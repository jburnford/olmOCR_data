Findlay, Prince Rupert, B.C., who is apparently acting for Indian Agent Gillett. In this letter he states that Miss Emma Schmidt, former teacher of the Sunnyside Indian Day School, is anxious to know how much she will be allowed for sick leave.\n\nMiss Schmidt taught at the Sunnyside Day School from November 26, 1945, to January 18, 1946. In your letter of January 31 you stated that she gave up duties at Sunnyside owing to illness on January 18. We allowed her salary for the month of January. In other words, she was paid for 13 days' sick leave. In view of the fact that she was employed as a teacher for less than two months, I cannot see how we can allow her any additional sick leave. I would appreciate it if you would write to Indian Agent Gillett.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. Gillett, before he went on holidays, sent reports to the Commissioner's office with reference to Miss Emma Schmidt having to leave her school teaching duties on account of illness. She has since sent us a letter stating that a doctor in Vancouver has ordered her to bed for six months suffering from a severe attack of pleurisy. She is anxious to know just how much she will be allowed for sick leave. She taught at Sunnyside Day School from November 28th, 1945 to January 18th, 1946. We might mention that she was Field Matron at Greenville last year from January to June.\n\nJAF/pb\n\nfor J.

This school was closed during the period January 18th to April 12th and aside from the fact that the operation of the school during the summer months will give the children an opportunity to complete their school work for the year, it would be of considerable advantage to the Indian parents working at the Cannery if the children were occupied. I concur with the Agent's views and would recommend that the school remain open and that Miss Atkinson be employed during the months July to September inclusive.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nJune 4th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver.\n\nMiss Ruth Atkinson has made application to this office for permission to continue as teacher at Sunnyside Cannery during the months of July, August and September during which period she would like to conduct a summer school for the Indian children congregated at that centre.\n\nWhilst Miss Atkinson is not a certificated teacher she is an enthusiastic person and I believe that she would do an excellent piece of educational and social service work at Sunnyside and adjacent canneries during the summer. She is prepared to have a morning and afternoon session with different groups and in view of the fact that well over 100 children will be located at this cannery alone anything that can be done to continue their education would be well worthwhile.\n\nIn connection with this application it should be stated that Dr. Galbraith hoped to employ both Miss Meier and Miss Fraser as itinerate first aid workers on the Skeena River this summer with headquarters at the North Pacific Hospital. Miss Meier's health is such that she may not be able to accept this post and if Miss Atkinson's continuance as teacher is approved she and Miss Fraser could stay together at Sunnyside.\n\nThis matter has been carefully discussed with Miss Atkinson and it is recommended that her application for continued service for the months of July to September be approved. Your early advice will be appreciated so that Miss Atkinson may make the necessary arrangements to continue in residence at Sunnyside.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\n\ncc.

The teacher at this school cannot be left in charge of the pupils there any longer. If she has not already had a mental breakdown she is on the verge of doing so. She made very wild statements about the fear she had of the Indians and referred to the tragedy that occurred at Port Essington several years ago and stated that she expected the same to happen to her. Apparently she will associate with neither the Indians or the white people at this point because, to quote her, \"they are all against me\". At several points during the conversation she broke down and cried. She asked how soon she could leave and when I told her that the Department usually expected at least a month's notice she wept.\n\nIn the latter part of January I received a letter from Mrs. Kennedy that indicated that she was not happy at Sunnyside. In the light of what I have found at this school it shows signs of the beginning of this teacher's breakdown. This letter is in my files in the Vancouver office under her name.\n\nAll of this indicated that Mrs. Kennedy should be moved without delay and I have made arrangements with her and Mr. Anfield to have the Naskeena pick her up at Sunnyside on Monday, February 9th, and bring her to Prince Rupert. I had some difficulty in persuading Mrs. Kennedy that it would be safe for her to travel in this way as she said she was afraid she might be \"kidnapped\".\n\nI recommend that Mrs. Kennedy's resignation be accepted as from the end of this month. She has promised to forward it to Mr. Indian Agent Anfield.\n\nI hope that the Department will approve of my action in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools\nOttawa, February 15th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe Bunnyside Day School, No. 374\n\nThe Department has accepted the resignation of the teacher at the above mentioned school, Mrs. Ethel Kennedy, effective March 1st, 1947.\n\nHer salary cheque for the month of February should be issued in her favour and forwarded to Major D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 15th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.

Her February salary cheque will be forwarded to your office so that you can readdress it to her.\n\nI presume that you will endeavour to secure another teacher for this school.\n\nBernard F.

Davey's Report dated February 7th, 1947, re Sunnyside B.C. Indian School.\n\nThe reading of the pupils of grades four and five consists of word calling and conveys no meaning to them. They are not able to answer simple questions on the content. Grades one and two repeat from memory the passages already learned and are unable to attempt new material of equal difficulty.\n\nThe grade four and five pupils scored so low on the Test in the Fundamentals of Arithmetic that it was impossible to determine their grade scores. All that can be said is that they are below grade three level. Grade two has some knowledge of the addition and subtraction facts up to ten.\n\nThere is no activity programme.\n\nThe language work of the pupils is poor.\n\nSome instruction is given in singing.\n\nThe classroom is neat and the pupils are clean.\n\nThere seems to be no basis for grading the pupils and grades four and above are trying to do work too difficult for them.\nOttawa, April 21, 1947.\n\nREGISTERED\n\nD.M.

The standard of achievement in number work and arithmetic is satisfactory. Somewhat more attention should be given to the development of number concepts with the Grade I group. Miss Thomas informs me that she is making arrangements to enter Normal School this year. I am sure that she will be successful in this course and that she will become a very efficient teacher.

This sum was incurred when it was found necessary to employ a carpenter to complete the seasonal school at Sunnyside Cannery this summer. As this building belongs to the United Church, it is proposed to withhold rental of $10.00 payable for this building for a space of three months to liquidate the cost of lining the building to make it suitable for school purposes.\n\nThis action will be taken on receipt of word from you authorizing same. Wall-board for this building had been piled up for over a year and it was impossible to get the work done without guaranteeing the payment of wages. The building is not ours; the work done is for the improvement of the structure and the cost should be a charge on the owner and deductible from rental.\n\nfor F.

M. HALLIDAY,\nINDIAN AGENT, ALERT BAY, B. C., dated Jan. 29, 1930.\n\nHas any decision been arrived at yet regarding the old Girls' Home? There has been a good deal of discussion regarding this building, and personally I am of the opinion that if the Department intend establishing a tubercular sanitarium for the Indians, that this would make a good central station for it, being used as an administrative building, while the patients themselves could be put in small huts outside. As you are aware, there have been many recommendations made on this matter, and some of the most eminent specialists on tuberculosis have made extensive researches regarding this disease. If this place was set aside for incipient cases, more particularly for children, and a competent staff appointed to look after it, the children could be educated, as there are classrooms in this building itself, and I think there would be very little danger on account of its close proximity to the new building.\n\nSuggestion:\n1. Store house etc./for/other\n2. Office to another for certain specific purpose to be determined.\nOttawa, February 7, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, copy of my letter of today's date to Mr. Indian Agent Halliday. If you have any comments to make on the future uses of the old Girls' School building at Alert Bay, the Department would be grateful for a recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

C.\nOttawa, February 7, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your 270/23 of the 29th ultimo, I have to inform you that the Department cannot favourably consider using the old Girls' Home at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School as a sanitarium. Will you please discuss the future use of this building with the Principal of the School, with a view to determining whether it could be used as an adjunct to the institution, and let me have a further report. It has been suggested that the second floor of the building could be used as a store room and the ground floor for supplementary work shops or cadet room. A further suggestion has been that the whole building be used as a gymnasium. Is it so constructed that the outer walls alone could support the roof? Is any portion of the basement suitable for cold storage or other purposes? The proximity to the wharf suggests that at least some of the building could be used to advantage by the school authorities for storage purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.

The Department is pleased to have your recommendations concerning the uses to which this building could be put, and, when the need for additional classroom space is urgent, an effort will be made to secure an appropriation for the proposed alterations. In the meantime, you might take the first opportunity of discussing this with Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn and suggest that he write the Department, with his comments concerning your proposal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nP. O. BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., February 18, 1930.\n\nYour file 156-0-Special.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in which you enclose for my information a copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Indian Agent Halliday, with regard to the use to which the old Girls' School at Alert Bay might be put to and asking for my recommendation if I have any comments to make thereon.\n\nIn reply I beg to say for the time being it would be advisable to withhold any determination as to what use the old Girls' Home should be put to, but I certainly agree with you that it should not be used as a sanitarium. The management of the school has hardly before properly established in the new buildings to know just what they really want. However, when Dr. Scott and myself were at Alert Bay in the summer of 1928, the future use of this school was discussed to a very slight extent with Principal Anfield and it was thought that a part of the same might be utilized for the advanced pupils in technical work. In the meantime there is no reason why the building cannot be used for storing considerable of the materials and commodities used at the school, but I am inclined to the opinion that it is too removed from the kitchen to be used as a cold storage plant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.H./IC.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 1C, Volume 6426, file 875-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nWith further reference to past correspondence, more particularly to your letter of February 7, I would advise you that I have gone thoroughly into the matter of the old Girls' Home at Alert Bay with the Principal of the Residential School.\n\nIn the building of this new institution it would seem that there is not sufficient classroom space if the building is filled to capacity. It has been the custom in most of the Residential Schools only to have the children in school for half time; in other words, half of them go in the morning and the other half in the afternoon. Personally, I have always felt that this is more or less an injustice to the Indians, as white children are at school for from five to six hours a day, and they seem to stand it alright and to get along alright, whereas in most of the Residential Schools from two to three hours is the maximum. In the classrooms provided in the new building, they can put one hundred pupils at a time, whereas the capacity of the school is from two hundred to two hundred and forty. It has always been the endeavor of the officials of the Residential School here to keep up the academic end and in order to do this to full capacity, more classrooms will have to be provided.\n\nIn looking over the plans of the old building, it would seem that it would not be a matter of very great expense to provide four good classrooms, or if it was felt that some of the other rooms should be kept intact, three good classrooms and four bedrooms on the top floor. If you will look at the plan which was drawn by Mr. Ogilvie, on Page 3 you will see on the ground floor that there is a hallway going through the building from the front door to the back stairs, and also another corridor going through from end to end of the building. Partitions on each side of this latter corridor carry the upper floor, and I would suggest that \"I\" beams of sufficient strength be used and\nthese partitions removed. This would convert into one classroom what is now marked the dining room, part of the corridor, the staff sitting-room, and the Principal's office, and would make a classroom with inside dimensions of 23' x 46'. The other classroom downstairs could be made by tearing out the staircase in the corridor, and would make a classroom 46' x 24'6\", giving two splendid classrooms downstairs. The verandah on the north-west end should be torn away entirely in order to give plenty of light.\n\nIn the upstairs, the room which is marked \"dormitory\" could be utilized without any changes other than taking away the sleeping verandah in order to give it more light. The other rooms upstairs might be left as they are, or might be used as a fourth classroom by including the private bathroom, infirmary, two chambers and the assistant matron's chamber. The lavatory which is at present would have to be renovated, and new toilet basins put in, as the others have not worked satisfactorily for a number of years, and a new lavatory could be provided in what is now the kitchen so that the plumbing would all be in line; one of these lavatories to be used by the boys, the other for the girls. The floors on the downstairs part of the building would all have to be renewed, as they are badly worn, and possibly new radiators might need to be provided for the heating plant, as for the last two years it was very unsatisfactory, but possibly by overhauling them and making a few changes they could be made to serve. The basement, which has concrete walls all round, and which, since the new drainage system was put in, remains dry, could be used for storing and as a root-house. The potatoes belonging to the institution have been stored there this year, and came through the exceptionally severe winter without any loss.\n\nIf, by any chance, you have not a copy of the plan referred to, I would be glad to let you have the one in my possession. The whole expense should not be very great, and it would make a good use of the building which is now lying idle. I would recommend, however, that if the work is done, that a good competent foreman be obtained and the work done by day labor; I think the expense would be much less than by letting a contract; all of which is respectfully submitted for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

(RC 10, Volume 6426, file 875-1, part 2)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward for your consideration a scheme for the benefit of the Indians under my charge in this Agency.\n\nAs I have before mentioned the area of good land in the Reserves is much too small to permit them to engage in agricultural pursuits, with the exception of the We-wai-ai Kai tribe at Cape Mudge. Consequently during the summer months they go south to earn money in whatever way they can, to the great detriment of both men and women, especially the latter so much so, that in a few years, if things go on as at present, there will be few women left among them.\n\nNow these Indians show a good capacity for mechanical work and any scheme that would induce them to remain at home would be a step in the right direction. I would suggest first, that the Department reserve all the land at Alert Bay which lies between the Church Missionary Society's claims and the\n\nJ. W. Powell Esq.,\nInd. Sup't.\npoint already reserved by the Provincial Government. This piece of land is admirably adapted for the purpose, large enough for the settlement of all Indians likely to come there. Here they would be willing to leave their present mode of life, could live secure from molestations from the others would gradually get accustomed to a civilized way of living, and would be more under control.\n\nAs soon as the land is secured as an Indian Reserve I would propose that a large building be erected, in which the different trades of Carpenter, Blacksmith, Boatbuilder and Shoemaker should be taught. The two trades of Carpenter and Blacksmith would not need resident instructors, as they could be obtained in the place and could be paid only when their services were required. The Shoemaker and boatbuilder would have to be frequently settled here for a time. The building would require to be about 60 ft x 40 ft, 26 ft high, an estimate of the cost of which I provide with tools I enclose. Next I would suggest the proposal of the Department acquiring the Saw Mill now erected and adjoining the land I propose to be Reserved. This would in the end save the Department expense, as the mill properly managed would soon pay for itself and be a source of employment to those settling...\nthe new village. The Department already an interest in the mill, and have obtained from the Church Missionary Society's representative that in the event of the Department being reimbursed for the actual outlay, the amount of which I also state in my estimate of the sum needed for the purpose. Next I would suggest the advisability of rendering some assistance to those wishing to build decent houses; these would form a nucleus around which others from all the tribes would quickly gather there, and not till then can anything in the shape of instruction be successful amongst them. Their mode of life at present is too nomadic to hope to do anything.\n\nA home for girls is also another thing that would be eventually required and which would answer a twofold purpose both for instruction in household duties and also general instruction.\n\nA small hospital and resident man are greatly needed. The distance from Victoria, nearly 240 miles, with no very regular communication, precludes the obtaining any medical assistance. There have been two urgent cases only during the last ten days and great numbers are in need of medical treatment.\nP. O' Reilly,\nH. R. Co.,\nVictoria,\nB.C.\n\n5 Oct. 89\n\nSir,\n\nEnclose herein copy of a letter of the 8th inst last from Mr. McTaggert, Pidcock, of Alert Bay, submitting a scheme for the industrial training of the Indians of the Kwawkweuth Tribe by the establishment of an institution at the above point; and, in connection therewith, I am willing to believe that Mr. Pidcock states that it would be necessary to secure certain land, which he described somewhat vaguely in his letter, and I, S.G., will be glad if you will ascertain whether...\nP.

That Mr. Ross made the necessary enquiries & exploration of Cormorant Island last spring & reported that the whole of it, excepting certain parts which were previously disposed of was included in a lease by the Prov.

However, considering the character of the Indians with whom the project is to be attempted, the Government does not propose at this juncture to expend much money in the promotion of its scheme. It is thought that with a sum not to exceed \u00a31500, or at most \u00a33000, a start in the direction desired might be made.\n\nThe above sum, including cost of building, the employment of such mechanics as may be necessary, &c., the provision...\nof the required plant; I have to request that you will concert such measures with the Right Reverend as will keep the expenditure within the above limit.\n\nThe question of the purchase of the land will be for future consideration, as well as the proposed establishment of an hospital & residence for permanent native boys in industries.\n\nIt is presumed that in the Right Reverend's estimate of cost, which accompanied his letter from a name quoted, he places the cost of the building at $1400, but the\nIt is probably much more than will be necessary for a building that as she was created in connection with (a prospect of this kind) will, may or may not prove successful, and it is likely therefore be selected at a much less cost that will answer all present purposes.\n\n[Signature]\nAbbotsford\nBritish Columbia\nJanuary 23rd 1890\n\nTo the\nDept.

But the parents found my action was legally marry their daughters and because their gain he could no longer make them to send their daughters to come.\nBut here are orphan girls whom I venture to suggest should become wards of the Department and placed in the girl boarding school, and doubtless others would follow. Nothing that the Department could do would confer so great a blessing on these people as the successful working of such an institution. It would do more than anything else to break up the system of pot-latching, and this must be destroyed before any real progress can be made amongst this people.\n\nProbably you are aware of the fact that it is impossible for a young man to legally marry. The pair live together according to Indian law, after the man has given a \"pot-latch\" to the girl's parents or relatives claiming to recall their daughter whenever he chooses until the husband gives them another \"pot-latch.\" Not unfrequently this \"pot-latch\" is forthcoming from another man, or sent to him to enable her people to gain more.\nReferring to your valued letter of August... although the Department sanctioned and encouraged its Agent in Pidcock in probably preventing some Indian women leaving our boat alone for Victoria, yet so severe a reprimand has been given to our constable by his superior officer that he refuses to act again.

Their long absences from school convey a tendency towards them forget what they had previously been taught.\n\nIndustrial, or Boarding schools, so far, seem to work very well, as the children are collected and the parents know that they are well cared for and not at all uneasy about their welfare abroad upon their fishing or trading expeditions.\n\nIn the matter of trades it is necessary, I think, to pay good results, that the pupils should be regular in their attendance and that they should step by step, so to speak, arrive at that knowledge which would qualify them for the carrying on successfully of such trades as they might be fitted for.\nfor\u2014\n\nIn looking over the matter with the Rev. Mr. Hall, missionary of the English Church, residing at Alert Bay, he seemed to concur with me as to the views above already stated; and the undersigned, Mr. Rideout, after mature consideration and a closer observation, has come to the same conclusion.\n\nI enclose a copy of Mr. Rideout's report on the subject which meets with my approval.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

July together with a copy of letter from the Deputy Supt. General in regard to the erection of Workshops &c at Alert Bay Cormorant Island, and requesting me to report on the same.\n\nI believe no plan of the proposed building has yet been accepted by the Department and therefore before this is definitely settled no idea can be given of the price of construction. I believe the best way, in a place so far from Victoria as Alert Bay is, is to erect the buildings by day work, appointing one of carpenters, if a competent man, as foreman.\n\nIn my letter of Dec. 4th. 1890, I gave my reasons for suggesting an alteration in the scheme and also in the character of the buildings, and went fully into the reason why a change in the scheme would be of so much more advantage to the Indians of this locality. I will again\n\nA. W. Vowell Esq.,\nVisiting Indian Superintendent.\nagain briefly state why the plan as originally proposed would not be of much benefit.\n\nIn the first place before any trade can be successfully learnt, a certain amount of knowledge must first be obtained by the pupil, especially in carpentry and blacksmith work, and until such knowledge has been imparted, very little progress will be made, and it is not to be supposed that trade instructors will teach anything except in their own particular line of business.\n\n2nd. As the young men who would be likely to attend would be of an age when it is difficult to control them, their attendance would be very irregular, and at times, as during this last winter when all were away for four months at one time, there would be absolutely no occupation for the instructors.\n\n3rd. The school as proposed would only be used by the one tribe, the Nimkeesh, as no one who knows the character of these Indians would suppose that any of the parents would leave their own village to reside at Alert Bay for the benefit of their children.\n\nAs the Deputy Supt. General says in his letter of 7 Dec'r 1889 \"as the scheme is purely a tentative one, and may not at all unlikely prove a failure\" it seems to me, that after mature\nmature consideration, the present scheme is not likely to be attended with success, it would be much better to defer the building of Workshops and dwelling houses for Instructors, until such time as some scheme that would be of real benefit to these Indians could be settled upon.\n\nI know of nothing more likely to be of real benefit to the Indians of this Agency than an Industrial School after the plan of other Industrial Schools erected in the Province, where the youth of both sexes might be taken permanently away from the influence of their present mode of life, and I feel sure that as many pupils could be obtained as the School could accommodate.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n(Signed) R.

Alfred J. Hall's application that a Boarding School for Indian girls be established at Alert Bay, that it appears to you that it would be of no use to vote a sum for pupils until we had an institution, and you inquire whether there is provision for this in the estimates, I beg to\nto inform you that no provision for the erection of a building for an Industrial Institution for girls at Alert Bay has been made in the estimates; but it occurred to me that we might offer Mr. Hall a per capita allowance of $70.00 for a certain number of pupils, he to provide lodging, board, clothing and tuition. This would be similar to the arrangement made with the Presbyterian authorities at Crowstaud, Round Lake and, formerly, Muscowpetung Boarding Schools. Mr. Hall is the\nthe representative of the Church of England at Alert Bay, and I know he has for a number of years been conducting the training of Indian girls at that place without any assistance from the Department. It might be better perhaps to erect a building for an institution thereat, but the expense would of course be much greater than were Mr. Hall to undertake, for the per capita allowance stated, to do the work.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nHon. E. Dewdney\nDept. General of Indian Affairs.\nMemorandum\u2014\n\nThe undersigned beg to report that in the early part of last year the Rev. Alfred J. Halle wrote to the Dept suggesting that a boarding school for Indian girls be established at Alert Bay in the Kwawkweil Agency. He states that great success had attended his efforts in the education of Indian girls which he had been able to accomplish to a limited extent by taking a few of them to live at his residence, and that the efforts put forth by him and his estimable wife in this direction had resulted in some of these girls.\n\nTo the\n\nE. Dewdney\nSup't Genl. of Ind. Affairs\nforming matrimonial alliances in a legal manner, instead of following the old custom prevalent among their tribe, of living with Indians who purchase them from their parents.\n\nThe undersigned begs to report that there are twelve Indian villages in the vicinity of Alert Bay, from which children of school age could probably be obtained, were an industrial school established at Alert Bay. The number of children of school age in these villages amounts to 176; and the only schools in operation in the locality are a day school at Alert Bay, whereat there is an attendance of 13 pupils, and a similar institution conducted for the benefit of the children of the villages of Kwaawkewlth and Kwe-ah-kah. The latter has an attendance of 9 pupils. It is of course impossible for the children of the more distant\nvillages to attend either of these schools; but, were a boarding school established, no doubt the difficulty of distance from the institution would be overcome by the fact that the children could be lodged as well as educated thereat.\n\nThe Sup't General will remember that the Deptt is already taking measures toward the formation of an industrial establishment in the vicinity of Alert Bay, in which instruction in trades will be given to the young men of the vicinity, and the undersigned has recently been informed by the Indian Reserve Commissioner that the Hon. the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for British Columbia has approved of the land reserved for the above purpose on Cormorant Island, and the undersigned has instructed the visiting Indian Deptt at Victoria to carry out the previous instructions that him in regard to the\npreparation and transmission to\nthe Dept of Plans & specifications\nfor the building to be erected\nthereat. This institution, as\nstated above, will be wholly\nfor the benefit of male members\nof the Board, and it will not\nof course be of any service to the\nfemale. In view, the methods\nwhich we shall recommend\nwould be established solely in the\ninterest of the latter class.\n\nThe undersigned is of opinion\nthat an allowance of $70 per\ncapita ought be offered to the\nstaff for the board, education\nand industrial training\u2014say of 30\nfemale pupils; and, if this\nrecommendation is approved of,\nthe undersigned would suggest\nthat an amount to cover the\ncost, viz., $2100, be included in\nthe supplementary estimates for\nthe year 1891-92 to be submitted\nto Parliament at its next session.\n\nBy Capt.

This is an additional reason for this heathen festival being put a stop to; I am happy to be able to inform you that more effective legislation is about to be brought into consideration by Parliament, which it is hoped will prevent any defeat of the law in accomplishing its object from again taking place.\n\nIn regard to the conclusion portion of yr. letter respect Mr. A.J. Riddell's action, who has read the approval of the Dept. in preventing Indian women from leaving the wharf at Victoria.\nAlert Bay for Victoria for immoral purposes, in connection with which you state that, so far as a remittance was given to the Constable for a trip in this manner by his Superior Officer that he refuses to act again, you nothing has been gained, & you ask whether no arrangement can be made with the Prov. Gov't or with the Steamship Co. by whom the traffic can be checked, I beg to inform you that I have since the receipt of Mr. Letter brought this important matter under the\nConsideration of the S.S. Act.\n\nI shall not, so far as in me lies, cease to make every effort to have measures adopted effective to prevent the exodus of Indian women from the district to Victoria & other cities for the infamous practices to which they are addicted while at those points.\n\nI am glad to learn from your letter that the Hon.

I could not then accept this offer, preparing at the time to take my furlough to England.\n\nI arrived here from England last July accompanied by a lady who had volunteered to act as matron to this proposed home. It was opened July 6 and today there are ten Indian girls looking for support. This home will only accommodate ten pupils, but it is purposed to enlarge so that thirty may be housed if funds are forthcoming.\nThe facts I would now emphasize are these:\n\n1. The fact necessitating such a home\u2014if you save the girl you save the boys; but the opposite is not true.\n\n2. The promise given by your department in 1891 to help, and in full expectation of which I brought out this mission and opened the home.\n\n3. I have applied to the Church Missions Society for a grant of \u00a3150 per annum\u2014this is not yet granted, and if it is will not commence till January 1895. I have positively nothing in hand or even promised for the support of these children.\nUnder these circumstances, bearing in mind that these girls are already in the home, I beg you to make a tentative grant of two hundred fifty dollars ($250) for this winter's emergency and pray that next year you may be able to do so as well as to do generously do for similar schools in the Dominion.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlfred E. Hall\nOttawa, 17th Oct., 1894\n\nDear Mr. Daly,\n\nI send herewith file 65,201 with a letter from the Rev. Alfred J. Hall, Alert Bay. Mr. Hall is known to us as a very deserving Missionary; he has done excellent work at Alert Bay. He called here in June on his way from England and saw me personally when Mr. Reed was away from the city. I talked the matter over with Mr. Reed, and he concluded not to present the question of making the school a grant to you, as everything had been so cut down in the British Columbia estimates. He certainly makes a very moderate request in his letter, which I am sure we could comply with, as we have several day schools provided in the estimates which are not in operation, so that, so far as this grant goes we could easily\nmeet his wishes. But the great question comes in of future assistance, and this I would submit for your consideration. Mr. Hall's letter of the 18th June will show the position he takes. I would feel inclined to give him the present assistance that he wants, with the distinct understanding that the Department does not subject itself to increase the grant. At the same time, I would like to put an item in the Estimates for, say, 10 pupils at $60.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHon. T. Mayne Daly,\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nOttawa 22nd March 1895\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the letter addressed to you by the Revd Alfred J.

The school did not bear the clean and well kept appearance that should prevail in an institution of this class.\n\nThe Department regrets the necessity for referring to this report, but, in view of the fact that tenders have been called for the erection of an expensive building for the Girls' Home at Alert Bay, the Department wishes to have Your Lordship's assurance that Mr. Cooker while Principal of this school will not absent himself without leave, as was done in this case, and that should leave be granted him at any time he will make adequate provision for the proper carrying on of the school during his absence. Without such assurance the Department will not feel justified in proceeding with the erection of the new building or continuing the grant.\n\nRight Rev. W. W.

McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose my report on the Alert Bay Industrial School for the month of October, which it will be noticed is not altogether a favorable one.\n\nI have always regarded this and similar institutions as the only means of lifting the Indians of this Agency to the higher level which should prevail. As a consequence I have spared no effort at any and all times to do everything in my power to make it a success. Mr. Ditchburn, Inspector of Indian Agencies, has been inspecting this office and affairs pertaining to this agency and accompanied me to the Industrial School, and I regret to state there was nothing to justify the praise which I had bestowed on the institution.\n\nOne very regrettable fact was the absence of both the Principal and assistant teachers of the institution, who were away entirely without consent from the Department.\n\nThe Principal casually in conversation on the evening of 15th instant mentioned that he was going to Victoria to attend the meeting of the clerical synod, and that George Luther his assistant had already gone. He was asked if the school was to be allowed to run itself but replied that Mrs. Gerker would be in charge. I informed him that I could not consider that this arrangement would be at all satisfactory to the Department, and advised that either he or his assistant should remain at home, and that as the Department built...\nand equipped the school, and provided the necessary funds for its maintenance, that, to put the matter very mildly, it was only a matter of courtesy that before vacating his post for a week he should first obtain permission from the Department, and even then should provide a proper substitute.\n\nIt may be remembered that in June 1936 the Principal of this institution went to England on furlough for over a year. On that occasion though he had been making preparations for months with regard to his departure the Department was not consulted on the matter. This occasioned considerable correspondence with the Department and this method of procedure was condemned by the Department, and on his return to duty this office notified the Principal that his conduct had merited the disapproval of the Department.\n\nI do not wish to dictate to the Department what course should or should not be pursued but I would respectfully recommend that a reprimand should be sent to the Principal from your office, a copy of which should be sent to this office, so that in future these unpleasantnesses may be avoided.\n\nI wish to state that there is absolutely no personal animus in the case, but feel that it is my duty to call your attention to the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 13, 1907.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th inst., in reference to the fire-fighting appliances at the Alert Bay Industrial School, and in reply I beg to say that you are hereby authorized to supply this institution with twelve Haverhill Eclipse Dry Dust Fire Extinguishers.\n\nThe Department prefers this as the chemical extinguisher, as it is simple in construction and efficient.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

In this instance connection I would further refer you to Departmental letter of 19th September 1895, No. 55,201, wherein it is stated in answer to Reverend Mr. Hall's application for $600.00 per annum in aid of the Indian Girls Home at Alert Bay that should the whole of the appropriation ($4,550.00) for the Industrial School established there not be required on account of the small number of pupils procurable for that Institution the Department would be willing to allow the $600.00 for Girls School to be taken from any balance that might exist, etc. from said appropriation.\n\nI am sorry to trouble the Department on this subject; and hope that I have stated clearly what I would wish to have explained.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\nYour Ob'dt.

C.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs.\nDecember 15 1910.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of November 25. Mr. Corker and his Assistant attended the meeting of the Synod, and the School at Alert Bay was left under the charge of Mrs. Corker assisted by her son, who has lately returned from a good public school in England. Mrs. Corker holds the highest certificates for teaching, and has had large experience, and is an excellent disciplinarian.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Corker himself I can assure you that no better Master could be found. He is a man of very strong character, and resents any interference except from those who have authority. We all deplore the resignation of Mr. Vowell as Superintendent. His wise and firm rule was thoroughly appreciated. No greater mistake could be made than to make a man like Mr. Corker feel that he was to be subordinate to, and take his orders from, an Indian Agent. In this case if Mr. Halliday, knowing that Mr. Corker was away, had offered to assist Mrs. Corker in any way in his power, he would have, in my opinion, been doing his duty; but at such a time to \"inspect\" and label the School, would I am sure have drawn from Mr. Vowell or any other official Head of a Department a rebuke.\n\nSeveral parts of the School require money to be spent upon it, but apart from this, you may be assured that the discipline and the influence for good of Mr. Corker are all that could be desired.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. W. Columbia\nOttawa, December 6, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to inform you that late reports received on the Alert Bay Industrial School are very disappointing. They show an unsatisfactory condition of affairs existing when the inspections were made. In October, last, both you and your assistant were absent attending the Synod and the school was in charge of your wife, who was apparently unable to preserve proper discipline. The senior pupils were untidy and lounging about the room and an apparent want of care was visible all over the school. The school was again visited last month and not much improvement was noted. The boys were playing at work, some pupilsumping water, some doing work around the building, cleaning lamps, etc., while the rest were playing at clearing the land. The tools were said to be too dull to be of any use. This state of affairs is probably due to the staff being too small for the school and to your absenting yourself without leave and making proper provision for carrying on the school efficiently during your absence. It is stated that the accommodation is limited on account of much of the building being occupied by yourself and family.\n\nThe Department is not satisfied with the way the school is conducted, as indicated by the reports above.\n\nRev. A. W. Corker,\nPrincipal,\nAlert Bay Industrial School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nreferred to, and a decided improvement will have to take place or else it will be under the painful necessity of asking for a change in the management.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, November 25, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the Alert Bay Industrial School for the month of October, and in reply I beg to say that the Bishop of the Diocese is being written to in regard to the unsatisfactory conditions at this school at the time of your visit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nAs medical officer of the Alert Bay Industrial School for Indian Boys I have been asked two letters from your Department actually criticizing the management of the above mentioned school.\n\nDuring the last twenty-three months I have visited the school dozens of times and can testify on the oath that I have never yet found the school in any thing but a creditable condition of cleanliness and tidiness. I consider the school in keps in for condition even for the same number of white boys and very suitable indeed when we consider the orderliness and cleanliness are quite foreign to the boys.\n\nI consider the school the most efficiently managed place of Indian work and of the most creditable Department of Indian Affairs. If anything that I ever wrote on the subject.\n\nIt is a great pity that your Department has placed so much dependence in an agent who could have been prevented from making such a mistake.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. McLean\nDept. Superint. & Secty. Indian Affairs\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nMy teacher George Luther (an old pupil) is a young man very suitable for ordination, and the Synod naturally wished him to be present.\n\nI consider I made adequate provision for the proper carrying on of the school during my absence.\n\nMrs. Coker, who is matron of the school, is a capable school mistress and a good disciplinarian. I did not leave until nearly midnight on Sunday Oct. 16th. The next day the officials called. In this short interval the school could not possibly have got dirty. Miss Warren, assistant matron, assured me the boys were in perfect order during the week, I was away. Mr. Eli Hunt, the trades instructor, states that the boys went to him in an orderly manner from the class room each day, and worked as usual.\n\nPermit me to draw the Department's attention to the following reports:\n\nBlue Book page 246, (1909). \"The school is well situated and ably managed.\"\n\nBlue Book 1910. 336. \"The (Mrs. Coker) has a well equipped staff,\" etc. I beg to state here there has been no change in my staff since this was written.\n\nAt a Church meeting Mr. Indian Agent Macleod, who was present said: \"Whenever I visit the Industrial School I always find the boys quiet and well behaved, and attentive to their lessons.\" The last visit he paid, in November, he spoke highly of the school and its progress the pupils were making. Why?\nremarks should be made here, and such totally different reports sent to the Department is more than I can understand.\n\nIn November Mr. Thomas Leith, Provincial public school inspector, visited the school & after spending the whole afternoon in the class room, wrote in the visitors book as follows:\n\n\"Greatly pleased with my visit to this institution. The school is being conducted with great credit to the Principal and his assistants.\"\n\nDr. Baker, the medical officer of this school, paid a visit to this school today. I showed him your letters.\n\nHe is writing you by this mail.\n\nRe- \"the tools being too dull to be of any use\" I may safely say during my 21 years in this country I have not seen a man to equal our trades instructor in filing and setting saws, and sharpening tools generally.\n\nIt is entirely false to say \"I am using school accommodation for myself and family,\" it is altogether the other way round, for we gave up one bed room to be used as a store, and sewing room.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.G. Cottet,\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Columbia wrote to Mr. Corken on Dec 5th complaining of the \"lack of discipline\" and \"the unclean appearance of this school\" on the occasion of the visit of two officers of the Department. As Mr. Corken was absent on that date these two remarks reflect upon me, hence my reason for writing to you.\n\nSince the year 1893 when Mr. Corken was appointed to take charge of this school I have been Matron and have in all these years aimed at perfect cleanliness in every department; this is the first time that anyone has ever said such a thing. It is so false that it seems ridiculous to write refuting it, it is especially so as I remarked to Miss Warner (Assistant Matron) on the morning of the aforementioned visit, we will have extra scrubbing done today, and literally the school was a great deal cleaner than usual. It is an extremely difficult subject to eulogize oneself but I am only writing thus for the Department's enlightenment. I taught for 8 years in a London School where the highest merit grant was always obtained. I am a Certificated Teacher and frequently help Mr. Corken in the classroom. The school was in perfect order when Mr. Hitchbourne and Mr. Halliday arrived, the boys rose and saluted them. Mr. Halliday introduced Mr. Hitchbourne whom I had never seen nor even heard of. He asked for Mr. Corken. I told him simply Mr. Corken was away but would be very sorry to miss him. They were both rather rude, they said I was only Mr. Corken which of course I admitted. I asked them if they would like to hear the boys read or see the work they discovered, etc. As it was just cleaning up...\nCame and took charge of the boys, setting them to work. I proceeded to show the Gentleman round the school accompanied by Miss Warren. The Dormitories, Dining Room, Kitchen, Bath rooms, Store rooms & Laundry were in perfect order. I was pleased to show them. I took them to the vegetable garden, workshop, well house etc.\n\nI should like to add that some things in the School are very shabby, we have been in the building 17 years this month & things have a way of wearing out. We would like to ask the Department for many things & we feel if my Ottawa could visit us they would supply every one realizing they were all very legitimate wants.\n\nApologizing for taking up so much time & with the power of proving absolutely true every word I have written.\n\nI am\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nThe Matron,\nEmma Corke.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of Dec. 6th, 116947, and in reply beg to state that these reports are false. In reading your letter carefully over I consider the summing up very strong, in consideration of the charges.\n\n\"Apparently unable to preserve discipline\"\n\"an apparent want of care\"\n\"the boys were playing at work\"\n\"some boys pumping water\"\n\"others cleaning camps\"\n\"the rest playing at clearing land.\"\n\nThe latter remark is really ludicrous; clearing land is no child's play, and I beg leave to inform the Department, that a plot 62 ft x 90 ft has been stumped & levelled during the past two months.\n\nCleaning camps and pumping water is part of the routine work.\n\nRe - the boys playing at work, what boys do not play at work? I encourage them to be happy, get fun out of their work as well as their play.\n\nI regret very much being absent from my school when the officials came.\n\nI attended the Synod in the interests of the School. The Department are probably aware that the Church Missionary Society, under whose auspices the school is managed, are gradually withdrawing from all missionary work in Canada, and it is essential to interest the Synod of our Canadian Church.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6426, file 875-1, part 2)\nOttawa, January 18th., 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th. of December with reference to the management of the Alert Bay Industrial School, I have to inform you that the Department is deeply concerned in the welfare of this institution and of the Indians who are dependent upon it for the education of their children. As you are aware, the erection of a new building for girls is in contemplation; in fact tenders have already been awarded and it is hoped that by next autumn an excellent building will be ready for the education of Indian girls. In the past Mr. Agent Halliday has certainly supported the cause of Indian education in his Agency. It was owing very largely to an earnest appeal which he made to the Department on behalf of the Indian girls that the decision was taken to build a Girls' Home. It was, therefore, with some surprise that his animadversions on the management of the Alert Bay Industrial School were received; particularly as Mr. Halliday felt compelled to state that after this last inspection he regretted that there was nothing to justify the praise he had bestowed on the institution. The Department has always considered that the Industrial, Boarding and Day Schools throughout the Dominion were subject to inspection and report by the Indian Agents in whose districts they were situated, and while the Indian Agent would have no power unless he was carrying out direct orders from the Department to say what should be done in an Industrial School, yet the Department considers that he is the competent supervising officer; but while placing this confidence\n\nRight Rev. W. W. Perrin, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nVictoria, B.C.\nin its Agent; he would be charged with the duty of perfect disinterestedness and unexceptionable bearing toward the Principal and staff.\n\nMr. Halliday's duty will be presented to him in this light and he will be asked for further explanations.\n\nIn the meantime I beg to assure Your Lordship of the interest which is taken in the educational work at Alert Bay as evidenced by the generous support accorded it in the past and the future extensions which are already provided for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, January 9, 1912.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in further reference to the appointment of a staff to take charge of the Alert Bay Girls' School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted that you purpose visiting Alert Bay before the inauguration of the Bishop with a view to having definite information to lay before His Lordship and it is hoped that immediately after His Lordship's inauguration you will be in a position to nominate a competent staff without any further loss of time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon Austin Scriven,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your communication of 20th December (no. 65201/5) I beg to say that although an appointment has been made to the vacant Bishopric of Columbia, the new Bishop will not be consecrated until Feb 24th 1912, and that until that date we are prohibited by our Canons from undertaking any new business.\n\nThe question of the Girls' School at Alert Bay will be one of the first to be taken up on his assuming authority. I have already secured the names of two ladies for the Staff, to be submitted to him, if he should judge it wise to undertake the work; and I am going to pay a visit to Alert Bay before he comes to collect all information on the spot, to lay before him, that he may the more readily come to a conclusion in the matter.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrebendary of Vancouver\n\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, December 20, 1911.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of October 18th, last, in reference to the appointment of a Principal and staff for the Alert Bay Girls' Industrial School.\n\nFrom a recent newspaper despatch it is learned that an appointment has been made to the vacant Bishopric of Columbia. I may say that the furniture for the new building has been ordered and will be installed shortly. In the meantime the Department has been obliged to appoint a caretaker to keep fires in the building. It is hoped, therefore, that the church authorities will be in a position at a very early date to nominate a competent staff. I shall hope to hear from you by return mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon Austin Scriven,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, November 8, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo reporting that Mr. A. S.

Until then there is no authority in the Diocese except the Synod, which is by its own canons debarred from transacting any business during the vacancy of the See.\n\nI am afraid therefore that some delay is inevitable in the appointment of a Matron and Teacher as suggested.\n\nBelieve me\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchdeacon of Vancouver\nOttawa, October 6, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nIt would appear from communications that the Department has had from the authorities of the Church of England that there may be some delay in the appointment of the staff to take charge of the Alert Bay Girls' Industrial School when the building is completed. It will not do to let it stand without fires and a caretaker when the cold weather sets in.\n\nI would ask you to state what arrangements you think could be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

W. Price, a missionary in the Diocese of Caledonia, I have heard that very grave scandals occurred at Metlakatla from the fact that the Girls' School was built in close proximity to the boys. Have you any correspondence upon the matter, as Mr. Price hinted that it was partly in consequence of this that the School was closed. I find that the new girls' school at Alert Bay has been built in close proximity to the Boys, and I am very anxious in consequence.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.W. Columba.\nToronto, Ontario, Oct. 3rd, 1911.\n\nADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO THE GENERAL SECRETARY\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAet. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of the 29th of Sept., pointing out the desirability of an immediate Staff being appointed for the new Girls' Industrial School at Alert Bay. I have written to the Bishop of New Westminster (The Right Reverend A.U. dePencier, New Westminster, B.C.), and the Ven. Archdeacon Pentreath, urging their assisting the Diocese of Columbia in this matter.\n\nThis is the fullest extent to which we can go as the new Bishop of Columbia has the full power, and it is difficult for anything to be done when there is no one occupying the See. I sincerely trust though that something can be done immediately.\n\nyours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nAet. Sec'y.\nOttawa, September 29, 1911\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nAs you are no doubt aware the Department is erecting at Alert Bay a new Girls' Industrial School building which is now almost completed and ready for occupation. In August, last, His Lordship Bishop Perrin of Victoria was communicated with in reference to the appointment of a staff and he has replied stating that the appointments of the staff of this school will have to be delayed for sometime owing to resignation of himself and the Rev. A. J. Hall.\n\nIt was suggested to His Lordship that one Principal could supervise the work of both the Boys' and Girls' Schools provided a thoroughly efficient matron was placed in charge of the girls and a qualified teacher appointed for the class-room.\n\nAs it is desirable that the building should be occupied as soon as completed and before the cold weather sets in you will see the necessity for immediate action as to the appointment of this staff. I should be glad to hear from you at an early date and to know whether you could take immediate steps to have an efficient staff appointed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. Canon Gould,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nSecretary,\nMissionary Society of the Church of England,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI regret to say that the appointments to the staff of the Girls' School, which the Department has built at Alert Bay will have to be delayed for some time. Everything is in a state of change. The Rev. A. J. Hall has resigned, and I am resigning the Bishopric in a few weeks. I will at once communicate with the Church Missionary Society in England, and hope to receive an answer before I leave.\n\nI am, Yours faithfully,\n\nW. W. Columbia\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, August 24, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is advised that the new Alert Bay Girls' Industrial School building which is under construction will be completed in about a month's time. The Department has agreed to supply the necessary equipment in the way of furniture, etc., once for all for the use of the pupils, renewals to be furnished by the Church, which will also be expected to furnish the private quarters.\n\nYour Lordship will recognize that the selection of a staff to take charge of this school is of the greatest importance. The positions of Principal and Matron especially should be filled by thoroughly competent persons. It might be that one Principal could supervise the work of both the Boys' and the Girls' Schools provided a thoroughly efficient Matron is placed in charge of the girls. A qualified teacher should be placed in charge of the class-room. No doubt Your Lordship has given these matters consideration and you will kindly submit nominations for the various positions to the Department, stating in each case the name, qualifications, etc.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. W. W. Perrin, D.D., D.C.L.,\nBishop of Columbia,\nVictoria, B.C.\nIndian Office,\nAlert Bay B.C.\nApril 6th 1911.\n\nSir:\n\nRe File II6,847/I\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter as above of date 27th March regarding the sale of timber on the Industrial School reserve.\n\nIn reply I would state that yesterday the young men in question came into this office and reported that they had carefully cruised the portion referred to but the timber was so rotten and so much fallen hemlock half rotten amongst it that they would not take the timber for logging purposes as they would lose money if they attempted to log it off.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, reporting that about ten years ago a severe wind storm blew down a considerable quantity of timber on part of the Alert Bay Industrial School Reserve, estimated at 40 acres of Spruce and Hemlock, which six ex-pupils of the School have applied for permission to cut and sell. In reply I beg to inform you that there does not appear to be any report of the damage to which you refer in the Department, and if there is no objection on the part of the school authorities to the sale of the timber, it is thought that it might be disposed of by public tender, either the whole or part.\n\nI have, therefore, to request you to ascertain if any objection to the sale is made and if so by whom, and also to submit a full report to the Department, with your recommendation.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nS. Stewart\nAsst. Secretary\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir:\n\nAbout ten years ago there was a very severe wind storm which blew down a considerable quantity of timber on a portion of the Alert Bay Industrial School Reserve. There is an area of probably 40 acres blown down with only an occasional tree standing. The timber is mostly hemlock and spruce but is badly decaying and in a short time will be of absolutely no value with rot.\n\nSix young men all of them ex-pupils of the Alert Bay Industrial school have asked me if they can log off this fallen timber. I told them that the usual royalty was $1.00 per Hemlock and $1.25 for spruce per thousand feet board measure. This timber however is not first class as the sap is rotten and the logs will net scale probably more than 2/3 of what they should. I would recommend that they be allowed to haul off this plot and pay therefor at the rate of .80 cents per thousand feet from the Gov't scale.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 23, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your communication of the 6th instant in regard to the management of the Alert Bay Industrial school I beg to say that instructions have been given Mr. Corker as to the necessity for obtaining permission from the Department before going on any extended leave and of making adequate provision for the management of the school during such absence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, February 23, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to official letter of January 12th, last, in regard to the management of the Alert Bay Industrial school I beg to say that it is sincerely hoped that there will be in future no cause whatever for any criticism of your management of this school. If found necessary for you to leave the institution for any length of time permission should first be obtained from the Department, and in any event provision must be made to have the institution left under competent management during your absence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. W. Cocker,\nPrincipal,\nAlert Bay Industrial School.\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to my report of October 22 on the affairs of the Alert Bay Industrial School I beg to state that there must be some misunderstanding somewhere. In my report I make a specific complaint for a specific offense, while I infer from your letter that the matter has been treated as a general complaint. I thank you for the last clause in your letter which reads \"You have always been considered as a friend to the cause of Indian education and the warm support you gave the project of erecting the Girl's School at Alert Bay was a factor which led to a favorable decision on that project X X X X.\"\n\nThis very fact was my reason for making the complaint and I would ask that you read this report again carefully and in it you will find my views on Industrial schools on the whole, which are, that in my opinion the Industrial school system is the only system so far as this agency is concerned.\n\nShortly after my taking office as Indian Agent for this agency I was in the Indian Office in Victoria and took up the matter of Industrial schools amongst other things; and asked what relationship should exist between the Indian Agent and the School authorities. The instructions given me verbally were that the Indian Agent represented the Department and if he saw anything wrong in the management or method of conducting affairs at any time his duty was first to take up the matter personally with the Principal and discuss the matter medically and if it was\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nnot remedied my duty was then to report the matter to the Department. I may say that this is the method that has been consistently followed and it is the first time that it has been necessary to lay a complaint to the Department the previous matters having been settled amicably.\n\nI informed the Principal of the School of the intended coming of Mr Inspector Ditchburn, and as a matter of fact Mr Ditchburn was at Alert Bay about one hour before Mr Gerber left. In my conversation with Mr Ditchburn previous to inspection I had spoken very favorably of the Industrial school, but conditions at the time of our visit did not in any sense warrant the opinion given to Mr Ditchburn on the morning of the day on which we called at the school. I may say in all fairness to the school management that I hardly ever saw the school untidy or dirty on any previous occasion, but on the occasion of our visit not only were the boys in school very untidy but the whole school from top to bottom looked as though no care had been taken and I therefore held to the same opinion that the Principal was doing his duty when he would leave home without getting some competent person to take care of things during his absence. Formerly no boy would be allowed to take his seat in the schoolroom without having his jacket on. On that day a large percentage were in their shirt sleeves, and many of them had lost the buttons from their neckbands and wristbands which were flopping in a very untidy manner. Two boys wore knickerbocker trousers, underneath which they wore long drawers of white cotton flannel which should be tied with tapes round the ankles. The tapes were off and as the boys mentioned had neither boots nor stockings on you can imagine what they would look like when they walked across the floor.\nIn all fairness I would ask how either the Bishop of Columbia or Dr Baker could be in any position to express any opinion as to the condition of the Alert Bay Industrial school on that particular occasion, nor can I see anything in the report to make anyone suppose that such a condition was customary. In my report I only requested that the Principal be reprimanded to avoid in future any such centretamps, as they are very detrimental to the school.\n\nWith regard to the statement of Mrs Gerker that both I, and Mr Ditchburn, were rude in our manner to her I beg to give a most emphatic and absolute denial.\n\nIn conclusion I would request as I did in my former report that the principal be instructed that in future he must not leave the school without leaving some competent person approved by the Department in his place, and this request is made in the interests of the education of the boys and not from a sense of \"defending our different positions and spheres of duty\" as mentioned in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S. Rev A.B. Green Inspector of Indian Schools was in this office just before my letter of Oct 22 was sent and he concurred that it was my duty as Indian Agent to bring the matter to the attention of the Department.\nJanuary 19 1911\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th Instant, and to assure you that I fully recognize the fact of the concern of the Department for the welfare of the Indians. I hope that I have not in my former letters seemed to cast any doubt upon the matter. I do not consider it necessary to say that I am equally interested.\n\nThere appears to me to be a blot upon the present system in the appointment of Agents as a political reward. It must be in the cognizance of the Department that owing to this, it often happens that the best men are not selected. In this Province it did not make so much difference so long as a Superintendent like Mr. Vowell was over them, but now that so much power is put into the hands of the Agents, it is a most serious affair. In the case of Alert Bay, there is no doubt that there is friction between Mr. Halliday and Mr. Corker. How it arose I am not absolutely certain, but the whole condition of things ought to be thoroughly probed. The outrageous length of the \"Potlatch\", and the fact that the Indians obtained liquor without being dealt with is generally known. Moreover there is dissatisfaction amongst the White people at the appointment of a Custom House Officer in the person of Mr. Halliday at a stipend of $300 a year.\n\nI can only repeat that no School could have a better Master than Mr. Corker, who has faithfully worked on, and who is worthy of the whole-hearted support of the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.W. Columbia\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RC 10, Volume 6426, file 875-1, part 2)\nOttawa, 20th January, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your report on the Industrial School Alert Bay, I have to say that communications have been received from the Bishop of Columbia, Mr. and Mrs. Corker and Dr. Baker of St. George's Hospital protesting against the contents of your report and Mr. Pitchburn's. It seems somewhat strange that you should have suddenly turned from your former reports as your former reports are favorable to the management and general usefulness of this institution while now willing to support you in the discharge of your duty, what sometimes be dangerous, the department is not disposed to submit to your report. In the present case the strong opposition to your report makes it necessary to call upon you for additional explanations. At the same time you must understand that it is not desirable to begin a dispute which might place yourself and the management of the school in antagonism. You should endeavor to so conduct the matter that there will be no undue friction and that the department may feel that both yourself and the management of the school have the sole desire of furthering the interests of the Indians and not defending your different positions and spheres of duty.\n\nMrs. Corker makes the statement that you and Mr. Pitchburn\n\nW. H. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nDitchburn were rude in your manner and while not taking it for granted that the statement is well founded, it is thought best to point out that it should not be possible for any person to make this statement unless from pure malice. The attitude of officers of this Department should be most courteous and kindly at all times. You have always been considered as a friend to the cause of Indian education and the warm support you gave the project of erecting the Girls' school at Alert Bay was a factor which lead to a favourable decision on that project and the receipt of such an adverse report from you and Mr. Ditchburn rendered it necessary to present the facts as represented by you to the school authorities and to the Bishop, as if there were any considerable foundation for your report, the whole management of the school would need to be re-organized. I have to ask you to re-consider this whole matter in a spirit of moderation and conciliation and in the best interests of the work of education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, January 12th., 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th ultimo; the contents of which have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nM. D. Baker, Esq., M.D.,\nSt. George's Hospital,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, January 12th., 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 16th. last and that of Mrs. Corker, of the same date. I have to draw your attention to the fact that in the past Agent Halliday's reports have always been favorable and it is to a large extent owing to his recommendation that it has been decided to erect a Girls' Home at Alert Bay, and it is unfortunate that Mr. Halliday has failed to take a proper interest in the work of Indian education. It is, therefore, regretted that Mrs. Corker reports that Mr. Halliday and Mr. Ditchburn were rude in their manner and the charge will be brought to the attention of these officers. They will also be further communicated with in regard to their report.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that there was no intention whatever to do you any injustice, but the proposed extension of the work at Alert Bay makes it necessary to be perfectly certain that the schools will be kept in a high state of efficiency and the late reports were of such a nature that it was impossible not to bring them to your attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAust.

As soon as this is received and the staff nominated by His Lordship the school may be opened. I may state for your information that the Department has now five young Indian girls, sisters, in the Skeena district, whom it wishes to place in this institution as soon as it is ready to receive pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the Girls Home at Alert Bay I have the honor to inform you that Dr Reper, Bishop of Columbia, recently visited Alert Bay in connection with the opening of the Girls Home. He expressed his intention that subject to the approval of the Department he intended to appoint Mr A.W. Carkar, Principal of the Alert Bay Industrial School as Principal of the Girls Home. It was also decided that Mr Herbert Pearson should be vice principal and Mrs Pearson, matron. Bishop Reper probably has written to you to this effect. This arrangement is for one year.\n\nAs the matter has been delayed so long it was thought best not to allow of any more delay and consequently the keys have been handed over to Mr Pearson in order to allow him to get everything ready for the opening which will not take place until sanctioned by the Department. The inventory of furnishings was carefully checked over by Mr Carkar and myself and a triplicate copy will be signed by himself on behalf of the Church authorities and by myself on behalf of the Department as soon as official sanction is given. One copy of the inventory will be sent the Department after signature. No girls will be admitted until sanction has been received from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

Consideration will be given to the matter of providing a separate class-room at some future date. In the meantime it is presumed that the space provided for a study and work room will be utilized.\n\nWith regard to Your Lordship's inquiries I beg to say that half-breed children cannot be admitted to the institution. All children admitted must be recognized members of some band of Indians in British Columbia.\n\nRight Rev. J. O. Ross,\nBishop of Columbia,\nBishopsgrove,\nVictoria, B.C.\nWhere at all possible it is desirable that teachers with proper certificates of qualification should be engaged. The difficulty of securing qualified teachers, however, is fully recognized by the Department and, where it is impossible to obtain such, the engagement of competent teachers even although not possessing certificates will be permitted.\n\nWith regard to the obligation in bringing back truants to the school I beg to say that this rests with those in charge of the school, both with reference to the work and the expense involved. Assistance will, however, always be given by the Indian Agents and other offices of the Department who may be in a position to render such aid.\n\nI may add for Your Lordship's information that the Department is awaiting the opening of the school in order to place therein five neglected Indian girls from the Skeena district.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nBishopsclose,\nVictoria, B.C.,\n16th May, 1912.\n\nThe Indian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nRefer to #65201.1 - April 9th, 1912.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nYour reply to my letter makes it clear that this Diocese is responsible for the management of the new Home for Girls at Alert Bay.

Mr. Halliday has evidently made these things his special care, and deserves our thanks for his pains.\n\nThe site is, in my judgment, not so wisely selected; the close proximity to the Boys' School is likely to increase the difficulty of maintaining due discipline in both institutions. The Department will, I hope, recognize there will be this difficulty and will be also confident that those who take charge of the Home will do their best to overcome it.\n\nThe girls dormitory is too small to accommodate 30. This is quite obvious now that the thirty beds are put up in it. There is however no real difficulty here, for other rooms...\ncan be used for some of the other girls to sleep in.\n\nA wise provision for the education of the girls is, in my opinion, vital to the success of the whole undertaking. The plan hitherto suggested has been that the girls should be taught at the village school. This will involve a walk to and fro of a considerable distance; the school is, I think, about half a mile away from the Home, and the walk would be through the native non-Christian village. I am so sure that experience will prove this to be harmful for the children that I am constrained to make it a condition of our undertaking the management that provision should be made for teaching the girls in the Home. This will not be difficult, for the Home is generously planned. If the Department will provide the necessary equipment, room could be spared for a schoolroom without any great inconvenience at present. When the school obtains its full quota of thirty girls, it will probably be necessary to build a special schoolroom within the enclosure within which the Home stands.\n\nWould you kindly give me further information upon the following points:-\n\n1. If half-breed children are admitted, will the per capita grant be given for them? I understand that many of the children are likely to be half-breeds.\n\n2. Teachers must, of course, be competent, but, under present regulations, must they always be certificated teachers?\n\n3. I believe, in some cases, children leave the Home or are\n\n2.\ntaken away from it by their parents, upon whom do\nthe duty and expense of bringing the truants back\nfall?\n\nI have taken some steps, but no final steps, towards\nthe appointment of a staff. There is a great deal to be done\nin preparation, and I feel that we should not undertake to\nreceive the girls until one month after the signing of the\nagreement. There will be no unnecessary delay, and I can\nassure you that the object of all who have a share in the\nwork will be to secure the highest success for the under-\ntaking.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of British Columbia.\nOttawa, May 22, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to Your Lordship's letter of the 28th of March, last, and the Department's letter of the 9th ultimo regarding the opening of the new Girls' Industrial School at Alert Bay and to beg to request that Your Lordship will be so good as to state what progress, if any, has been made towards the appointment of a staff to take charge of this school, which is completely furnished and equipped and should have been in operations many months ago.\n\nThe school is urgently needed as there are many orphan and neglected girls in the neighborhood who should be cared for in a residential school.\n\nThe Department is anxious to know when your church will take over the school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. C. Roper,\nBishop of Columbia,\nBishopsclose,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, April 9, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to Your Lordship's request for information regarding the Alert Bay Girls' Home I beg to say that in January, 1890, the Rev. Mr. Hall, Principal of the Alert Bay Industrial School, wrote the Department asking for the establishment of a residential school for girls. Mr. Hall had for some years prior to this application maintained and educated a few Indian girls in his own house without Government aid. The Department, recognizing the desirability of industrial training and education being afforded to Indian girls, agreed to allow Mr. Hall a per capita grant of $70.00 for the education and maintenance of a certain number of girls, not to exceed 30. Owing to Mr. Hall's leaving for England nothing was done until 1895, some time after his return, when the grant was fixed at $60.00 for each of ten girl pupils. Mr. Hall carried on the school up to 1905, when it was closed for want of pupils. Mr. Hall, after being forced to discontinue the school, urged the Department to re-open the school, the need of which as a protection to the girls was plainly put before the Department as Your Lordship will see from the enclosed copy of a letter from our Agent at Alert Bay dated January 5th, 1910. In another letter from our Agent dated May 21, 1910, he states that the \"Church proposes to place a man and his wife as Principal and Matron of the Institution and have also another lady as Assistant Matron.\"\n\nRight Rev. J. G. Roper,\nBishop of Columbia,\nBishopsclose,\nVictoria, B.C.\nThe new building was put up and fully equipped on the understanding that the school would be carried on by the Church with the usual per capita grant of $100.00 for each of 30 pupils from the Department.\n\nI would refer Your Lordship to the Rev. Mr. Hall, through whom the negotiations for the erection of the building and the re-opening of the school took place, for any further information Your Lordship may require.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI find upon taking up my duties here as Bishop of Columbia (Vancouver Island) that I am called upon to take action in the matter of the new girls Industrial School\u2014a building for which has recently been completed at Alert Bay.\n\nWould you kindly let me know, at whose request, if request there was, the Government decided to build the school, what pledge was given and by whom that this Diocese would undertake the charge a cost of maintaining the School, and by whom the site was chosen.\n\nI shall of course urge that all obligations on our part shall be fulfilled\u2014but I want to be quite clear what the obligations in that\nwe have incurred. I find no records were concerning it. If we are really responsible for the undertaking, we must attempt it as well as soon as funds can be found, but at present in the absence of any records, I am a good deal perplexed. It may have been a personal promise on the part of Bishop Perin or of the Rev. A. G. Hall.\n\nBelieve me\n\nFraternally,\n\nJohn Charles Ripper,\nBishop of Columbia.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, March 20, 1912.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of January 9th last, and previous correspondence in reference to the appointment of a staff to take charge of the Alert Bay Girls' Home and I have to ask you when the Department may expect some announcement from the Church authorities as to the personnel of this staff.\n\nThe school, although completed and furnished, has been idle now for many months and the Department wishes to see it in full operation at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon Austin Scriven,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant in reference to Upper gallery at Alert Bay Girls' Home, and in reply to request that you will procure and forward an estimate for fitting the portion of gallery to be used as dormitory with window sash glazed, the bottom portion below rail closed in tight and every third window hinged to open. The sash all to be fitted as casement, the window opening to have wire guards.\n\nThe estimate to be furnished as soon as possible when the question of increasing the number of pupils will be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nReferring to your letter of April 26th, I beg to report that I made an examination of the gallery or verandah adjoining the dormitory of the Girls Home. I find that the inside width of this gallery is only 8 feet 6 inches, and I would recommend that it be finished in the same manner as the portion which has been completed for fresh air sleeping purposes.\n\nThis would necessitate four panels being completed with four canvas frames in each panel, with a wire screen as in the other part. The whole could be completed and painted at a cost of about $80.00 which I would recommend be done, if the Department can see their way clear to grant an increase in the pupilage of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 20, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the Alert Bay Girls' Home for the month of March, last, in which you state that there are many applications for admission which must be refused, but the staff say that if the grant can be increased to accommodate six more that the attic could be used as a dormitory for that number I beg to say that the Department does not approve of the attic being used as dormitory, as it does not contain sufficient air space for that purpose.\n\nThere is, however, a gallery 11 by 46, adjoining the dormitory which could be utilized for further accommodation if required. To put it in condition for dormitory use it would be necessary to fix in sash and partition part of the gallery off, so as to leave about one-half for fresh air sleeping purposes. The Department would like you to submit an estimate of the probable cost of making the necessary alterations to the gallery and when this estimate is received the question of granting an increase in the pupilage at this school will be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nExtract from Agent's Monthly Report on the Alert Bay Girls Home for the month of March, 1916. Original on 65201-7\n\nThere are many applications for admission which must be refused, but the Staff say that if the grant can be increased to accommodate six more that the attic could be used as a dormitory for that number.\n\nSgd. W. M. Halliday\nAgent.\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nThere is a gallery 11 x 46 adjoining the dormitory which could be utilized for further accommodation if required. To put in condition for dormitory use it will be necessary to provide and fix in sash. Six or seven more could be accommodated and still leave one-half of the gallery for fresh air sleeping purposes which would prove adequate for their requirements. As a sleeping gallery affords accommodation for 11 pupils, this might be considered sufficient to entitle the school to increase their attendance to that amount if thought desirable.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, May 14, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you informed the Department that Mr. A. W. Corker, Principal of the Alert Bay Industrial School and Girls' Home has been granted a furlough for one year by the Church Missionary Society, under whose auspices these schools are conducted.\n\nIn this connection I beg to inform you that Mr. Corker informed the Department that he had obtained a year's leave of absence and this arrangement meets with the approval of the Department.\n\nThe Department has also approved of the arrangement made by the Missionary Society, whereby Mr. F. Comley will supply Mr. Corker's place during the latter's absence and that Mrs. Comley will act as matron in place of Mrs. Corker.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D.

Mrs Comley his wife is a trained nurse and has had considerable experience as matron in various hospitals and is well known at Alert Bay will act as matron during Mrs Corkers absence.\n\nMr Corker informed me that he had written to the Department during my absence.\n\nI recommend that Mr Corker be allowed his furlough and that Mr Comley be allowed to act in his absence.\n\nMr Parrott who is teaching at present has promised to remain in the same capacity during Mr Corkers absence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

(RG 10, Volume 6426, file 875-1, part 2)\nOttawa, December 23, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Ditchburn, in his report on his inspectorate for the month of November, last, states in connection with the Alert Bay Girls' Home that some of the parents contended that the children had not been looked after properly and were allowed to go home with their heads in an unclean condition and also that the girls were made to work digging the garden and doing other general work around the school, which they did not think the girls should be called upon to do.\n\nYou will be good enough to see that the children's heads are kept clean in the future.\n\nThe Department would like you to state what work the girls are called upon to do, as it is not considered that a reasonable amount of work should hurt them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. W. Corker, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nAlert Bay Girls' Home,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir:\n\nThe only complaint I had to investigate at Alert Bay was in connection with the management of the Girls' Home. A number of the girls who had been allowed out on their holidays, had not returned and a special constable had been appointed to bring them back. Some of the parents contended that the children had not been looked after properly and were allowed to go home with their heads in an unclean condition; also that the girls were made to work digging the garden and doing other general work around the school which they did not think girls should be called upon to do. I regret to say that upon investigation these complaints were well founded. As regards the children's heads not being kept in a clean condition, it was admitted by the school authorities that some time last year some of the girls went to their homes and their heads were found to be infected with vermin. I took this matter up with the matron, Miss Neville, and she admitted that, at the time about which the Indians complained, owing to the staff being extremely busy, the children's heads had not been properly inspected for a week. With reference to the complaint of the Indians that the girls had to do work which they should not be called upon to do, this and the other complaint is the direct result of a recommendation I made to the management of this school at the time it was opened not being carried out. At that time I gave my opinion that it would be found necessary to have a man employed to do the general labor work and carry out the many odd jobs in connection with this institution that no woman could do successfully. However, I was informed that such help was not required and that the staff and the girls could do everything that was necessary.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe result has been that the girls have been made to do all the work in connection with the establishment and the premises. This was all right until the novelty wore off and then the Indians had a chance to complain, and to my mind with some just cause.\n\nIn so far as the childrens' heads not being kept clean I am satisfied that after my talk with the matron that this will not happen again, but I would recommend that the authorities, who have supervision of this school, should be informed that it is necessary to have a man appointed who will attend to the general work of the school, for it cannot be expected that Mr. Eli Hunt, who is the manual training instructor of the Boys' Industrial School, should act as general utility at the Girls' Home, for his time is, or should be, fully taken up giving instructions to the boys. However as the Girls' Home is under the supervision of the Anglican Diocese of British Columbia and the Boys' Industrial School is supervised by the Church Missionary Society, two separate and distinct bodies, a scheme of such a nature would not work out satisfactorily. If a man is appointed to do the general work around the Girls' Home it would then give the staff full opportunity to carry out their duties more efficiently and would permit of no excuse for laxity in their oversight of the childrens' persons.\n\nAt the Girls' Home, of which Miss A.R. Neville is matron, there were only 21 girls present, 11 not having returned since their holidays. I have since received word that the special constable had succeeded in bringing all the children back to the school! Miss N.E. Nixon gives the girls a good education in the classroom and the children have been making all the progress that can be expected of them. Nothing serious has taken place amongst the pupils so far as their health is concerned during the summer. A very good crop of vegetables and small fruit were grown.\ngrown in the garden; but the potatoes were a very poor crop.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, August 10, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo stating that the improvements being made to the Alert Bay Girls' Home will be finished in the course of a few days and asking if the increase in the pupilage will be allowed.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to allow an increase of six pupils at this school and this increase will date from the first of the current quarter. If you receive this letter in time you may purchase the necessary additional beds and bedding when you are in Vancouver.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nWith reference to your letter of June 6th, in which authority was given to finish the upper gallery of the Alert Bay Girls Home, I beg to state that the work has been delayed owing to no carpenter being available, but will be finished in the course of a few days.\n\nI wish to know if the increased pupilage will be allowed, as, the girls are more likely to come directly school is opened than later, more particularly as the fishing season has been very poor. If the increase of six pupils is allowed would you kindly also give me authority to purchase the necessary beds and bedding. I expect to be in Vancouver privately about the fifteenth proximo, and would select what was needed while there and thus save expense to the department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 6, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo in reference to finishing the upper gallery of Alert Bay girls' school as stated in my letter to you of May 10th, and in reply to inform you that you are hereby authorized to complete same at the estimated cost of ($85.00) eighty-five dollars, the work to be undertaken and completed as soon as possible.\n\nThe matter of increase of pupilage at the school will be dealt with in a separate letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nfor Aset. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nReferring to your letter of May 10th in reference to the upper gallery at the Alert Bay Girls Home I beg to inform you that I have gone carefully into an estimate of the probable cost and it will not exceed the price mentioned in the last estimate, which was $80.00. An extra $5.00 would be enough to allow for the new wood-work to be properly painted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D.

Through another channel I had already been advised that Mr. Corker was giving up his work at this point and that Mr. Lord was taking charge, and I granted my approval. I expressed my appreciation of the good work that has been done among the Indians of this district by Mr. and Mrs. Corker, and I have no doubt that Your Lordship has made the best choice possible. I trust that the high standard of the school will be maintained under the new management.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. Charles D.

The address on the envelope was Duncan C.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nApril 25, 1921.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\nIndian Dept., Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI should have reported to you before this that we have been making a change in the Principalship of our Indian Schools at Alert Bay. The Rev. A.W. Corker after long, faithful and devoted service has asked to be relieved, and in his place we have appointed Vivian S. Lord, Esq., as Principal.\n\nThe Dept. will be interested to learn that in Mr. Lord we believe we have an exceptionally suitable person for this position. The son of an English clergyman, Mr. Lord received a public school education and took part of his course at Oxford; he then was apprenticed to an engineering firm where he also took a course in carpentering. For some years he studied farming in South America, and then in Canada, and after several years overseas, he has been engaged at a lumber camp near Alert Bay.\n\nAfter all this experience he has offered to tackle this work as a missionary undertaking, and if he finds he can do it to our satisfaction he is ready to give himself to it as a life work.\n\nMy own interview with him confirms all that I have been told by those who have known him, that Mr. Lord is a man of exceptional ability and of strong character; and that since he is taking up the work in a sincerely religious spirit, he should be a tower of strength to the boys and girls of the schools.\n\nWill you then kindly deal with Mr. Lord in all matters pertaining to the School at Alert Bay, sending the quarterly cheques to him.\n\nWith kindest regards, I remain, yours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6426, file 875-1, part 2)\nApril 6th, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Corker,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the last instant tendering your resignation as Principal of the Alert Bay Industrial School. I wish to express my appreciation of your long and faithful service in the capacity of principal of this institution, and of your work generally among the Indians of the district. I am glad to know that you will still continue in active work among the Indians although in a somewhat different capacity. Both Rev. Canon Gould and Archdeacon Snowdon, with whom I had an interview recently, spoke in the highest terms of the Alert Bay Industrial School, and I shall look forward to good results in the future from your contact with ex-pupils, who, I trust, will take every opportunity to benefit from your direction and counsel.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

S. Lord as principal, which fact His Lordship will doubtless inform the Department.\n\nI am not leaving their Indian work, as I am the only white man who knows their language, at the Bishop's request, I shall devote myself to the spiritual and social work of all the Indians of this vicinity.\n\nI take this opportunity of thanking the Department for its help and patience. These Indians have in the past been very slow in availing themselves of the opportunities of education, owing to the practise of the potlatch, but now they are anxious for their children to be educated. There are several children wishing to enter the schools when vacancies occur.\n\nA deputation of the M.S.C.C., The Rev Canon Gould & the Ven. Archdeacon Snowden of Ottawa, recently visited the schools, & said at a public meeting held here, that \"these schools were the best they had visited.\"\n\nI assure the department that I shall be always interested in the work of the schools, and endeavour to follow up the work with the ex pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDuncan Scott Esq.\nSuperintendent General\nIndian Department\nOttawa\nExtract from Agent's Report on the ALERT BAY INDUSTRIAL School for the month of October, Original on 116947-7\n\nIt was intended by the Anglican Church Authorities that Rev. A. W. Corker should be retired as principal of this school and confine his duties to that of the church. Unfortunately the Bishop has not been able to replace him. The present arrangement is not working to the utmost satisfaction and it is to be hoped that the church authorities will soon have his successor appointed. The staff are doing the best they can but are short-handed. Mr. Corker is in attendance at the school the greater part of his time but his residence is at the vicarage.\n\nW. M.

Original on 116947/7.\n\nMr. Eli Hunt, who for a number of years has been Trade instructor at this institution, has just severed his connection with it as he found it impossible to support his family on the salary he received there. His successor is not yet in evidence.\n\nThe great drawback to this institution is the scarcity of cleared land. This institution should be absolutely self-supporting, in the matter of vegetables, meat and butter and eggs. The only vegetables of which there is enough grown are potatoes while meat has always to be bought and there is never any produce of any kind sold. The ground is hard to clear and with the labour of the boys takes a long time to clear, and this largely accounts for the small amount under cultivation.\nOttawa, May 1, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Alert Bay Industrial School, in which he requests that the per capita grant for that institution be increased from $130.00 to $150.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is unable to grant this request at the present time, as, owing to the war, the funds at its disposal have been considerably reduced. You will be good enough to inform the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nWith reference to your letter of January 29th, No 65201/1 regarding the attempt to burn the Alert Bay Girls Home by Kathleen Collison and Flora Robinson two pupils of that institution, I beg to state that yesterday afternoon I visited the Girls Home, and in the school room in the presence of the staff and all the pupils I spoke very seriously to these two girls and practically put them on suspended sentence, as in some ways their conduct had not been satisfactory since the attempt to burn the school. I told them that under the Criminal Code they had left themselves liable to fourteen years imprisonment, and had they been successful in their attempt to imprison them for life. However as the principal had given them a good caning that prosecution would not be entered if they behaved themselves and did what was right during the rest of their stay. They promised to do their best and it is to be hoped that in future no misdemeanor of this kind will ever occur.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Ass't Deputy & Secretary,\nDept., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 29th, 1918.\n\nSir -\n\nChief Inspector Ditchburn has brought to the attention of the Department your report on the attempt to burn the Alert Bay School Building by Kathleen Collison and another pupil. Mr. Ditchburn is of opinion that these girls should be prosecuted under the criminal code. The Department having in view the fact that they have already been punished by the Principal does not wish to take harsher measures. I would ask you to interview these girls in the presence of the staff and the other pupils and impress upon them the seriousness of the misdemeanor, and inform them if any such attempt is again made the Department will not shield them but that they will be criminally prosecuted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, January 29th, 1918.\n\nSir -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing an excerpt of a letter addressed to you by Mr. Agent Halliday having reference to an attempt to burn the Alert Bay School Building by two of the pupils.\n\nWhile the Department realizes the seriousness of the conduct of these two girls, it does not wish to prosecute them. It is noted that they have already been punished, and I propose to write to the Principal today asking him to try to impress upon these girls the enormity of the crime, and the fact that should any similar attempt be made in the future, they will not be shielded by the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nJ. D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Bitchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nI regret to inform you that I have received a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Halliday stating that on Sunday, the 13th instant, an attempt was made to burn down the Indian Girls Home at Alert Bay by two of the pupils, and on this matter I have to draw your attention to the remarks contained in Mr. Halliday's letter wherein he says that after a conference between himself and Principal Corker he suggested that if the two girls were given a good thrashing it would not occur again.\n\nI am inclined to think that too much leniency has been extended to the pupils on this matter, as this is the fifth Indian school that has been on fire in a period of nine months.\n\nIn the five weeks from May 5th to June 15th, 1917, the Ahousaht, Alberni and Sechelt schools were burned down, the Clayoquot Indian school was also set on fire but was put out before much damage was done. Upon investigation it was shown that at Ahousaht and Clayoquot the fires were deliberately set by some of the pupils, at Alberni and Sechelt the origin of the fires was doubtful. The fire at Alert Bay makes the fifth, and I am therefore of the opinion that these girls should have been arrested and dealt with under Section 511 of the Criminal Code, which deals with the crime of arson, as I believe that if these girls had been sent to the Provincial Girls Home in Vancouver for a long term and notices put up in all the schools explaining what had happened.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nhad been done it would serve as a warning to others who might meditate a like offence in future.\n\nI have written to Mr. Indian Agent Halliday giving him my views on the subject and would suggest that a letter from the Department should also be written to him, and, if you concur in my views, instruct him to have these girls prosecuted.\n\nAn excerpt from Mr. Indian Agent Halliday's letter is herewith enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nExcerpt from Indian Agent Halliday's letter of January 17th, 1916, to Chief Inspector Ditchburn.\n\nI have also to report that institution had a narrow escape from being burned last Sunday night. A girl by name of Kathleen Collison, who comes from the north, from a spirit of pique over some fancied grievance procured some old rags, soaked them with coal oil, and crawled under the building in the part that has not been excavated and set fire to the waste, amongst the joints of the building. It was just at the time they were preparing to go to church, but fortunately another girl happened to notice the blaze and Miss Ferryman went in with a bucket of water and the fire was extinguished immediately before any harm was done. Mr. Corker held an investigation into it and finally the girl confessed and stated that another girl had been with her at the time. The reason given for the offence was that if the home was burned they would have a good holiday before a new one could be built. Mr. Corker reported the affair to me and asked me what I thought best to do as the staff at the girls' home thought she should be sent to jail. After hearing all about this matter I told Mr. Corker that if, under the circumstances, he gave the two of them a good thrashing that it would not occur again, and that if the girls were sent home the same thing would be likely to occur again, as in my experience while teaching at the Boys Home was that oftentimes mischief was done by the boys in the hope that they would be discharged from the school and sent home and not from any criminal or malicious intent. My suggestion was carried out but the staff has been warned to keep a very strict lookout.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Signed) W. M. Halliday,\nIndian Agent.\nMay 3rd, 1917.\n\nRight Rev. Sir -\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship's letter of the 25th ultimo, in reference to the Alert Bay Girls' Home.\n\nAlthough the contract for the maintenance of this and similar institutions expired last year, no action was taken to either renew the contract or to enter into a new one. If any increase were made in the per capita grant to boarding schools an increase in our Parliamentary Appropriation would be necessary. However, owing to the need of retrenchment in the public expenditure it was not found possible to take the matter into consideration.\n\nI regret exceedingly, therefore, that I am unable to give favourable consideration to your Lordship's request at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, May 4, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo advising the Department that Miss A. E. Neville, who has been matron of the Alert Bay Girls' Home since it first opened and is leaving, at her own expense about a year ago purchased a jersey cow, which cost landed at Albert Bay $110.00 and which was used entirely for the benefit of the school, and recommending that the Department purchase this cow and add it to the equipment of the school and enclosing a communication from the Principal in reference to this matter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to purchase this cow and I have to ask you to be good enough to inform the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nDuncan C. Scott Esq  \nDeputy Supt. General  \nIndian Affairs,  \nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre. Indian Girls' Home, ALERT BAY, B.C.\n\nConfirming my Lettergram of last night I desire to take up more fully the question of an increase in the allowance at present made by your Department to the \"Girls' Home\" at Alert Bay, which has already been brought to your notice by Principal Corker.\n\nIn the first place I desire to put before you the following summary of the account with the \"Home\" as it stands in the books of this Diocese from May 1913 to December 1916:\n\n| Month | Govt. Grant | Expenditure |\n|-------|-------------|-------------|\n| May   | $2073.50    | $3035.61    |\n| Jan   | $1619.25    | $184.81     |\n| Feb   | $2358.25    | $3732.13    |\n| Mar   | $2508.25    | $3868.27    |\n| Total | $8539.75    | $13,220.82  |\n\nThis a/c shows that in the three years and nine months we have had to raise almost $5,000.00 over and above the Government Aid in order to carry on efficiently our work for the Indian Girls.\n\nAs our Principal states the tremendous increase in the price of all food-stuffs, clothing, and boots makes it abundantly clear that the cost of Board and clothing the pupils is growing rapidly.\n\nWe are as anxious as the Department can be that the Character Training of these Indian Children, which can only be accomplished under such influences as prevail in this kind of school, should be continued, and to this end we are prepared to urge our people to contribute to their support. At the same time the strenuous demands of the Patriotic Fund, Red Cross, and other War Calls are making it more and more difficult to maintain this kind of work which is dependent on the voluntary contributions of the Church-people. Furthermore, these difficulties, tho' common to all, are greatly aggravated by the specially unsatisfactory financial condition prevailing at present in these Western Provinces.\nDuncan C. Scott Esq (2)\n\nAs I have only recently come into office I had not before studied the papers connected with this subject; on investigation I find that the time of the original Contract between your Department and the Bishop has been fulfilled more than a year. If the Government desire to renew the arrangement for a term of years, I would gladly take up the matter with them on behalf of the Church. In this case it might not be possible to enter into a contract on so small an increase as is suggested in the request of Principal Corker. We could however undertake to try and carry on the work for a year or two on the basis of $120.00 per child, watching conditions; and later on consider a new arrangement.\n\nThe Bishop who entered into the original contract with the Department, the Rt. Rev. Dr. Roper, is now Bishop of Ottawa, and I am writing to ask if he will be good enough to arrange for an interview with you to talk this matter over. He knows the conditions at the \"Home\" even better than I do as yet.\n\nTrusting you will feel able to recommend at least the additional aid asked for by the Principal in his letter of the 18th inst.\n\nI remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of British Columbia.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Miss A.E. Neville who has been matron of the Alert Bay Girls' Home since it first opened, has resigned and is leaving today.\n\nAbout a year ago Miss Neville at her own expense purchased a Jersey cow which cost landed at Alert Bay $140.00, and which was used entirely for the benefit of the Alert Bay Girls' Home.\n\nI am given to understand that the Diocese is not in a position to buy the cow, nor are there any funds available from the per capita grant and I beg to recommend that the Department purchase the cow, and add it to the equipment of the school, with the distinct understanding that if at any time the management of the school should change that the present management should leave a cow of equal value as part of the equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Ass't Deputy & Secretary,\nDept., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAlert Bay Girls Home\nAlert Bay B.C.\nApril 23rd, 1917.\n\nSIR:\n\nI have the honour to request that the Department will be good enough to give us a cow for the use of the Girls Home. At present the cow giving milk is the property of the matron. As she has resigned that position she is selling the cow. The cow is a good one, a Jersey, and is giving rich milk. I think it would be a pity for the cow to be sold elsewhere. No animal has as yet been given by the Department to the school, I trust therefore the Department will give this one to the Home.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDuncan C.

A. W.

Corker, Principal of the Alert Bay Industrial School, in which he makes request to have the per capita grant for that institution increased from $130.00 to $150.00.\n\nThe principal in his remark draws attention to the great increase in the price of living and I can recommend that the increase be given, as on the present grant it is absolutely impossible to pay running expenses. Flour has increased from $7.50 per barrel to $12.50 while boots have just about doubled in price, these two being the chief items of expense. In addition to this it may be necessary to increase the salary of the staff as they cannot live on the salaries paid at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Ass't Deputy & Secretary,\nDept, Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Alert Bay Industrial School\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nApril 18th, 1917.\n\nSIR:\n\nI have the honour to request that the per capita grant to this school be increased from $130.00 to $150.00 per capita. The great increase in price of food stuffs, boots, and clothing make it impossible to run the school on the present grant. The Church Missionary Society under whose auspices the school has been managed have stopped their grant to the school, and at the present time it is impossible to get help from this diocese, which is at this time badly hit by the war.

Scott Esqr.\nDeputy Superintendent General\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa.\nJANUARY REPORT OF AGENT HALLIDAY ON THE ALERT BAY INDUSTRIAL.\n\nIn the industrial part of the work a very noticeable falling off can be seen since Mr. Comley retired from Acting Principal. On the other hand, many complaints had come in that the boys had to work too hard and that the Indians sent them to school to learn to read and write and not to work.\n\nReport dated, Feb. 1st, 1917.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of December 23rd. No 65201/I. re Mr Inspector Ditchburn's report of certain complaints made by some of the parents of the girls.\n\nI much regret to have to plead guilty, for the first time, regarding unfavourable reports of the Department's Officials, to the complaint that some of the children went home with heads in an unclean condition. This took place last year while I was on furlough in England. On my return when the Indians first told me of it, I severely reprimanded those responsible.\n\nI wish the Department to know that as far as I could ascertain this only occurred once, & at the time when all the Indians were here potlatching, when the village was in an awful state of uncleanness, which was brought to the Department's notice by the Bishop of Ottawa.\n\nIn reference to the complaint of the outside work I can assure the Department, that the girls do not work too hard, they do a little digging with small children's forks, weeding, planting, watering &c & I may add that the\nGirls enjoy the work. I have never heard a single girl complain.\n\nThese complaints were really Indians' excuses; they were planning to marry four or five of the girls at the coming winter's potlatch to be held at Gwayasdums, hence would not send them back after the holidays.\n\nI explained all this to Mr. Ditchburn when he was here.\n\nYour Obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Department.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 23, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn regard to your report on your inspectorate for the month of November, last, I beg to say that the Department has noted your suggestions in regard to the Alert Bay Girls' Home.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLennan\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have to report that a number of changes are being made in the personnel of the staff at the Alert Bay Industrial School. Miss Warrener, for a number of years matron at the school, has been transferred to another school.\n\nMiss McCarthy, the teacher at the Boys' School, had poor health and on the advice of the doctor sent in her resignation and has gone to Vancouver. I have been informed by Mr. Lord that a male teacher will be here to take her place commencing with the 1st inst.\n\nMiss Donald, who has been cook for some months past, has also resigned and I understand a new appointment has been made to take effect shortly.\n\nIn connection with these resignations, Mr. Lord went to Vancouver leaving the school temporarily in charge of Rev. A. W. Corker and he informed me personally on his return that he had completed satisfactory arrangements for a new staff.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have acknowledged receipt of your letter of March 8th referring to a report from Mr. Inspector Cairns regarding the milk cows kept at the Alert Bay Industrial and Girls' Boarding schools and also to the fact that milk was being sold from the school when there was not a sufficient supply for the use of the pupils.\n\nI took this matter up personally with Mr. Lord, the Principal of the school, and gave him a copy of your letter. I am in receipt of a reply from him stating that he has forwarded a copy of your letter to Dr. Nesbitt, Secretary of the Commission managing the Indian schools.\n\nHe also states that he has issued instructions that all sales of milk, cream or butter are to cease as soon as possible. He states also that since the beginning of the year the only sales made, with the exception of the butter from the Girls' Home have been to deluge people in case of sickness and young babies etc., etc., during circumstances prevalent on this island are almost unable to obtain the said commodity, and he states further that 100 pounds of butter was bought for the Girls' Home during the quarter ending March 31st, showing that the girls did not lack butter for which he adds is the main part of the milk.\n\nIn connection with these schools I have always urged on the principal the necessity for having more land put under cultivation so that stock could be kept and as I have pointed out that in addition to supplying the schools a very profitable dairy business could be conducted and the whole of the land might be supplied to the benefit of the settlers and to the profit of the schools. The late principal, the Rev. L. W. Corker, while agreeing with me in principle did not seem to be able to get the land under cultivation. Mr. Lord has for some time been a practical farmer and he is gradually extending their clearing. When Dr. Nesbitt, the Superintendent for the missionary Society of the Church of England, visited Alert Bay I took the matter up with him and urged on him the necessity of having land cleared for the benefit of the school, and he promised to give it his careful consideration but as his trip was a hurried one he told me that he would have to leave the details for further consideration before bringing it to the attention of the finance committee.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, May 2nd, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, informing the Department as to the name of the teacher who has been appointed at the Alert Bay Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the temporary appointment of Mr. Hooper, formerly teacher at the Lytton Industrial School, is noted. It is further noted that the Principal is taking steps to obtain a certificated teacher to begin duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nWe have also noted that Mrs. Harris, formerly of the Lytton Industrial School, has been appointed to take charge of the cooking, to succeed Miss Donald.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. H. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of April 6th I beg to advise you that the new teacher who is replacing Miss McCarthy at the Alert Bay Industrial School was recommended by Mr. Inspector Cairns. His name is Edgar Hooper and he was formerly teacher at an Indian school at Lytton. He has no teacher's certificate but has had considerable experience and his influence is altogether for good amongst the boys over whom he already has great control.\n\nIn a conversation held this morning with the Principal of the school Mr. Lord informed me that Mr. Hooper's appointment was only temporary as the Missionary Society of the Church in Canada is taking steps to supply a certificated teacher at the opening of the new term after the Summer holidays.\n\nMiss Donald who has been cooking at the school is leaving on the 29th inst., and her place will be filled by Mrs. Harris who also filled the same appointment at Lytton some years ago.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, April 6th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, reporting the changes that have been made in the personnel of the staff at the Alert Bay Industrial School.\n\nI will be pleased if you will give the name and the qualifications of the teacher secured by the Principal to replace Miss McCarthy, the teacher at the boys' school. The other changes have been noted.\n\nReplying to your other letter of the same date, it is noted that the Principal has issued instructions that all sales of milk, cream or butter are to cease as soon as possible, and that the milk supply will be used for the benefit of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nALERT BAY.\n\nBOYS' SCHOOL.\n\nAt the time of my visit to Alert Bay this summer, I found an insufficient staff on the boys' side and no harmony among the officers. The Principal has poor control over both boys and staff and, generally speaking, the institution is only fairly successful.\n\nAt this institution the boys' and girls' plants are entirely separate in finance and management, with the exception of the Principal himself. Even the gardens are under different control.\n\nThe boys' building needs new flooring on the main floor, and the foundation will have to be renewed very shortly. The range in the kitchen is in bad condition. The lavatories are all outdoor, and a new one for staff is badly needed. The water supply is adequate. Stoves only are used for heating. Laundry equipment is all \"hand\" in type. Water should be piped to it. Lighting is entirely by lamps.\n\nThe boys' classroom, which is a separate building, is in bad shape. It is crowded and the desks are poor, and at the other end of the building there is a noisy carpenter shop.\n\nThe boys' dormitories (2) are fairly good, but beds are badly needed. There are no wash room or lavatory facilities on the upper floors.\n\nA complete new school for boys is really needed, and Dr. Westgate suggests building onto the girls school. The present water system would be adequate for a large building. Detached classrooms are satisfactory on the West Coast and if they had 3 rooms in one building and commenced co-education I believe better results would be obtained.\n\nThe Agent can place 120 pupils here. There are 50 on the waiting list now. The Kwawkewlth Agency is entirely Protestant.\n\nGIRLS' SCHOOL.\n\nThe outside needs painting and I understand the contract has been let. The girls' staff is very efficient. The girls' dormitory has plenty air space, but hardly enough floor space for 56 girls. Lavatory and wash room facilities are on the same floor as the dormitory. Infirmary O.K. Third floor but a storeroom. Building is steam heated. Main floor needs renovating. The building on the whole is well provided, but is too small for 56 girls.\nBasement is concrete. Adequate water supply (Artesian well with gas engine pump to cistern for both school). Lighting by lamps. In the near future a wing to permit of more dormitory accommodation is badly needed.\n\nThirty acres are cultivated, mostly potatoes but some vegetables are raised. Hay for the four cows has to be purchased.\n\nArrangements should be made to strengthen the hands of the Agent and Principal so that pupils could be held until they are eighteen (See Agent's report of March, 1921, concerning this).\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nBasement is concrete.

To quote the words of Mr. Cairns as given by the Principal in this connection they are as follows:- \"Mr. Cairns' opinion is that it is only fair to these Schools and their Managers that the maximum grant should be forthcoming, and that the Department would view with favour any exceptional case such as ours.\"\n\nCommending the request as set forth above to your favourable consideration, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary & Acting General Secretary M.B.C.C.\n\nTBRW/PEO.\nOttawa, Feb. 16, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Dr. Westgate, of Winnipeg, the Acting General Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, has requested that the holiday period for the Alert Bay Indian Residential School be increased from 4 to 6 weeks. Dr. Westgate, during a recent interview in Ottawa, discussed with the Superintendent of Indian Education the desirability of changing the season of the annual vacation from the mid-summer, at certain of the Indian residential schools under Church of England auspices. The request now to hand, however, has reference to a longer period than the one month allowed with grant.\n\nBefore definitely refusing Dr. Westgate's request, the Department would be pleased to have your recommendation in this connection. I would draw your careful attention to the precedent that would be established if a longer holiday period were given at any one Indian residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

C.\nOttawa, Feb. 16, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to holidays at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. I have noted your request that 6 weeks be allowed, with grant.\n\nIn reply I beg to state the Superintendent of Indian Education is under the impression that you discussed, during a recent visit in Ottawa, the season best suited for vacation purposes at Alert Bay; and it was suggested to you that, if it was found desirable to have the annual holiday of one month at some time other than in midsummer, a communication should be addressed to the Department. I regret to state that we cannot favourably consider a 6 weeks' vacation, with grant. However, in view of your report concerning Mr. Inspector Cairns' opinion, a communication is being addressed to him, and the Department will postpone a decision until his answering letter has been received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAust. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary &\nActing Gen. Secretary, M.B.C.C.,\n41 - 42 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOTTAWA, March 8th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in a report on his inspection of the Alert Bay Industrial and Girls' boarding school in February, last, states that the milch cows kept give a very small supply of milk, and that he has advised the Principal to get rid of them and obtain a better grade of cows.\n\nHe also draws attention to the quantity of milk used at the girl's school. He states that in January, last, only 45 gallons of milk were produced, 7 of which were sold, also that 10 pounds of butter were made, 5 of which were sold.\n\nThis is quite an inadequate supply of milk for the use of the pupils. Milk should form one of the main items of diet, especially for the younger children, and you should take up with the Principal the matter of obtaining a sufficient number of good milch cows to supply the pupils with an adequate supply of milk each day.\n\nOwing to the small quantity of milk at present produced, it should be used for the benefit of the pupils, and none should be sold. This also applies to the butter made.\n\nI will be pleased if you will consult the Principal regarding the obtaining of more milch cows, and inform the Department as to what he proposes to do in this matter, as milk should be served to the pupils, especially the younger ones, at each meal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nDairy:\n\nIn January 10 pounds of butter were made; sold 5 pounds. Produced 45 gallons of milk, and sold 7 gals. in January. My opinion would be that this school with only one cow milking and having 36 pupils and a staff of four should not sell either butter or milk.\n\n(Sgd.) R. H. Cairns.\nOttawa, April 20, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, and, previous to the receipt thereof, the Department had been advised of the resignation of the Rev. A. W. Corker, as Principal of the Alert Bay Industrial School. I trust that the institution under the new management will continue to serve the same useful purpose among the Indians of that district as in the past.\n\nI am glad to note your commendatory remarks regarding the new principal and his wife.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. [Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Rev. A. W. Corker, who for many years has been Principal of the Alert Bay Industrial School, has been retired from that position, and is now Vicar of the Parish. In the meantime the Church has appointed Mr. Vivian Spencer Lord as Principal both of the Alert Bay Industrial School and of the Alert Bay Girls' Home. Mr. Lord is a young man and was in attendance at Oxford University at the outbreak of the War and joined the Air Force where he served with some distinction, but at the end of the War did not care to go back to the University, where he was studying for Holy Orders. His wife received a decoration from the Imperial Government for services rendered as a nursing sister.\n\nFrom the slight acquaintance which I have had of them I would judge that they would be quite capable and fit for the duties which they have undertaken.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 3, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer further to your letter of the 8th ultimo, with reference to holidays at the Alert Bay Indian Residential school. A report has been received from Mr. Inspector Cairns, in this connection, and I regret to state that the Department cannot allow any special consideration at the above mentioned school. There have been advanced several arguments for, and against, a change in our regulations lengthening the vacation period; but the Department is not prepared to make a new ruling at this time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary &\nActing Gen. Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n41 - 43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, March 3, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the holiday period at Indian residential schools. I have noted the reasons advanced by you why it might be desirable to arrange for a 6 weeks' period.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department cannot change its regulations in this connection, at the present time. Some schools in certain parts of Canada are so situated that it is impracticable to allow the children to go home in the summer time. At these schools, arrangements are made for summer camps and other outings, always under the supervision of members of the staff. Further, I am of the opinion that there will always be delinquent pupils who fail to return promptly at the expiration of a holiday period, and a lengthening of the vacation would result in a general disorganizing of institutional routine, for a period every summer of at least two months. Most of our institutions are crowded to the limit of their capacity, and no opportunity must be lost to educate and prepare for Christian citizenship the youth of the present generation.\n\nIf it is found, at any school, that the general health and stamina of the children are not what they should be, special arrangements can be made upon application to the Department for outdoor activities, as a substitution for classroom work for those weeks in the summer that are not in the vacation period. The Department believes that the children enrolled at Indian residential schools should be, for 11 months of the year, under the discipline, care and civilizing influence of the staff of workers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian schools,\n402 Holden Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nThis acknowledges the receipt of your letter of February the 16th in which you state that Dr. Westgate, Acting General Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, requests that the holiday period for the Alert Bay Residential Schools be extended from four weeks to six weeks each year.\n\nIt will be just as well to recognize that if the request is granted in this case it will, of necessity, lead to a change of policy in this matter by the Indian Department. For I feel certain that similar requests will come from many of our Residential Schools.\n\nIt would be well, too, to remember that according to Indian Day School Regulations, the pupils of Day Schools have two months' holidays. I think that the arguments in favour of two months' holidays for our day school are equally cogent when applied to Residential Schools.\n\nThere is a tendency in educational circles to increase the holiday time. July and August are holidays in all the public schools of British Columbia. From a health point of view it is generally recognized that pupils are better out of the class-room during the period of extremely hot weather.\nThe objective of all our schools is to develop the moral, mental, and physical powers of the child. Therefore I am prepared to sanction any change that will help the schools to attain that objective.\n\nThere is also another phase of the question. At the present time many pupils do not return promptly and the result is that the quarter ending September 30th generally shows a marked decrease in the financial results. This leads to difficulty in financing the schools.\n\nOn the whole, I am in favour of the holiday period being extended to six weeks with full grant. Practically, it takes two weeks to get the pupils back to school and organized for work. If the policy of six weeks' holidays were adopted then punctuality on the part of the pupils should be insisted upon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\nOttawa, March 23, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, your file E.T., in further reference to the question of exemption from payment of sales tax on purchases made by the Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Boys' Industrial School and Girls' Home at Alert Bay, B.C., are the property of the Federal Government and are financed from per capita grants provided by Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sup't Gen.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is with very great regret that I have to make the following report.\n\nAbout 7.30 pm, Sept. 15th, I was informed that the Girls' Home was on fire. I hurried over at once and found that a pile of coats in the attic had been ablaze, but had already been extinguished by Miss Dibben, Matron i/c, with an Extinguisher. This lady's presence of mind and promptitude was very praiseworthy.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Halliday arrived a few minutes after me and it was clear to us both that the fire was not of accidental origin. Upon investigation it was found that the fire had been deliberately lit by Kitty Wannock, accompanied by Marion Webb. We also discovered that a small fire on Sept. 7th, had been lit by Molly Wilson. (This was a small fire in some underclothes, which did no damage. I reported this to Rev. Dr. Westgate, but did not think it of sufficient importance to report to the Dept., as no damage was done, and the fire appeared to be accidental).\n\nI punished the above three girls in the presence of Mr. Halliday and the assembled school. Also, on the recommendation of Mr. Halliday, Kitty Wannock was expelled that evening. All three girls were members of a small group which had given us a great deal of trouble last term, and their only excuse was that they wanted to get out of school.\n\nI would strongly recommend that all the girls be sent to a Reformatory, or a more distant school. Molly Wilson and Marion Webb have a bad influence in the School, but I should not like to see them sent to their own villages, - they need to be saved from themselves. Also if Kitty Wannock is permitted to remain at home it will only encourage other girls who wish to get out to commit similar acts. On the other hand if all three girls are sent away the moral effect will be very great.\n\nI am glad to be able to report that no damage whatever was done to the building itself. The only damage was to clothing and bedding, of which the following was destroyed:\n\nIndian Affairs.

M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the fact that the Industrial School for boys at Alert Bay is altogether too small for the number of pupils who wish to attend. The regular capacity is forty boys and I am in receipt of a letter from the Principal as follows:\n\n\"I anticipated certain vacancies this Summer and took new boys in. Now Peter Mason who failed in the Entrance Examination has come back again to try next year. I am also keeping Godfrey Kelly who passed the examination until I hear whether the engineering course has been authorized for him. This makes me forty-one boys in residence today and I also think that David White, seventeen, who announced his intention of leaving is intending to come back for one more year. I may also add that I have a waiting list of about twenty-five boys who wish to come into the school. I have floor and air space in the dormitories sufficient to keep 42 boys and I should be glad of authority to keep this number on full grant.\"\n\nSince the mailing of the above letter to me David White has returned so that now there are forty-two boys in regular attendance at the school and I would recommend that authority be given to the Principal to keep that number.\n\nThere was a certain amount of correspondence in connection with the building of a new Institution and I would urge the necessity of doing this as quickly as possible and I would also suggest that if it is the intention of the Department to build this school next year that ten acres of land\nshould be cleared immediately before building operations commence. I would suggest that the best way to do it would be to get a logging donkey and three or four men and have it done by day's work so that the land might be ready for the new building.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW.

A letter was addressed to you yesterday, giving the Department's decision regarding the case of the three girls implicated. You may inform Kitty Whonnock that the Department cannot approve of her return to the school. She was leniently dealt with in that no action was taken to prosecute her for incendiarism.

I can honestly say, I will never do a thing like that again as long as I live. I ought to have told Mr. Holiday at first, that I was sorry for doing such a thing.\n\nI hope I shall be forgiven as I understand now what a dreadful thing I did.\n\nI am\n\nYours Obediently\nKitty Wannock.\nOttawa, October 3, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo, informing the Department of the occurrence of two fires at the Alert Bay Girls' Home, on the evenings of the 7th and 15th ultimo. A communication has also been received from the Principal, detailing the circumstances in connection with both these fires and the action taken to investigate the cause. We note that in both cases the fires were of incendiary origin, as they were set by pupils - three girls having acknowledged that they were the guilty parties.\n\nRegarding the suggestion that consideration be given to the prosecution of these girls and that they be sent to a reform school, I have to say that it is not considered advisable to take this action. We note that they were whipped in the presence of yourself, the staff and the rest of the girls and that Kitty Whonnock was expelled and taken home to her people. If the Principal and yourself are of the opinion that it would be advisable to expel Molly Wilson, this action may be taken. However, it is hoped that in her case, in view of the punishment administered, this will be a sufficient deterrent to prevent a repetition of her serious offence. In the case of Marion Webb, it is thought that no further action is necessary. If it is decided to expel Molly Wilson, this should be done in the presence of the school and she should be formally expelled in disgrace. At the same time, the Principal should state to the pupils that Kitty Whonnock was expelled in disgrace.\n\nWe hope that there will be no repetition, by any of the pupils, of the serious offence of attempting to destroy the building. Please inform the Department what the Principal and yourself decide in the case of Molly Wilson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nALERT BAY, B.

There appears to be air space for only 28 pupils in the two main dormitories in the boys' building. I should be pleased to have a report, giving the interior dimensions of the dormitories and any other rooms that are used for boys' sleeping quarters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Haldimand, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nI beg to advise you that on Monday evening the 14th inst. a fire occurred at the Alert Bay Girls' Home.\n\nIt so happened that I was at the Industrial School which adjoins the Girls' Home overlooking the sewerage proposition and was informed that a fire had occurred at the Girls' Home and I immediately went over and found that the fire had been extinguished.\n\nA week previous another fire had occurred in the same Institution which the ladies of the Institution thought was purely accidental and they were inclined to treat this one as accidental but after thorough examination of the situation I concluded that both fires had been of incendiary origin and I so informed the Principal. The girls were all called into the school room and questioned very closely and finally admissions were made by Kitty Wharnock that she had deliberately started the present fire and Molly Wilson admitted having deliberately started the other one. Associated with Kitty Wharnock was a girl known as Marian Webb who while she did not take any actual part was present when Kitty Wharnock started the fire up in the attic on a pile of clothing which was covered over by sheets.\n\nMiss Dibben, the Matron of the Institution, very fortunately kept her head and used the chemical fire extinguisher directly the fire was discovered and thus avoided any serious loss but a few minutes longer would have resulted in the fire getting into the roof and possibly the whole building being destroyed.\n\nThe three girls in question were\npublicly whipped before the staff, the Indian Agent and the rest of the girls and I immediately expelled Kitty Whonnock and took her home to her people. The other girl's misconduct was really not discovered until the next day and as her parents live at Kingcome Inlet she has not yet been expelled from the school but is being kept separate from the rest of the girls and is practically a prisoner.\n\nIn talking the matter over with the Principal I suggested that possibly the Department would consider the prosecution of these girls in the Criminal Court and have them sent to the reform school for girls which is near the City of Vancouver partly for their own sake that their education maybe continued and partly for the discipline of the school but before taking this step I would like your decision on the matter.\n\nOn being questioned the only excuse that the girls could give was that they felt lonely which being interpreted meant that they wanted to go out and carry on with the boys but were not given the opportunity to do so.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW.

The Department wishes to congratulate these successful students, but I regret that it is not our practice to give a reward in the form of a cheque. I note the Rev. Principal states that a pupil who passed the Entrance last year has not received a cheque that was promised. I am unable to find any authority for such a reward.\n\nWhen successful and promising pupils graduate from an Indian residential school the Department, when funds can be found for the purpose, gives favourable consideration to either a tuition grant for further training or assistance to establish a home.

It is not proposed to effect any general increase, but to prepare new classifications and groups which will be fair to the individual schools.

Mr. Agent Halliday, however, is of the opinion that the food given these growing boys is too meagre. Miss Long, the senior teacher, who is also a registered nurse, said she thought more fats were needed to attain the best results.\"\n\nYou will be good enough to bring this matter to the attention of the Principal with a view to having him arrange for a more balanced diet for the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nReferring to my letter of the 11th of June which contains a report on the food at the Alert Bay Industrial School I would advise you that when the principal received his copy of my report he took exception to one paragraph in it which states that a larger amount of peanut butter was provided for the Girls' Home per capita than for the boys.\n\nThe amount supplied for the boys has been 100 lbs. per quarter for 40 boys while the amount supplied for the Girls' School has been 45 lbs. per quarter for 26 girls both of which would appear to be inadequate.\n\nWith this exception the principal has made no other comment on the report and would you kindly make this correction in the original report.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW. M. Halliday\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\u2014 156-0-1\n\nYour letter of May 20th was duly received but owing to the fact that I was called away for a few days and on my return the Principal was away for a few days I was unable to act upon it until this week. On the 8th inst. I went to the Industrial School and had a long interview with the Principal regarding the food supplies for the school. Mr. Spackman allowed me the free use of his requisitions and while on the whole there is ample food supplied for the boys it was pointed out to Mr. Spackman that many changes could be made that would benefit the boys and which in my opinion should be made commencing with the next quarter.\n\nI find, first, that no butter is allowed for the boys but as a substitute they use peanut butter the average being 100 lbs. a quarter for from 40 to 41 boys. I consider peanut butter a very poor substitute for butter and that this quantity is insufficient. I find also that there is a scarcity in other rich foods and I suggested to Mr. Spackman that he increase the amount of beans used as food to at least three times the quantity which is being used at present.\n\nWith regard to meat the school has been handicapped until recently owing to the fact that in order to buy meat at all economically the week's supply has been bought at one time and there is no proper refrigerator to keep it in and even if there was bringing it up on the boat in small quantities seved up in sacks the meat is tainted before they get it. Mr. Spackman assured me, however, that now there are two cold storage plants handling meat at Alert Bay he has suggested to his Church Committee at Winnipeg that he be allowed to buy the meat locally which would allow more choice as to what they purchase and also allow a little better quality of meat. The quantity for the boys school has been insufficient. Had all the meat been in good order which arrived it would have been much more nearly a sufficient quantity than it has been under the present conditions.\n\nThe boys at the school look healthy and\nlook to be well fed, but during the last year there has been an unusual amount of illness and I talked this matter over with the principal to see if he did not think that it was on account of the not having enough fats. It was pointed out to him that in their native habitat Indians live on more or less oily foods, they use large quantities of fish and use very largely fish oils and also eat a great many of the hair seals which are very fat indeed. I found at the school that there was a very small quantity of fish on the diet list. It must be admitted however that at times it is difficult to get fresh fish, but it would appear from the quantity that would be used there that an arrangement might be made to get a good weekly allowance.\n\nI found also that the allowance of sugar was only 4 lb. a day for the boys in the school and I think that this should at least be doubled. I suggested to the principal that if he would use more beans and would buy mess pork in barrels and cook it with the beans that it would help out materially with the fats and would not increase the cost of their living as they would make up for it in other ways.\n\nI also took up the matter of the diet with the principal so far as the Girls' Home is concerned and I found that a much more liberal allowance had been made for the girls than for the boys. There, as in the boys school, no butter was allowed for the girls but the amount of peanut butter per capita was larger but still insufficient to keep the girls in good growing condition. Also at this institution there was found a scarcity of vegetables as they were limited to what they grow in their garden with the exception of potatoes.\n\nTo my mind, the great difficulty exists in the fact that these schools and their diet are controlled very largely by a committee at Winnipeg who have to deal with a large number of schools and apparently know nothing whatever about climatic conditions and what is best for this particular place, and the principal informs me that he has taken up this matter of the scarcity of fats with them but they have done nothing to remedy it. A copy of this report is being given to the Principal for his guidance and it is to be hoped that steps will be taken to make the school in every way as efficient as it might be.\n\nThe agent has been for two years past pressing the need of a new school building which is as much needed or perhaps more so than a change in the diet at the schools.\n\nWISH/I\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW. M. Halliday\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 28, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Indian Agent Halliday and the Rev. Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School have given much attention of late to the provision of a better balanced diet for the pupils at the institution. I should be grateful if you would give very favourable consideration to any recommendations of the Principal which have to do with the question of food. Mr. Inspector Cairns, the Indian Agent and the staff at the school have looked into the matter carefully and, I believe, are prepared to make some suggestions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. E. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C.

I note that you have taken some steps to remedy the situation and propose to discuss the whole question with the Church authorities at the first opportunity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

It has formed the subject of some correspondence with the Principal, and was also given careful consideration by me at the time of my last visit to this institution. It will, of course, promptly receive the further consideration which you suggest, but there are certain factors which enter into this particular case which may not have been communicated to you, and to which I think it well to direct your attention.\n\n1. In the first place I should like to state that the only items of food about which there has been any question of an inadequate quantity being furnished are butter and sugar. On referring to my report to our Commission, on my visit to this School in August of last year, I find special reference made to these two items. I also find that provision was made for an increase in the quantity of sugar which was to be allowed, and the provision thus made has been carefully adhered to.\n\nThe question of an increase in the supply of butter has also been considered, but owing to the lack of sufficient funds our Society has not been able to sanction the full amount which the School management have requested. They have always furnished, however, the amount fixed by schedule for all of the schools under their control, and this, it was felt, along with the quantities of syrup, peanut butter, etc., provided, was sufficient to meet the school's need.\n2. In the second place, I beg to state that as practically no complaints have been made by any of the other Schools under our Society's control about a shortage of either butter or sugar, our Commission have been puzzled to know why any such should have reached your Department with regard to the Alert Bay School. The only conclusion they have, so far, been able to reach in this matter is that your local representatives namely, Mr. Indian Agent Halliday and Mr. Inspector Cairns have not furnished the Principal of the Alert Bay School with all the support and confidence which they could reasonably be expected to give. In support of this conclusion I may state that Mr. Inspector Cairns before he left the School at the time of his last visit informed the Principal that his report on the food would show that it was \"Good in quality, Sufficient in quantity, Recommend more fats\". On the 8th of June Mr. Indian Agent Halliday, accompanied by his Stenographer, presented himself at the School and stated that he had received orders from your Department to investigate food matters. When leaving the School after making his investigation he took away with him all the food requisitions for the three quarters of this year.\n\nThe Principal having placed the above facts side by side has come to the conclusion that the Inspector must have altered the tenor of his report before despatching the same to your Department, and is at a loss to know why he should have done so. He is of the opinion that this must have been done at the request of the Indian Agent but as no certain proof that such is the case. If the Inspector changed his report at the suggestion of Mr. Indian Agent Halliday who never uttered a complaint to the Principal personally, nor ever visited the School to examine the food for himself, then the conclusion which our Commission have reached that the Principal has not been receiving the support and confidence of your local representatives, appears to me to be well founded, and I hope that you may take the necessary steps to alter this condition of affairs.\n\nI should further like to point out that in Mr. Indian Agent Halliday's report to you - dated June 11th - on his investigation of the food supply at the Alert Bay School, he has made certain statements which do not harmonize with the facts.\n\n1. He states, for instance, with regard to the diet, that he found a much more liberal allowance had been made for the girls at the Girls' Home, than for the boys.\n\n2. He also states that the Principal informed him that he had taken up with the Commission the matter of the scarcity of foods but that the Commission had done nothing to remedy it.\n\nWith regard to the first of these I can assure you that it is not true. With regard to the second the Principal declares that it is an \"absolute exaggeration\".\nI regret Sir, that I have felt it necessary to write at such length, but the importance of the question raised seemed to me to demand the information which this letter will lay before you. When you have read the same I shall be obliged if you will (1) instruct your local representatives to furnish the Principal of this School with all the assistance they could reasonably be expected to render, (2) to refrain from incorporating in their reports statements - which are not accurate, and (3) request Mr. Indian Agent Halliday to return to the Principal the requisitions which he took away. He is at liberty to examine the requisitions and even to make copies of them, but I consider that he exceeded his powers when he removed the same from the custodianship of the Principal.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTRHW/JF\nOttawa, July 22, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of July 10th, with reference to the diet for the pupils at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. I note that your Commission has made an increase in the quantity of sugar allowed but that you have been unable to arrange for more butter or fats.\n\nWith reference to the first paragraph of the second page of your communication, I wish to point out that the Alert Bay School is peculiarly situated and it is possible that more fat should be provided for the Indians of this vicinity.\n\nI note with regret that you consider the Principal has not received the support and confidence of our local representatives. With regard to the points you raise in this connection, I wish to state that Mr. Indian Agent Halliday, three days after he first reported on the food supplied at the Alert Bay School, corrected his statement concerning the different allowances at the Girls' and Boys' Homes. Against our representative does not state \"that the Principal informed him he had taken up with the Commission the matter of the scarcity of foods but that the Commission had done nothing to remedy it.\" The word \"Fats\" is written in place of the word \"foods,\" and your letter, which I am acknowledging, shows that Mr. Halliday's contention is correct.\n\nConcerning your requests, I wish to state that our local representatives have standing orders to assist principals of schools as far as possible. I am asking Mr. Halliday to return the food requisitions to the principal. I might point out that his letter reads in part as follows: \"Mr. Speckman allowed me the free use of his requisitions.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

Principal concerning the diet for the pupils at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. If you have not already done so, please return the food requisitions to Mr. Speckman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have to inform you that the Rev. F. S. Spackman, M.A., Principal of the Alert Bay Schools since June 1923 has been called to England on account of the serious illness of his father and tendered his resignation to our Society, the same to take effect at the end of last month. Mr. Spackman's resignation has been accepted with very deep regret, and I beg to inform you that the Rev. F. Comley, Missionary-in-charge of Alert Bay has been given the position of Acting Principal for the month of December. On January 1st of next year Mr. F. Earl Anfield, who is at present on the staff of St. George's School, Lytton, B.C., will relieve Mr. Comley from any further responsibility in connection with the Schools by taking charge in the capacity of Acting Principal. He will hold this position until an Ordained man has been found to take over the Principalship.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Anfield's qualifications, I beg to submit the following information contained in a letter he had addressed to me on Nov. 1st:-\n\n\"I am 29 years of age, born and educated in England, where I attended the William Ellis College; teacher-trained in London, Eng., and Ontario, and have close on seven years experience in teaching, three of which were as Principal of the Provincial Reformatory, one as Principal of the Fort George Public School, and the remainder here at Lytton. Have been Senior Leader at the Y.M.C.A. Boys' Camp for Vancouver, for the past six years, where I gained an intimate knowledge of boyology outside the schoolroom. Am also experienced in physical culture, and have a working knowledge of medicine and nursing having nursed the boys here through severe epidemics of...\"\nsmallpox, scarlet fever, measles, and other ailments.\n\nAs far as Indian education here is concerned, I have built the school up to Entrance standard, and passed the first children ever to enter High School from Lytton. But I am not too keen on much advanced education for them, and I devote much time to the teaching of practical agriculture and hygiene, which subjects I consider to be fundamentally important for Indians; the first to enable them to compete with the whites and thus make a living; and the second to enable them to live as we have decided they must live.\n\nHealth is all important and I have tried by every means to teach the children here its real value. We have an organized Health Club, with weight charts, etc., and that we have been partly successful is shown by an increase in weight of 1500 lb. among 100 children in the past school year, with another increase of from nothing to 100 qt. of whole milk drunk per day, and the Indian as a class does not like milk as a beverage.\n\nFurther information with regard to Mr. Anfield's ability may be gathered from the following copies of Inspectors Reports:\n\n1. Vancouver, B.C., Dec.2-4.1925., by R.H.Cairns, Esq.,\n   Inspector of Indian Schools,\n   Vancouver, B.C.\n\n\"Modern methods are followed by Mr. Anfield, who is doing very thorough work, and his pupils have made remarkable progress since my last visit.\n\nThe Senior classes have made wonderful progress in Arith. and Geography. Mr. Anfield is a very capable teacher and gets the hearty co-operation of his pupils.\n\nBoth boys and girls are practising calisthenics and deep-breathing. The work along this line is excellent. The pupils play basketball under the training of Mr. Anfield.\"\n\n2. Vancouver, B.C., May, 1925, by R.H.Cairns, Esq.,\n   Inspector of Indian Schools,\n   Vancouver, B.C.\n\n\"Mr. Anfield is an excellent teacher. He is preparing one Indian boy for Entrance Exam., and states that he will have a good class next year.\"\n\nP.S. This pupil passed his Entrance and is now in High School.\n\n3. Prince George, B.C., April, 1923, by G.H.Gower, Esq.,\n   Inspector of Schools,\n   Prince George, B.C.\n\n\"Mr. Anfield is doing effective work in this school. He has a strong hold on his pupils and there is every evidence that...\"\nthey are responding. Orderliness marks the work of the room.\"\n\n4. New Westminster, B.C., May 3rd, 1922, by Arthur Anstey, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\n\"The Principal appears well adapted to the special type of work carried on here (Provincial Reformatory); control is firm, and the pupils work with interest and effort. The class methods are good and organization good. Co-operative methods and efforts by the pupils themselves need to be emphasized, with plenty of class teaching and careful training in oral expression. The written exercises are neatly and carefully done; and the drawing and colour work is good. The general attitude of the pupils towards school work is better than might be expected.\"\n\nOwing to the presence of an Ordained Missionary in the town of Alert Bay our Society does not consider it absolutely necessary to make an immediate appointment of an Ordained man to the Principalship of these Schools. They have decided, however, not to depart from their rule to give the position of Principal to none but men in full Orders, and when a suitable man has been found Mr. Anfield will be asked to serve under him in the capacity of Vice-Principal or given an appointment at another School.\n\nTrusting that the above arrangement may be satisfactory to your Department,\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nSir:\u2014\n\nWith further reference to past correspondence, more particularly your letter of Sept. 19th, in answer to mine of the 8th, regarding increased pupilage for the Alert Bay Residential Schools, I would advise you that I took this matter up with the principal, and he tells me that owing to the fact that the two pupils for whom the extra accommodation was asked were refused admission by the Medical Officer, that the increased pupilage will not now be needed.\n\nHowever, I may say that the air space in the dormitories has not been enlarged any since my letter of October 16th, 1924.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Please let me have a report showing the interior dimensions of the dormitories and any other rooms that are used for sleeping quarters both in the Girls' and Boys' Schools. On receipt of this information, the application for increased pupilage will receive further consideration.\n\nIn connection with the Boys' School, I might refer you to your letter of October 4th, 1924. You will note from official letter of October 16th, 1924, that it was found that, at that time, there was only sufficient air space in the dormitories of the Boys' School for 41 pupils.

In that year the Rev. A.J. Hall, C.M.S. Missionary, arrived at Fort Rupert and started the first mission. A year later he moved his headquarters to Alert Bay on Cormorant Island, off the north-east coast of Vancouver Island, where in the face of tremendous odds, the Good Word found fertile soil in the hearts of many.\n\nSix years later the first Boys' School was opened by Mr. A.W. Corker, who was also on the C.M.S. Staff. The School commenced with seven boys, but within a few days all but one had run away. In spite of this discouragement and in the face of terrific opposition on the part of the Indians as a whole, the School steadily grew and prospered. The school reserve consisted of heavily timbered land, and technical education was at first of necessity confined to land clearing and carpentry. Mr. and Mrs. Corker were the only members of the staff for some time, and for many years Mr. Corker also did all the medical work of the district. It was in 1867 that the first Trades Instructor was appointed in the person of Mr. W.M. Halliday, now our respected Indian Agent for the district.\n\nIn 1905 it was found necessary to enlarge the School. The roof was therefore raised and a new dormitory added. The capacity is now for 40 boys, though 43 are in residence at present.\n\nThe Girls' Home was opened as a Diocesan School in July, 1912, with the Misses Nixon and Neville in charge. This was an independent school with a capacity for 35 girls.\n\nIn 1913, Mr. Corker, who had been ordained in the meantime, took charge of the Mission at Alert Bay. For nearly seven years he controlled both schools and parish. In 1920, however, he resigned his position as Principal and confined himself entirely to the Parish of Christchurch. Mr. V.S. Lord was appointed Principal, and Mr. J. H. was followed by Rev. F.S. Spackman, who arrived from the Diocese of Saskatchewan to take charge. He remained until June 1927, when the present incumbent arrived. In 1922 the Schools were combined under the management and control of the M.S.O.C.\n\nDuring these long years the names of 368 boys and 156 girls have appeared on the school registers of admission. What a tribute to those workers of early days who laid a foundation sure and strong on which could be raised such a work for God. Up and down this coast, from Cape Mudge in the South to the Naas River in the North are scattered the graduates of these schools. They settled down in their villages, in many cases, built good homes for themselves, and in many cases, we have these ex-pupils' children in residence in the Schools today.\nAnd what of the results - Considering the difficulties to be faced; the sweeping change of environment that school life must mean for the Indian child; the language handicap; the tremendous urge of native customs - we can indeed humbly thank God for a great work well done, and we can thank Him too for the lives of consecrated and devoted workers who pioneered the way. We reap where they have sown, and they sowed thickly of the Love of God to men.\n\nThe work goes on in the Strength and with the Help of the Master. Though not faced with the dangers of the early days, yet there are difficulties yet; and we need all the help from above; all the prayers of the faithful; and sympathy and understanding, to carry on Christ's work in the way that He would have it go.\n\nOur buildings, worn with time and wracked with storm are fast approaching their latter days; and it is our prayer and hope that this year will see the erection of a building with large capacity, that will stand as a living witness to the zeal of the Church, a monument to the pioneers of days gone by, and a tribute of co-operation and interest on the part of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nBoth spiritually, educationally and morally these schools have abundantly justified their existence, and with the blessing and guidance of God, much can be hoped for in the future.\n\nLet us take this opportunity of thanking those who made the printing of this magazine possible. The Diocesan Board of the Columbia W.A., in donating a mimeograph to the Schools have performed a work, the value of which will increase as time goes on. Keeping in touch with ex-pupils; contacts with the Sunday Schools and Churches that are actively interested in our work; reports on progress to parents of children in the schools; scripture study project work; hymn sheets, and many other uses too numerous to mention, are all made possible by this splendid gift of fellow workers in a common cause - the advancement of Christ's Kingdom on earth.\n\nWe do not know just how often it will be possible to publish this little magazine. It is hoped to get it out quarterly at any rate, and later, if results justify, to make it monthly. In order to defray the cost of paper, postage and ink, we are making a charge of ten cents, and we would ask who like our effort to send us this amount when next they write. Suggestions and comment whereby we can improve will be welcomed. Please address all letters to the Principal, Residential Schools, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nWith this school magazine we are incorporating a section dealing with other Mission activities in Alert Bay and district; including the work of the Columbia Coast Mission with its hospitals and mission ships; and the outlying stations of Village Island and Kingcome. Material for our next issue will be gladly received. We wish to urge on those engaged in Missionary effort to help us with this work. Our magazine will cover a wide field, and the Churches are keen and anxious to hear of the work.\nA Page of Interest for all Our Ex-Pupils\n\nMy dear Friends:\u2014\n\nTo all our ex-pupils, whether you left last year, ten, twenty or more years ago, do we extend greetings and best wishes with the hope that in this magazine of ours you will find much to help and encourage you in the battle of life; that in its pages you may find news of fellow pupils of your day in school; and that you may be linked up with us in our work for the present generation now in the Schools.\n\nToo often alas, is it said, that after the Schools have trained and educated our Indian children, they leave and have no further link with the place that has been home to them, often for many years; the place in which they have been taught to know and love Jesus Christ to lead a Christian and a godly life; and then return to their homes and villages to lead out and live out those lives in Service to the Master and their fellow men.\n\nDear Friends, do not think that school days are over. Do not think that you are no longer linked with us\u2014for you are still pupils\u2014older perhaps, but yet in training. Here the ground work was laid; the foundation put in\u2014though remember that the strength and stability of that foundation depend greatly on the application paid to your teaching whilst in school\u2014and then you left the small school of training for the bigger school of life. It was the Master Himself who said, \"Go ye into all the World, and preach the Gospel to every Creature.\"\u2014So you too were sent forth equipped with all the armour we could give you\u2014to preach the Gospel\u2014to show it to others by your lives\u2014to live out in the world the teaching of Christ received here in the Schools. Just a continuation of School, isn't it? With the same help waiting there as helped you here\u2014the Spirit of Christ still seeking to help and guide you if you will let Him. Have you?\n\nWe know by record and report that many have; that numbers have gone forth from here and have led lives that are creditable both to themselves and their School\u2014for we see it right here in the children; sons and daughters of old pupils of the Schools\u2014God bless you for your lives so freely given to His service, for your children shall rise up and call you blessed. May you go on from strength to strength, sure in His trust and loyal to His cause.\n\nAnd to those of you who feel that you have not got all out of school that you hoped for; to those who found the going rough and the way hard; and to those few, if any there be, who thought it better and easier to paddle their own canoes, to go their own way\u2014to you all we have a message; remember, Christ in His love is always there to help\u2014He longs for you to try and walk His way\u2014the path of lowly Service\u2014not always the easiest or the best paying from the worldly point of view, but certainly the best from every other. My friend, your School and all it stands for, is still willing to be your guard and guide\u2014it watches patiently, prays daily that in God's good time you will turn to Him as you leaned on Him here in school\u2014that you will see that His way is best\u2014and that you will go forward for Him and with Him.\nWhen on earth, Christ told us not to hide our light under a bushel, but to let it. So shine before men that they may see your good works.\" Like St. Paul, \"Let us not be weary in well doing, but let us run with patience the race that is set before us.\" Let us do some active work for the Master. There is a crying need among our Indian people for more Missionaries. Are you doing your share - you who were sent forth to preach the gospel? Every boy and girl sent forth from these Schools is a Missionary, whether they will it or not, either for good or for evil.\n\nGo to work, my friends, and help the cause of Christ. Your people need you, and they would sooner hear you than hear us. Are you now teaching the Word of God; taking your share and part in Church life seeking new sheep for His flock; and taking every opportunity of helping His work to progress? If you are not, may we not urge you now to at once make a start.\n\nAt this coming Easter tide, let us consecrate ourselves anew to the Risen Christ, to go forward in His strength to do the task that He has set for our accomplishment, trusting in His help and relying on His word, \"Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the World.\"\n\nVery sincerely your friend,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nNotes on Ex-Pupils of the Schools.\n\nWe were glad to have a visit last summer from Paul Mercer, a graduate of 1902. Paul's two boys are both in the school now and doing well. It is a pleasure for us to hear that Paul is a strong worker for the Church in his village on the Naas River.\n\nGeorge Luther, one of the earliest of our graduates still preaches at the teacher's desk in the Alert Bay Indian Day School. He also both preaches and teaches in Christ's Church and is a power for good among his people.\n\nNellie Hamilton, now Mrs. Reggie Cook, is the proud mother of a fine baby boy. The little man was baptised in our Church recently.\n\nWe regret to say that Caleb Starr of Bella Bella, is confined to the Hospital there with lung trouble. We trust and pray that he will be soon restored to health and strength again. He writes often to the school, and we wish that some of his old friends would write to him.\n\nElizabeth Mason, a graduate of 1927, was the winner of a medal from the Department of Indian Affairs for her essay on Confederation. We regret that we have not a copy of this essay for publication.\n\nSimon Brown, that smiling youth from Klemtu, continues to make good progress in health, and we hope that he will soon be his old self again.\n\nWe would like news items from ex-pupils for our next issue. Send them along.\nSCHOOL NOTES OF INTEREST TO ALL\n\nGreat advances are shortly to be made in land clearing when, through the kindness of the Indian Department, nearly thirty acres are to be brought under cultivation for pasture and farming land. This land will be most welcome in view of the possibility of an early increase in pupilage for the long looked for new school.\n\nOur cows are all under regular test for T.B., and we are glad to say that Drs. Frank and Thompson found the animals all clear of the dreaded disease.\n\nManual Training. This most essential subject for boys was re-started in the spring of 1927, and though handicapped a little by lack of sufficient tools, the boys are making remarkable progress. They have turned out paddles, stop-ladders, wheelbarrows, and many other useful things, as well as making all the bench equipment for their shop. We are going to exhibit this fall at the Exhibitions, and try and wrest some of the honours from our good friends at Coquilletza. We hope to start basketry for the younger boys and girls shortly.\n\nSport.\n\nThanks to our good friend, Dr. Mandy, we have two complete sets of football uniforms, one red and white, and the other blue and brown. The boys enjoy football very much and we usually have at least two organized games each week. Contrary to usual practice, these youngsters play football as a summer game instead of during the winter, and will go through a gruelling game on the hottest days in summer. The girls are now taking up basketball, whilst the boys enjoy volleyball.\n\nCadet.\n\nFor the second year in succession the Cadets of this School won the I.O.D.E. Challenge Shield for the best Indian Cadet Corps in the Province. The boys are very keen on their work and thoroughly enjoy it. Great credit is due to Rev. F.S. Spackman, who in his time here as Principal, made such success possible.\n\nThe Senior Rifle team is now competing in the Dom. of Canada Miniature Range Championship. In the first month of the shoot, they averaged 92% and we hope to do better yet before we are finished. Peter Nensloos won a special medal for shooting last year. Well done.\n\nThe boys go to the Parish Hall for Physical Training every Tuesday evening. They play organized games, and are now taking up Badminton. Some of them show promise of becoming excellent players.\n\nThe Girls go to drill every Monday afternoon with their teacher, Mrs. I.D. Woods. They also enjoy it immensely.\n\nW.A. Activities. We are proud of the fact that all our Girls are in the W.A., the senior ones belonging to the Girls' Br., and the Juniors to the Little Helpers. Wonderful, though secret plans are being made now for the Bazaar already, and needles ply busily through the meetings.\nSchool Notes. (Cont'd)\n\nSchoolrooms. Both the Girls' and Boys' schools won honours at the Provincial Exhibitions last fall, when they took first prizes in art and writing. Part of this collection was composed of a remarkable set of Indian Designs, which attracted very favourable attention.\n\nThe boys are now rejoicing in a fine new schoolroom built by the Indian Department last summer. The building is really the Manual Training shop for the new school, but will be used as a classroom until we move into our new home.\n\nWe re-print herewith the prize essay of Peter Neasloss, which won a medal and a special honourable mention from Ottawa in connection with the subject of \"Confederation\". Let us also take this opportunity of extending our congratulations to Minnie Wesley and her school at Coquileetza, for securing the first place in the Dominion.\n\n\"CONFEDERATION\"...Peter Neasloss, Grade VII.\n\nYears before Confederation took place, Lord Durham in his famous report, had advised a union to unite the British North American Provinces under one main Governor.\n\nUpper and Lower Canada had their own Prime Ministers, one for the British and one for the French; who helped to guide each other's part. This the people did not like. Although one part had more population than the other, they only allowed equal representation. The people thought they should have representation by population, and so became dissatisfied. The country came to a state of deadlock.\n\nThe great men such as Sir. John A. Macdonald and George Brown of Upper Canada, Sir. George E. Cartier of Lower Canada, Sir. Leonard Tilley of New Brunswick, and Sir. Charles Tupper of Nova Scotia and several great men met at Charlottetown in September, 1864 to discuss what was best to be done for their country; the following month, thirty-three delegates together with E.P. Tache as their Chairman met again at Quebec; here they drew a bill and decided on a federal union. The conference had lasted for eighteen days, a result of seventy-two resolutions.\n\nIn 1866 there was trouble on the American border which made the people realise that they must have a Union.\n\nIn 1866 thirty-three delegates now known as the Fathers of Confederation went to London, England, with Macdonald as their leader.\n\nOn March 29th, 1867, the Bill was stamped and signed by Queen Victoria which is now known as the British North America Act, which formed Upper Canada, (now Quebec,) and Lower Canada, (now Ontario), New Brunswick and Nova Scotia into the Dominion of Canada.\nThe Imperial Government appoints the Governor General as the representative of the Sovereign.\n\nSince Confederation each Province is allowed to have representation by population. Quebec is used as a base, who is allowed sixty-five representatives in the House of Commons.\n\nLord Monck was the first Governor General of the Dominion of Canada, and John A. Macdonald was Prime Minister. Today Lord Willingdon is the Governor General and Mackenzie-King is the Prime Minister.\n\nQueen Victoria chose Ottawa to be the seat of government. On May 22nd, the Queen proclaimed July 1st to be set aside each year to be known as Dominion Day, to be kept for a great national holiday. This July 1st will be the Diamond Jubilee of Confederation.\n\nBy 1870 Manitoba, in 1871 British Columbia, and in 1873 Prince Edward Island had joined the Dominion. In 1905 Alberta and Saskatchewan formed a part of the Union. Newfoundland alone stayed out.\n\nNow Canada is a great Dominion stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, and has made great progress ever since. She has a great railroad system from the Atlantic to the Pacific. She has wonderful educational systems. She is one of the leading countries of the world in her wheat growing, lumbering, mining and fishing.\n\nEssay... \"My Desk\"... Frank Wilson, Grade 11, Sr.\n\nMy desk is made of wood which used to be a tree. A man cut me down and cut my branches off. I was so long that the man carved me in half. He then took me to the big mill, where the people sawed me into pieces, which they called lumber. After that, they made me smooth and I was put into a big pile to dry. A man then bought me and took me home and cut me into smaller pieces to form a nice little desk. Then when I was a desk, they polished me to make me look good so that somebody would buy me, and now I am in the Indian Residential School having a fine time with the boys who write on me.\n\n---\n\nIN MEMORIAM\n\nIt was with real sorrow that we at the Schools learned of the passing of Dr. J.C. Spencer of Bella Bella B.C., for many years United Church missionary at that centre. Both to his people, Indian and white, his family, and his Church do we extend our deepest sympathy. Dr. Spencer did a splendid work for the Indian people of the coast, and it is our prayer that God will raise up another great man to take his place among the Indian people at Bella Bella. For the work to go on to bigger and even greater things would be the greatest memorial one could give the late Missionary, and the one that he would choose.\nWe were pleased to receive a visit from the Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C., Dr. Westgate, with his genial smile and happy way won the hearts of all the children. Whilst here, Dr. Westgate gave an illustrated lecture on his Missionary experiences in Africa during the war. Very kindly, too, he showed and explained a set of M.S.C.C. slides to the Girls of the School, they unfortunately being down with epidemic measles at the time.\n\nOther visitors during the year included Mr. R.H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, Mrs. Ferraboe, Dominion President of the N.A., Miss Dalton, on her way to India, Archdeacon Heathcote of Vancouver, Rev. and Mrs. Redman of the United Church, Rev. Robt. Connell of Victoria, and a number of local friends interested in our work.\n\nHis Lordship, the Bishop of Columbia, administered the rite of Confirmation to a class of boys and girls from the Schools last year. Those confirmed were Annie Williams, Gertie Hinchliffe, Rhoda Cook, Pauline Adams and Alice Johnson in the Girls' Home, and Jack Scow, Robert Mountain, Ernest Mason, Simon Hopkins, Mark White and Billy Joseph in the Boys' School.\n\nOur School dining rooms now look very nice with their snowy white tablecloths and china dishes and you would hardly believe how few dishes the children break or how few bad spills occur on the cloths. We feel that they appreciate our efforts to make school life as 'homey' as possible.\n\nIt is often stated that institutional life at its best is not a very good substitute for the home (however humble it might be) in the upbringing of a child. We must bear in mind however that the Indian is a gregarious type and seems to take kindly to the mass activities of a large school\u2014a relic perhaps of the community house custom or bygone days\u2014Perhaps in the not far distant future the Church and the Indian Department might design a school on the 'cottage plan' at one of the new centres. It would be an experiment well worth watching from the viewpoint of modern child welfare ideas.\n\nAn unnamed friend donated a beautiful silver shield to be competed for monthly, the winner to be the best all round boy in the School. Keen competition and strenuous effort has won the Shield for the following boys this school year: August, Ernest Mason; September, Jack Scow; October, Peter Kendall; November, Gordon Reid; December, Ernest Mason; January, Fred Cook; February, Peter Kendall and Ernest Logan (tie). The high man for the year will keep the Shield and take it home with him.\n\nAmong our ex-pupils who signed the marriage register last year we find the following names: Alvin Alfred, Ethel Annan, Willie Dawson and Hudson West. We trust that in their married life these young people may find much happiness.\n\nMark White, graduate of 1927, is now working in his father's store at Bella Bella. We wish him all kinds of luck in his new field, but we miss his cheery face around the School and Church where he performed such happy service.\n\nSam Campbell and Peter Mason, both ex-pupils, have visited us lately.\nJust a word to the Churches and Sunday Schools who are adopting boys and girls of these Schools.\n\nMy Dear Friends:\n\nThe great thing in this \"Adoption Scheme\" of our Missionary Society from the point of view of the Schools is the linking up of the work in our Indian Missions with that carried on in the Parish life of the country. We like to feel that children all over the country are thinking of us, praying for our little ones, and helping to make the work of these Schools possible through generous financial assistance. We have ever so many children on our lists now, although there is room for more, and I think it would be so nice if some of you would try and influence others to take on the active support of some Indian child from this centre. We appeal especially to the Parishes of the big cities where often little is known of the Indian of this day, and where often the children have never seen an Indian child at all. It will help you to understand them by having one to care for, and to pray for; for we do need to know and understand our Indian people. The potentiality for good in them is tremendous, but it needs sympathetic understanding and careful guidance, so that in time, blessed by God and supported by His people, the Indian people of Canada may become a power for good in this great Canada of ours.\n\nAmong recent children adopted we find the names of George Alfred, who is being assigned to Christ Church, Amherstburg, Ontario; Kenneth Henderson by St. Peter's, North Augusta, Ontario; James Puglas by St. John's S.S., Stamford Ont.; William Rufus by the S.S. of St. Paul's Garrison Church, Esquimalt, B.C.; Christopher Clayton to St. Peter's S.S., Hamilton, Ontario; James Howell to All Saint's S.S., Mission City, B.C.; Jack Hanuse to St. Paul's S.S., Dauphin, Manitoba; Roy Nelson to St. Peter's, Hamilton, Ont.; Roger Mercer and Frank Wilson to Mrs. Macallister, 74 Beechwood Ave., Hamilton, Ontario; Calvin Rufus to the Boys' Missionary Clubs, Brandon, Manitoba; Roy Watts to the A.Y.P.A. of St. Paul's Church, Wingham, Ontario; Jack Scow to the S.S. Mission of St. Catharines, Ontario; Eva Adams to St. Stephens Jr. W.A., Calgary; Fanny Rufus to St. George's S.S., Ottawa, Ontario, and Mary Jane Alfred to the W.A., Milverton, Ontario.\n\nOthers, such as Alice Sewood, Dorothy Azak, Patsy Wilson, John Hanchitt, Harry Joseph, are still being faithfully supported by their respective Churches, and we owe them a great debt of gratitude for their unfailing interest in our children. All the children are well and happy, and beginning to get a little interest in the approach of the fishing season which brings to them their annual holiday season, when their home becomes either a fish boat in the case of the boys, or a cannery in that of the girls. We would like all our friends to pray especially for our children during these holiday months, as it is a time of great danger for them, and when if they are not strong in faith and loyal to Christ, they can easily fall into temptation and sin.\n\nIn closing, let me assure you all of how glad we are to get word from you. Do write to the children you 'adopt', wont you? They just love to get letters, and will answer if they can.\n\nFaithfully and sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6426, file 875-1, part 3)\nThe Beaver........Annie Seevitt, Grade Jr. 4.\n\nI am a little beaver and I am not lazy like some other animals. I build my house myself, nobody helps me. I cut trees down every autumn, as I have to cut trees down for the winter time. When I get the tree down, I run away to my house for a while because I am afraid the wildcat might eat me. Then I go back to work again and cut the tree into short pieces. I pull them into my dam and if there are any holes in it I put some sticks and stones and mud on it. I make a tunnel through it for the pantry so that we do not have to swim when I go out to work.\n\nI have a little son and he thought there was no work to do and one night he came with me to the forest and cut a tree down. When it was nearly done, I told him to run away to our house to hide himself. Then we went back to work and we took it home.\n\nWhen my son and I were working we saw a man. I told him to hide himself and the man tried to shoot me but didn't get me. I went to hide myself as I was badly wounded in the hind legs. I told my son to be very careful for the men will shoot him. One day he ran away from me and he never came back. I think he had some friends but where he had gone I did not know. Now I have a little daughter.\n\nSt. Valentine.............George Alfred, Grade V.\n\nSt. Valentine was a Bishop. The people liked him very much because he was so kind to everybody. He fed the hungry, clothed the poor, and did everything he could that was good. He soon became very old and could not go about to teach the people about God, but this did not stop his good work for he sent messages to his friends. The people who did not like St. Valentine got very angry with him, and put him in chains and threw him in prison because they were jealous of him for his goodness. In the prison he was very much ill-treated and there he died. When the people became good, they felt very sorry for what they had done so they said, \"Weep for our wickedness, and we will keep in memory his birthday,\" and we have been keeping it ever since.\n\nWe are indebted to Mr. R.H. Connell, our Farm Instructor, for the front cover design of this magazine. It depicts one of the famous \"Thunderbirds\" of the Kwakwakwala Indians. We trust that they will not mind our adopting it to our School, so intimately associated with them for so many years.\n\nThe back cover design is the work of Pauline Adams, Grade V, and we feel that it is a very creditable piece of work. The original is even better than the mimeographed copies, as it is not possible to bring out all the light and shade. The boys will do the design for the next issue.\n\nOur motto, \"Omnia ad Dei Gloriam\" means \"Everything for the Glory of God\" - May we all make it our own and endeavour to live up to such a standard that our Schools may be worthy to boast of such a motto.\nOUR PICTURE GALLERY.\n\nPeople seen at the Boys' School.\n\nGeorgie, our hog man.\n\n\"Skeezix\", Big Chief of the Woredash.\n\nClayton Mack, head barn boy returns with the milk.\n\nPatsy Wilson, in charge of repair squad.\n\nMr. Claude Morven of Aiyansh looks rather worried about his helpers in the Kitchen.\nTHE ALERT BAY MISSION\n\nA Message from the Rector\n\n\"Come ye yourselves apart, and rest awhile.\" One day in the hurry and bustle of life our Lord addressed these words to His followers. The reason we are told was \"That there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure.\" One of the complaints of modern life is that there is so much coming and going - so much rush and turmoil - that we have no leisure to think.\n\nMany a modern man and woman longs for a desert place to rest awhile. What was to be the occupation of the disciples during this time of rest? I am sure that the correct answer is hard work. Probably the hardest task we do, is when we really concentrate on a certain subject with all the faculties God has given us. If you think it is not hard work, try it. We flit from one subject to another, because it is so easy to obtain a smattering of things today. The Radio, the modern newspaper and popular magazine enable us to do this without much hard work, for they give popular knowledge in a predigested form, and we are all so busy that we prefer it that way, rather than do any research work ourselves. We want enough knowledge to pass examinations of our fellow men and women, or the school Inspector.\n\nTo give two practical examples of what I mean - I was speaking the other day to an old Indian pupil and he gave me a long treatise on the Atwater-Kent system of ignition which he had recently installed on his boat engine. He described some of the advantages of the new system over the old, and I realised that it was time I endeavoured to learn something about this system of ignition in order that I might pass the examination he was giving me. The other example concerns the children who are growing up in Alert Bay. I visited a school recently during a lesson on Canadian History, and I was watching the faces of the scholars to try and discover who and how many were really interested. If they read this and I misjudge them, I apologise. But judging from the interest displayed in the faces, only a very few were really interested. Why not?\n\nThe great names in Canadian History were just names, no more. The boys and girls were not thrilled with the experiences of the early pioneers in this land. They were willing to try and learn enough to pass examinations. History to them was like the Atwater-Kent system of ignition to me. Yet we study history and especially the history of our own land, that we may be thrilled and try in our small way to be worthy of such an inheritance.\n\nHow can we who aim to be teachers really make a subject live, so that we rouse attention and interest? The men and women Jesus called to Him, in order that they might be first disciples and afterward teachers are called to \"Come apart, and rest awhile\"; to concentrate and learn. The greatest Teacher realised that men and women are very much like \"wells\"; in a time of drought, they soon go dry - Unless there is a spring in the well in August our water supply upon variations. A well can only give out according to what goes in. Men and women have to be constantly giving out soon become \"well without water.\"\n\nJesus told the woman of Samaria that He was the source of Living Water, and \"Whoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\" The woman naturally answered, \"Sir, give me this water.\" When Jesus called the disciples to \"Come apart in a desert place\" He saw there was a danger\nof the wells in the disciples becoming dry. They were giving out day by day in service to mankind, and many of their nights were spent on the Lake providing food for themselves and families. Hence, Jesus said, \"Come and replenish, so that you may have more to give. If I am asked to give the meaning of Lent, I do not know a better answer than that; it is a time for parents to come apart so they may have something more than 'bread alone' to give to their children. It is a time of replenishment for all of us, so that we may have something worthwhile to give to those who are spiritually hungry and thirsty.\n\nJesus, before He began His earthly ministry, spent a certain time in a desert place apart. St. Paul tells us his desert was Arabia where he was not taught by men but by God; he learned \"The Master's Secret\". Then, if you read the soul stirring message of Amos in the Old Testament, you will realise that he spent a long time as a herdsman and cultivating fruit before he was able to say, \"Lo, He that formed the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto men His thoughts, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, the Lord, the God of Hosts is His Name.\"\n\nFurthermore the great Psalms that haunt us were written in the desert of captivity. St. John banished to the island of Patmos, sent out his message, not only to the Churches in Asia Minor, but to the Churches in the world today.\n\n\"Come apart\" - It may be the hardest work you have ever done. I am sure the first disciples found it harder than toiling all night, dragging a heavy net and catching nothing; but they gained a rich experience that they share with us today. They were no longer wells without water, but men who had seen God face to face.\n\nDon't be satisfied with just enough knowledge, and Bible knowledge too, to pass examinations but endeavour so to know a book, or some character that will reveal to you \"The Master's Secret\" - Then in the dark days of life, as well as in the bright ones, you will not only have enough \"Living Water\" for your own personal needs, but directed by the Master, minister to the thirst of others.\n\nDuring Holy Week the Archdeacon of Columbia will be with us to conduct a Lenten Mission. There will be a daily celebration of the Holy Communion, a special teaching service for women in the afternoons, and services every evening at 7:30 p.m. in the Church. The Mission will commence on Palm Sunday, and end on Good Friday.\n\nWill you make an effort to \"Come apart\" for these services, and pray for God's Blessing on the Mission?\n\nYour friend and Rector,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChurch Notes.\n\nOur delegates to the Diocesan Synod this year were the Rector and Mr. F.W. Kenmure. They brought back a report of increased zeal and effort on the part of the Diocese in the work of the Master, and also the interesting news that Albert Bay shines forth as a beacon light in the active support of Missions.\n\nThis is our Jubilee Year, and already the long looked for improvements in God's House are under way, and it is hoped that much more will be done before the Bishop arrives for the Jubilee Festival.\n\"The Kwawkewlth Agency\"....W.M.Halliday.\n\nThere is an old saying that, \"An old man talks of the past, a young man talks of the present, and the dreamer or the fool talks of the future.\"\n\nI have been asked by the Principal of the Alert Bay Residential Schools, to write a short article on the Indians and the work of the Kwawkewlth Agency; and to write this article fairly it must partake of all three of the above mentioned heads. It is necessary to speak of the past and the present, and in justice to the Department of Indian Affairs and those associated with them in their work, also to go into the realms of the future.\n\nIt has been my lot to have been intimately associated with the Indian and Indian work for the past thirty-four years, over six years of which was as Trade Instructor in the Industrial School, and twenty-two years as Indian Agent, in which time many changes have taken place in the Indians, as well as much development of the country round about.\n\nThe Kwawkewlth Indian Agency embraces about Thirty Thousand square miles, and while there are many portions of this agency where there are no Indians living, still they have isolated reserves scattered here and there throughout the whole district. Thirty-four years ago when I first came to this part of the country I lived at Kingcome for about three years, where the nearest neighbours were the Tsawataineuk Indians, about two hundred and thirty in number. This band is composed of four subdivisions, the Tsawataineuk, Ahnhamun, Kwa'wakwainueuk, and Klwikswataneuk Bands. When I first came amongst them they had a very great distrust of the white man, and the white man's ways, and were at all desirous of having white neighbours live amongst them. This at first led to considerable friction but gradually they themselves recognised that the advent of the white man was for their betterment. During the summer months they wore very little clothing and lived very uncivilized lives. Today their men and women are well dressed in the very best of modern clothing, silk stockings for the ladies, patent leather shoes for the young men, and everything else to correspond with it. Their houses at that time were large barn-like structures, made entirely of split cedar boards and all the cracks left open, and anything but comfortable. Today they have very comfortable cottages, linoleum on the floors, gramophones, pianos and all the modern appliances, and can talk very intelligently on many subjects.\n\nThe Nimpkish Indians living at Alert Bay possibly have had better opportunity than any of the other Indians, as Alert Bay has not only been the educational centre for the Agency, but has also been the religious centre, as the Anglican Church have their headquarters here, and the schools are under their active management. Formerly the village of Alert Bay was principally noted for its totem poles, but many of these have been removed, some in Stanley Park in Vancouver, one I believe in Toronto, and others scattered here and there throughout Canada. Newer ones have taken their places, but not in the village itself, but are now being erected as monuments in the cemetery.\n\nIn the Southern part of the Agency, at Cape Mudge, they have an entirely modern village. Formerly the Cape Mudge (or Wewaikai Indians as they should properly be called) were a very dissolute lot, and bore a very bad reputation. Very largely through the instrument-\nation of one man, Chief Billy Assu, this village is now absolutely modern, and they have a very fine type of young men. They have a water system, and electric light plant, own two donkey engines, and the greater number of them own their own seine boats or other fishing boats and are practically independent.\n\nThe Wewaiaikum or Campbell River Indians have been a little slower in development, and unfortunately have been placed too near the scene of their great temptation - strong drink, but this is gradually being overcome, and they are now living in comfortable modern homes, each with a garden around it and several of them owning their own automobiles, and all of them owning their own fishing gear.\n\nOn the west coast of Vancouver Island the Kostemo and the Quatsino Indians are not very progressive. About twenty-five years ago their young men used to go out on the sealing schooners. Two schooners were lost with all hands, which left the tribe in rather a bad way, the result being that their women married and drifted away to other places, and they have very sadly decreased in numbers. The same may be said of the Newitti Band living at Hope Island where they have a very large reserve. The Nakwakto Indians living at Blunden Harbour and the Kwashola living at Smith Inlet, have not the same advancement as those living nearer by. The village of the Manalilikulla Band at Village Island is exceptionally well kept, while the two villages of Tsataisnukomi or New Vancouver, the home of the Tanakteuk Indians and Karlukwees, the home of the Kinawtsis and Matilpi Bands are beautifully situated and fairly well looked after. During the past ten years the old houses have nearly all been removed and modern cottages built in their place.\n\nIn the advancement that has taken place a great deal of credit is due to Missionary enterprise. Where there has been advancement the Missionaries have first taken hold and by showing them and by teaching them, advancement has followed. In the villages already mentioned where progress has been slow there has been little if any missionary work done. There has always been a very strong friendly feeling of co-operation between the various Missionary Societies and the Department of Indian Affairs, and the Department has always been very generous with financial help.\n\nIt has been decided that in the very near future, a large and suitable building will be provided, with a capacity of approximately two hundred pupils. The School will be on the Industrial School site at Alert Bay, and will be absolutely modern and up-to-date. A contract is now being arranged for to largely increase the acreage under cultivation.\n\nThe Department is contributing liberally towards hospital and medical attention, with the result that the physical manhood and womanhood of the Indians will be largely improved, and I can feel a great deal of satisfaction that our labours among them have not been in vain. There is still room for improvement, but to quote an old saying, \"The largest room in the world is the room for improvement,\" and this saying pertains to the whites as well as to the Indians.\nALERT INDIANS PUBLISH PAPER\n\nALERT BAY, March 30.\u2014There has been much activity inside and out at the Indian Industrial schools here. A large piece of land had been cleared this year, and a contract for the clearing of a further twenty-eight acres has been given. A school magazine has just been organized. It is called \"The Thunderbird.\" A splendidly drawn design by one of the boys is on the front cover, and the back has a conventional design by a girl from one of the girls' classes. Articles by Rev. F. Conolly and Mr. Antfield, the principal, and some contributed by the boys themselves, together with events of the past year, form some of the contents of this number. It is proposed to publish the magazine three times a year. The mimeograph forwarded by the Columbia W. A. has proved most useful.\nPrincipal's Annual Report letter to Parents and Friends:\n\nMy dear Friends:\u2014\n\nBy the time your mail reaches you with this letter, the long looked for annual vacation of our children will have started and the youngsters will be scattered up and down this vast Pacific Coast where they will engage in one or other of the different branches of the fishing industry of our Province of British Columbia.\n\nTo them all holidays are a testing time, to try and put into practice the lessons taught during the school year. We know well that this teaching is only valuable insofar as it will be applied during the long days of holiday life; when, if used well, it will act as a ground work for the bigger life of after-school-days. But these children are still young and there lies on the shoulders of the parents and those in charge of them during the two months of holidays an important and great God-given responsibility, and one that must not be shirked or put aside. Our children must be guided, guarded and helped, both by wise counsel and by prayer, so that no harm may befall them. Keep before them always the ideals of school life; urge them to live that life at home; to keep Christ ever foremost in their lives, and then, and only then, will have the holidays been a blessing to them. Fathers and mothers, your bounden duty as parents demands that you keep an ever watchful eye on your children, especially the girls. You know the dangers of cannery life, so please \"watch and pray that they enter not into temptation.\" They cannot do it alone, but must have your help.\n\nThe children journeyed home on Wednesday the 13th of June. Unfortunately the \"cardona\" was packed and it must have been a very trying journey for all concerned. We must try and arrange things better next year, but with the great changes in fishing regulations that take place this year, it was difficult to gauge the best sailing date for this year, when holiday periods have to be set at least two months ahead of the date of departure. Miss E.W. Morryman, the Vice-Principal went as escort on the trip, and her own statement, \"it would have been absolutely criminal not to have sent an escort,\" sums up the whole situation in regard to conditions on the coast at this time of the year.\n\nOnly a few children remain at the Schools now, six girls and two boys. Three of the girls are staying in at their own request, as they do not wish to go home. Poor Indian girls\u2014there's is truly a hard lot, isn't it? One girl and one boy have to stay in for not returning on time last year, and we do hope that there will be no further trouble in this connection. The Department is allowing two months' holiday on the condition that the children return on time, and if you wish the privilege to be continued, make it your business to see that the girls and boys return on the date set, and not a day later.\n\nNow about new children. We have so many applications for children to come to school that we cannot possibly put them all in, until the new school is built, so please do not send any new children to the Schools unless you definite word from me to do so. I will write during July and notify the parents which children I can take. I am sorry that it will be only a very few.\n\nSunday, the 3rd. of June was a great day in the life of the School,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6426, file 875-1, part 3)\nwhom fourteen children were presented to His Lordship, the Bishop of Columbia for the rite of Confirmation. Five girls, Lucy Elliott, Louisa Gladstone, Cottie Martin, Annie Johnson and Lena White, and nine boys, John Humchitt, Gordon Reid, Patsy Wilson, George Alfred, Abel Hall, Clayton Mack, Claude Morvon, Christopher and Henry Nelson, thus signified their intention of trying to lead and live upright Christian lives, as co-workers in the cause of Jesus Christ. Your earnest prayers are especially asked for them during the next two months that they may remain true and faithful to their voluntarily accepted trust. All these children made their first Communions prior to the close of the School term.\n\nGreat honour has come to our School through the splendid shooting of our Senior Team in Musketry, who in the Winter Series II. of the Dominion of Canada Rifle Association took third place in the Dominion and first among the Indian Schools of the land. Seven of the team won medals which were presented at our Annual Prizegiving Day by Mr. W.M. Halliday, Indian Agent.\n\nWe are planning on sending a large and very representative exhibit of the work of the Schools to the Provincial and Pacific Exhibitions this summer. Outside of the competitive interest for the youngsters, these exhibitions do good work in bringing before the public just what the Indian children can accomplish.\n\nEmpire Day was joyously spent by the children in a long round of sports and games. After a flag raising ceremony in the morning, the youngsters watched the Championship game. During the afternoon, nearly fifty athletic events were run off and some good times were noted. Principal interest centred around the Mile Race, which was won by Claude Morvon of Aiyansh. Our Senior Football Team, we are sorry to say, went down to defeat in the game for the Martin Cup, but we were proud to see them lose like gentlemen, and we wish them better luck next time. As the Empire Day Sports are a community effort, we had our own School Sports on June 4th, after which the Junior Football teams played for the School Championship. Points were given for all events and the athletic champions were Helen Wilson at the Girls' Home and Alfred Lack at the Boys' School.\n\nAnnual Prizegiving Day dawned with cloudless skies, and in the afternoon the children and many friends of the School met on the lawn at the Girls' Home, where prizes and honours for the year were distributed by Mr. W.M. Halliday, Indian Agent at Alert Bay, who also gave the children some good advice and friendly counsel. Singing and drill exhibitions on the part of the girls and boys featured the programme. The School Honour Shield, premier honour of the year, was won by Ernest Mason of Klenotu, whilst the equivalent prize at the Girls' Home went to Louisa Gladstone. The grade prizes for Schoolroom efficiency went to the following;-- Girls, Fanny Rufus, Primary; Grade 1, Helen Wilson; III, Dorcas Alexander; IV, Annie Seaweed; IV Sr., Agnes King; V, Pauline Adams; VI, Cottie Martin. Boys - I, Harold Wright; II, Amos Vickers; III, Basil Carpenter; IV, Herbert Morvon; V, Richard Carpenter; VI, Patsy Wilson; VII Peter Nensloss. Other prizes for departmental work in the Schools went to Louisa Gladstone and Mary Alfred for conduct; Nora Gladstone, Lena White and Alice Lawson for Dining room and Kitchen; Annie Johnson for laundry; Rhoda Cook won prizes for sewing and housework, whilst other prizes went to Sophia Nelson, Olympia McKay, Agnes King, Mary Martin, Maggie Wilson, Annie Williams, Lucy Adams, Daisy Elliott, Lucy Elliott, and Violet Nowell. At the Boys' School, Patsy Wilson took the prize for Manual Training, Peter Nensloss for engineering, Ernest Mason for Farming,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6426, file 875-1, part 3)\nClyton Mack for milking, Jack Scow and James Puglas for Scripture, while prizes for other departmental subjects were awarded to Herbert H. N., Charlie Mason, Amos Vickers, Harry Joseph, George Wake and John Hanchitt. The Prize for Scripture at the Girls' Home went to Lena Kate Shaw, which is very creditable when one knows that this girl only came to school last fall.\n\nHealth. The general health throughout the year has been good. Although we were visited with epidemic measles last fall, no serious results were apparent at the close of the term, for which we are all truly thankful. A slight touch of flu and danger of chickenpox were noticeable this spring but happily they were averted from the Schools. A study of the weight charts of the Schools is interesting indeed, showing as they do a total increase of weight from August of last year until June this year of 709 lbs. in the ten months of School life. This averages out at 9 lb. per pupil, which is highly satisfactory from a health point of view. A great deal can be done by the parents to aid in keeping good health if they will see that the children look after themselves during the holidays. Cases of skin trouble should be taken to the nurse or doctor, and any signs of more serious illness should at once be looked after. During the holidays last year, there was a serious loss of weight among the children which this year should be prevented by more care and attention, as Indian children cannot afford to lose weight.\n\nWe will be publishing our second edition of our school magazine, \"The Thunderbird\" during the month of July, and trust that all will like it. If any of the readers of this letter have items of interest, will they please send them in at once.\n\nThis letter will give you a fair report of our year's work. The children have, as a whole, been well-behaved, and we feel that good progress has been made. What next year will bring, we do not know; but with steady and persevering interest on the part of the children; a keen and loyal co-operation on the part of their parents and friends joined with the blessing and guidance of Almighty God and faithful work from we who are entrusted by Him with the training of the children, we may go on bravely and thankfully to do what is His Will.\n\nPraying that God's Blessing may richly endow you all,\n\nYour sincere friend,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nThe Thunderbird\n\nA record of events at the Alert Bay Indian Residential Schools, and news of the Alert Bay Mission and Outlying stations.\nOUR PICTURE GALLERY.\n\nPeople seen at the Boys' School.\n\nGeorgie, our hog man.\n\n\"Skeezix\", Big Chief of the Woods.\n\nClayton Mack, head barn boy returns with the milk.\n\nPatsy Wilson, in charge of repair squad.\n\nMr. Claude Morven of Alvanah looks rather worried about his house in the kitchen.\nThe Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nIndian and Eskimo Commission.\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6426, file 875-1, part 3)\nThe Legend of Qunnucilla and Namugwazalas,\n\nNamugwazalas was the first man of one of the clans of the Nimkish Tribe of Indians. He was camped on the Nimkish River just below the Lake at the time of this story. Ozulas is the name of the present site of the fishing village of the Nimkish.\n\nThis man became tired of the migratory life he was living, and wanted a permanent home, so in his mind he made a plan of the present type of Indian Community house. To build it he secured and prepared huge cedar timbers, each shaped and cut with a hand adze. He put in the huge posts and cross pieces, but he had not foreseen that he could not put up alone the huge ridge beams, and so when all was ready he found to his sorrow that he could not lift the big timbers into place. When he realized this he was very sad. He sat out on the bank of the river and could have cried had he not been a brave man. As he sat there feeling so glum, he looked across the river and saw a huge Thunderbird sitting on a large stone.\n\nHe said to the bird, \"If you were only an intelligent human being, what a help you could be to me with your great strength.\" The Thunderbird said to him, \"Why, I am human, what do you wish?\" As he spoke, he lifted up the visor of the Thunderbird costume, and showed his face, the face of a man. \"I wish you could help me to put up the beams on my house,\" said the man. \"Surely,\" said the Thunderbird, who closed up his visor and flew up and lighted on the middle of the big beam and seized it with his enormous claws, carrying it up and placing it in position on the posts.\n\nHe then asked the man what this building was to be. Namugwazalas told him of his idea of building for himself and his people a permanent home. The Thunderbird said it was a grand idea. \"I think\" said he, \"I will join you and together we will form a tribe.\" Then the brave Namugwazalas told him that he would rejoice in his company.\n\nSo the Thunderbird undressed himself of his Thunder dress, and sent it back to the heavens with these words, \"Go back to your home, and take heed that you thunder not out of season. At one time only shall your voice roar forth, and that only if one of my future posterity is near to the borders of death.\"\n\nThis is the Legend of the Thunderbird, telling why its spreading wings adorn all totems of the Nimkish Tribe. It is still believed that when there is thunder over the Nimkish River, one of the Tribe or line of the Nimkish is in danger of death, near death, or dead.\n\nWritten by Mrs. Stephen Cook, hereditary Chieftainess of the Nimkish.\n\nThe back cover of this issue is the work of Ernest Mason, Honour Boy for the School during the past year. It represents one of the Indian crests of days gone by, and doubtless there are interesting legends connected with it. We will try and find one for next issue.\n\nThe rose design is the work of Peter Neasloss, Grade VIII.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6426, file 875-1, part 3)\nThat of the Future of Indian Education.\n\nTo all who live on this far Pacific Coast who are in any way interested in Indians, whether commercially, spiritually or educationally, there must at this time be a most recurring thought. What is to be the future of the Indian Race. In Cannery stores, on fishboat, in the porch of the Church and in the Schools, and above all in the homes of the Indians themselves, this question is being asked and thought over. For a change is coming and that before many years are by. The other day I was talking with the captain of a large seine-boat passing through to Bella Bella. A fine type of Indian he was, well educated and a Christian man. His children have been pupils at these Schools for many years, and his eldest boy, a second year high school student is this fall, through the generosity of the Indian Department to enter Technical School for a three year course in machining. This captain asked me, Mr. Anfield, he said, \"What are you doing to meet the changing conditions of Indian life?\" I waited for him to go on. \"You know, times are changing. The time was when for an Indian to be able to read a little, write a little and know how to figure, coupled with a sound religious training was enough for our people. They could hardly handle more. But life was easy for them then. They had land logging, trapping, and fishing made them rich. They could hunt all the year round, and their bodily wants were easily satisfied. But what about now. Land-logging is gone, and the trapping is scarcely worth while. And as for fishing, well, the time is not far distant when that will be gone too. And then what? What are our children to do? Are our boys to have to loaf around all the winter because they have no trade?\n\nAnd another day as I waited for the mail outside the Cannery store, I heard two men talking. They were looking across the Bay to the Nimkish where could be discerned the fishing fleet catching the sockeye in tens where formerly they netted them in hundreds, nay often in thousands. \"Well\", one of them said, \"Fishing's nearly gone\" \"Yep\", said the other, \"and what are those Indians going to do then?\"\n\nAnd on yet another day further up the Coast, I talked with a cannery manager, and in answer to a question of the future of the fishing industry, he gave me this answer. \"The fishing industry is not done yet, but there must be changes and big ones. The purse seines must be radically cut down in number, and there must be all round increases in economy of operation. More machines in the canneries and less human labour.\"\n\nThus the story goes, and when one sorts it all out and pigeonholes the facts where they belong, one thing is plainly to be seen, and that is that the day of the Indian in fishing is nearly done, unless he can be trained to fish scientifically like his white brother. For like it or not, the Indian must face the fact that the white man is consistently beating him at his own games. More and more are the canneries putting in white crews, and with the inevitable cut in gear that must come soon, it is the Indian that will be laid off. Then in the canneries themselves, machinery will in time oust the Indian women and girls who depend on work at filling cans to help support the large families during the winter months. On the trap line, the white man is fast encroaching on preserves formerly held almost entirely by Indians, and in many cases is consistently getting more pelts per line of traps too. Not that the white is robbing any land belonging to Indians, for all trap lines are registered, but they are more and more moving in on lands not previously trapped by...\nthe whites. Hardly anyone living on this coast can deny that the \"writing is on the wall\" as affecting the fishing industry. Last year was a terrible failure, and so far this year, things are not much better, though there is promise of improvement. Too much gear is the cause of the trouble, and cut down gear means cut down man power.\n\nAnd so we on the Coast are facing what the Indians of the Plains faced some years back. They had to seek new occupations and they found the best in farming, and one has only to read the Annual Report of the Indian Department to see how well many of them are doing under careful supervision on the part of the Department and through systematic training on the part of the Schools.\n\nBut here on the Coast, hemmed in by gigantic mountains, the Indians cannot turn to farming. He has not the land for one thing. Many reserves on this coast could not be farmed even with the best intentions in the world. Then too, the Coast Indian is a man of seasonal occupations. In our Schools at present, one could count on one's fingers the number of boys who will return to areas capable of being farmed successfully.\n\nThe solution seems to lie in technical training for the boys and domestic science for the girls, so that the children can be discharged from Schools, the boys with some sort of trade, and the girls with a sound knowledge of housekeeping, dressmaking, and kindred subjects. Thus by economical living, coupled with the earnings brought in from seasonal employment in the restricted fields open to them, they will be able to make an honest livelihood. Indian boys should leave school with a good knowledge of carpentry, capable of building their own homes with help in planning, buying, etc. They should also be able to make or at least repair their own and their families boots and shoes, and in cases where intelligence and aptitude warrants such help, others should receive course in machinery and electricity. Native arts, now alas almost lost, should be revived for both boys and girls, for therein lies a sure source of income, outside of the fact that such a revival would preserve to posterity arts and crafts unrivalled in their class.\n\nThis is the programme that lies ahead of these Schools, but it will need much careful study and thought, coupled with sympathetic help and above all with Divine guidance and aid to make it the success that we would have it be. We have assurance that the Department of Indian Affairs are fully willing to help and are keenly alive to the needs of the Coast Indians. So we hope for great things in our new school, though a start on this programme has been made even with the poor equipment at our disposal in these old buildings, and results so far attained augur well for the future.\n\nEditor.\n\nWe are deeply gratified at the splendid reception given to the first edition of our magazine. Many letters from all parts of the Dominion have been received showing clearly the intense interest on the part of Church people in our work. Our mailing list is growing but we would bespeak yet more subscriptions in order to meet the necessary expenses of publishing our little effort.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6426, file 875-1, part 3)\n\"Our Pets\"\n\nClayton Mack returns to Bella Coola\nThese children will have learnt a certain amount of English so that the first year away from their homes and home life will be less strange and trying. They will have seen too, some of the different habits of the white people, learnt something of their different code of manners, all of which will make life away come easier to them. And too, the rudiments of reading, writing and arithmetic will enable them to take their place in a grade more suitable in many cases, to their age.\n\nAltogether the village mission can often act as a link between the Indian homes and the Schools, and look to the latter to produce what is surely the aim of us all, not some exotic being, but good villagers, living in sanitary villages, made up of sanitary houses, happy, healthy, bright and hopeful children running in and out of happy homes founded on happy married life; an end that can only be attained, as has been proved in other lands, through working for and in the strength of Christ, on the part of all, white man and red.\n\nK.O'Brian...Village Island.\n\nSchool notes\n\nWe were very proud to receive a visit from the Deputy-Supt. of Indian Affairs, Dr. Duncan C. Scott, L.L.D., who, accompanied by Indian Commissioner W.E. Ditchburn of Victoria, and the newly appointed Director of Medical Services, Dr. Stone, arrived at the Bay on August 5th, to look over the question of the long looked for new school. It is nice to record that as a result of this visit, construction will be under way within a very short time. Dr. Scott was very interested in all that is being done at the Schools, in and in the village and outlying stations too. We wish that we could see more of him.\n\nA very pleasant event took place during the holidays, when the staff of the schools were hosts to the people of Alert Bay, at a silver tea in aid of the expenses of shipping our exhibits of school-work to the Pacific Exhibition at Vancouver. A large and keenly interested number, both white and Indian, came during the two afternoons of the Exhibition here, and we glad to announce that a sum, quite sufficient to cover all expenses, was taken in. We wish to thank all our guests for the kindly appreciation of the work of our children, and trust that the bond of interest thus formed may continue. As we run off the last checks of the morning, word has come from Vancouver to the effect that these Schools have taken 21 prizes at the Exhibition in town, including the grand awards and diplomas for Manual Training and the best Educational Exhibit. As soon as he heard, Mr. W.M. Halliday, Indian Agent, came to the Schools and congratulated the children and their teachers on the splendid results attained.\n\nAmong new faces on the staff, we welcome Mr. and Mrs. T.H. Dudley, who arrived to take over the positions of House-master, Manual Training and Cadet Instructor in the case of the former, and the position of Kitchen Matron at the Girls' School for the latter. We wish them all the luck and happiness in the world, and God's blessing on all they will do for our children.\nSchool Notes.\n\nWe were glad to welcome to the Schools this year, His Grace, the Archbishop of New Westminster. It is 13 years since Dr. DePencier visited the Schools, and he brought a cheery message to the youngsters who gave him a rousing reception. His Grace afterwards proceeded to Kincolith Inlet on a round of the Missions.\n\nMr. R.J. Cairns made his annual inspection of the Schools this summer and was pleased with the progress the children are making. Whilst here, Mr. Cairns presented the medals won by pupils for Confederation essays. Peter MacBroom at the Boys' School and Elizabeth Mason at the Girls' Home were the winners.\n\nHolidays are now in progress and the schools are almost empty, and are most unusually quiet. We miss the youngsters so much, although we appreciate the rest that holidays bring to some. We trust that all the youngsters return with minds made up for a bigger and better year in all things. Most of the staff are also away on holiday and trust that they will benefit greatly by the rest.\n\nAmong the graduating class of this year we find the following names, Gertrude Rumchitt of Bella Bella, Annie Williams of the same tribe, Gertie H. Fin of the Kwakwatha, all of the Girls' Home. Gordon Reid and Abel Hall of Bella Bella both left this term, as did Clayton Mack of Bella Coola. Charlie Mason of Klemtu had to be sent home with pleurisy, and is now in hospital at Bella Bella, where he is making great strides towards returning health and strength. If he can pass a doctor's examination, we hope to welcome back to our happy home, that smiling young man from Klemtu, Simon Brown. Our only regret is that we cannot put in all the children now on our rapidly growing waiting list for admission. Be patient my little friends, and we will doubtless find room for you sometime in the next year or so.\n\nMiss Long, Teacher of Junior Grades, is now in Victoria taking a summer school course in preparation for her work next year, when she intends starting basketry and other manual arts. Mail will reach her at the Victoria High School, Victoria, B.C.\n\nWe take this opportunity of extending congratulations to the Diocese of Caledonia on the election of Archdeacon G.A. Rix to the episcopate. We know that under the new Bishop, the Indian Missions will continue and extend their work for the Kingdom. It is hoped that within a short time plans will be complete for the building of a large Residential School to take care of the Indian children of the Diocese, and whilst we will be more than sorry to lose our northern children, yet we realise the fact that it is far better for them to be nearer home.\n\nThis coming term will see the introduction of co-education in the Schools for the first time. It has been long wanted and is an absolute necessity in a school of this type. The change will be all for the best as the teachers instead of having eight grades each, will now have only four at the most, and usually three for one grade is always out each session taking vocational work.\n\nThe Junior W.A. members of the Schools were delighted with the visit of Mrs. E. Crow of Victoria, who was the recipient of several nice momentos of her trip.\nW.A. NOTES\n\nFor the W.A. of Christchurch, Alert Bay, B.C., to all members of other branches who may receive this magazine greetings. No doubt, you, as we, have been resting from the usual monthly meetings, laying up; we trust renewed strength and energy for the great venture before us during the coming winter months; namely to fulfil the mission which is our as members of the Woman's Auxiliary, which is none other than helping to carry on the great work entrusted to the Church by her Divine Founder and Leader; to make disciples of all nations.\n\nIt is true that some must tarry at home by the \"stuff\" (1 Sam. 30:24), but they are to have their part in the great reward and to them perhaps more than to others who go to the front lines, will the great \"General\" say, \"Well done, good and faithful servant\", so the soldier of Jesus Christ must also be a servant and to each one of us is given the opportunity to prove our faithfulness, even though we cannot all be successful.\n\nIt has been said by some, perhaps by many, that the W.A. seems to be just a money-making machine. If we omit the word \"just\", and instead call it a \"Great\" money-making machine, then it will be nearer the truth, \"in fact, part of the truth\", but not the whole truth. In answer to this criticism, we would ask what greater honour can we have than to raise the money for carrying out the last command of our Master?\n\nHow shall those, who today are still in the darkness of ignorance and superstition hear the message which will dispel the darkness without a preacher, and how shall they preach except they be sent, and how shall they be sent without money? It has ever been the same, if we would help, we must pray, give our time, our talents, money, for the service of the King of kings.\n\nEven in our Lord's day, money was needed for the Temple and the Synagogue services, and Jesus sitting by the treasury one day took notice of those who contributed, and He said there were those who gave and had plenty left, for they gave of their abundance, but the one particularly mentioned was a widow and she was poor, but she gave and it was money she gave. \"How little\", some say, \"only two mites\", \"How much\", Jesus said, \"for she has cast in more than they all, for she has given all that she had.\"\n\nTo those who depend very largely upon sales of work for raising their funds, it has been said that such is not the ideal way of giving, but recommend direct giving as the highest form. Granted that is so, we have yet to ask that whether as a whole, we are able to give the equivalent of what is now being raised by the sale of garments and other things made by willing capable fingers, costing much thought and time, as well as money, but the former added to the latter makes a sum much larger than could otherwise be given directly. Money makes money we are told, but no does brains and ability, and those who may have little of the one, yet who using the gifts that God has so freely bestowed upon them, are able to give back to Him all that they have and in this way speed forward the work of bringing His Kingdom on earth.\n\n\"And is it uphill all the way?\"\n\n\"Yes, to the very end.\n\nBut it is the mountain climbers and especially those who reach the summit that can enjoy the most perfect view and purest air. Lest we grow weary in the climb, may God inspire us with fresh vision of His sustaining Grace and Power and something of the ultimate issue of our undertaking as W.A. members.\"\nMuch might be said and has already been said regarding the W.A. as a great praying machine, and which is of course the most important side of the work as well as the most difficult, but we need to remind ourselves that by raising the funds we are thereby used by God to answer the prayer of faith. How better can we aid and encourage missionaries than by helping to provide the means to carry on?\n\nHow sad the cry, sometimes heard from some of Christ's faithful soldiers at the Front, \"unless men and money are forthcoming, we shall be obliged to close down\" this or that station. Shall we not then take courage and go forward with renewed zeal, praying that we may be content to labour and not to ask for any reward save that of knowing we do His Will.\n\nK. Dibben, Pres., Senior W.A.\n\nSchool Notes.\n\nSchool re-opened on Monday the 13th. of August, and we are glad to say that by owing of the opening day, both schools were almost full, and are now running at full capacity. This is a wonderful tribute to the children's interest in their work, and of their parents desire for education for them.\n\nWord has been received from Capt. J.M. Cumming to the effect that the Cadet Corps has for the third successive time won the I.O.D.E. Challenge Shield presented to Indian Schools. A very nice letter of congratulation has been received from the Provincial Chapter of the Order, and we wish to thank them for their kindly words.\n\nWe must extend our thanks to Mr. W.S. Rowe, who very kindly and at great pains set up our exhibit in town for the Pacific Exhibition. It is nice to think that our friends will go to such lengths to help forward the work of the Schools.\n\nDuring the holidays we were pleased to have a short visit from Mr. E.W. Mernagen, Office Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Comm., of the M.S.C.O. Mr. Mernagen was on his way to Carcross and hence had but little time here, and we hope that he will come again and spend a week or so with us.\n\nAs we go to type Mr. Chester Warren, the Govt. Engineer is laying out the site for the new building, and testing the ground to make sure that it is safe to support a building the size contemplated.\n\nDuring the past year Rev. W.Govier, Missionary on the Columbia Mission Ship has been teaching our boys singing, and we trust that with the opening of the new term we will have him with us again.\nColumbia Coast Mission News.\n\nMany accounts have been written of journeys made on the mission ship Columbia, and it would be hard for the writer to cover new ground, though a few impressions of the journey recently made by me might be of interest. Thanks to the courtesy of Rev. John Antle and the crew of this most useful little ship, I was privileged to journey on the northern run and to view at first hand some of diversified interests of this British Columbia coast. Leaving the Hospital Wharf at the Bay on a Saturday we proceeded to Englewood, a huge lumbering and mill centre, where the L.O., Dr. Striner spent some hours in tending to the sick. A patient was brought back to the hospital and then off to the north. First call, Hardy Bay. No, it was Fort Rupert, a deserted Hudson's Bay post. What tales that place could tell if only its broken down stone fireplaces and community house could talk. It is now an Indian winter village, but a few of the older folks were living there then we called and social calls were made on them all. Ailments peculiar to old people were described and prescribed for, and then with an A-la-Ki-asia to all we were off to Port Hardy and Hardy Bay, key centres to the pulp mills at Port Alice. Hardy Bay is growing fast and many new houses were in course of erection. The missionary of the Columbia, Rev. W. Govier takes regular services at all these places all the year round. Shushartie was the next stop, but not much life was there found, as the Cannery has been moved lock, stock and barrel down to Bone Bay near to the entrance of Knight's Inlet. After a short call at the Indian village of Nalwitti, tenanted only by an old Chief who remained as watchman, we dropped our hook, which is nautical for anchor, in the still and beautiful bay of Bull Barbour, seat of a Government Wireless Station. This is an extremely beautiful place, with an almost landlocked harbour on one side, its very stillness accentuating the thunderous roar of the vast Pacific Ocean rolling in on the other side of the small peninsula. It must be a lonely life for these men, though they seemed cheery enough, and more than one boasted of over five years at the Harbour. The loneliness must tell on them, and a change of environment might not be out of place at times.\n\nAs evening fell, so fell the fog, and all night long the strident voice of the fog horn on Pine Island boomed out its warning call to \"thee in peril on the sea\". We waited the next morning until nearly ten and still the fog showed no sign of lifting to me, but the Skipper's sea-wise eye or nose, I know not which, told him otherwise, and off we went in a regular pea-souper of a fog, right out into the Pacific. Sure enough after half an hour or so of running up went the fog, and we speeded up for the other side, where we tied up at Allision Harbour at the mouth of Seymour Inlet. We were now on the mainland of the Renfrew B.C. Coast, and several trips took us up small inlets and harbours, visiting in most cases empty Indian villages, or small logging settlements, where the crew knew everyone and everyone knew the crew. Large stacks of papers and magazines are given out at all these places, and to hear a little girl of nine or thereabouts ask for \"A grade II book, please\", followed instantly by \"Where's Mr. Govier\", gives one most all the information needed as to the value of such a craft as the Columbia.\n\nOn down the coast, with a short stay at Blunden Harbour, where the doctor's services were rewarded by a big basket of strawberries for the engineer, and then into the logging settlements of Wells Pass.\nThe beauty of some of these Inlets, with their towering mountains abutting on either shore is quite indescribable and has to be done to be appreciated. Almost a dozen calls were made at logging camps, thus giving medical protection to hundreds of men. Very little work awaited the doctor but the chance to speak with these people and to give them all some reading material or pass on the news received over the radio seemed to be a sort of health cure in itself. Regularly every hour the Columbia engineer talks over the radio-telephone to the operator at the Alert Bay station, so messages, recalls or medical advice are never very far away, so matter how mountain enclosed the boat might be. That night saw us tied in the entrance to Kingcome Inlet. It's great how one can sleep on this boat.\n\nSeven o'clock in the morning was the zero hour for Kingcome, but several other calls had to be made first, and it was nearly noon before we got properly into the Inlet. Up to now the scenery had been wonderful, now it became grand, as the somewhat dirty Kingcome river pours its waters into the swirling tides of the Inlet.\n\nA long time was spent at Charles Creek cannery, some seven miles below the river proper, and the doctor was a busy man if the one can judge by the number of bottles of medicine he dispensed. A long chat with Miss E.G. Westbury, the Missionary to the Kingcomes, gave one an idea of the work to be done. Hers is a noble task, and nobly done. Miss Westbury hopes to start school for the children resident at the Cannery this summer, as a building is on the site though not jacked into position yet.\n\nLate that afternoon all hands got into the longboat whose speedy little outboard engine soon drove us up the winding river en route for the Indian village and the Hallidays ranch. The latter was reached first, and the hospitality of these good people and welcome extended to the Columbia's crew, need no eulogising here. Visits to the other ranches of the settlement were made and it was in the wee small hours that we journeyed back with Reg. Halliday down the river in pouring rain and with the night blocker than the proverbial Kilkenny cat to the safe haven of the Columbia's decks. How that man found his way down there I know not, and what conditions must be like in winter I care not to think about.\n\nThe next afternoon saw us back in Alert Bay, and my thanks go to the boys of this boat for a chance to see the work being done. It is lovely in summer, but I know somewhat of what it is in winter too, then the southeasters roar for weeks at a time. Then it is not so nice. It is an indispensible work that this boat is doing and one worthy of all the help and support that our Church can give. \"Let us not be weary in well-doing.\"\n\nEditor.\n\nWe are greatly indebted to the M.S.S.C. for the electros and cuts that enable us to publish our cover in colours, and we feel sure that our readers will like the change.

POST #2\nOttawa, May 5, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the pupilage at the new Alert Bay Indian Residential School. Accommodation is being provided for approximately 175 pupils and grant will be allowed for this number whenever earned. At a later date, when the school is filled, it may be found that a few more children can be admitted if there is adequate space, and arrangements would then be made for an increased per capita grant. In the meantime, it can be considered that the pupilage at this school is 175.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. H. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs the Commission have nothing on record to show the capacity of the new School at Alert Bay now under construction, I shall be obliged if you will furnish me with a written statement in this connection. My understanding is that it will accommodate 175 pupils, namely, 100 boys and 75 girls. It is important that our Commission should have this information on file in order that they may advise the School Management with regard to the question of recruiting the full number of pupils required to fill the School to capacity.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI have had a long talk with Rev. F. Comley, Rector of Alert Bay, on his return from Ottawa, where he had an interview with you on matters pertaining to the work here.\n\nLet me assure you that I am well aware that I must have been somewhat of a thorn in the flesh to the Department of late, and I wish to take this opportunity of apologising most sincerely for any trouble that I might have caused. I see fully the justice of your request in asking me to approach the Department through the properly organised channels, and I can assure you that I will do all in my power to carry out your wishes in this respect. The sympathy and interest of the Department are both well known to me, and I suppose that it must have been mere over-enthusiasm that allowed my typewriter to do so much overtime work!\n\nThings have been difficult here, and the equipment required sadly lacking, and there have been times when I have been compelled to approach the Department direct, but thanks to your kindly words as expressed to Mr. Comley, I feel that the right way might after all be the best way. At any rate it shall be the way I shall pursue in future.\n\nThere is a big work to be done on the Coast, and the ever-hastening approach of an acute economic situation among the Indians is one that requires all our energies to solve, and one in which the new school to be erected here by the Department is to play an extremely important part.\n\nWith kind regards and many thanks for your unfailing help in the past,\n\nBelieve me, most sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nIn 1881, Rev. A. J. Hall, an Anglican missionary to the Indians, believing Alert Bay the most central locality for his work, established a mission there and erected a classroom. Day school activities commenced, and, in addition, classes were held in the evening. This work was recognized by the Government in 1882, when a grant of $12 per pupil per year was allowed for the activity. He and his wife kept a few girls in their own home, without any grant for their maintenance.\n\nIndian Agent R. H. Pidcock, of the Kwawkewlth agency, with headquarters at Alert Bay, wrote in 1889, urging the Government to establish a vocational training centre for Indian young men at Alert Bay and that the present school reserve be secured from the Provincial Crown for the purpose. A year later, Rev. A. J. Hall asked for the establishment of a girls' boarding school. In 1891, Mr. Hall was offered a $70 per capita grant if he would provide the maintenance and educate Indian girls in a boarding school there. Mr. Hall was unable to accept this offer at that time, because of his approaching furlough to England.\n\nIn 1892 and the following year, the boys' industrial school was erected and equipped. The funds were provided by Parliament. In 1894, under the principalship of the Rev. A. W. Corker, the school was opened. Per capita grant of $130 per annum was allowed for 35 pupils. It is interesting to note that the present Indian Agent, Mr. W. M. Halliday, was appointed in 1897 as the first trades instructor.\n\nRev. Mr. Hall renewed his application for a girls' boarding school in 1894. He and Mrs. Hall were boarding from 5 to 10 girls in their home at that time. The Department gave assistance for the first time, and, in the following year (1895) a pupilage of 10 and a per capita grant of $60 per annum was allowed. The building was owned, of course, by the church authorities.\n\nBoys' school was conducted, without interruption, to the present date. From 1905, however, after some difficulty in connection with supervision and because of poor enrolment generally, the girls' school was closed. The Department erected a building for the girls' boarding school in 1911. It was opened in 1912, with the Rev. Mr. Corker principal of both schools. The management of the boys' school was in the missionary society, while the girls' institution was managed by the diocesan authorities.\n\nFuture principals were as follows:\n\n- Mr. V. S.

Your school magazine, \"The Thunderbird,\" is a most commendable enterprise, and I wish to express the Department's congratulations and, through this medium, to reach the Indians for whose benefit the school has been established.\n\nTo understand and appreciate the present situation, it is necessary to cast a backward glance at the first educational efforts of the Church of England in your district. In 1861, Rev. A. J. Hall, believing Alert Bay the most central locality, established a mission there and commenced a school. Classes were held both in the daytime and in the evening, and a few girls were kept by Mrs. Hall in her own home. The work was recognized by the Canadian Government in 1883 and a grant of $12 per pupil per year was given.\n\nImprovement was gradual but continuous. In 1892, the Department commenced the erection of the Boys' Industrial School, which was opened two years later, under the principalship of the Reverend A. W. Corker. It is interesting to note that the present Indian Agent, Mr. W. M. Halliday, was the first trades instructor at the school. The Boys' School has been conducted without interruption since that date.\n\nThe Boarding School for Girls, managed by Reverend and Mrs. Hall, was assisted by the Department of Indian Affairs in 1895 - an annual grant being provided until the\n\nF. Earl Anfield, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nwork was\nwork was discontinued ten years later. In 1911, Parliament provided funds for the erection of a building suitable for the maintenance and education of girls. A year later, girls were admitted and the new institution was placed under the control of Mr. Corker, Principal of the Boys' School.\n\nThe Alert Bay training centre has become an important factor in the lives of British Columbia coast Indians. Encouraged by the constant zeal of those in charge, the Dominion Government has erected one of the most modern Indian school buildings in Canada. The re-establishment of the institution has been effected at a cost of $223,000.00, and I hope you will be proud of your new school and will face the future with new confidence.\n\nIndian educational work at Alert Bay had humble beginnings; but, all through the years, representatives of the Church of England and of the Department have striven for success, and their efforts have been supported by Indian parents. The future appears bright. New standards of efficiency can be achieved. I appeal to graduates of the school and other Indian supporters, upon whose loyalty and interest success will largely depend.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Macpherson, Managing Editor of \"The School\", a magazine devoted to elementary and secondary education published by the Ontario College of Education, he requests an engraving of the new St. Michael's Indian Residential School at Alert Bay, British Columbia. We have advised him that his request has been referred to you. No doubt if an engraving is not available he would be glad to receive a clear print. Mr. Macpherson's address is O/c Ontario College of Education, 371 Bloor Street West, Toronto 5, Ontario.\n\nJames Lawler,\nDepartmental Editor.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my visit to your Department on Sept. 17th last, I discussed with the Superintendent of Indian Education the question of an increased pupilage at our Alert Bay School, and was informed that the earliest date when this increase could be sanctioned would be on April 1st, 1931.\n\nIn a letter received from the Principal of this school some time ago he stated that he could easily secure 200 pupils and still be unable to accommodate many who wish to be admitted. I shall be obliged if you will kindly let me know if the pupilage at this school may be increased to 200 at the time indicated.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, November 26th, 1930.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to request that you supply the Department with the dimensions of the dormitories at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. You should, of course, include the dimensions of the new dormitory mentioned in the third paragraph of your 163/25/1 of July 5th, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nOttawa, July 25, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your letter of the 5th instant in which you state that the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School has applied to you for an increase in the number of pupils for which grant is allowed. Owing to our funds being limited, it is regretted that no increase in the pupilage can be authorized at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing voucher No. 67 for $68.85 for escort expenses incurred in sending the children home from the Residential School, for which authority was given in your letter of May 8th, No. 156/0/10.\n\nI am more or less dubious as to the advisability of these expenses in connection with an escort. Looking at it from the view of an outsider, one would say why should the Department be called on to pay these expenses in the first place. The reason advanced by the Missionary Society is a very good one, that they want to see the children safely home and without being unduly exposed to temptation on the way. On the other hand, as soon as they get home they are turned loose, and if they have not sufficient character to stand up against temptation after they arrive home, why incur the expense in seeing that they get safely home; let them have the temptation when they first leave, instead of later. However the Department in its wisdom has decided otherwise, and in all probability for the sake of public appearances the view taken is the correct one.\n\nThe Principal has written to see if the per capita grant earning pupilage cannot be increased to the full capacity of the building, namely two hundred. He states in his letter that they have made such alterations as will give another dormitory and another classroom and if permission is granted to increase from 175 to 200 they will be able to fill to capacity as soon as the holiday is over.\n\nIn view of the wonderful structure that we have there, and of the need there is for the education of the Indian children, many of whom are unable to attend day school, I would recommend that the authority be given to increase the pupilage to 200. The building is capable of accommodating really more than that; the dining room has a seating capacity of 240, and this is the place where they usually run short in all these buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nWMH/SMT\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, July 2, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 110/23/1 of the 11th ultimo, enclosing photographs of the new Indian Residential School at Alert Bay. The Department is very grateful for these prints, as they are much superior to any photographs we have of the new equipment.\n\nYou might discuss with the Principal the cleaning up of the grounds at the school. The pictures show that there is much desired in this connection. I speak principally of the debris which is across the road to the front of the school. Perhaps this matter has already been attended to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nSir:\n\nSome time ago you wrote me asking for some photographs of the new Indian Residential School at Alert Bay, and pending receipt of them I sent some snapshots. Since that time I have photographed the building myself, but as I had no proper solutions for making the prints, I kept the negatives until I had an opportunity to go to Vancouver. I have had them printed by the Eastman Kodak Company, and am sending four prints which gives a very fair idea of the school. One print shows the view from directly in front of it, one taken from the south-east from the top of a boat in the harbor, one showing a back view, and one showing the perspective taken from the end of the sawmill wharf.

W. H. Gibson,\nUnited Church Missionary,\nBella Bella, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nThank you for your kind letter of recent date in connection with the United Church children who are pupils of this school. I quite appreciate your feelings in the matter of religious education of these children, who will be members of the United Church when they leave the school. May I impress upon you the fact that it is not, and never will be our desire to take United Church children from the church of their fathers, though this church is administered by the Anglican Church; it has always been my endeavour to see that the children have their opportunity to worship God in the manner in which they have been brought up. On the other hand, however, we have to consider the children themselves, and the question of admitting United Church children to communion in our church is a delicate problem. What are we to do if these children demand access to the sacraments of our Church? The preparatory classes for communicants is now in progress, admission to which is entirely voluntary on the part of the girls and boys attending. Several of your United Church children are attending, and I have spoken to them privately about the relationship of their own church ties. The children are quite insistent that they wish to continue in this communicant's class, and I do not in any way feel justified in refusing them such communion. In fact I think it would be a very serious thing if we were to refuse them equal rights with their fellow pupils of the schools. Nice distinctions of inter-denominationalism are quite foreign to the Indian mind, and it would be fatal in my opinion to try and distinguish such for them. Far better for them to grow up to learn the hopes and possibilities of one great church of Christ, be it named United Church, Anglican or otherwise.\n\nI will be grateful to you for a frank expression of your opinion on this matter, as I am quite open minded on the whole thing myself. With very kind regards and best wishes for the success of your work, believe me\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) F. Earl Anfield.\nPrincipal.\nBella Bella, B.C.,\nSept. 20, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Anfield,\n\nYour's dated Sept. 13th to hand. I am very glad you opened your heart to me in this matter. Above all else I desire that our children should become Christians. And I would not mind if they were all members of the Church of England, but under present conditions it must be that they remain members of the United Church for that is the Church working in their home town.\n\nNow I see no reason at all why our children could not attend the preparatory or communion classes and when the time comes for Confirmation, let it be understood that they are members of the United Church of Canada, and I could send membership cards to you, and you hand them to the children. I see nothing in the Confirmation Service that would conflict with such an arrangement.\n\nI understand that the Rev. Raley has invited a Church of England Minister to go into his School and instruct Church of England children.\n\nYou will have a large number of our children from Bella Bella, and other missions attending your School and it is only right that you see our children are true to their Church.\n\nI will be glad to hear from you regarding this matter.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nI beg to remain yours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) W.

(Next trip of Cabala).\n\nLouisa Nelson\nAlice Mason\nIrene Gladstone\nGeorge Housty\nPhilip Hall\nRoy Gladstone\nErnest Wilson\nCharlie Mason\n\nIf there are any others not on this list whose papers have been forwarded to us, they may come in still, but please do not send any others without consulting us, as we are going to be very full up for awhile.\n\nWith regards to the United Church children from your centre, we would be grateful to you for the membership cards of the following pupils.\n\nFrank Wilson,\nRichard Carpenter\nWillie Windsor\nAlfred Mack\nSimon Brown\nLydia Brown\nNora Gladstone\nDaisy Elliot\nAgnes King\n\nThese children were confirmed at a very impressive service held here last week, and in accordance with our agreement we are forwarding their names to you for membership cards in their church.\n\nWith kind regards and best wishes,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) F. Earl Anfield,\nPrincipal.\nDear Mr. Rendle,\n\nI have been writing Mr. Anfield of Alert Bay about United Church children attending his school, and the question of confirmation arose, and we decided that it would be better for our children to attend the confirmation classes and receive confirmation just as the other children are doing, but instead of them being received into the Church of England that each minister of our Church should forward to Mr. Anfield a membership card and Mr. Anfield would explain to them that they were now received into the Communion of the United Church, with their membership in their own town or village.\n\nI have just received a list of a class and find three names from Bella Coola.\n\nI don't suppose that you have any cards so I am sending you these or four, three made out for you to fill in and send to him.\n\nThis is the very best way out of the difficulty.\n\nI trust that you are keeping fit,\n\nKind regards to you all at the mission,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) W. H. Gibson.\n\nDo you expect to go to Ocean Falls to meet Dr. Cochrane?\nBella Bella, B.C.,\nFeb. 22, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Barner,\n\nI am sending you letters which passed between Mr. Anfield, Principal of the Anglican Residential School at Alert Bay and myself. They will explain themselves.\n\nI have been dismayed reading a letter from Rev. G. A. Wilson, D.D., Supt. of Missions, Vancouver. Which letter is a report of a joint meeting of the Anglican Church and the United Church on the building of Residential Schools. A copy has no doubt been sent to you.\n\nThere are three resolutions which were adopted by the conference. The item which troubles me is No. 2, which reads thus - That each Church should recruit only from its own constituency.\n\nTo enforce this section would be to inflict upon the Indian people a great wrong. At this time when there is so much talk of Union and cooperation surely this is a backward movement, and will be misunderstood, for the Natives of this Coast make no fine distinctions. Both Churches are as one to them.\n\nI find children coming home from the Anglican school are quite as good as those coming from our own schools, so WHY make a difference? And why send children hundreds of miles away from home when there is a good school near at hand? Of course some parents have a decided choice, but most want their children not so far away.\n\nIn case of sickness it is a real hardship upon both parents and children.\n\nAt the present time we have about twenty-five children at the Alert Bay school and about sixteen at Coqualeetza.\n\nYou will see by the enclosed letters the arrangement between Mr. Anfield is working fine.\n\nI beg to remain yours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) W. H. Gibson.\nOttawa, December 15, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 5th instant, relative to an increased pupilage at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, I now have to inform you that there is dormitory accommodation for a pupilage of 200, and provision will be made for a per capita grant for that number from April 1, 1931. We are requesting the local Indian Agent to inform the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

You may advise the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nDecember 4, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 26, file 156/0/1, regarding dimensions of the dormitories of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, I would advise you that there are the same number of dormitories, namely four in number, on each side of the building.\n\nOn the top floor on each side the approximate dimensions of the large dormitory is 60' x 32'6\", and the overflow dormitory is approximately 27'6\" x 34'6\". On the floor immediately below this, there are two dormitories, one approximately 31' x 23'6\", and one approximately 35'6\" x 31'6\".\n\nWhat is referred to in my letter is an additional dormitory is what I have called in this letter an overflow dormitory, but has not been used for dormitory purposes, but for the storing of clothes, and if the additional pupilage is recommended and granted, these overflow dormitories can be used for dormitories, thus easily increasing the area for the pupilage of the school to the two hundred requisitioned for. This will make a total number of eight dormitories in all.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\n[Handwritten calculations]\n\n60 x 32'6\" x 10 = 19800 cu ft\n27'6\" x 34'6\" x 10 = 9488\n31' x 23'6\" x 10 = 7280\n35'6\" x 31'6\" x 10 = 11162\n47460\nOttawa, December 10, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, relative to an increased pupilage at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is giving this matter consideration. We have requested the local Indian Agent to state the dimensions of the dormitories at this school and, when this information is received, you will be advised as to the pupilage for which a grant can be allowed as from April 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

SCHOOL:\n\nPupilage of 200 from April 1st, 1931.\nAgent Halliday advised by letter of July 16th,\non File 156-0-3.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF SCHOOL INSPECTOR BARRY, DATED APRIL 13 & 14, 1931, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE ALERT BAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 156-0-6.\n\nMusic Room:- Teacher Mrs. Kenmuir.\n\nMrs. Kenmuir visits the school five days a week. She gives lessons on the piano and organ. This class was organized last September and has 26 children who have lessons individually. Since last September, 18 of these children have learned enough to play hymns at the evening services. Their progress has been remarkable. As this is an extra, the Principal endeavours to collect small fees from the parents of the children learning the piano. These fees are supposed to pay the teacher. If this work is to be continued, some other and better way will have to be found for the payment of the teacher. The children love these lessons and I consider it would be a great pity if the class has to be discontinued.\nOttawa, March 19, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to a form sent by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics to the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nUpon enquiry, I find that this was in error, as it was not the intention of the Bureau to include Indian schools in this survey. They secure the facts necessary for their purpose from this Department as far as Indian schools are concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43, The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of our Alert Bay School has forwarded to me the enclosed form which he had just received, and desires to know if he is obliged to fill in the same. I presume that the Principals of all Indian Residential Schools, regardless of denomination, have received the same forms, but as this appears to be the first time they have been sent out, I shall be obliged if you will inform me if it is your wish that the information requested should be given. After an examination of the quarterly returns and annual reports made by Principals to your Department it seems to me that all the information desired could be secured from those documents, instead of through the various school managements, all of whom are already heavily taxed with daily routine duties. Your ruling in the matter, however, will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nDear Friends:\n\nWe hope this school year to be able to send out to you all regular news letters from St. Michael's giving you an idea of what the youngsters are doing, and at the same time to keep in touch with the parents and friends interested in our work for Indian children.\n\nSchool re-opened on August 16 with an almost record opening attendance of 205 children which number has now reached the full capacity of 210. From the emptiness of holiday days to the happy laughter of the children these days is a considerable and very pleasant change, and we are glad indeed to have the children back to school and settled down for the year's work.\n\nGenerally speaking, the health of the children was reasonably good when they returned to school, though unfortunately since re-opening we have had several down with a nasty type of flu. Under the providence of God, and with good care and nursing, all are now well again, and the school infirmary practically empty. We hope it may remain so.\n\nWe had better speak a few words about fishing, the natural industry of our Indian people on the entire coast. As predicted earlier in the year, fishing has in no way approached the plentifulness it showed in 1930, and as a result many of our Indian people are going to be in hard luck this coming winter. We would at this time urge most strongly on all the parents not to send large amounts of clothes or food to their children at the school. Your children are well fed and well clothed, and apart from an occasional gift of fruit or dried fish, they do not need much more. You will need all your money to care for your own homes, so please learn to say \"NO\" when your children write and ask for the most unnecessary things. Of course, as long as you will send, they will keep on asking, for that is the way of children.\n\nThe latest report from the northern districts show a decrease of over 300,000 cases compared to last year's catch, mostly in the pink variety. Sockeye was fairly good, especially the Skeena, but the poor old Nass River was almost a complete failure. Prices were low all over, which has made things harder. Smiths Inlet was a failure, Rivers Inlet Fair, and Alert Bay fair. The outlook for fall fishing is only fair, though a lot of dog salmon will be put up by the salteries, with low prices all around. This condition will mean trying times for our Indian friends, but we trust that they will see the need of storing and saving in good times, so that they may have something when fish harvests are bad.\n\nOur many friends will be extremely interested to hear the results of the Indian school competition at the Vancouver Exhibition, ten Residential Schools competing. St. Michael's won twenty-eight awards, including the grand diploma and first prize for manual training, and second for the educational exhibit. The Vancouver press spoke very highly of the work done, and we are sure that the parents who are con-\nWe are glad our many friends may know that this year for the first time several of our senior children have undertaken active work for the Church by becoming Sunday School teachers. Over one hundred ten of our junior children attend the parish Sunday School in Alert Bay, and nine of our senior children, Mary Martin, Agnes King, Violet Ross, Allen Newman, Richard Carpenter, Leonard Mercer, Daniel Henwood, and Freddie Cook have offered themselves as teachers, in the work of teaching the young. Such a work is a very creditable one, and we would ask the prayers of all interested in our school that these young people may in their work find a real field of service and inspiration to bigger or and greater things when their time comes to leave the school. We realise that we must get the senior children actively interested in Church work whilst at school if they are to carry on when they go home to their villages. Hence you will realise the great importance that we place on such an enterprise.\n\nYou will be interested to hear three of our children wrote the Entrance Examinations in June and we have to congratulate George Alfred of Alert Bay on making a very satisfactory pass. He will be taking High School work with us this fall.\n\nQuite a number of children, mostly from Massett in the Queen Charlotte Islands stayed in school during the summer months of this year, and we are glad to say that they had a most pleasant time. The move to allow children to stay in school during the vacation is meeting with a great deal of favour by our Indian people, as those who stayed in during the holidays are without exception in better condition when school opens than those who went out to the canneries. The youngsters who stayed in with us this year, had a wonderfully happy time and as a result of their regular meals and plenty of sleep, that they were able to obtain at that time, are off to a flying start in the new school year. If more of our Indian friends could see the value of leaving their children in school, say every other year, there is no doubt that the health standard as well as the moral and academic would be considerably advanced. All too often, the two months holiday set them back in health to a considerable extent.\n\nWe are all now looking forward with interest to keeping St. Michael's Day at the end of this month. This day is to be a great one in our school year, as far as athletics are concerned, and our children are now busy practising for the races and other events of that day. We will give you a full report of the events of St. Michael's Day in our next newsletter.\n\nWe would like all our Indian people and parents of our children to make a real effort this year to write to their youngsters at least once a month. We encourage the children to write home regularly and provide them with paper, envelopes and stamps. Yet we do have children who do not hear from home once during the school year. This tends to make them forget the ties of home, as well as making them considerably unhappy at times. Now as most of our Indian people can either write themselves, or can get someone to write for them, there is really no excuse why the children in school should not hear from home at least once every few weeks. We would suggest if stamps cannot be afforded, that three or four families might put their letters together and send them direct to the Principal, who will see that the\nWe also wish to tell you that this year, any money or parcels sent for the children will be acknowledged direct from the office of the school with a school receipt form. We have found in the past that some children do not always acknowledge gifts from home, and we know how anxious parents must be if they send parcels or money to their children and then hear no word as to their arrival. If you do not get a receipt from the school inside of two weeks, please write and enquire further from the Principal.\n\nSuch a lot of our new children especially the younger ones, seem to have such bad teeth when they come to school, that when the dentist comes, all he can do is to pull a lot of them out. This is too bad, as mothers should try their best to take care of the first teeth, which are very important to the health of the children. Bad and decaying teeth such as we find in so many mouths are responsible for a lot of the sickness among the younger children. Will you not try this winter to take more care of the youngsters' teeth. Teach them to clean them with a brush, or better still clean them yourself, and then keep the brush in a proper place. The large amount of candy eaten by so many Indian children makes it absolutely necessary that they clean their teeth twice a day at least.\n\nWishing you all a very happy winter and praying the work of all the missions along the coast may be greatly blessed as they settle down for the winter's endeavours,\n\nBelieve me, with kind regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nMr D.C.Scott, C.M.G.\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr Scott:-\n\nThe Executive Committee M.S.C.C., at its meeting yesterday, very cordially approved the recommendation of its Indian Residential School Commission, that the name of Mr F.E.Anfield, though he is not in Holy Orders, should be submitted to you for promotion from the position of Acting Principal to that of Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nThe reasons submitted, by the Commission, are set out in the enclosed copy, in part, of letter, dated Dec.11th. 1931 received from Dr.Westgate.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nGeneral Secretary M.S.C.C.\nTHE MISSIONARY SOCIETY OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN CANADA.\n\n39-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave.E.\nWINNIPEG, Man. Dec.11th. 1931.\n\nRev. Canon S.Gould, M.D., D.C.L.\nGeneral Secretary M.S.C.C.\n604 Jarvis St.\nTORONTO.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\n\"Some time ago Mr Anfield who holds the position of Acting Principal of our Society's Indian Residential School at Alert Bay, requested the Commission to have his status changed to that of Principal. He was informed at that time of the ruling of the Society that Principalships were given to men in full Orders only, and after they had been in charge of a school for some years. He was also informed that appointments to Principalships were subject to the approval of the Indian Department, who, if they approved the same, would have the appointment confirmed by an Order-in-Council.\n\nMr Anfield has been in charge of the Alert Bay School since January 1st. 1927, and in view of the satisfactory services he has rendered, coupled with the fact that the Rector of Alert Bay is able to discharge the duties of Chaplain to the school, the Commission agreed, at a meeting held on the 8th inst. to ask the Executive Committee M.S.C.C. to recommend to the Indian Department that his status be changed from \"Acting Principal\" to that of \"Principal\".\n\nIn taking this action the Commission did not desire it to be understood that they favoured a change in the existing policy and regulation which requires Principals to be men in full Orders. It is their opinion that the situation at Alert Bay is exceptional - (1) because of the close location of the Rector of the local parish to the school, and the happy relationship which exists between the school and the parish, and (2) because the Acting-Principal, although a Layman, has rendered such faithful and efficient services for nearly six years. They feel, therefore, that Mr Anfield is entitled to the encouragement and recognition which the change in status would afford, and they trust that their recommendation may be accepted by the Executive Committee and also by the Indian Department.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nFaithfully, Yours,\n\n(sgd) T.B.R.Westgate,\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nGEN.

Accompanying His Honour were Major H. S. Humphreys, A.D.C., and Mr. A. M. D. Fairbairn, Private Secretary.\n\nAs soon as the anchor of Canada's own warship dropped into the placid waters of the Bay, the Provincial Police boat bearing an official welcome party moved alongside and were received by Commander Brodeur of the \"Skeena\" and the Governor's Secretary, who escorted the party below where they were introduced to His Honour. Arrangements for the four day visit were rapidly consummated, and that evening His Honour came ashore and was entertained at the home of Mr. W. M. Halliday, Indian Agent, where a representative gathering of citizens spent a pleasant evening.\n\nThe \"Skeena\" was thrown open for public inspection on Sunday and a large number of residents boarded the splendid vessel on a tour of inspection.\n\nAt 2:30 P.M. Sunday the Lieutenant Governor and party came ashore and were met by the Principal of the Indian Residential School, Mr. Indian Agent Halliday, and Rev. C. K. K. Prosser, the Chaplain of the school. Arriving at the school, His Honour planted a tree in commemoration of this, his first visit to Alert Bay, and then the party proceeded into the large and spacious auditorium where the entire student body and staff, numbering over 225, rose to greet him. A short programme was carried out, the children taking part in the singing of \"O Canada\" and the National Anthem. In a few well-chosen words, His Honour gave a message to the children of the school, and informed them that he was giving for annual competition a medal to be presented to the pupil earning the highest marks in the Provincial Government Entrance examinations. A picturesque touch was added to the ceremony when two of the younger children carried forward a flag-draped table which was presented to His Honour as a mark of esteem and as a souvenir of this, his first visit to an Indian Residential School. The gift proved to be a beautifully inlaid chess table in five native woods, the entire work having been done by two of the boy pupils of the school in the manual training section.\n\nFollowing the brief ceremony in the auditorium, the official party inspected the entire school and were then entertained by the Principal and staff at a delightfully informal tea, following which His Honour proceeded back to the \"Skeena\".\nThat evening a community service was held in the Anglican Church at which the Rector, Rev. C. K. K. Prosser and the United Church minister, Rev. W. H. Ashford, officiated. His Honour the Lieutenant Governor and A. D. C. attended this service, during which Mr. Ashford gave an inspiring address on the need of broader views and firmer faith if the destiny of Canada was to be fulfilled and this country become the home of a Christian race.\n\nNearly four hundred children from the settlement of Alert Bay were, through the courtesy of Commander Brodeur enabled to pay a visit of inspection to the \"Skeena\" on Monday afternoon, when the launches of Mr. W. M. Halliday, Indian Agent, and Mr. Harry Douglas, Fishery Inspector, were placed at the disposal of the youngsters to take them out to the warship anchored in the Bay. The children were thrilled at the sights unfolded before their eyes, as the large majority of them had never at any time seen a vessel comparable in any way to the \"Skeena\". From the deepest depths to the highest bridge they ran, in spite of rain and the slippery decks, and though the adults may have \"inspected\" the ship on Sunday, it is a truism indeed that the children \"searched\" it very thoroughly on Monday. They kept the sailors busy with weird and wonderful questions, none of which however seemed to lack for an answer of some kind or other. The thanks of the residents of Alert Bay are certainly due to Commander Brodeur, his staff and crew for their extreme courtesy in making such a visit possible.\n\nThe playground of St. Michael's Residential School was the scene of a stern combat when football teams representing the \"Skeena\" and the School met at 3:15 P.M. on this day in a very exciting match. Honors went to the School, to the tune of 6:0 but the disadvantages of poor ground and a gravelly pitch made things very difficult for the sailors. The game was refereed by Constable F. Putland, but we are glad to say that his official services were not at any time in demand. The score was not indicative of the game, which was a very good one, and in the first half might have been anyone's victory.\n\nTeams from the \"Skeena\" and the School met again, in the evening in a basketball game which was a duel to the finish. The \"Skeena\" boys netted a long fast shot with less than twenty seconds to go, winning a victory of thirteen to the twelve scored by the School. This was one of the finest exhibitions of basketball ever seen in this district, and the boys from the ship are to be congratulated on having such a team, more so when it must be remembered that opportunities for practice must necessarily be few.\n\nThe visit of His Honour the Lieutenant Governor and the \"Skeena\" wound up with a magnificent public reception and dance on Monday evening when four hundred citizens met to do honor to the representative of His Majesty the King in this province. The affair was informal, and all made themselves at home and were made to feel at home by His Honour who received them with a hearty handclasp and a word of welcome. Dancing was carried on until well on into the night hours, a large party of sailors from the \"Skeena\" enjoying\nthemselves in their characteristically nautical fashion.\n\nEarly Tuesday morning a short puff of smoke from the steam whistle of the \"Skeena\" signified the hoisting of the anchor and the closing of a chapter that will go down in memory as one of the most pleasant in the history of Alert Bay.\nFebruary 10, 1932.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with enclosures, and in reply I am pleased to state that the Department concurs in the appointment of Mr. F. E. Anfield to the principalship of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.D., D.C.L.,\nGeneral Secretary, M. S. C.

Like yourselves, our children have gone through the forty days of the Lenten season; they have tried in special services to understand how to love God in everyday life; they journeyed on Good Friday with those who with sorrowful hearts saw our Blessed Lord walk the road to Calvary; but our hearts were not as sad as theirs, because beyond the veil and through the gloom and darkness that overhung the Tree of crucifixion, we could see the dawning glory of Easter which was so soon to turn a seeming failure and defeat into the most glorious triumph of all time. And if you had heard the children sing the great hymns of Easter, you, like us, would thank God for their beautiful faith, for they really rejoiced in the glory of the Risen Lord, and we believe that their Easter was the more greatly blessed because they had tried so hard to keep a good Lent.\n\nEaster Monday the sun shone for the first time for oh so long. It seemed like a special Blessing, so we all had a wonderful Sports Meet on our new racing track. Fifty-two events were run off before 2 P.M., when, because we had finished, down came the rain again. Some very good races were seen, the senior champion, Fred Cook of Alert Bay running the 100 yards in ten and two-fifths seconds. The mile brought the same boy home, first in four minutes thirty-eight seconds, which was pretty good for a new and yet rough track. Jack Hanuse took the pole vault at 6'4\" and the 120 yard hurdles in 35 seconds, whilst Frank Wilson captured the broad jump with 16'6\". Young Billy Alfred took the Intermediate championship winning four out of five events entered, as also did the running-up Daniel Hanuse, whose little brother Freddie won the Junior championship, also winning four out of five events. In the girls' side, Stella Robinson took senior honour, Mary Boyd the Intermediate and Alice Macdonald the Juniors for the non-one time running. The younger girls did some very good work, but the seniors are still rather shy. Sports are now to them and our hopes at this line of endeavour must perform like in the younger generation.\n\nIn the evening the youngsters enjoyed seeing Harold Lloyd in \"Welcome Danger\" and the roof almost lifted between screams of laughter and those of terror. They had a great time and are now happily back at their studies for the last lap of the school year.\n\nWe are sorry indeed to tell you all that due to the need for economy, the Olympic will not be held this year. It will be a keen disappointment to the children who have been working faithfully to earn places on the school team. However they are young, and we are sure that many of them will make the grade for the Meet in 1933. Our school football team are they getting tuned up for May 24th, when they have to meet all comers to hold the Football Challenge Cup for the second time. It should be a great game.\n\nWe have added another teacher to our staff, making five classrooms working here and all children up to and including Grade 3 junior go to school all day. This is in line with Mr. Taylor's lowering the grade age in this school and will prove a decided help in getting the children along more quickly. The Principal recently went north to Bella Bella and was royally entertained by the entire village, to whom he was privileged to speak both in Church and in their community Hall on the work being done for their children in school. At the Sunday evening service, over four hundred were in church, which was packed to the doors. At a very wonderful concert...\nlasting from 7:30 P.M. until well after midnight, ex-pupils joined in many varied ways that they have learned much, both in skill and happiness. At another meeting an association of ex-pupils was formed, forty-nine signing the charter roll of members. One cannot pass on without raising a tribute to the wonderful work being done by Rev. & Mrs. Gibson and Dr. Darby, Medical Superintendent of the R.J. Large Memorial Hospital.\n\nSchool health continues fairly good, though we have had several children quite ill. This past winter has been a severe one on children all through the coastal villages, and we have not been free of our share of worry and sorrow. We have had a dentist here during the past month and it may interest you to know that he put fillings in 631 teeth and extracted 632. We can hardly say the youngsters enjoyed it, but they are very brave and good.\n\nSixty children are now busily preparing for the examiner of the Royal College of Music, whilst five are studying hard for the Entrance examinations. One boy is shortly to take up his Grade X studies in commercial work in Vancouver; you will wish them all success we are sure. They are busy days and they just fly along.\n\nAll interested in our Indian people will hear with regret of the retirement of Dr. Duncan C. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, who after fifty-five years work for the Indian people of Canada, is now to earn a well-deserved rest. Dr. Scott recently wrote to us wishing all in the school every success, and we echo back the wish that the success he has already earned may be attended by those joys and blessings that accompany the evening of a life well lived in service to his fellow-men.\n\nAll too soon we will have to give thought to the question of holidays and we will be glad to hear from some of our friends in the Indian villages giving us their views as to the most suitable dates for commencement of the annual vacations. We may say quite definitely that it is not our intention to allow as many children out as usual, though more of this latter.\n\nAlready we have a considerable waiting list of children seeking places in the school this fall, and parents desiring to have children admitted should arrange for the applications to go in to the Indian Agents as soon as possible.\n\nSpring is here now and our school gardens are soon to be beautiful with flowers and our fields with vegetables. We hope many of you will enjoy the same pleasure as we do in planting and growing the bountiful gifts of a loving God.\n\nThis must be all for this time, and with kindest regards to you all,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSt. Michael's Residential School\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nFebruary 15, 1933.\n\nE.G. Newnham, Esq.,\nA/Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Newnham:\n\nAfter considerable thought we have to ask you to place the question of vacation for the pupils of this school before your Department for their consideration and advice.\n\nWe have to apply for a vacation period for this year of two months, same to start on June 15 approximately ending August 15 approximately. This period will be for the main body of the school. There is a group, however of local boys with perhaps a few girls, regarding whom special consideration is asked. As you are aware, fishing opens in the Nimpkish River on May 1st and we have among our senior pupils a number of boys who belong to the Nimpkish tribe who have been asked to take positions in boats working in the river this year. Parents have applied to us for permission for them to leave school at the start of the fishing season and we have informed them that we cannot concur in any such request as it would mean the disorganization of most of our senior classes of the school. We have however promised to recommend to the Department that this special group be allowed to take their vacation as from June 1st for a period of two months on a grant earning basis. If for any reason it was felt necessary or advisable to extend this period, it would be understood that the school would draw no grants for the additional period of leave granted. The problem this year appears to be largely an economic one, and the only hope of many of these youngsters earning any money this year would seem to be by their taking these positions not later than June 1st. In their case we would request that you recommend to the Department to allow their vacation to start from this date.\n\nEnclosed please find copies of correspondence between the School and Inspector of Schools G.H. Barry of your Department. Our entire High School Entrance class writing examinations this year is composed of boys of an age permitting them to work and earn funds for the maintenance of their people during the coming winter and to assist in the necessary expenses of cloth-\ning and transportation to and from school. This correspondence speaks for itself and we would request that you consider it with a view to giving your concurrence to the suggestion outlined by the Inspector. This would permit all pupils of the school to get away on their vacation on the date recommended for the closing of school for the two summer months.\n\nWe would be grateful if you would ask the Department to give us their views regarding which children are to be allowed home and which retained in school, and further as to the possibility of the Department making any grant towards transportation for pupils proceeding home on vacation. It will, as in former years, be necessary to send escorts with the children proceeding home, and we would ask that you recommend an amount of $72.00 to cover expenses in this connection.\n\nWe would also appreciate a ruling from the Department as to whether or not children whose courses are completed and who are being graduated from school this year may expect the Department to pay their fare home.\n\nThanking you,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\"F. Earl Anfield\"\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 28th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the holiday period at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School this summer.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the vacation period may commence on June 15th and extend to August 15th.\n\nWith regard to the special group who, it is desired, should be allowed to leave on June 1st, it has been decided to leave this matter with the Principal and yourself to make whatever arrangements you consider necessary in the circumstances.\n\nIt might be well to accept the offer made by Inspector Barry, viz., that he visit the Alert Bay School during the early part of May and carry out a testing programme with the senior grades in order that he can decide what pupils should be promoted.\n\nIn preparing the June and September quarter returns, care should be taken to show the exact date on which each pupil leaves for holidays and the date of their return. Grant should not be requested for more than two months' leave.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nE. G. Newnham, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nFebruary 18, 1933.\n\nFile # 23-2\n\nSir:\n\nThe attached copies of correspondence which I have received from Mr. F.E. Anfield, Principal of the Alert Bay Residential School are for your information, and I would recommend that his request in regard to allowing pupils to leave school on the dates stated be granted.\n\nThis matter has been viewed from all possible angles and it is impossible at the present time to furnish any probable forecast as to how the operations of the coming fishing season are likely to develop. I understand that in past years there has been some possibility of making an approximate estimate of this, but this year it is unsafe to do anything of the kind.\n\nHowever the special arrangements that Mr. School Inspector Barry proposes to make if carried out, would render the whole question less complex.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(E.G. Newnham)\nA/Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nFebruary 8, 1933.\n\nInspector of Schools G.H. Barry,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe would much appreciate your views as to whether or not we are justified in holding our pupils for Entrance exams until the end of June, when by so doing they will forfeit their chances of getting a job at fishing this summer. As perhaps you know, fishing starts early in June this year, and in the Nimpkish before then. There are signs of considerable curtailment as regards the number of boats, and already the parents are writing to their children informing them that they have positions for them provided that they are there to take the boats over on the first day of fishing. We have six boys in the Entrance class, five of whom came from the Shuswap Agency and already have jobs booked for this summer on the one condition that they are available by June 16th to take them on. The other boy is a local and has an offer of a place in a drag seine over at the river if he can be there by the 1st of June. He is Daniel Hanuse, with a widowed mother. We have two Grade IX pupils Jack Hanuse and Agnes King. The former was sick all last summer and has not earned anything to help his mother and a large family for two years. Again, there is the question, are we justified in holding him to write Grade IX Government exams and thereby depriving him of his chance to earn enough to make it possible for him to come back to school next year and continue his course.\n\nThe problem seems to be an economic one entirely; the parents are glad and in most cases anxious for their boys to go on and complete their courses provided that they themselves can earn sufficient to make expenses of fares and clothing needed, and where possible contribute something to the support of the family. Otherwise the parents say that if the children are not given an opportunity of earning, then they cannot return them to school. We are quite satisfied that competition is keen enough this year to deprive late arrivals of any opportunity of getting boats or gear.\n\nYour remarks will be awaited with interest.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA.\n\nFebruary 10, 1933.\n\nE.E. Anfield, Esq.,\nSt. Michael's Indian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in which you refer to the question of justification in holding some of your Grade 8 and Grade 9 pupils in school long enough for them to take the examinations set by the Provincial Department of Education at the end of next June.\n\nIn your letter you mention that Agnes King is one of your two Grade 9 pupils. In the list you gave me during my last inspection of the school your Grade 9 girl is named Ellen Newman. Are these just two names for the same girl? It was Ellen Newman who was examined by me, and who made a score of 95 in the B.C. Achievement Test on October 17, 1932. Perhaps you would be good enough to clear up this matter in your next letter.\n\nI have given some considerable thought to the questions raised in your letter, and have come to the following opinion.\n\nThe parents of the children concerned should be communicated with, if this has not been done, and it should be pointed out that for the children to miss taking their B.C. Departmental examinations is a grave matter, and may have a very unfortunate result on their future educational progress. I wish to make it very clear that those children who fail to obtain Entrance Certificates will be unable to take advantage of High School instruction under the B.C. Department of Education, either in the way of a Correspondence Course or by instruction at a Technical High School. The substance of this paragraph should be communicated to the boys themselves, and their wishes taken into consideration.\n\nOwing to the peculiar economic conditions of the present time, and to the fact that you certify that the six boys of your Grade 8 class will be actually employed during the period for which they are given leave of absence, I consider that it would be unfair to keep them in school till the end of June. To thus force the boys to remain till after the conclusion of the Entrance examination would probably cause strained feeling between the boys, their parents and the school authorities. This would be particularly unfortunate in the case of the boys from the North.\n\nShould you so desire, I am prepared to visit your school during the early part of next May, to carry out a testing programme with the Senior grades, particularly with the Entrance candidates. If I do this, the decision as to the promotion of these children to a Grade 9 class in September must be left in my hands. Those whom I do not consider fit then for High School must, if they return to school, repeat Grade 8 next year.\nYour wholehearted agreement in this is necessary if I am to devote several days during a particularly busy period of the year, to the carrying out of this special work for your Indian children. The matter contained in this letter is to be taken as a professional opinion, and in no sense an authority for the giving of this special leave of absence to some of the boys of your school. The Indian Agent will no doubt have to be consulted, and the matter taken up in the ordinary manner.\n\nYour Senior Teacher should have the Grade 7, Grade 8 and Grade 9 children write examinations in all the subjects of their courses. These examinations might well be taken just before Easter. The marks out of 100 in each subject ought to be tabulated against the name of the candidate, so that I can see at a glance the Name of the child, Standing in Class, Age, Mark in each subject, Total percentage obtained, and teacher's estimate of attitude to work and suitability for promotion.\n\nMy own work in the classroom will be supplementary to this and will take the form of Standard Tests in certain of the subjects, and an Intelligence Test.\n\nPlease consult your Senior Teacher with regard to the above, and let me have a reply when the matter is finally approved through the Indian Agent, so that I may plan my future itineraries to suit. I should have to visit you on my way to other schools on the coast and in the North, and a number of arrangements have to be made well ahead.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Gerald H. Barry\"\n\nGHB\nDistrict Inspector of Schools, B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nJune 21st, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with your letter dated June 10th, re the above, I have to state that when the matter referred to therein was first brought to me, it had reached a stage where it was obviously impossible for the Principal to adjust it, he being one of the parties against whom the complaining teacher had a grievance and I succeeded in inducing the lady to consent to having it brought to the notice of Dr. Westgate of the Anglican Indian Residential School Commission, in preference to her having her case put into the hands of a lawyer.\n\nAt no time did it reach a stage where it was necessary for the Department of Indian Affairs to enter, although it was undoubtedly in my capacity as acting Indian Agent that Dr. Westgate requested me to act in company with Rev. C.K.K. Prosser and Mr. F.F. Anfield in investigating the matter. The result of this investigation has been reported to Dr. Westgate and certain staff re-adjustments are being made at the Residential School. I have now withdrawn from the case entirely.\n\nApart from the combination of unfortunate circumstances which led to the trouble, I would point out that amongst the white community of Alert Bay\u2014not a large one\u2014there are certain people who are always ready to criticize, condemn and also obstruct the different phases of work involved in taking care of the Indians and just now keen resentment is being expressed by this particular faction of the white community, at the public expense entailed in the maintenance of the Indian Residential School at Alert Bay with the result that the slightest opportunity of attaching the slightest breath of scandal to the institution is made the most of.\n\nIn this case, it is believed that the loyalty and the proper conduct of the staff as a body, in the contacts with outside members of the community, have obviated the possibility of any reflection being cast upon the honour of the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\n(P.O. Newnham)\nA/Indian Agent.\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nJune 6th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nPursuant to my letter dated June 3rd, I have to report that in compliance with a request from Dr. Westgate, head of the Anglican Indian Residential School Commission telegraphed from Winnipeg, a committee was formed consisting of the Rev. C.K.K. Prosser, Anglican Rector at Alert Bay, F.E. Anfield Esq., Principal, St. Michael's Indian Residential School and myself as acting Indian Agent, for the purpose of determining whether the complaints of Miss Annie Ripley, a teacher of the Residential School warranted an investigation by the Commission.\n\nI declined to make any comment or take part in any discussion relating to the lady's teaching abilities, stating that this was within the purview of Capt. G.H. Barry, District Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., who was due to arrive at Alert Bay on June 7th, in connection with other business.\n\nOn June 5th, the committee dealt with the matter, a series of discussions taking place first between Rev. C.K.K. Prosser and Mr. Anfield, then between Mr. Prosser, Mr. Anfield and myself followed by one between Mr. Prosser and myself.\n\nOn Miss Ripley being called, Mr. Anfield requested to be allowed to withdraw but was subsequently recalled on my support of Miss Ripley's contention that he should be present during the whole of the proceedings. The final discussion was by all three members of the committee with Miss Ripley present, submitting her evidence both documentary and oral, which was dealt with and the following decisions were reached.\n\n(1) So far as the Commission were concerned, the allegations of unprofessional conduct made by Miss Ripley against the head matron\u2014Miss Leonard\u2014had been disposed of, as Miss Leonard was leaving the institution on June 30th, next, whether by resignation or dismissal was not disclosed, but apparently she was content to leave without making any defence to the charges against her. Miss Ripley was not desirous of taking her case to a lawyer and stated that as Dr. Westgate was now evidently giving it further consideration, she was prepared to abide by his decision. This phase of the matter was therefore not pursued.\n\n(2) The Principal\u2014Mr. Anfield\u2014admitted that he had not\nhe had not\n\nbeen aware of all the facts and agreed that a \"terrible mistake\" had been made which had caused Miss Ripley considerable physical hardship and mental worry during the past six months. He therefore approved of Miss Ripley writing a report to the Commission stating her case in full, which would be accompanied by a covering letter from himself in which he would seek to nullify the effects of an adverse report which he had previously submitted on Miss Ripley and which no doubt had led to her being officially notified that her teaching contract which automatically terminated on June 30th next, could not be renewed. Miss Ripley stated that she would like to remain on the Residential School staff if possible, but if not she had no desire to leave \"under a cloud\". This was her chief concern and had led to her bringing her case to me, she and the Principal apparently being at cross purposes. She implied that her father would go to any expense to see that she was justly dealt with. However she was satisfied with this decision and again agreed to abide by Dr. Westgate's decision.\n\nLast December, whilst playing basket-ball at the school with pupils and other staff members, Miss Ripley was accidentally hurt. She suffered great pain but continued with the game and in the course of a few days was admitted to hospital where she was treated for pleurisy being subsequently diagnosed as tubercular by the local doctor, she was not \"X-rayed\" at that time, but it later transpired that she had actually sustained fractures of a number of ribs. Suffering great pain but being unaware of the nature of her injury she had carried on teaching after discharge from hospital, under most difficult conditions which had made her irritable and drew some censure from the Principal. She then obtained leave to go to Vancouver, where she was examined by Dr. G. Barker a specialist, who furnished her with a certificate stating that she was not tubercular and which in fact was a \"clean bill of health\".\n\nWhilst in hospital, she came under the care of Miss Leonard, at that time on the hospital staff and who a short time later was appointed Head Matron at the Residential School where evidently the bad feeling which existed between her and Miss Ripley was renewed, Miss Ripley being subjected to further mental stress by Miss Leonard's allegedly open statements to the effect that she (Miss Ripley) was \"tubercular\" \"a mental case\" and other remarks as to her physical condition, which lead to her being practically ostracized by other members of the staff. This had its effect on her teaching and resulted in Mr Anfield rendering an adverse report to the Commission, also in her class not making a good showing during a recent inspection by the Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\n\nBefore referring the case to Dr. Westgate, I took an affidavit from Miss Carol, another member of the staff, who swore to having heard Miss Leonard make the statements complained of.\ncomplained of.\n\nMiss Ripley is a lady of mature age, and apart from official duties, courtesy demanded that I give her complaints some attention and I do not regret bringing them to the attention of Dr Westgate, in whose hands they now rest. As an official of the Department of Indian Affairs, I feel compelled to make the following comment.\n\nMr F.B. Anfield, is undoubtedly a very capable school principal, but according to statements made during this recent inquiry, which he himself admitted, he evidently has difficulty at times\u2014probably due to him being a young man and a bachelor\u2014in maintaining proper discipline in regard to some members of the staff.\n\nHeated controversies in his office, which can possibly be overheard by pupils\u2014Indian children\u2014regardless of whether the door is closed or shut, and remarks addressed to him by a member of the staff, such as \"If you think so much of Miss Leonard, why don't you marry her and take her off to your own residence?\" would appear to savour somewhat of insubordination and not conducive to the proper upbringing of Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G. Newnham\n(A/Indian Agent)\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 10, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, relative to the complaint made to you by a teacher on the staff of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School as set forth in your letter.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the discipline and harmony of the staff are matters which should be adjusted by the Principal of the school, and, in this case, by the Missionary Society of the Anglican Church, under whose auspices the school is conducted. It is noted that you have taken this matter up with Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C., and he informed you enquiry would be made into the matter complained of by the teacher. At the present stage, the matter does not appear to be one which this Department should be called upon to enter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. G. Newnham, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir,\n\nOn June 1st, Miss Annie Ripley, a teacher on the staff of St Michael's Indian Residential School called on me and made certain complaints against the present matron of the school and to a lesser degree against the principal.\n\nThe lady was distressed and somewhat overwrought and undoubtedly indulged in personalities which I persuaded her to eliminate. She sought my advice in my capacity as Justice of the Peace. After hearing her story I decided that if the matron's conduct had been as Miss Ripley stated and which was corroborated by the affidavit of another member of the school staff, that the matter could not be dismissed as trivial, particularly as, apparently through no fault of her own, circumstances had arisen which would in a most unfair way jeopardise Miss Ripley's future career.\n\nThe most serious of Miss Ripley's allegations are in regard to the fact that after being examined by the local doctor, she received an adverse report as to her physical condition which was publicly discussed by the matron of the school, who is a qualified nurse and who before assuming her present duties was engaged at the Alert Bay Hospital. Being considerably distressed and subjected to unnecessary annoyance she was subsequently examined by a specialist in Vancouver, who furnished her with an absolutely clean \"bill of health\" and whose report she showed to me.\n\nMiss Ripley further informed me that on lodging a complaint with the principal\u2014Mr. P.E. Anfield\u2014he had dismissed it with a remark to the effect that \"the Commission at Winnipeg were always receiving complaints and took no notice of them\". I then decided to accede to her request and wire to Dr. Westgate head of the Indian Residential School Commission and I have today received a telegraphic reply that the Commission is taking the necessary steps immediately to inquire into conditions at St Michael's.\n\nIn its present stage the matter does not appear to come within the purview of the Department of Indian Affairs. I was appealed to judicially and feel that in bringing it to\nthe notice of the Indian Residential School Commission, I have done all that it is necessary for me to do, unless the Department gives me other instructions, and therefore refrain from all comment.\n\nIt is perhaps unnecessary to state that under normal circumstances, I do not interfere with the management of the St Michael's Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G.

D.I.A. Harold W. McGill.\nMiss D. Winstanley: Age 21.\n\nMiss Winstanley is quite unsuitable for a teaching position in any Indian school. She is a very small girl, not as big as many of the girls at Alert Bay, her control of her class is simply non-existent. Her appointment here was authorized by Dr. Westgate, M.M. of the L. S. C. C., and like many other of the appointments made by the Anglican Church to the teaching staff here, appears to me to be most unfortunate. Dr. Westgate told me this girl has a B. C. Teaching Certificate. As a matter of fact only INTERIM CERTIFICATES are issued at the close of Normal training, and it is one of these which Miss Winstanley holds at present. The mere holding of a teaching certificate of this nature does not imply any particular ability to teach or control Indian children. We have numbers of well trained and recommended ANGLICAN teachers, and I fail to see why such inferior candidates should be selected by the Church. I WOULD RECOMMEND MISS WINSTANLEY'S DISMISSAL AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY. This matter has been thoroughly discussed with the Principal of the School, Mr. Amfield, and I believe he agrees with me.\nSt. Michael's Indian Reserve School, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nNews Letter No. 1 - 1933-1934\n\nTo the Parents, all Ex-Pupils & Supporters of the School:\n\nMy dear Friends;-\n\nA long time has passed since last we sent out a news letter to you all, but it has not been on account either of lack of news or of interest, but due to a combination of work and financial stress. We feel the need of contact between the school and our friends is however so important, that whatever expense is required will somehow or other be forthcoming, so here we go for Number One news letter for this term.\n\nSchool re-opened with a capacity attendance towards the end of the month of August. The children who did not go home had a wonderful time at our school camp, and they are certainly among the healthiest of our children today. It is hoped that the camp will continue each year and that more of our Indian people will see the wisdom of leaving their children in charge of the school each summer, especially in these times when money for fares is so difficult to obtain.\n\nWe are sorry for our Indian people in the far north who this year faced one of the worst fishing years in the history of the Coast, but it is a fine thing to know that so many of them worked hard to be able to send their children back to school. What a big step forward it would be if more of our people could see the wisdom of leaving younger children at home in the villages with the older people and those without work, instead of all going off to the Cannaries where living is so much more expensive and where so many often have to live on the small earnings of the few. If more people stayed in the villages, more gardens could be planted with potatoes, fruit and vegetables and there would be a lot less distress and poverty during the winter months. It is hardly worth while to plant a garden in the spring and then go and leave it for three or four months, where as if more people spent their summer months at home, they themselves would be healthier and the gardens would have good care and would produce much more food for you. It is quite certain that the young children would be better at home than around canneries where machinery within and wharves without are ever present dangers to the youngsters. It is hoped that our Indian young people will try and see the wisdom of this suggestion and then sell the idea to the older folks.\n\nThe bad summer and fishing season had its effect on the health of the children who went out from school for vacation, as most of them returned underweight and became easy victims of the flu which visited us just after school opened. At the time of writing, however, the general health of the student body is very good and the children are practically all gaining in weight and look well. They are certainly a lively crowd this year and keep us all on the jump.\nAll the classrooms are busy and the children working with keenness and energy. We have the biggest High School class in the history of the school and it is our hope that as the years go by, the standard will get steadily higher and the general grade age of the children improve. It must be the effort of us all to build up the mental equipment of all our Indian young people, not just a few here and there, and here is where the villages must help more and more. We are all facing difficult times and it is hard to see just what the future holds. I am quite certain, however, that the future holds more for the boy or girl with an education than for those without, and it is the duty of every Indian mother and father to see that their children have as good or better chance than they had themselves, because the need of men and women trained to think things out in bad times is greater than in good times when life moves along easily and we do not have to worry from whence is coming our next meal. Your greatest duty is to see that your children get to the day school when they are young. See that they attend regularly and back up the teacher and missionary in what they are trying to do. The biggest difficulty we have to face in the Residential School is the lack of day school education in the children that come to us. We have to spend money on primary education you should have given to your children in their own villages. This money could well be spent on more technical work for the older children, but, until our Indian people really get in and use the day schools provided for the young children, they are holding back the work of these larger schools and it is their own children that suffer as a result. When a girl or boy comes to us at eleven or twelve years of age, unable even to get into grade one, you can hardly expect us to be able to do as much for him or her as for a child who has been going regularly to the day school and goes right into grade three or four when admitted here. This is one of the biggest reasons for keeping children at home during the summer. It would mean that the day school could be started in September instead of November. Do you know that as I write this letter, there are day schools not yet started because children are still out with their parents fishing. This is not right and the day will come when the parents will be bitterly sorry for it, because their children will blame them for not giving them a chance to equip themselves with education for the battle of life.\n\nNow a word or two for those girls and boys who graduated this past term. Do not think, will you, that your education is completed because you have ceased to be a pupil of St. Michael's? You have only changed your school, from Alert Bay to your village. Whether you have gone up a grade or down depends pretty largely upon yourself, doesn't it? Your teachers have changed too, from those here to your parents, the missionary and your friends. I do hope you will all give them the same attention and respect as you gave to us here at school. You enjoyed learning here or you should have - I hope you will enjoy learning in your school, that of home and village life. Be careful that you choose only the best teachers. In school you learned that everything depends on our Christianity or lack of it, and really, it is just the same at home. Be as faithful there as you were here.\nregular in your attendance at the services of your Church, take a real and active part in Church life. Make a real friend of your missionary. I know most of them and you will find them fine fellows and anxious to be your friends. They are hoping great things of you; so are we; and of course God is too. Don't disappoint anyone, will you. It is not always going to be easy, sometimes it is going to be as tough as possible. You are going to miss School I know. I did myself when I left school many years ago, and so can know how you will feel like. But I have found one friend all through life. I met Him first in school where I went when I was only five. So will you, Jesus Christ, the same today, yesterday and forever. In Alert Bay, at St. Michael's, in your home; in your parents, in your missionary, your Church and games and work; and oh I hope in your heart. He will help you make friends, good ones, who will stay with you when the storms come and that is when you need a friend, don't you? By the way, we would like ever so much for all girls and boys to write sometimes to the old school, your home for many years. Tell us how you get along, your joys and triumphs, yes and your defeats. We have them too and may be able to help you sometimes.\n\nDo you know that 1934 is our Golden Jubilee year? Fifty years ago the old school started and since then 450 boys and 200 girls have been through the school. We must try and plan a great re-union of ex-pupils next spring. What do you think about the month of February for a big re-union at St. Michael's? How many will come? Bring your basketball and football teams, and we could have a wonderful ten days of re-union and fellowship together.\n\nOur monthly challenge shield system is working again this year and on the girls' side, Lydia Brown's team, the Crescents won the Shield for September and October. On the boys' side, Madrick Nelson's team won in September and Roger Mercer's team in October.\n\nIt is nice to hear that Dave Bernard of Rivers Inlet, an ex-pupil of the school and a returned soldier, is a regular and trusted employee of the Dominion Government Hatchery at the Inlet.\n\nTwenty pupils are taking music this year, thanks to Mrs. Kenmuir, who gives her services so wonderfully in this way. As the course is free, we choose a few pupils from each village, thus trying to spread musical education over as large an area as possible.\n\nThe children have been greatly interested in the campaign for the Restoration Fund and have subscribed this year the sum of $85.00 to this great cause.\n\nOur Harvest Festival this year was held on Sunday, October 15th and as a result of a special appeal, the collections totalled $210.00.\nOur first word to you all must be one of very sincere greetings and all good wishes for the New Year now opened before us. May this year be to one and all the hope and answer of our deepest thought and prayer; may it be a period of making good the failures and disappointments of last year; and may the blessing of the good God and Father of all be upon you.\n\nWith these letters going out to the parents, you will find the half year reports of your children. Will you study them carefully and write to the youngsters about them, as it is a great help if they feel and know that you are deeply interested in their progress and welfare. As we look over the reports, we are impressed with the splendid health of the children. In spite of a short attack of colds, which was more or less general on the staff, our youngsters were not in better health than they are now and everyone who visits the school remarks on how wonderfully healthy and well they all look. With a family as large as ours, it may be expected that some sickness will prevail, but we are glad to tell you that throughout the Christmas festival, not one child was in our infirmary and only one little boy in the hospital.\n\nYou will of course want to know about the Christmas, won't you? We certainly had a very wonderful time, made the happier, I know by our children's efforts to make others happy as well as themselves. The great festival started with a pageant of the Nativity, shown in our Church, when the children were able to see the glorious story of the Incarnation acted before their own eyes. We believe there is room for great development of the dramatic form of teaching for our Indian children and we would be glad to offer our experience to any villages interested. We are giving careful thought at this time to staging on Good Friday the story of the Passion of Our Lord, using the entire staff and student body as the actors in the story.\n\nBut we must get back to our Christmas activities, mustn't we? The joyful day dawned fine and early, almost too early, and down into the school, beautifully decorated for the holiday, surged our huge family of over two hundred. Santa Claus had visited the dormitories during the night and so breakfast was chiefly an occasion for exchanging cards and greetings; following which, all prepared to offer their welcome to Him who at the first glad Christmas gave Himself to mankind for evermore, and Who, in very truth, came once again to earth to greet us and be greeted; and together we knelt in Communion with Him. It seemed no time till noon had come and all sat down to partake of the good things provided for the Christmas dinner. During the afternoon many group leaders were busy preparing for the great school service and Christmas tree. Once more as in previous years, the entire student body was divided into groups, representing the eight large tribes enrolled in the school, and our Hall was a glorious sight. At one end was the altar, the gift of the Staff to the School, with its riddles and beautiful hangings. In the centre of the Hall a huge Christmas tree, blazing with lights and banked with gifts for the children.\nAll around the walls were the wigwams, teepees, community houses and camp fires of the various tribes, the members of which were all dressed in costumes of the olden days. One does not describe these things well; one just remembers them; and as the organ pealed out the opening notes of \"O Come, all ye faithful\", a great silence reigned the whispered excitement of the children; and on silently thanked God for the privilege of being used in the work of showing Christ to these, His native children. It was a real Indian service, all in Indian dress, many painted and be-feathered; here and there gorgeous dancing blankets and grim masks - some stood, others knelt and yet others sat on the blankets strewn upon the floor; but all worshipped Him, the Lord of Light and Peace, Jesus Immanuel. Once more the children were given the opportunity of giving what they could for the needs of children less fortunate than themselves, and it was possible to send away next day a worthwhile gift to one of the poorest parishes in Vancouver. Our worship over, our gifts presented, the children prepared to receive their own and to the tinkling of bells, the old yet ever young Santa arrived and in short order our Christmas gift tree was stripped and the children playing with their presents. And so to bed.\n\nDuring the week that followed, high festival was held, group after group met for parties, culminating in a Xmas pantomime, staged and acted by the staff and entitled \"Robinson Crusoe and Mr. Ffriday\". We certainly did not realise until we saw them in this play, what talents had been hidden by our staff. This pantomime was presented twice; on the first night for the school and the second, it was given as a token of goodwill from the School to the whole community, and in all some seven hundred adults and children were enabled to enjoy a good laugh and a pleasant two hours of entertainment. All too soon the week passed by and we met at the close of the old year to thank the great Giver of All for blessings received; to ask His forgiveness for opportunities wasted; and as the New Year dawned; that His blessing may remain with us.\n\nSuch was Christmas, and it was a good time too; it gave us a chance to get close to the great love of God to men; and its joys; its divine spirit; and its great urge to give will stand us in good stead in the days that lie before us.\n\nWe have been thinking seriously for some time about starting a school band, we can get a good instructor locally; but the great drawback is the enormous cost of instruments, and we were wondering if some of our Indian friends in the villages of our Coast would not be able to donate us a few pieces here and there. I know that the people are keenly interested in music for their children, and we have a piano and organ class of nearly twenty who make wonderful progress. But as far as a band goes, we cannot do much without the instruments. Surely in each of our villages there must be unused instruments? Will you think of this and look around and if you have any instruments you care to donate, we will be glad to pay the freight on them. We would even be glad to accept them on loan and will take every care of them, should it not be possible to donate them outright.\nMuch thought is being given to the question of our anniversary this year, and we are inclined to think that a celebration might be arranged to take place here at the school around May 24th, as this would seem to be a time when most of our villages could send teams for a week's games and festivities. Nothing definite has been settled, but enquiries are being made and we hope in our next letter to be able to tell you something fairly definite.\n\nNow a few words for our graduates and ex-pupils. Much thought is being given to your needs these days, ways and means are being sought to help you use the teaching, training and experience of school days, but I wonder often if we all really do enough ourselves. In every village of our Coast are groups of young men and women who passed through this school. If they were united in aim and effort to make their village the best there is, what a power they would be. We cannot do very much alone, we may say! Well, what about joining together in a group and, having definite aims and objects see what can be done. I am certain our missionaries will stand behind such an ex-pupil's association. Will you not give thought to forming a \"St. Michael's Club\" in every village\u2014ask your Missionary to become one of its officers, say the Chaplain. If any group will meet and form such a Club, and will write to me, I will send up a suggested outline of rules and possible forms of service that might be undertaken. There will have to be officers; there must be regular meetings and the Clubs must set a definite plan of how they will help forward the work and life of the village. What a help to some of our hard worked Missionaries it would be if a Club of say twenty or thirty young people would say \"him and mean it\u2014\"Here we are, what can we do to help your work\u2014we will stand with you and back you up in anything and everything that will extend the Kingdom of God in our village. Some Missionaries I know would at once think Heaven had come on earth. You would need a watchword. How \"All for Jesus\" and I say this because there is always the danger in Clubs of having a motto that works out like this \"All for us\"\u2014which is the cause of half the trouble in the world today. Above all, Clubs of this kind would mean much a lot to the graduates when they first reach home; something to carry on with from school days and something to join school life with the new life of a young man or woman at home.\n\nMay we in closing this letter thank one and all who in ways known and unknown, helped to make Christmas the happy time it was for our children, and may I add a personal word of thanks for the scores of cards and gifts sent me from friends up and down the coast and across Canada, and very especially the ex-pupils who wrote to me at the blessed time of Christmas. As I looked at my piled up desk on Christmas Day, my heart was very full for you all, and it shall ever be my prayer that I may be found more worthy to carry on this great work for you and yours.\n\nWith every good wish,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nF.

It is proposed:\n\n(1) That the School celebrate its fiftieth anniversary during the week May 20th to 26th.\n\n(2) That the affair have as definite objects for all participants (a) a revived spiritual emphasis (b) the arousing of a definite \"education\" consciousness (c) a more real sense of fellowship among the different villages of the coast (d) the friendly rivalry of competition in an organized sports meet.\n\n(3) Every village having graduate or ex-pupils will be invited to send a delegation, to comprise where possible a competitive unit for purposes of sports.\n\n(4) The following groups may be reasonably expected to appear as delegations: Naas River, (all villages) 12 participants - Bella Bella, 18 to 20 participants - Klemtu, 6 participants - Bella Coola, 6 participants.\n\n(5) These groups are the only ones around whom any expense may be involved and it is now suggested that the school will take no responsibility whatever for cost of travel to or from Alert Bay, but that between the dates suggested, viz; May 20-26th the school will board any active participants from villages north of the Queen Charlotte Straits; to wit, all villages named in para. 4.\n\n(6) That permission be granted the school to apply to the Department of Militia and Defence for the loan of tents and other essential equipment.\n2.\n\n(7) From the local agency it may be fully expected that participating groups will appear as follows:- Alert Bay, 18; Kingcome Inlet, 18; Village Island, 12; Cape Mudge 12; but as stated in para 5 these people will find habitation locally among friends.\n\n(8) From available data it would appear that a special grant of $300.00 will be required made up as follows:-\nFor board and all expense in connection with food $225.00\nFor freight and other charges 26.00\nFor prizes and incidental expenses 50.00\n\n(9) As the provision of this grant is essential, it will be as well to hold up definite arrangements until the Commission have given their ruling.\n\n(10) It should be remembered that preliminary suggestions have been very well received, and letters to hand evince a keen desire on the part of most villages to participate. It is my opinion that such an occasion would give a very real impetus to the work of the school, especially in its relation to the very live issue of follow-up work among the graduates.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nFEA/c Principal.\nEncl.2.\nQuestionnaire\n\nTo,-\nThe Chief Councillor or Leading Chief,\n\"Kitkathla, Aiyansh, Kincolith, Greenville,\nKlemtu, Bella Coola, Bella Bella, Alert Bay,\nVillage Island, Cape Mudge, Kingcome River.\"\n\nDear Friend:-\n\nSt. Michael's School, Alert Bay, is planning to keep this year its 50th Anniversary, and should it be possible for us to raise sufficient funds for same, we would like to arrange a week's celebration during which time we could have a re-union of graduate pupils of the school, represented by a delegation of graduates from each of the villages from which pupils have in the past been drawn to the school.\n\nBearing in mind the fact that nothing certain can be arranged until (a) we are sure of a financial grant to cover the expenses involved in such a celebration and (b) we have definite information from the villages re what part they can take in such a proposed re-union, it would be greatly appreciated if you will arrange at the earliest possible moment to call a meeting of all graduates and ex-pupils of this school, to which meeting we would earnestly beg you to invite your Missionary or any resident officer of the Indian Department so that their advice and help may be sought, and then to advise me as soon as possible of your views on the following points,-\n\n(1) Do you think this a suitable year in which to arrange for a re-union? If not, will you tell us why you do not agree?\n\n(2) What do you think about the week of May 20th to May 26th as the best time?\n\n(3) Could your village send 12 men who could form a football, basketball and track team?\n\n(4) Could your village send a team of girls as a basketball and track team?\n\n(5) Should the re-union be possible will your village take part?\n(6) Should your village take part, will you agree to provide transportation for all members of the delegation? (Should the re-union take place, we are recommending that the school will provide food and accommodation to all competing delegates from villages north of Vancouver Island.)\n\n(7) What do you think of this as a general outline of the week's programme?\n\n(a) Special religious services some of which to be lead by members from visiting villages.\n\n(b) Lectures by outstanding people on such subjects as Indian education and round table conferences on how the schools can help the Indian people more; what the Churches can do to help and what the Indians can do to help the Churches; and other subjects.\n\n(c) An inter-village track meet in which the school would enter competitors.\n\n(d) Football, baseball and basketball games between the competing villages and the school teams.\n\n(8) Have you any suggestion as to other activities that would be well included in the programme?\n\n(9) Should your village send a delegation, how and when would they arrive?\n\n(10) How many graduates boys and men - women and girls are resident in your village? We really hope you will give this matter very earnest consideration, and as time is short, an early reply will be appreciated.\n\nWith every good wish,\n\nYour very sincere friend,\n\n\"F. Earl Anfield\"\n\nPrincipal.\nMichael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nNews Letter No. 4. - ooOoo - March 12, 1934.\n\nMy dear Friends:\n\nTime flies along so fast at school that it seems only a very little while since we last wrote to you all, and yet it is getting on for two whole months, so it would seem a good thing to let you all know something of what is being done at St. Michael's for your children.\n\nFirst of all we are pleased to tell you that the children keep well and practically all of them are in splendid health. In a school as large as this it seems almost impossible to escape from sickness altogether, but the number of children ill seems to get less each year, which looks as if the general health standard is slowly improving in the villages, a tribute to the patient work being done both by the Indian Department and the Church in those places. The children are now well into the second half of the school year and many of them have been moved to higher grades, where we trust they will continue to make steady progress in their studies.\n\nAfter a very long and trying winter from the point of view of weather, the spring at last seems to be arriving and glorious sunny days are with us now, bringing new joy and healthy sun rays to the youngsters, with longer hours and brighter days for outside games.\n\nSo too in our Church life, the long days of Lent are moving on, and we strive to see beyond the darkness of the approaching Passiontide the glorious and certain hope of new and better life in the triumphant glory of the Feast of Easter.\n\nOn Good Friday in our Church we will endeavour to portray the \"Story of the Passion\" and many from the school, both pupils and staff, are among those chosen to act in this solemn play. May God help them all to reverently portray those terrible days in the earthly life of His Beloved Son; that through their service in word and action, others of His flock may learn to love Him more.\n\nThrough the kindness of the Superintendent of the Oriental Mission of B.C., we have secured the loan of a very fine set of slides on the life of our Blessed Lord, and these are being used in the mid-week Lenten services at the School. It is very wonderful to observe the reverence of the children as they see and hear that old but ever new story unfolded to them.\n\nDuring Lent we are undertaking our second year's drive for the Restoration Fund and once more the children have taken this great cause to their hearts and are giving generously as they did last year.\nOn Sunday next, March 18th, over fifty of our children will be presented to the Bishop of the Diocese for the sacred rite of Confirmation. For them all we ask your prayers as they take upon themselves fuller citizenship in the Kingdom of Our Lord and Saviour. May they go from strength to strength and be a power for good among their people.\n\nWith these newsletters to the parents, go out the holiday applications for this year and we would ask your careful attention to them and their quick return to the school so that plans may be made in plenty of time for the annual vacation. We would like you to know that a splendid site is being secured for a summer camp for the children who will remain with us during the holiday, and we would urge on you to give careful thought before deciding whether to take your children out or not. We know that last year was an exceptionally bad year for fishing, with the result that many of the children had but a poor holiday in the canneries, especially from the health standpoint. From the money side it was very bad and the school was put to considerable expense in getting some of the children back, so we want you to be very careful in what you do this year. Things do look a little better for this summer and I think fish prices will be higher, but we would urge our Indian people to keep away from strikes at all costs. They do nothing but harm and when the fish runs are so short, the fishermen are always the greater losers in the end.\n\nDuring the winter I have been able to visit several of the villages from which our children come to school, and I have been much impressed by the brave way in which our Indian people are trying to meet these difficult times. A long overdue visit was paid to Massett on the Queen Charlotte Islands, where the people gave me a splendid reception and welcome and when it was possible for them and the Principal to really get together and try to understand the problems and viewpoints of both parties. A remarkable band and choir concert was given, as a result of which I am the more certain that greater attention must be paid to choral and instrumental work in the school.\n\nIt is a pleasure to tell you that the proposed Re-union of ex-pupils of this school has been settled to take place in the week of May 20-26th, when we shall fittingly celebrate a half century of Residential School work in Alert Bay. We do hope that delegates from all the villages will be with us and every effort will be made to see that a worthwhile programme is put on. More detailed news of this great event will go forward to the villages direct in a little while.\n\nIn closing this letter, may we wish you one and all a very Happy and Holy Eastertide, with the prayer that into our hearts and minds may come the power and strength of the Risen Christ. May the victory that was His that first great Easter morn be ours by His help; may we learn that in Him, we too may conquer sin and death, and like Him, we too may rise to new life in His service, both here on earth and hereafter in Heaven above.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nF.E. Anfield, Principal\nOttawa, May 28, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, regarding the request of the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School for a grant for an increase of 10 in the pupilage.\n\nIn reply I have to say that it will not be possible to provide for an increased pupilage at this school during the current fiscal year. Our appropriation for per capita grants to Indian residential schools has been entirely assigned. There are many demands for increases, and the Department was unable to make any provision for an increase over the 200 for which the grant is allowed at the Alert Bay School. I may add, however, that when our Estimates for the next fiscal year are being prepared, full consideration will be given to the matter of an increased pupilage at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nSir,\n\nOn September 14th last I wrote the Department enclosing copy of a letter received from Mr. F.E. Anfield, Principal of St. Michael's Indian Residential School in which he requested an increase in per capita earning pupilage from the present scale of 200 up to 210.\n\nThe Department replied to this letter on September 25th, No. 156-0-1 stating consideration would be given to the matter of providing grant for an extra pupilage when the Estimates were being prepared for the next fiscal year.\n\nMr. Anfield has again written me requesting that this be granted for the next term commencing after the summer holidays. It might be as well for me to explain the situation somewhat so that the Department will be fully aware of our position. During the past year Mr. Anfield has carried in the school pupils in excess of 200 but has received no grant for them. In the Kwawkwahltlth Agency during the past year I have found a considerable number of children who are physically fit but who have no Day School available and I am insisting that these children be put into the Residential School. Three other Agencies to the north of us, namely Bella Coola, Skeena and Queen Charlotte, are also making demands on this school, and it would appear unless we can raise the pupilage some children who have no opportunity of education are going to be left out. There is ample accommodation in the school for 210 pupils, and so long as we are able to accommodate them properly I feel the pupilage grant should be raised to 210, and am therefore asking the Department to give this their serious consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

We have very few discharges this year and the Agents have practically insisted on our taking in cases of special merit and emergency.

Earl Anfield, Principal of St. Michael's Residential School at Alert Bay, containing the information that the school in week May 20 - 26th was going to celebrate its 50 years' anniversary, with re-union of ex-pupils, asking Indians of Bella Coola to attend, promising free board and lodging at Alert Bay, but not transportation expenses.\n\nThe Indians have held a meeting about this, result of which being that eight young men expressed their desire to go. Steamship fare from here (steerage) is thought to be $80.00, +$0.00 for each. The band is prepared to pay 50% of this; the balance, $40.00 dollars they hereby, most respectfully, asks the Department to contribute towards this end.\n\nI may say that this celebration will take place between seeding and fishing time, so Indians will be free to go.\n\nObediently yours,\n\n[Signature]\nInd. Ag't.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nMy dear friends,\n\nHolidays are over and the school is once more filled to overflowing for a new term of work which started officially on September 1st. On the Pacific coast the subject of talk during most of the year is fishing, which industry reaches its zenith during the two months our youngsters are out on vacation, giving most of those who are old enough to work an opportunity to earn some much needed money to buy clothes for themselves and to help their parents through the winter. I have in the past ten years at Alert Bay been much struck with the self-sacrifice of many of our older girls and boys who have done well during the fishing season and yet who, during the school year, have very little pocket money and I have often found that they have given almost all their earnings to their people, after buying an outfit of clothes for themselves. This is a nice thing to notice and makes us happy in our work for the children.\n\nOn the coast this year we have had the extremes of poverty and wealth in the different fishing areas. In our own district around Alert Bay we have seen the greatest run in years and our Indian people should all be very well off. The same can be said for Rivers Inlet, where in the last week of the run, literally hundreds of thousands of salmon were caught by the gill-netters, glutting the Canneries with fish to an unheard of extent. Whilst the fishermen did so well in Rivers Inlet, getting 45\u00a2 per fish with an average catch per man of over 1200, the Cannery Companies will not profit greatly as this fish was not of very good grade for sock-eye, and will not bring high prices. The Bella Coola run was a failure as was also that of the Naas River, which was the worst in years. The run in the Queen Charlotte Islands was very poor, and that in the famous Skeena River was only fair. Generally speaking, our northern Indians will be very badly off whilst those of the south have done remarkably well. It is a great pity that more of them do not learn to save their money, though I am happy to say that some of our ex-pupils have brought their money either to the School or the Indian Agent to have placed in a bank for safe-keeping.\n\nOnly a few children were in school during the summer holiday, so few that we did not consider it worthwhile operating our camp. However, they had a very nice time and all but one improved greatly in health. The one exception who unfortunately has never had much of a chance from infancy, was finally taken to a hospital near his home where our prayers for his recovery follow him with our love and best wishes. We had a busy summer due largely to a superabundant crop of good things from the farm, and the staff were strenuously engaged in putting up jam and pickles, over 1\u00bd tons of which were put by for the winter.\n\nThe largest class of graduating pupils we have known left this year to try out in their new village life at home the foundation they have been building at school. Few of us will ever forget the service held in our School for them at the close of term, and we do pray and beseech your prayers as well, that the resolutions there formed may be helped and strengthened in them all; and that the blessings there besought may be ever around them, to protect and fortify as they meet the cold challenge of the outside world. To you graduates, I say, be strong and of good courage and hold fast to that which is good. Make firm friends and counsellors of your village missionaries and teachers, and above all, get actively into God's work among your people. Write when you can and tell us of your joys and sorrows and remember always that your school is your home for you and will welcome a visit whenever you are near Alert Bay.\nAs a result of the large graduating class, we have a smaller school from the individual point of view, but every bed is full and five classrooms are working well. We have happily been able to relieve several difficult situations this year, taking in children from areas where no schools exist, and from others where children needed so badly a measure of home life, which, in spite of the size of the place, we do strive to give in this school. The health standard is good at the time of writing and it is our hope that this year, as last, we may be spared any undue worry over the physical welfare of our children.\n\nDuring this summer, thanks indeed to generous help from friends in the different Government Departments at Alert Bay I have been able to follow up the children at the Canneries, and by boat and seaplane have visited them and their parents, much to the joy of us all. It was a tremendous help to see and feel the welcome they gave me at the Canneries this year, and also to know how well the Cannery officials co-operate - getting net lofts ready for services at which, thank God, we sometimes had over a hundred attending. Our Indian people need all the ministration we can give them, and especially so during the fishing season when violent sin is so often all around them. One feels, in services such as those taken this year something of the joy that must have animated our Master, when beside a lakeshore, lined with fishing boats, He taught the people that man does not live by bread or fish alone, but by the living word of God.\n\nThe first special event for the opening School was of course, St. Michael's Day and we did indeed have a happy Patronal Festival, made more so by a pleasant remembrance in the form of a cablegram from Rev. G.K.K. Prosser in England. Rev. Prosser was the School Chaplain for five years and he won the love and esteem of all at St. Michael's. A perfect day saw a well run programme brought to a successful conclusion, and the champions who came up to receive the Challenge Cups were Hester Jones of Massett and Marjorie Wilson of Letlakathla on the girls' side; Sam Guno and Jacob Davies, both of Aiyansh, on the boys' side.\n\nA week later we kept Harvest Festival and welcomed to the School for the first time our new Bishop Co-adjutor, Rt. Rev. H. E. Sexton, whom the School took to its heart in a great way. He brought wonderful messages to us, and with them the loving greetings of the Diocesean, our dear friend, Bishop Schofield, whom, we were glad to hear, is rejoicing in better health. Bishop Sexton was present at a special service in our school when the school captains were commissioned for their year's work. Those who lead the school this year are: Patricia Thompson - \"Eagles\", Alice Mason - \"Ravens\", Hester Jones - \"Orchids\", Mary Munday - \"Royal Rose\"; Stanley Adams - \"Vikings\", Reggie Percival - \"Comets\", Jacob Davies - \"Crusaders\", Edwin Cook - \"Wanderers\".\n\nThe School was also pleased to welcome our friend, Dr. Westgate, Executive Secretary of the Indian Residential School Commission of our Church. We are always glad to see him and to listen to his friendly counsel and wise advice and we wish he would come more often. With him on his visit was Canon Vale, Principal of the School at Chapleau, Ontario, and a veteran missionary among our Indian people for the past 28 years. The visit of these two good people was ended greatly by one and all and helped us get off to a happy start in the new school year.\n\nWe welcome several new members on our staff this year, and especial Capt. J. E. Allsopp of the Church Army in Canada, who comes to us as Vice-Prin. I believe this to be a very fine choice by the Commission in view of the large played by the Church Army in the work of many of our northern villages.\n\nThe letter must close, it has been far too long. We shall write again to you all after Christmas and in the meantime wish you one and all God speed every blessing.\n\nEver your sincere friend,\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. A. Wilson, Esq.,\nController of Civil Aviation,\nDepartment of National Defence,\nOttawa.\nMy dear Friends,\n\nIn our last letter we told you something of the Season of Renewal held for staff and pupils during the season of Lent, an opportunity God given, for spiritual research and fresh endeavour. Weeknight lantern services with instructions during the weeks of Lent prepared the way for an intensive day by day Mission during Holy Week, and we will not soon forget those wonderful services conducted by Captain Allsopp of the Church Army, now the Vice-Principal of our School. On Good Friday evening at the concluding service of the Mission, nearly one hundred of our company, staff and pupils alike, in response to a definite challenge, came forward from the congregation and kneeling before the altar, publicly renewed their Baptismal and Confirmation vows and re-dedicated their lives to fuller Christian service. For each and all of them we ask your prayers that they may continue loyal and faithful members of the living Church of Christ. Nearly half of those who made decisions in the mission are preparing themselves for Confirmation, when Bishop Sexton comes to us at the end of May. Just as it required a Calvary to glorify an Easter morn, so our mission of renewal brought to us all its own reward in a wonderful Eastertide; one of the happiest we have ever known at St. Michael's, for so many of our children had learned the real meaning of \"everlasting life\" and in their Communion on that glorious day sought and received from on high the power to live a life that lasts, triumphant over time and space; a life which can conquer sin and death and which can be used as the Evangel of a new day in the hearts of all mankind.\n\nDue to the nearness of Empire Day to which the children are looking forward with great glee, we did not have a Sports Meet on the Easter Monday holiday this year, but treasure hunts, picnics, and a very fine football game in which our boys were victorious over the Village team, 2 - 0, seemed to fill in quite nicely and the children voted the day, which ended with a party, quite one of the best yet. They seemed quite contented to be back at their studies the following day and now they are on the last lap of the school year. Their minds of course, are looking ahead to vacation time, which will be upon us all too quickly. The holidays will start around the end of June, and I am sure even our smallest and youngest child can, without hesitation tell you the exact number of days still to wait. In some ways, prospects for a good fishing year seem brighter than those of last year, but the fishing industry is a rather elusive one on which to prophesy.\n\nToward the end of April it was possible for me to make a trip north, and in two weeks I travelled over 1300 miles and visited practically every Indian village north of Alert Bay to the Alaska boundary, most of the travelling being done in motor launches. I would be most ungrateful were I not to express thanks and appreciation to the Indian Agents, Missionaries, Doctors and teachers who made the visits possible and so greatly worthwhile. Leaving Alert Bay on a Wednesday, we worked north to Bella Coola by steamer, and en route visited the people of the Oweekayno tribe in Rivers Inlet, and\nmet Dave Bernard and John Thompson, graduates of 1915 and 1935 respectively. They were busy building a gill net boat for this season's work, but dropped the tools to hear news of the school and their relations therein. So quickly did time fly that I had almost to fly, too, to get the boat and run 100 yards faster than I have moved for years. The steamer had freight and passengers for every cannery in Smith and Rivers Inlets so it was not until 2:30 a.m. on Friday that the ship's whistle blew for Bella Coola, but even such hours of arrival have their compensations, for I sat on the front steps of the Church in the village and watched a perfectly glorious sunrise splash gold on the glacial peaks on either side of the Bella Coola valley. Shortly after nine, accompanied by Inspector Barry and the Indian Agent, Mr. Fougner, we visited the village and the day school, where after a few words with the children, I left to look up the Missionary and then the ex-pupils. If I were to name all I met on the trip this letter would become a magazine, so I must just say I met them all and if I was glad to see them, I know they were glad to see someone from the old school and quite soon they were hot-foot after news. I was lucky to have with me photos of most of the present pupilage and the gift of these to the parents was a great joy. As one of them said, \"It is almost as good as seeing them ourselves.\" The Missionary, Rev. G. Knox, warned me that the Young People's Association had asked that I speak at the Church that night, so after a visit to the Hospital, I went off for a walk towards the river to think things through, but had to go further afield as the olachun grease makers were just skimming off a boiling. As it is from this village that we get the olachun grease for the School, I strolled over later to see how they were getting on - they were doing fine. In spite of a nasty outbreak of 'flu in the village, the Church was filled that evening for a very enjoyable service made doubly pleasant for me by the sight of so many young people who in the past years have learned within these walls. The ushers and bell-ringers were all ex-pupils, and it was so encouraging to hear the Missionary speak of them as his right hand. But all good things must end, and so noon on Saturday saw us pulling out on the Agency launch, which under the skilful piloting of Constable Levelton was to be our home for a week's trip to Prince Rupert.\n\nSaturday night was spent at Ocean Falls where I met and had a short talk with Bishop Rix of Caledonia Diocese, and after attending Matins on Sunday morning in the beautiful little Church in that busy paper-making town, we left for Bella Bella, in which village live scores and scores of our graduates. We were welcomed by the Missionary, Rev. W. R. Welch, and the entire rising generation of Bella Bella; then, accompanied by the odd dozen or so we made our way towards the Mission House for supper following which we went back to the wharf to meet the \"Thomas Crosby\", of the United Church Marine Hospital, on which ship I met Principal Scott of the Coqualeetza Residential School. He, like myself, was on a tour of the Indian villages in the interests of the Church and School, and it was a splendid gesture on the part of the Missionary that we should each be asked to preach a sermon at the evening service. We did, and perhaps our mutual friends will hope that in future, School Principals will not travel in couples. The following day passed with lightning speed, and into a very few hours were crowded interviews with the parents of children in St. Michael's; a check on new pupils; and a visit to the\nschool, where in this village as in many others, simply splendid work is being done under very difficult conditions. A visit to the Hospital and a quiet talk with the patients known to me, and then the journey started again and the good ship turned her bow towards Millbank Sound, which stretch of water can, under given circumstances, produce conditions that would devastate one's wildest imaginings. The Sound was fortunately, on its best behaviour, but the skipper decided to show us the inside channel and we turned in just below Ivory Light to calm waters, through channels deep and narrow, and scenery of indescribable beauty quite unknown to those who travel in steamers and tourist boats. Just as the sun went down we entered Jackson Passage where one could touch shore from either side of the boat, and two hours later saw us tied up at Klentu village. A visit to the Mission House and Church and an hour with ex-pupils, watching the girls' teams play basketball, completed the day, and we retired to our berths for the night. Next morning we were awakened to the noise of hammering, and going out on deck found the men of the village all busy building a deck and freight shed on their new wharf. As many of them had children in School, I stayed on the launch and they came down to see me about their youngsters' progress. Later on I visited the day school and at noon we once more cranked the willing engine and set off for Kitamaat, arriving the following day at noon.\n\nIn this village live some 250 Indian people; there is a United Church Mission and Residential School for 30 pupils and a day School. It seems rather isolated as they only get mail boats once a month, but they were all cheerful and busy with their tasks. We spent several happy hours among them, rowing out later into a beautiful moon-lit night to where the launch was anchored. Almost before sleep came to me at all, I heard the anchor being hoisted and we were off at 4 a.m., towards the Skeena River, via Hartley Bay, at which village we stopped for a couple of hours to inspect the day school and pay a call on the Missionary and his good wife. It is a long run up Gronville Channel, which seems to maintain the same width and straightness for hours on end, but eventually we saw the opening of the Skeena, one of the greatest salmon rivers of B.C., and at seven in the evening the engine slowed down at Claxton. Here occurred the only mishap of the trip - just as we were pulling into the wharf, the clutch chose that moment to break in two and we had a pleasant few minutes making a landing. Going ashore, I was delighted to meet some of the ex-pupils, especially Rogor and Leonard Mercer, and Claude Morven, all of whom are now happily married. We had a most enjoyable chat in the home of their father, Paul Mercer, a licensed lay reader of Caledonia Diocese and a graduate of this School in 1902. I was most impressed all through the trip with the large number of really happy marriages which have taken place between boy and girl ex-pupils. In only two cases did I find genuinely unhappy marriages, and in both cases the ex-pupil was married to a partner who had not been to school at all.\n\nAfter repairs were completed next day, we moved up river to Port Essington where the Inspector had work in the day school. This town is, apart from some 100 Indians, almost entirely populated by Japanese, and I understand that in keeping with the Nationalist movement among these people, they are building a Buddhist Temple in\nEssington. Our work completed, we finally reached Prince Rupert after calling at Cassiar and Inverness Canneries to see parents of pupils at present in the School. Here ended the first part of our journey and after bidding farewell to our genial skipper, we left the launch and embarked on the \"Nanskeena\" of the Prince Rupert Indian Agency, and on the following day set sail for the Naas River, via Port Simpson, with a population of 650 Indians, the largest village I believe, in B. C. We had with us in addition to the Inspector and Indian Agent, the Asst. Director of Medical Services for the Department of Indian Affairs in the person of Dr. McQuarrie, and I am more than grateful for the opportunity afforded for a long conference on the problem of T. B. control, and the educational opportunities of the Residential School in this work.\n\nAfter a short call at Kincolith, we anchored for the night off the deserted cannery at Naas Harbour, and the following morning we once more changed boats, this time into a river boat in charge of Captain Stephen Clayton, a native of Gitlakdamix, under whose extremely skilful guidance we started the twelve hour trip up the Naas River, whose shallow waters and innumerable sand bars in the lower stages, and roaring canyons and rapids further up, were a challenge to the highest degree of skill and river lore. Captain Clayton's father was a river man before him, and Stephen had started to learn his trade of river pilot as a boy. On this trip his own son Silas, a fine strapping young man, was in the bow of the boat watching the river, making it part of his very being, so that in turn he, too, could follow in his father's steps. The boat was a thirty-foot tunnel craft with a 40 H.P. engine, built and equipped by the skipper himself. A stop was made at Fishery Bay, the old Indian camp of the Naas River people, where I met both parents and ex-pupils. Grease making was nearly completed, and I was glad to note that even in this camp in which the people would spend at most but two months of the year, they had built a splendid little Church, capable I suppose of seating 150 people. It was late that night, about eleven, when we saw the lights of the village of Gitlakdamix, to which village many years ago, the people had returned following the flood at Alyash Village started by the late Rev. J. B. McCullough of missionary fame. Tired after our long trip, we were more so after climbing the 89 steps up to the Mission House, but the very genuine welcome of Rev. and Mrs Kinley, and a bounteous supper soon put things to rights. As there was a phone from Gitlakdamix to the Big Canyon, word of our progress had gone before and the good missionary and his wife were ready with smiles (and Irish ones too), food, and restful beds. One could not ask for more, and we had a wonderful rest, fitting us all for our respective tasks on the morrow, when doctors examined the sick, the Inspector the schools, the Agent heard various and sundry delegations, and I went forth to find ex-pupils and parents. This village of 240 people is one of the best on the B. C. coast, wide streets and sidewalks, large halls for athletics and meetings, and one of the largest and most beautiful Churches one could visit anywhere. They also have a fine Church Army Hall, and in the tower of the Church a large illuminated clock which keeps the village on time. The houses are all fairly modern, though bad fishing seasons in the north have held back the building of as many new homes as I noticed further south. In Gitlakdamix and in Greenville, further down the\none would almost imagine that a town planning commission had been at work, so well and spaciously laid out are the homes, and there is a telephone in almost every house. It is more than evident that mighty solid foundations have been laid by those who pioneered the faith in these parts. At noon the flag was hoisted and an hour later we met the Council to discuss education. They appealed for a Residential School, and one can hardly blame them for they have not even got a day school, the teaching being done in a room in the Mission House by the Missionary who is, however, a qualified teacher. As there is no likelihood of further residential schools being built, I urged them to support their teacher, and send their children to school at the Mission House until such time as the Department can find the means of building a proper day school for them, but that the Residential School would help by taking in special cases where and whenever opportunity and vacancies permitted. Since writing this we are very glad to note that the Department has, in the supplementary estimates, sanctioned the building of a day school for this village.\n\nAfter a two-day stay we once more set our faces toward the south, and the run down the river was accomplished in about four hours running time. There were, however, two villages to visit on the way down, Canyon City, perched up on the rocks in the middle of the Canyon, and Greenville. At Canyon City I met the Azak youngsters, Ernest, Percy and Dorothy, now all grown up to be fine young people. It was nice to hear such good reports of them from the missionary. This village lies opposite the Naas River lava beds, the volcano of which pushed the river five miles out of its course some 200 years ago. From the village one can see clear across the ten miles of lava to the mountains along which the river must have run in days gone by.\n\nBy noon we were off again, and in the afternoon we moored our craft at Greenville, a village about the same size as Gitlakdamix. We had not much time here, but managed to visit the missionary, Rev. W. Cooper, spend some time in the day school, attend a meeting of the Council at which the same plea for a Residential School was made and later we were all the guests of the Council and Village at a splendid banquet in the Town Hall, where we enjoyed a feast of spring salmon with all the trimmings. One could not have had a better cooked or more tastily served repast anywhere, and the good people must have gone to a lot of work to entertain us. I was especially impressed with the day school in this village, and urged the people to support it fully. At 6.30 p.m., as night was falling, we set out on the last stretch of our journey for the day, and at 22 miles per hour came down to Kincolith in black darkness and pouring rain across the sand-bars. At midnight the very welcome and hospitable roof of Dr. Macdonald's home at Kincolith was over our heads; our soaked clothing was changed and we were at peace. There is a fine day school in this village and it was a pleasure to once again meet Miss Aylwin, the teacher, who was on the teaching staff at St. Michael's some years ago. During the following day, I paid a call on the Missionary, Rev. O. Thorne and his wife, real veterans on the Nans. The good man was busy in his garden, one of the finest in the north and a great joy to him. Most of the people of Kincolith were away at the Canaries so we did not see much of them, but in Dr. and Mrs Macdonald and Rev. and Mrs Thorne they have real friends and helpers, who have all given a lifetime of service to the Nishga people.\nThe following morning saw us on our way south once again, with grateful thoughts for all who had so hospitably entertained and cared for us on our wanderings. Back in Prince Rupert to a long conference with the Agent and Inspector on school matters, and then off home on the steamer to our big family at Alert Bay.\n\nOne must make a trip such as this to know the worthwhileness thereof. The personal contact means so much, doesn't it? One ex-pupil, writing to one of the pupils in school after my return said \"Mr. Anfield's visit meant so much to us all, it gave us new life to go on with.\" Putting aside the personal element, one can only say that it surely is our duty, who have these children in our hands for as long as ten years in some cases, to see that the link of friendship and trust is not broken by neglect. We owe it to our ex-pupils and the parents to visit the villages as often as possible, and I can assure you that our Indian Residential School Commission is both anxious and glad for such visits to be made. The improvement in the day schools is tremendous and this is a good sign indeed. The work of this School is clearly defined, and need never interfere with or overlap that of the day schools. We stand ready to help by taking children orphaned or neglected from any village; and also children from villages where there are no day schools and from villages where the day schools are overcrowded; and this School can be filled twice over with children from these groups alone.\n\nThis has been the longest letter yet, but I know many will be glad to get some little insight into the extent of the work undertaken by our Church for the Indian people on the coast of British Columbia.\n\nWith kindest regards and all good wishes,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMay 18th, 1936.\nOn October 11th I left Alert Bay on a business trip to Victoria and Vancouver and while there besides attending to Departmental business I attended the International Arts and Crafts Festival which was held at the Vancouver Hotel from the 14th to 17th inclusive. St. Michael's Indian Residential school at Alert Bay displayed the work done by the pupils during the past term, which created a great deal of interest amongst the people who visited the exhibit, and many genuine favourable comments were made as to the workmanship and Indian designs. Arrangements had been made by the Vancouver School Board whereby the children of the Vancouver schools were escorted by their teachers to visit the exhibit, and each day thousands passed through the building, and I am sure the work from our Indian school taking into consideration the ages of those doing the work was far superior to any work done by the same aged children in the white schools in Vancouver. We feel this is something really worth while as it gives us an opportunity to show the general public just what is being done by the Indian children at our schools.\n\nM. S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 9th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the request of the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School for a grant of $300.00 towards the cost of a celebration to be held at the school next year.\n\nOur Estimates for the next fiscal year have not yet been approved by the Treasury Board and, as you are aware, will not be considered by Parliament for some months. No special provision was made in our Appropriation for a grant for the purpose mentioned by Mr. Anfield and, under the circumstances, it is not possible, at the present time, to favourably consider his request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nAlert Bay B.C.,\nNovember 27, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. F.E. Anfield, Principal of St. Michael's Residential School, Alert Bay, has written me in connection with plans for a celebration to be held here next year when all ex-pupils of the Residential School and other Indians on this coast will be invited to participate.\n\nAs next year is Coronation Year, and celebrations will be held throughout Canada, it is our desire that the Indians take part on this historic occasion and thus emphasize the relationship between our Indian people and the Crown.\n\nMr. Anfield and I have discussed plans for this event, and we feel it would be of great value to the Indians in many ways, but in order to carry out our programme it is necessary to have some financial help, and I am therefore writing the Department to see if they would be good enough to give us a grant of $300.00 to put on this Pageant of Empire in the interests of all Indians.\n\nIt will entail a great deal of work and money, but we feel if the Department would assist us in the amount requested, the celebration could be made a real success. The Indians along the coast have expressed a desire to attend, and it will no doubt be the only celebration put on in the interests of Indians on this coast. I would therefore kindly ask the Department to approve of this amount and advise me as soon as possible in order that our plans may be got under way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 156-0-1 dated December 9th last, in reference to our request for a grant of three hundred dollars towards the cost of a celebration to be held at the Residential School at Alert Bay in connection with the Coronation, it is noted the Department do not feel it possible at this time to favourably consider our request.\n\nThe celebration which is contemplated is in my opinion, a very worthy cause, and I would appreciate if you would keep it in mind and if possible at a later date, try and help us to this extent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nVOL.2\n\nCLOSED\n\nFROM 10/7/26.\n\nTO 17/12/36.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6426)\n\nFile

1947, addressed to the Department regarding the need of repairs etc., at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, has been referred to this office.\n\nThe maintenance of government owned school buildings and equipment, is one that should receive the attention of the Indian Agent. I am unable to find anything in the Department's instructions issued to the Inspector of Schools, which indicates that responsibility in this respect devolves on him, although I am sure the Department would welcome information from the Inspector in this regard in cases of evident neglect.\n\nThe Department expects the Indian agent to discuss with the Principal, the matter of repairs and improvements necessary to maintain the buildings in proper condition, and make provision for the expenditures indicated in the annual agency estimates. It does not follow, however, that the Department will be in a position to approve the total expenditure involved, but it would be reasonable to expect that under normal conditions some of the work will be provided for. Repairs and improvements at the school should be carried out in so far as possible during the summer months, when the school is not in session.\n\nYou should confer with the Principal, Reverend S. J. Wickens, regarding the repairs that should be attended to this summer, advising this office of the cost involved in order that the matter may be placed before the Department for attention.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJuly 9th, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRecently it has come to my notice that correspondence from the Educational Branch, Ottawa, is being directed to the Principal of St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, in which new instructions have been given and new arrangements made in respect to policy and the administration of the school. This office has never been advised with respect to any changes in policy or administration.\n\nWe are expected to check and supervise accounts and Returns received from the school and have been requested to have them correct before submitting to Ottawa. We questioned the correctness of the June Quarterly Returns of St. Michael's Indian Residential School, and were rather embarrassed to be told by the Principal that he had received instructions direct from the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, to increase the per capita grant and also make other changes in respect to their Quarterly Returns. As we have not been advised of any changes we are accepting Principal Wickens' word and forwarding the Returns as received.\n\nIt has been found desirable in the past that any correspondence taking place between Ottawa and the Principal of the Residential School effecting administration in which the Agent has a responsibility, that a carbon copy be forwarded this office. Possibly the Department would advise me in respect to any new instructions which have been issued to the Principal during the past few months.\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\nMarch 5, 1948.\n\nColonel B. H. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nWhen I visited Alert Bay School in company with Mr. Arneil, we agreed that considerable painting and repair work was in need of attention this coming summer. He recommended that, if Indian Affairs supplied the paint and materials, the I.S.A. might be responsible for the labour. This I agreed to.\n\nThe type of work is of such a nature that it would have to be done when the children are out of residence but the amount is so great that it could not be accomplished within a two month holiday period.\n\nWith the above in mind would you please inform this Administration whether the Indian Affairs Branch would approve a three month holiday period this coming summer, instead of the usual two. This would entail closing the school at the end of May instead of the end of June.\n\nConsidering the state of financial emergency, it is also asked that the grant be continued for the additional holiday month.\n\nMay this request have your sympathetic consideration and a report back to this Administration would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nMarch 3, 1948.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nKnowing that you must be busy at this particular time, I thought it wise to write you a short letter rather than take up time by calling personally.\n\nI want to thank you very much for the co-operation of Indian Affairs during my recent visit to the Alert Bay school. As you know, Commissioner Arnell paid the school a visit during my stay there and he and I, in company with the Principal and Acting Agent Letcher, were able to make a very thorough survey of the whole problem. Mr. Arnell's report will, no doubt, bring you up to date on conclusions reached. I might say that both Mr. Arnell and Mr. Letcher were most helpful and considerate at all times. It was a real joy to be with them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent.\nAIR MAIL.\n\nOttawa, March 2, 1948.\n\nConfidential\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nALERT BAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nWe have in the past received recommendations that the old classroom block at the above school be replaced when conditions improve. It is hoped that steps can now be formulated for the replacement of this classroom block.\n\nThe following proposals have been discussed with Major Mackay and are submitted for your comment and for action where necessary by Inspector Davey:\n\n(1) That a four classroom block or larger be erected to replace the present classroom block building. The new classroom block would be similar to that at St. Catherine's Day School. A plan is being forwarded under separate cover.\n\n(2) That this new building along with the four room day school now nearing completion be used by both the day and residential school pupils.\n\n(3) That the teaching staff at this school be appointed entirely by the Department.\n\n(4) That the present residential school be a hostel for those children who have to come from isolated reserves as at present. This hostel would be operated by the Church of England.\n\n(5) That the hostel children attend the new day school on the same basis as the children from the village.\nIn other words, we are considering a somewhat similar set-up to that operated at the Fairbridge Farm School where the Provincial Department of Education operates a day school within the frame-work of the farm school. This proposal has been discussed with Mr. Todd and we would appreciate your views on this matter.\n\nIt should be realized that the above proposals constitute a departure from the present system and are in the nature of an experiment.\n\nIt is felt that Inspector Davey should make:\n\n(a) Specific recommendation as to the size of the classroom block which would have to be erected. The plans forwarded are only a suggestion.\n\n(b) Recommendation as to the most suitable site for the new building bearing in mind the location of the four classroom block now nearing completion.\n\nThe residential school pupils would, of course, attend on a full day basis. Provision should be made for eventually providing High School education for these children either by the Department or through co-operation with the Alert Bay School Board. The Department appointed principal would be in charge of both the proposed classroom block and the block now nearing completion. The Anglican Church would appoint a superintendent for the hostel.\n\nThe above proposals have not yet been discussed with the Indian School Administration of the Missionary Society of the Church of England.\n\nBFN/HH.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 2nd December, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Varcoe -\n\nMinimum Wage Order No. 52 (1946)\nProvince of British Columbia.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find correspondence received by the Director of Indian Affairs from Major General G. R. Turner of the M.S.C.O. This correspondence, it will be noted, relates to the application of the Minimum Wage Order No. 52 of the Province of British Columbia to the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. This school was built and equipped by this Department, from appropriation, and is maintained from year to year by per capita grants also provided from appropriation.\n\nIt will be noted that in a copy of the letter from the Superintendent of the School to the Board of Industrial Relations, Province of British Columbia, dated the 31st October last, copy of which is attached, the statement is made that the cost of operating these schools is borne mainly by the Dominion Government who pay a per capita grant for each pupil in attendance. The balance of the funds required, which is considerable, is provided \"by missionary contributions of various church congregations throughout Canada\". This statement does not apply to this school in question as the said per capita grants pay the salaries of all staff including the teachers.\n\nPlease advise if, under the circumstances, the Minimum Wage Order No. 52 of the Province of British Columbia applies\n\n(a) to the employees of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School which is operated entirely on per capita grants furnished from appropriation, or\n\n(b) to employees of other Indian Residential Schools where the employees are paid partly by per capita grant from appropriation and partly from funds provided by missionary contributions of various church congregations throughout Canada.\n\nIf you are of opinion that in either or both of the above two cases this Minimum Wage Order applies the charge upon public funds in cases of this kind will, by necessity, be greatly increased.\n\nPlease return the attached correspondence.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. P. Varcoe, Esq., K.C.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Justice,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6426, file 875-1, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNovember 15, 1947.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nThank you for your letter of November 12th with which you enclosed copies of your telegram of November 6th to Commissioner MacKay and his reply of November 7th.\n\nIn this connection, you may be interested to see the following extract from a letter of November 7th addressed to the late Dr. Alderwood by Rev. B.O.G. Dixon, the new principal, as it indicates his attitude towards co-operation with your officials:\n\n\"Everything is quiet now. The police make at least one visit during the night and everyone knows. I have been unable to meet the Indian Agent as he is away but I shall visit the Indian Office in Vancouver. I shall do my best to bring in a spirit of co-operation.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMajor General G. E. Turner\nfor Superintendent.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office.\nMarch 9, 1948.\n\nDear Archdeacon Cook:\n\nWe have your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the Alert Bay Residential School. It is noted that in connection with the painting and repair work that you consider necessary at the Alert Bay School, you offer to supply labour if the Department supplies the material. We appreciate your co-operation in this regard but it appears that this would be contingent on increasing the holiday leave from two months to three months.\n\nFor many reasons we feel that it is undesirable to increase the holidays at any one school unless the situation is more serious than at Alert Bay.\n\nWe are writing to Indian Commissioner Arneil requesting him to let us have an estimate of the cost of the labour in carrying out the repairs and painting during the months of July and August. We are instructing him to communicate with the Reverend Principal of the Alert Bay school with a view to ascertaining how much labour can be supplied by the school staff and intimating to him that we will be prepared to pay the cost of the labour over and above what is supplied free by the staff. We are also requesting him to submit a requisition for the paint and materials required.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nVen. Archdeacon H.G.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI enclose for your information a letter recently received from Archdeacon Cook with reference to the Alert Bay Residential School. It is noted from this communication that the M.S.C.C. is prepared to be responsible for the labour required for painting and repairs, provided the annual vacation period be extended for three months.\n\nWe feel that any such extension of the holiday period would be inadvisable for many reasons and consequently we would like you to give us an estimate of what labour would cost to do the work that is absolutely essential. Previous to submitting this estimate you might communicate with the Reverend principal and ascertain what assistance in the form of labour the school staff is prepared to give during the months of July and August and if you have this information it would reduce the amount that the Department would be expected to pay.\n\nYou should also forward a requisition for the paint and materials for repairs that you recommend and let us know the approximate cost of these, and if they can be purchased in British Columbia you should submit the names and addresses of the firms from whom the paint and materials can be secured.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nEncl.\nMarch 19th, 1948.\n\nRef. No. C.11-8-18\n\nDear Doctor Keenleyside:\n\nRe: Enforcement of the Indian Act in British Columbia\n\n1. Please refer to your letter of the 7th of November, 1947, addressed to Gordon S. Wismer, Attorney General, and the latter's reply of the 3rd of December, 1947.\n\n2. In accordance with Mr. Wismer's suggestion, I communicated with Commissioner Shirres of the British Columbia Police. Copies of correspondence in this connection have been forwarded to Mr. R.A. Hoey, Director of Indian Affairs Branch, under date of the 8th of December, 1947. Particular reference is made in the above correspondence to those sections of the Act having to deal with the illegal sale, consumption, etc., of liquor by Indians.\n\n3. We pointed out at that time that an old Order-in-Council was still in effect under which responsibility for enforcement of the Act rested upon the Provincial authorities, and the fines collected in relation to liquor offences go to the Treasurer of that Province.\n\n4. It has recently been necessary for me to survey some of the work the Force is doing with a view to effecting some economies in manpower. In that survey I found that among other things we carry out certain work in and about Vancouver in relation to the enforcement of the Indian Act which employs one man full time and another part time. For the period from April 1st, 1947, to March 1st, 1948, this effort resulted in 134 convictions for violations of the Act, of which all but 13 pertained to liquor offences. I am informed also that the fines collected are eventually credited to the City Treasurer in Vancouver and do not go to the Province, also that the Provincial Police do not undertake any work of this sort in Vancouver.\n\n5. Our Officer Commanding at Vancouver - Supt. J. Healey - has been in touch with your Commissioner, Mr. Arnell, and with Mr. Taylor, the Indian Agent at Vancouver. There is apparently some dissatisfaction with the general enforcement arrangement.\n\n6. I feel that until the policy is altered by Order-in-Council this Force should take no part in the matter and should restrict its activities to assisting the British Columbia Provincial Police when that Force asks for our help. I am loath to permit a situation to continue which might cause some confusion as to the actual division of responsibility.\n\n7. As matters stand now the British Columbia Provincial Police are responsible for the enforcement of the Indian Act in that province and the fines should go to the Provincial Treasurer. If the policy is to be changed, I submit that the old Order-in-Council would have to be cancelled, and if this is done the R.C.M.P. Police detachments would have to be strengthened very materially and, in fact, new ones might have to be opened. This I am prepared to do.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) S.T. Wood\n(S.T.

Keenleyside,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Residential School\n\nYour file 156-0-1 (E)\n\nThe proposals outlined in Mr. Hoey's letter of March 2nd with respect to the future operation of the above mentioned school are in our opinion in every way satisfactory and will, I hope, remedy the present unsatisfactory conditions at the school.\n\nWith regard to the additional classrooms required I am enclosing for your information a memorandum dated March 24th from District School Inspector Davey wherein he suggests various alternatives and recommends the construction of a four room classroom block with manual training and domestic science rooms in the basement and use of the building which we intended to construct from Port Hardy Camp materials originally planned for use as domestic science and manual training for two additional classrooms, which will provide a total of ten classrooms, the minimum necessary to accommodate the expected combined enrolment of 320 Day and Residential School pupils.\n\nWith regard to the site of the classroom block it is agreed that this should be constructed on lot 23 on the West side of the road and across from the new Day School building. Mr. Indian Agent Todd estimates that it would cost approximately $700.00 to clear this lot and dispose of the refuse. I should appreciate being advised as soon as possible when funds are available to have this clearing proceeded with.\n\nI might mention that Mr. Todd has obtained an offer from a local contractor to do the labour by contract, the Department to supply materials, but I have yet to secure details.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMarch 24, 1948.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nFrom: The District School Inspector.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Residential School\n\nI refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of March 2nd concerning the construction of a four room classroom block at the above mentioned school and the suggested combination of the academic work for the Day and Residential Schools at Alert Bay.\n\nMr. Hoey has asked for a definite recommendation from me regarding the size of the block and the site.\n\nSize:\n\nIn addition to the four room block just completed, six classrooms are required to accommodate the expected combined enrolment of the Day and Residential Schools of 320 pupils. There are three ways of providing these six classrooms:\n\n(1) The construction of a new four room block and the use of the two classrooms in the Residential School building for primary classes. These rooms are excellent for classroom purposes and would also obviate the primary children walking in inclement weather to the combined school from the Residential School and would also reduce the distance which the junior pupils would have to walk from the more distant parts of the reserve.\n\n(2) The construction of a four room block with manual training and domestic science in the basement and the use of the building to be constructed from the materials at the Port Hardy Army Camp which was originally planned for use as domestic science and manual training for two additional classrooms.\n\n(3) Construct a six room classroom block and use the vocational training building as originally planned. This would provide\nample play space in the basement when the weather is not favourable for the pupils to play on the school grounds.\n\nOf these three suggestions I favour the second plan because:\n\n(a) It would avoid any possible friction due to the presence of pupils in the dormitory building who do not normally come under the control of the person in charge of that building.\n\n(b) Because it would simplify the problem of administration by having all of the classrooms centralized.\n\nThe third suggestion I do not favour because the advantages hardly seem commensurate with the additional cost.\n\nSite:\n\nYou will recall that when we visited Alert Bay we were in agreement with Mr. Indian Agent Todd that the new classroom block should be constructed on lot 23, on the west side of the road and across from the new Day School building.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDist. School Inspector.\nApril 2nd, 1948.\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for British Columbia,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter addressed to the Deputy Minister from the Commissioner, Royal Canadian Mounted Police dated March 19th, and also the reply from this Branch dated April 1st, regarding enforcement of the Indian Act in British Columbia.\n\nPlease note particularly the contents of Para. 7 regarding the increases in the establishment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as suggested in Commissioner Wood's letter.\n\nIt is the wish of the Department to proceed cautiously in this matter and only to consider creation of new detachments for Indian work where they are really necessary, where the services of the Provincial Police cannot be availed satisfactorily.\n\nPlease submit a report on this matter at your convenience.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, March 31st, 1948.\n\nDear Commissioner Wood:\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of March 19th addressed to the Deputy Minister re enforcement of the Indian Act in British Columbia, which has been referred to me for attention.\n\nThe copies of correspondence referred to in your paragraph 2 have been reviewed carefully.\n\nAs you intimated to the Attorney-General, the Order in Council P.C.2535 with amendments dated December 11th, 1890, whereby the Province undertakes Indian Act enforcement and receives the fines imposed under the Indian Act, is still in effect.\n\nOn the whole the arrangement made between the Dominion and the Province under this Order in Council has worked out reasonably well over a long period of years. I believe you will agree with me when I say that in any co-ordination of law enforcement work as between the Dominion and a province, occasional local difficulties and problems are bound to arise from time to time. We have had our share of these, but it has always been possible to find a solution through consolidation and co-operation with the Provincial authorities. In the present instance, I feel satisfied after reading a letter of November 10th from Commissioner Shirras to you, that the situation will receive proper consideration and attention from the Provincial authorities responsible for law enforcement. The specialized control problems that have arisen in recent years in the Prince Rupert area are difficult.\n\nOn this subject in a report dated January 20th, 1948, the Indian Agent for the Skeena River Indian Agency whose critical observations concerning the work of the British Columbia police gave rise to the present correspondence, has this to say:\n\n\"In the City of Prince Rupert, the sum of $10,178.00 was paid in police court fines on all charges in 1947. In the same year, 196 natives were convicted of offences under the Indian Act, paying fines totalling $2,612.25 and serving 731 days imprisonment.\n\nA total of 102 suppliers were charged, of whom 96 were convicted paying a total of $4,425.00 in fines.\n\nIn the year, the number of Indians charged decreased over previous years, whilst the number of suppliers charged and convicted\n\n........ increased\nincreased, due to a real effort by the B.C. Police to cope with the Indian liquor problem. A lot of credit is due Sgt. L. Potterton, I/c Prince Rupert City Detachment of the British Columbia Police, for this increased activity.\n\nThe liquor situation on the Reserves is serious, particularly on the Nass River where the natives can bring in liquor from the American side. It should be noted that apart from the \"P.M.L. 15\", there is no organized police protection on any reserve in the Agency. Native constables, without supervision, are of no real value.\"\n\nThis seems to be an encouraging indication of improved enforcement efforts in Prince Rupert, although unsatisfactory on the reserves.\n\nAfter mature consideration and discussion with the senior officials, who have followed the problem on the ground over a long period, the conclusion has been reached that it would not be advisable at this time to undertake a major change in policy involving the rescinding of the Order in Council governing the agreement between the Dominion and the Province as mentioned in your paragraph 6.\n\nAt the same time, I should like to say that this Department greatly appreciates your offer to increase your establishment if necessary in British Columbia, and information is being sought as to where this might be done with advantage to both forces.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\n\nThe Commissioner,\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police,\nOttawa.\n\nTRM/ITH\n\nIndian Affairs.

The difficulties experienced in this field have recently reached a climax with the unpleasant events that have happened at Alert Bay.\n\nIn conversation with Commissioner Wood of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police this morning, I was informed that although there had at one time been a detachment of his organization at Alert Bay, it was withdrawn at the request of the Provincial authorities of that day. It would be inappropriate to consider the re-establishment of this detachment, except under agreement with the Province. Even if such an agreement were to be arranged, it would take sometime, and would not assist in solving the current difficulties. Commissioner Wood has been so good as to say that he will write personally direct to Commissioner Shirras in regard to the present troubles. This should assist in straightening out the situation at Alert Bay where the Provincial Police representative is apparently under the impression that he has no responsibility in relation to the maintenance of order among the Indian population.

Wismer.\nAttorney-General.\nPERSONAL\n\nDear Mr. Wismer:\n\nI had hoped to have the pleasure of calling on you during my recent visit to Victoria but unfortunately for me you were out of town during the three days of my visit. I am now taking the liberty of writing you to mention a matter that has recently been giving me and the members of the Department of Mines and Resources some concern. I am writing to you personally as the suggestion I have to make is a little out of my field and I do not wish to interfere with the official responsibilities of others.\n\nWhen I was in Prince Rupert ten days ago I found that the liquor situation there as it affected the Indian population in the city and in the Skeena Valley seemed to be pretty much out of hand. The local Provincial Constables were doing their best but were finding it difficult to get time to handle this matter in addition to their other responsibilities. The same situation existed with regard to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Post in Prince Rupert.\n\nIt has occurred to me that this situation might perhaps be more effectively handled if a Provincial constable of Indian race (preferably a Haida or Tsimtslaim) could be appointed and sent into the district in order to handle this particular problem. It might be easier for such a man to discover just how widespread the bootlegging is and to take effective action against both the Indians and Whites concerned. It would moreover do something for Indian morale for one of their people to be given the dignity of membership in the Provincial Police and the responsibility of applying the law to the White residents of the area as well as to the Indian population.\n\nI don't know how this idea may appeal to you but I think perhaps it might be worth considering and Commissioner Parsons who knows the Indians very well indeed might be prepared to express an opinion in regard to it.\n\nThe Honourable G.S. Wismer, K.C., M.L.A.\nAttorney General, for British Columbia,\nVictoria, B.C.\nIt will be a matter of great satisfaction to me and to the other members of our Department who have to deal with Indian Affairs if steps can be taken to straighten out the very deplorable situation which at present exists around the lower reaches of the Skeena River.\n\nWith kind personal regards, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.L.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEncl:\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI very much appreciated your personal letter of January 29th enclosing copies of correspondence relative to working conditions and wages at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nAn opportunity presented itself to discuss the matter at length with Mr. James Thomson, the Deputy Minister of Labour and Chairman of the Board of Industrial Relations at Victoria, and he has agreed, as confirmed in the attached letter dated February 12th, to leave the entire matter in abeyance for a period of three or four months. I found Mr. Thomson most co-operative and with a sympathetic appreciation of our problem.\n\nI visited the Alert Bay Residential School during Archdeacon Cook's visit and spent two days interviewing the staff and inspecting the buildings and adjacent land. I contemplate later making this visit the subject of a separate report when I have interviewed the Indian Agent, Mr. Todd.\n\nMy discussions with Archdeacon Cook regarding school staff and salaries were quite frank and I feel sure if it is within his power to rectify salaries to at least the minimum requirements of the British Columbia Board of Industrial Relations that he will do so despite what he terms \"a possible precedence which might upset the remainder of the M.S.C.C. school salary schedules throughout the Dominion.\" For myself\nand the School Principal, the Rev. Mr. Dixon, it is imperative that the staff be improved and this seems impossible to accomplish without, in all likelihood, exceeding the minimum rates as quoted by the Provincial Board of Industrial Relations.\n\nAlthough perhaps slowly, I am gradually becoming acquainted with our various problems and getting my feet on the ground in this \"banana belt\" and am enjoying the work.

Canon C. F. Hives, \"The Work of One Indian School.\" I would inform that I have had some contact with St. Michael's Indian Residential School at Alert Bay, B.C., back in the '30s and knowing how that institution was conducted during that time and, since returning from overseas, having heard of the difficulties now experienced by the Columbia Coast Mission in financing. Under present conditions, I do not consider that it is at all out of order to draw special attention to an excerpt from the third paragraph of Canon Hives' letter, viz., \"Being a Church Institution, this grant is supplemented by financial support from an old missionary society in England.\"\n\nWith all due respect to the very fine work which has been done our since times immemorial by the missionaries of all denominations among the Indians, it is an established fact that this has been achieved under generous financial support of British people and, although the Indians are officially the wards of the Federal government, this has undoubtedly eased the burden of taxation in this direction on the Canadian taxpayer.\n\nIt is most interesting to learn now, that after all the trials and tribulations which have been experienced and are still being experienced in the \"Old Country,\" the education and well-being of our native people are still being assisted by the British.\n\nE. G. NEWNHAM.\n1348 Robson Street.\nEdmonton Girl Works With Indian Children\n\nIndian Children Lovable, Natural, Adapt Themselves to Learning\n\nWhen Betty Kingsett left Edmonton for Alert Bay, B.C., last January, she probably didn't imagine herself president of an Anglican Young People's group of 25 members, all Indians except herself and another white girl. Yet, that's what she is today when she returns.\n\nMiss Kingsett is on the staff of St. Michael's Indian Residential School at Alert Bay, 200 miles north of Vancouver, and she is back here for two weeks.\n\nFinding her work intensely interesting, she loves the children, who range in age from 6 to 16 and follow her around like little puppy dogs. \"They need help, but love them,\" she says. \"They are all so affectionate and natural.\"\n\nDespite the fact that she would rather have a group of Indians children to manage than any others, she explained that they are not spoiled or extravagant and make no fuss about things like having inoculations or taking medicine.\n\nIndian children are quick at learning and if given the same chance could equal white children, according to Miss Kingsett. The big trouble, she says, is that their environment is backward and antiquated and they don't learn the little things that are basic to a white child is taught.\n\nEducation and a feeling of equality with white people are what the Indians need most in Miss Kingsett's opinion. One example of this was accomplished by that of a young Indian boy, a graduate of the school, who is now doing his last year of law at university.\n\nThere is a farm in connection with the school where the boys receive agricultural instruction. Many of the older girls want to be nurses and teachers. A lot of their spare time is taken up with Girl Guide activities.\n\nA shortage of staff at the school makes it necessary for persons to be employed to do anything including nursing. During a recent flu epidemic, there were 120 children in hospital. Miss Kingsett. There are 220 at the school.\n\nA well-known singer, when she was in Edmonton, Miss Kingsett has started a choir at the school. She finds that music and stories will keep the children satisfied for hours even the 68 small boys in her Sunday school class.\n\nSome of the native people know few of the war chants and songs but they can sometimes be coaxed to perform the native dances.\n28th September, 1948.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Principalship.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nAs you probably know we have recently lost the Rev. B.O.G. Dixon as Principal of St. Michael's School, Alert Bay.\n\nAfter very careful search and consideration by our Indian School Administration I write to ask that in place of the Rev. B.O.G. Dixon, the Rev. John Edwin Allsopp be appointed Principal in his place.\n\nMr. Allsopp is an Englishman by birth and a graduate of the Anglican Theological College in Vancouver. He has spent nine years as a worker in the Church Army and nine years also in parish work. For four years he was Vice-Principal at St. Michael's under Mr. Anfield. He is 43 years of age, married and has two children. Our Indian School Administration, after careful enquiry, feel that his qualifications would fit him for the work of Principal.\n\nI should therefore be grateful if he might be appointed as Principal of St. Michael's School, Alert Bay.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLAD K.\n24 November, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nAlert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease find hereunder Inspector Davey's report on the Alert Bay Residential School. In a discussion with him I was able to learn that little improvement can yet be noted in the classroom work, general discipline and morale of this school.\n\nTherefore I called Canon Cook and General Turner to a meeting in my office to discuss this situation.\n\nThey realize the staff situation is far from satisfactory but advise that it is almost impossible in British Columbia to compete with local industry for general staff and with our Indian day and provincial schools for teaching staff.\n\nI advised Inspector Davey that funds would be made available for the purchase of furniture for the staff quarters and also for paint which can be used to advantage in brightening the teachers' living accommodation.\n\nInspector Davey does not recommend the painting of the interior of the school until discipline has been restored to a much greater extent than at present.\n\nWhile this is primarily a staff problem, the Principal would seem to be at fault in that he had not held a\nsingle staff meeting up to the time of Inspector Davey's visit. He is apparently trying to do too much himself and is even handling some of the classroom work. This leads to the unhappy position of having the Principal tied up in a classroom when he should be supervising the many other activities of the school.\n\nAs you are aware, the contract for the heating repairs will shortly be let and we had just finished waterproofing the outside of the building. In other words, the Department has done its share in restoring this building to proper working shape and the M.S.C.C. has not been able yet to provide the proper staff.\n\nInspector Davey has recommended that either Mr. Caldwell or Mr. Anfield be sent to this school for a period of two weeks or more in order that their experience can be used to advantage in reorganizing the entire staff and working conditions.\n\nI feel that these matters should be brought to your attention as this is the only residential school in British Columbia which is now not functioning in a fairly efficient manner.\n\nBernard E. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 875-1 (E.1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of September 26th and Superintendent Todd's letter of September 19th to District School Inspector Davey, with regard to conditions at the Alert Bay Residential School, memorandum from Mr. Davey, dated October 15th, in this connection, is enclosed.\n\nMr. Davey is presently visiting the Alert Bay School and it is anticipated that the management of the School will be the subject of a report by him following his return.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nFrom: The Inspector of Indian Schools in B.C.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Residential School\n\nI refer to Mr. Phelan's letter of September 26th concerning the report of Mr. Todd on the above mentioned school.\n\nIt is quite obvious from Mr. Todd's letter that the above-mentioned school is far from operating efficiently, in spite of some improvement. It would appear that Mr. Todd's criticism is based on two things. First, the failure of the school to obtain qualified teachers and second, the unsatisfactory service of the engineer, Mr. W.P. McNeill. To my mind there are three contributing factors which make it difficult for this school to secure satisfactory staff. The first of these is the school's inability to operate on the grant and consequently pays salaries insufficiently high to attract good staff members. The second factor is the unsavory reputation which this school has acquired in the last three years. The third factor is the deplorable working conditions at the school. Two of the classes are held in an old condemned building locally known as the \"old girls' home\". The principal informs me that the roof of this building leaks so badly that it has been necessary for him to discontinue classes on several occasions during the current academic year, and it is also impossible to keep these class-rooms warm. The main building, as the Department knows, is not kept sufficiently warm for the staff members. This has resulted in both illness and resignations. I understand however, that the Department has already advertised for tenders for the necessary repairs to the heating system. It was also planned to construct a class-room block to permit the abandonment and dismantling of the old building formerly used as a residence for girls.\n\nIt might be interesting to contrast the policy of administration of the Alert Bay School with that of the school at Alberni. The primary concern at Alert Bay appears to be to operate the school within the budget, whereas at Alberni\nthe policy is to operate the school efficiently and give first consideration to the welfare of the children. The Alberni Residential School has adhered to this policy in spite of the fact that it has not been able to finance the operation of the school within the funds made available by government grants. In the last year the Alberni School received a loan of $5000.00 from the United Church.\n\nR.F. Davey\nSeptember 26, 1949.\n\nMr. W. S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nWe have just received a copy of Superintendent Todd's letter of September 19, addressed to District School Inspector Davey, in regard to the above school.\n\nNo action is being taken on the contents of Mr. Todd's letter until we hear from your office.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nMr. R. F. Davey, District School Inspector, Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nIn reply to your letter of September 1st last, file #6-11-2, the Rev. J. E. Allsopp, Principal of Alert Bay Indian Residential School has forwarded me a list of present employees at that institution showing their respective positions, net salary, value of board and living accommodation and gross salary.\n\nYou will please note there are two vacancies in the present set-up of the staff: Manual Training Instructor and Intermediate Teacher. I have had a chat with Mr. Allsopp this morning and he informs me he is going to Vancouver to-morrow with a view to try and get a teacher to fill the intermediate room. He is also going to discuss the matter with yourself. Mr. Allsopp informs me he has had several opportunities to employ teachers but they refuse to accept a position there at the salary offered. This is the reason why one classroom is without a teacher.\n\nIt is also noted that both the senior and junior teachers are not qualified. They are only working under a permit.\n\nIt has always been my understanding that the fundamental function of a Residential School is education. Here we have over two hundred children in residence for that purpose. The M.S.C.C. evidently cannot obtain qualified teachers because they refuse to pay adequate salaries, with the result this school has only one certified teacher, two teachers teaching under permits and one classroom with no teacher. The same applies to the Manual Training. In other words we only have one qualified teacher for this school of over two hundred pupils.\n\nThis seems to me a very serious situation and one which should be rectified forthwith. To make a comparison with the salaries paid at the Residential School and those paid at our Indian Day Schools, I will give you one example. If Mrs. K. Bridge, primary teacher in the Residential School, who holds a second-class certificate, was paid under the same schedule as Day School teachers she would be getting 150% more salary. It is no wonder the M.S.C.C. cannot find teachers who will work for the disgraceful salaries they pay them!\n\np.t.o.\nThe result appears to be that the Department is still allowing this Residential School to operate as a hostel rather than an educational institution, and the children's education cannot help but suffer. I am dwelling on this because I think the time is overdue when the Department must insist that the M.S.C.C. appoint certified teachers and pay the same salaries as paid Day School teachers; and failing this, the Department should assume the responsibility of appointing qualified teachers and paying them direct, just the same as Indian Day Schools. This applies to Manual Training as well.\n\nI should like to refer to Mr. W. P. McNeill, whom the M.S.C.C. have employed as an engineer. Several reports in respect to the services and qualifications of this employee have been made previously. I am informed he tried to write off his fourth-class papers this year but was not allowed to sit for the exam on the grounds that he had not had sufficient experience. I must again point out to the Department that the Government have a very large investment in valuable, important equipment installed in this school, all of which comes under the supervision of Mr. McNeill. In my opinion as well as others, in a better position than I, who are conversant with the needs of a proper engineer, feel that a qualified engineer should be appointed in charge of this equipment, otherwise we are going to be faced with endless repair bills and finally replacement of equipment which will be of major proportion.\n\nAlert Bay Residential School has almost the same equipment as the old Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, Sardis, now under the administration of the Department of National Health and Welfare. Here at Alert Bay we have a man in charge of similar equipment who cannot obtain his fourth-class papers, receiving a net salary of $72.50 with a gross salary of $132.50; as compared to the present staff at Coqualeetza Indian Hospital, Sardis, where they have a Chief Engineer and either two or three Assistants. I am given to understand the Chief's salary is $215.00 a month, and his Assistants' starting at $165.00, graduating to $190.00 a month. Surely there must be something wrong!\n\nI would feel satisfied myself if we had one good qualified engineer, someone who could and would take care of our equipment and do ordinary maintenance work. How long is this situation going to continue?\n\nI am satisfied that the Rev. J. E. Allsopp cannot do otherwise than carry out his instructions from the M.S.C.C. in respect to staff salaries. Therefore, no blame can be attached to him in this respect.\n\nThe Department must not overlook the fact that this school is now twenty years old and requires more maintenance work than when it was originally built. Even in early days we had good qualified engineers when maintenance work was at a minimum.\n\np.t.o.\nThe evident policy of retrenchment by the M.S.C.C. through employment of inefficient help is slowly but surely costing the Department large sums of money for repairs and replacement. In my opinion we have two major situations to deal with:\n\n(1) Employ a qualified engineer who can do maintenance work and give proper care to equipment.\n\n(2) Employ qualified teachers in every department.\n\nOther minor problems can be dealt with locally.\n\nI am writing at some length as we are doing everything possible to put this Residential School back to enjoy the same good administration as it did years ago.\n\n(M.

If \"white\" children were taught in so dilapidated a building as the one that accommodates all the senior students of St. Michael's school the outcry would resound from Vancouver to Halifax. Moreover effective teaching is not given, for, owing to the general discomfort that prevails, and the inadequate salaries paid, teachers will not remain, and moreover few are properly qualified.\n\nI am a (retired) Ontario High School teacher, and I assure you that I speak from definite knowledge of conditions.

Davey, District Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\n\nRe: Consolidation of Classroom Work,\nAlert Bay Day and Residential Schools.\n\nWith reference to Canon Cook's letter of July 12th, to Mr. Neary, I was very surprised by the tone of this letter, particularly in view of the events which preceded Mr. Allsopp's conversation with Mr. Cook. On June 24th, I made a special trip to Alert Bay in order to arrange the details necessary before any consolidation could take place and on the evening of June 26th, I met with the two Principals and Mr. Todd so that a full discussion could take place with respect to the arrangements. At this meeting there was complete accord on all proposals except one. This point was raised by Mr. Allsopp and was with respect to the observance of Days of \"Obligation\". Mr. Allsopp wished that the pupils in residence at his school should be permitted to observe three days and be granted leave from classroom work for the whole or part of these days. I stated that I did not believe it was the Department's policy to grant leave to Protestant children on such occasions. I further stated that I felt that since the classroom work would take only five hours of the day there was ample opportunity for the Residential School to give whatever religious instruction the Principal thought necessary outside of classroom hours. Mr. Allsopp stated that it was probable that such an arrangement could be made but he was unwilling to make an adjustment in the routine of his school when he knew that the Roman Catholic Church received these privileges.\n\nAfter a discussion of probably ten or fifteen minutes, in which only Mr. Allsopp and myself participated, Mr. Todd suggested that, after all, this was a matter of policy which should be decided by the Department rather than at the meeting. With this I concurred. This seemed to be a reasonable solution to the impasse which had developed and I was certainly under the impression that Mr. Allsopp was quite content to have the matter left to the Department. I wish to repeat that this was the only point upon which there appeared to be a difference of opinion and also that the discussion was entirely between myself and the Principal of the Residential School, aside from the final suggestion by Mr. Todd. At no time did Mrs. Scanlon enter into the discussion.\nIn view of the above, I am at a loss to understand Canon Cook's statement: \"Mr. Todd apparently is taking the attitude that he and Mrs. Scanlon are going to be in full control of the activities of the children and that St. Michaels will simply be a place where they eat and sleep\".\n\nIn order that the Department may be fully informed, I shall outline all of the decisions which were made at this meeting on June 26:\n\n1. It was decided that as a temporary arrangement three classrooms would be held in rooms made available by the Residential School.\n\n2. The assignment of Teachers to the rooms and grades was made.\n\n3. Mr. Allsopp agreed to provide living accommodation for two teachers, namely, Mrs. Lamperson and Mrs. Bridge. The amount of board and lodging was to be set by the Principal of the Residential School at a figure which would be fair and reasonable.\n\n4. The pupils from the Residential School would be escorted to and from the Residential School.\n\n5. A report would be provided by the Residential School each morning of the absentees of Residential School pupils.\n\n6. The Classroom Teachers would report each morning to the Principal of the Day School any absentees from their classes.\n\n7. In order to permit ample time for the Residential School children to return to the Residence for the lunch hour, the morning session would be closed at 11:45 and the afternoon session would open at 1:15. The afternoon session would end at 3:30. This adjustment in hours was to be tried to see if the hour and a half lunch period was suitable.\n\n8. No child was to be detained more than thirty minutes after school and no child in the Primary grades (Grades 1 to 3) was to be detained at all.\n\n9. Teachers detaining children in Grades 4 to 8 were to report such detentions to the Day School Principal so that the Residential School would be informed.\n\n10. Teachers in classrooms at the Residential School were to\nshare the responsibility of supervision of the Day School pupils in the lunchrooms and playgrounds at noon and recess.\n\n11. The Principal of the Day School would be responsible for the grading and grouping of pupils.\n\n12. All village children would report to the Day School for class assignment on the first day of school.\n\n13. The matter of the observance of Days of Holy Obligation would be referred to the Department for a decision.\n\n14. Copies of these arrangements were to be duplicated and copies sent to the Principal of the Day School, the Principal of the Residential School, the Indian Superintendent and to each of the Teachers.\n\n---\n\nYou will note from the above that at no time was there any suggestion that the enrollment of pupils from the Residential School at the Day School implied that the Day School Principal would exercise any authority over the pupils once the normal classroom day had ended, nor is there any suggestion that the Principal of the Residential School should interfere with the operation of the Day School. If Mr. Allsopp felt that there was any attempt at interference with his authority or responsibilities, he certainly did not say so in my presence. I am confident that there was no wish on the part of either Mrs. Scanlon or Mr. Todd to do so. Surely Mr. Allsopp is not suggesting that he should control the operation of the Day School, particularly in view of the very inefficient manner in which the classroom work has been conducted in his school in the past three and a half years. I am at a loss to understand what Canon Cook means in his sentence: \"In their zeal to 'secularize' the school system there is grave danger that Mr. Todd, Mrs. Scanlon and the School Inspector are going to overlook the fact that the children in the Day School from St. Michaels are still residential school children\". If he means that I feel that children from the Residential School in attendance at the Day School should conform with Day School regulations, he is quite correct.\n\nI take very strong objection to the implication in the third paragraph of Canon Cook's letter that the Day School has not a good standard of discipline; in fact, the Alert Bay Day School has made a very great contribution to the improvement of the behaviour of the children in Alert Bay. Unfortunately, a similar statement cannot be\nmade with respect to the Residential School. I have no hesitation in saying that the Alert Bay Day School is the most efficiently operated Indian Day School in British Columbia and compares very favorably with Provincial schools.\n\nCanon Cook makes inquiry concerning religious instruction. It has not been the practice of the Alert Bay Day School to devote 25 minutes per day to religious instruction as is permitted by Departmental regulations, but I know that the Day School has made a considerable contribution in the way of moral instruction and character building through the efforts of the teachers. There is no reason why the Residential School should not follow the practice that is general in many Residential Schools of holding a brief religious period before the commencement of the classroom day or in the evenings, which I understand is the time set aside at the Alert Bay Residential School for prayers.\n\nCanon Cook asks: \"Our handicrafts have played an important part in school life and this year an exhibit has been sent to Victoria - is this to be forfeited?\". Some time ago I was asked by Mr. Allsopp whether the Residential School would be permitted to retain the tools now used at the Residential School for Industrial Arts. I informed him that as far as I was concerned I could see no objection to such an arrangement and I was fairly confident that the Department would permit this. I certainly do not feel that the Residential School should dictate to the Day School the program that should be instigated or interfere with Industrial Arts program which we are able to establish at the Day School.\n\nI regret that it is not possible for me to sit down with Canon Cook, Mr. Allsopp and Mr. Neary for a discussion of this whole matter, but I cannot help but feel that this problem has assumed proportions quite beyond what is warranted. It is possible that Canon Cook gained an impression from Mr. Allsopp which the Reverend Principal did not wish to give.\n\nR. F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nThe attached letter received from Principal J. E. Allsopp,\nof the Alert Bay Residential School, Alert Bay, B. C., is being\nforwarded you for your information. It is my understanding most\nof this work accomplished was in room Grade Four under the instruc-\ntions of Miss Hamilton, who I understand has reached the retiring\nage and no longer available for employment by our Branch.\n\nI might also add the Alert Bay Indian Day School won the\nProvincial Cup this year in respect to TB Poster Competition. We\nare very pleased with the progress being made in this Agency with\nrespect to education and my object in writing you is that this would\nnot have been possible if we had not received your support in provid-\ning necessary schools and equipment. There is much to be done, but\nwe feel with your help and continued interest this also will be, ac-\ncomplished fact in due course.\n\n(M. S.

Citizenship & Immigration  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary: Re: St. Michael's School, Alert Bay\n\nIn conversation with Principal Allsopp, after our visit with you, (It's a pity it was not discussed when we were with you) he brought up the matter of co-operation between the St. Michael's School authorities and the day school authorities at Alert Bay when the experiment of having the residential school children attend day school classes goes into practice.\n\nIn their zeal to \"secularize\" the school system there is grave danger that Mr. Todd, Mrs. Scanlon and the School Inspector are going to overlook the fact that the children in the day school from St. Michaels are still residential school children. Mr. Todd apparently is taking the attitude that he and Mrs. Scanlon are going to be in full control over the activities of the children and that St. Michaels will simply be the place where they eat and sleep. Such an attitude is altogether different from I.S.A. understanding of the experiment.\n\nIt must be remembered that through the years the Church of England has expended thousands of dollars and the labors of many of its adherents at St. Michaels in an effort to give the children a Christian upbringing and help them to adjust to changing conditions. If the control of the children is going to be taken out of the hands of the Principal the experiment is doomed to failure before it begins. We are willing to cooperate most certainly and fully expect to have to make many adjustments in residential school life but if the St. Michaels children are going to be allowed to become undisciplined youngsters such as the village children now are the whole purpose of the Church maintaining workers at St. Michaels is lost.\n\nAs in the Roman Church - we too have days of obligation - is the observance of these special days to be discontinued? St. Michael's Day has, since the founding of\n\np.t.o.\nColonel Neary\n\nJuly 12, 1950.\n\nthe School, been a day of celebration without any loss to the academic interests of the children - are these things to go by the board? What about religious instruction - is time in the curriculum to be allowed for this? Our handicrafts have played an important part in school life and this year an exhibit has been sent to Victoria - is this to be forfeited?\n\nWe realize that because of this experiment we shall have to concentrate more and more on extra curricular and evening activities largely to overcome the influences the children will experience in their association with the village children. This letter is not meant to be a stumbling block in the way of progress - not by any means but simply to show how problems will arise unless all parties concerned have a firm understanding of the whole purpose and conduct of the experiment.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would issue a directive on this topic to both the Day School and the Residential School authorities so that the matter may be clarified.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHenry J. Cook\nSuperintendent\nJuly 21st, 1950\n\nB.F.

I might add that I fully concur with Mr. Davey's memorandum and feel that the matters mentioned can easily be remedied locally without disrupting either the day or the residential school pupils.\n\nI should like to try and come to some arrangement with Mr. Allsopp regarding the observance of days of obligation referred to by him as I feel it would be a pity to have the entire residential school pupilage absent when the other pupils are required to attend.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOctober 3, 1950.\n\nMEMORANDUM - Mr. W. S. Arneil:\n\nRe: Consolidation Classroom Work,\nAlert Bay Day and Residential Schools.\n\nOn September 17, 18, 20 and 21 I visited the Alert Bay Day and Residential Schools in order to make an assessment of the effect of consolidating the classroom work of the two schools. In spite of some unavoidable difficulties occasioned by the recent railway strike and the late arrival of teachers, this scheme has gone into effect with less difficulty than I had anticipated. These minor difficulties were overcome quite quickly and I was impressed with the smoothness with which the scheme was going forward. The calibre of the teaching staff is good, the movement of children from the Residence to the Day School is taking place without friction, the classroom facilities, although inadequate at the present time, are far superior to the arrangement which prevailed at the Residential School in preceding years. Both the Principal of the Residential School and the Matron have stated that far fewer difficulties have arisen than they had anticipated. I am sure this scheme will be even more effective when the new classroom block is provided, which will give adequate classroom space and relieve the crowded conditions which now prevail in the Residential School and also lighten the teaching load.\n\nThe Principal of the Residential School informs me that his staff is overworked at the moment because of two staff vacancies. In spite of this, my observation of the Residential School indicates that conditions there are much better than they have been since 1947 when I first visited the Residential School. In addition, all of the pupils are attending class on a full day basis under competent teachers. A review of my reports indicate that in both these respects there has been a very marked improvement. The general tone of the children's behaviour has also greatly improved.\nThe chief difficulty is the failure of the two schools to coordinate their extra curricular work. This point was discussed at a meeting of the two Principals and Mr. Superintendent Todd. At this time I expressed the belief that there was no reason why there should not be more co-operative work and both Principals have agreed to try and work out a program which would make fuller use of the recreational facilities at both schools. I cannot help but feel that part of this difficulty is occasioned by something less than full confidence on the part of the Principal of the Residential School in this experiment. I do not wish to imply that the Rev. Principal has not made some effort to be co-operative, quite the reverse is true, but it was evident that he wished to retain as much control as possible over his pupils and seemed to resent the loss which had already taken place. I feel confident, however, that as time goes on the effectiveness of the experiment will convince Mr. Allsopp that the scheme is practical and that there is no loss in moral instruction and character building.\n\nThe primary weakness appears to be the lack of an over-all authority to control and co-ordinate the work. I am hopeful that this deficiency will be minimized by the full co-operation of both schools.\n\nThe use of three rooms at the Residential School and the shortage of staff at the Residence has placed an unfair load on Mr. Allsopp and I should like to state that he has in this respect been the most co-operative and most understanding.\n\nAlthough it is somewhat early to make a complete assessment as to how effective this scheme will be, there is no doubt that it has already made a marked improvement in the efficiency of the educational program at Alert Bay.\n\nR.

May we please be informed as to the designation and dates of these?\n\nSince the Residential School pupils are to be excused from class, may I suggest that the Day School pupils at Alert Bay should also receive this privilege. I feel that it is essential that all students be placed upon the same basis if this experiment is to be successful.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, September 1, 1950.\n\nMemorandum to\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nAlert Bay Indian Residential School\n\nTwo years ago the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada agreed to have the children from the above-named Residential School educated at the Alert Bay Indian Day School. We have gradually been providing sufficient accommodation at the Alert Bay Indian Day School to carry out this agreement.\n\nTwo years ago a four-classroom block was provided from buildings secured through War Assets Corporation from the Port Hardy Military Camp. A two-classroom building from the same source is to be provided this summer.\n\nIt is planned to erect another four-classroom block this year, but to date plans have not yet been completed.\n\nIn accordance with our agreement with the Church of England, it is therefore recommended that the Department take over the payment of the salaries of the three remaining teachers at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. This will mean nine divisions being operated with approximately three hundred and sixty pupils. About two hundred will come from the Residential School and the remaining one hundred and sixty will come from the Alert Bay Indian Village.\n\nThis will provide a unified system of education at Alert Bay and will ensure a better calibre of teachers.\nThe Residential School teachers have been resigning regularly each year, due to the higher salaries, better working conditions and superannuation benefits which can be obtained in teaching in Indian Day Schools.\n\nThe present per capita grant rate at this school is $290.00 per annum. The last audit report for the year ended December 31, 1949, shows that the dollar cost per pupil at this school was $300.75. In view of this information, I would recommend that we do not reduce the per capita rate at this school but leave it at the present amount. We should also inform the M.S.C.C. that this school has been given an increase in grant in that the Department has assumed the cost of paying the teachers.\n\nI would recommend, therefore, that the Minister grant authority in the usual way for the payment of these teachers at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, now to become teachers at the Indian Day School. It is anticipated that the salaries involved will amount to about $6,500.00 an academic year.\n\nDirector.\n\nRecommended.\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nApproved.\n\nMinister.\nSeptember 1, 1950.\n\nReverend Canon H.

It was decided that as a temporary arrangement three classrooms would be held in rooms made available by the Residential School.\n\n2. The assignment of Teachers to the rooms and grades was made.\n\n3. Mr. Allsopp agreed to provide living accommodation for two teachers, namely, Mrs. Lamperson and Mrs. Bridge. The amount of board and lodging was to be set by the Principal of the Residential School at a figure which would be fair and reasonable.\n\n4. The pupils from the Residential School would be escorted to and from the Residential School.\n\n5. A report would be provided by the Residential School each morning of the absentees of Residential School pupils.\n6. The Classroom Teachers would report each morning to the Principal of the Day School any absences from their classes.\n\n7. In order to permit ample time for the Residential School children to return to the Residence for the lunch hour, the morning session would be closed at 11:45 and the afternoon session would open at 1:15. The afternoon session would end at 3:30. This adjustment in hours was to be tried to see if the hour and a half lunch period was suitable.\n\n8. No child was to be detained more than thirty minutes after school and no child in the Primary grades (Grades 1 to 3) was to be detained at all.\n\n9. Teachers detaining children in Grades 4 to 8 were to report such detentions to the Day School Principal so that the Residential School would be informed.\n\n10. Teachers in classrooms at the Residential School were to share the responsibility of supervision of the Day School pupils in the lunchrooms and playgrounds at noon and recess.\n\n11. The Principal of the Day School would be responsible for the grading and grouping of pupils.\n\n12. All village children would report to the Day School for class assignment on the first day of school.\n\n13. The matter of the observance of Days of Holy Obligation would be referred to the Department for a decision.\n\n14. Copies of these arrangements were to be duplicated and copies sent to the Principal of the Day School, the Principal of the Residential School, the Indian Superintendent and to each of the Teachers.\nWith regard to paragraph 13, I have assured you that the Department will allow a maximum of three such days of Holy Obligation for a normal year. I believe that in the forthcoming academic year there are only two such days as one of them falls on a normal school holiday.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended ......................................................... 19......\n\nPrincipal ..................................................................\n\nDated ................................................................. 19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n.................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended 19.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A.403\nRequ.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................School for the Quarter ended......................................................19......\n\nPrincipal................................................................\n\nDated..............................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n...........................................................................\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at..............................................................\n\nthis...............................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the......................................................School for the Quarter ended..........................................................19......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at..................................................................\n\nthis.................................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDated.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the..............................................................School for the Quarter ended.........................................................19......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at.................................................................this.........................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the..............................................................School for the Quarter ended.........................................................19......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent..................................................................\n\nDated at.................................................................this.................................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. All Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, piling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 20th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return, the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended ................................. 19...\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: ........................................... 19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at ........................................... this ........................................... 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2 and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the columns under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. These Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days residences of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended .\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDated .\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at .\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended 19 .\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet; paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALERT BAY, B. C. School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1945.\n\nPrincipal: S. J. Dickens\n\nDated April 5th 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10th\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On the Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended ..................................................10......\n\nPrincipal ..................................................................\n\nDated .................................................................10......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ..................................................................\n\nDated at .................................................................this .................................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended .................................................. 19......\n\nPrincipal ...............................................................\n\nDated .................................................. 19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ............................................................\n\nDated at .................................................. this .................................................. 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended.........................................................19......\n\nPrincipal...........................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at.................................................................this.........................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pages 8 No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the ALERT BAY, B.C.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................School for the Quarter ended ..................................................19..............\n\nPrincipal ..................................................................\n\nDated ..................................................19..............\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return, and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ..................................................................\n\nDated at ..................................................this ..................................................19..............\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................School for the Quarter ended ......................................................... 19......\n\nPrincipal ..................................................................\n\nDated ................................................................. 19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ...........................................................\n\nDated at ................................................................. this ................................................................. 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

(RC IC, Volume 6426, file 875-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended..................................................19......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated..................................................10......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent...........................................................\n\nDated at...........................................................\n\nthis..................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ...............................................................School for the Quarter ended ......................................................... 19......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated ................................................................. 19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent...........................................................\n\nDated at ............................................................ this ................................................................. 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended 19...\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nResp.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ......................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, turn another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended ........................................... 19......\n\nPrincipal .......................................................\n\nDated ......................................................... 19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ....................................................\n\nDated at .......................................................... this ......................................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Principal Dated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alert Bay B.C. this 26 Nov. 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0538            | Katherine Wilson | 14  | x   | Ahwamish | Brought Forward | 77/5                |                        | 0 1-9-45                  | 62         | Not returned                                                |\n| 0539            | Winifred Wilson | 12  | x   | Ahwamish | Brought Forward | 77/5                |                        | 20 1-9-45                 | 76         | Absent Sept.14                                              |\n| 0540            | Eleanor Dawson | 13  | x   | Tsawataineuk | Brought Forward | 77/5                |                        | 30 1-9-45                 | 92         | 22                                                          |\n| 0541            | Hazel Dawson   | 11  | x   | Tsawataineuk | Brought Forward | 77/5                |                        | 30 1-9-45                 | 92         | 22                                                          |\n| 0542            | Barbara Willie | 10  | x   | Tsawataineuk | Brought Forward | 77/5                |                        | 30 1-9-45                 | 92         | 17                                                          |\n| 0543            | Gloria Willie  | 9   | x   | Tsawataineuk | Brought Forward | 77/5                |                        | 30 1-9-45                 | 92         | 19 1/2                                                     |\n| 0544            | Frances Bell   | 10  | x   | Mamlilikulla | Brought Forward | 77/5                |                        | 30 1-9-45                 | 92         | 21 1/2                                                     |\n| 0545            | Janet Bell     | 12  | x   | Mamlilikulla | Brought Forward | 77/5                |                        | 30 1-9-45                 | 92         | 22                                                          |\n| 0547            | Martha Dawson  | 12  | x   | Tsawataineuk | Brought Forward | 77/5                |                        | 30 1-9-45                 | 92         | 22                                                          |\n| 0548            | Leona Vesta Woods | 12  | x   | Aiyansh    | Brought Forward | 77/5                |                        | 30 1-9-45                 | 92         | 22                                                          |\n| 0549            | Elsie Wamiss   | 12  | x   | Tsawataineuk | Brought Forward | 77/5                |                        | 30 1-9-45                 | 92         | 20                                                          |\n| 0551            | Joyce E.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, put another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case however, can payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Quarter:** 60\n\n**AMOUNT of per capita grant due for Quarter:** $\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will a return be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, piling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Michael's School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 12th, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alex Bay, this 5th June, 1948.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. 11A-403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nDated\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby Certify that the within Return is a

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days residing of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHerewith Requisition for School Material for the Preventorium. The Matron of this unit in submitting her requisition states as follows:\n\n\"Considering the number of patients (14) at the Preventorium, it is realized that some items on this list may seem in excess of normal requirements. This is due to several factors. In the first place, the Preventorium is operated as a unit separate from the school, and it is felt it will be much more satisfactory and more economical in the long run if the supply is established at the Preventorium. There can, of course, due to circumstances, be practically no \"doubling up\" in the use of textbooks, and since we are subject to an irregular change of patients there is an unpredictable change of grades. However, there is a careful supervision of supplies with no waste.\n\nWith regard to material for occupational therapy, which includes such things as raffia, paints, build-up posters, etc., even a small amount would be greatly appreciated since mental contentment plays such an important part in eventual cure, and it is a problem to keep little hands happily occupied with a minimum of physical expenditure.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to the quantities and varieties of school supplies requested, and it is hoped that the requisition will meet with favourable consideration.\"\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay.\n\nIn spite of this request, I have cut this requisition drastically in line with the Department's request in their circular C 1-1-4 of April 13th for economy, and it is hoped that as it now stands the Department may see fit to sanction the items requested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFEAL.\nEnclosure.\nPrincipal.\nAlways Ready\nBrownie and His Friends\nAnimals are Fun\nAnimals Work TOO\nTreasury Readers, Book 1\nTreasury Readers, \" ll\nElementary General Science\nHow We Are Fed\nCargoes & Cruises\nNature Study & Science\nLong Ago\nIn The Far Off Days\nAgriculture and Farm Life\nPinnocchio\nMally\nHappy Birthday\nForest Facts for Schools\nReal Adventures\nHistory of Britain - King\nHealth Through Science\nUnknown Ways\nSwampy Cree Legends\nRound the World\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\n18th June, 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nAttached please find a requisition for school material for the Preventorium operated in connection with St. Michael's Residential School, Alert Bay.\n\nThe enclosed letter from Principal Anfield will be self-explanatory, and I agree in his remarks and would kindly ask the Department to furnish the requisition if at all possible, as submitted.\n\nAt the present time there are fourteen patients in this Preventorium, and splendid work is being done by the staff in charge, and while the requisition may appear a little large, nevertheless once a certain amount of the material is provided, future requisitions will be more of a minor nature.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the requisition as requested be shipped direct to the \"Matron-in-charge, St. Michael's School Preventorium, Alert Bay, B.C.\".\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

The Government Stationery Office has tried several firms, but up to the present time has been unable to secure these books, although an order for a large supply was placed several months ago. As you are aware, the delay is due to shipping conditions.\n\nThese books may arrive at any time, and we are forwarding a requisition to the Government Stationery Office, so that they can send them on as soon as they are received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. Earl Anfield,\nPrincipal,\nAlert Bay Indian Res. School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir,\n\nAs the end of the school term is approaching, Principal Anfield has forwarded a list of the graduating pupils of the Alert Bay Residential School, and is making request that the Department grant to each pupil a Diploma as a record of this achievement. Eleven diplomas are requested, and the names of the pupils are shown on Mr. Anfield's letter of April 29th, copy of which is attached. I would request that the Department give this matter early attention so that the diplomas may arrive in time for the closing exercises.\n\nIn another communication of the same date, copy attached, Principal Anfield is placing before the Department a request for Bibles and Prayer and Hymn Books as graduation gifts to pupils leaving the school this year, and has submitted a requisition covering the quantities required. Such gifts have been the practice in the past, and if possible I would recommend that the Department continue this very worth-while gesture. These too would be appreciated, if granted, in time for the closing exercises of the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S.

It may be that the Department of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, could furnish you with same, and we are therefore today referring your letter to the above department for their attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Chief, Division of Documents.\n\nMr. F.

MICHAEL'S SCHOOL\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nNOV. 2nd, 1942.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Public Printing & Stationery\nOTTAWA ONTARIO.\n\nSir:\n\nPlease advise if a Bulletin published by your Department dealing with Indian Arts and Crafts and their Preservation, and edited by Mr. Harlan Smith, is available still? I understand this Bulletin was published twenty years ago, if available please advise the cost of three copies, and oblige.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFEA/dnw\nPRINCIPAL\nOttawa,\nSeptember 30, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 22nd instant and also copies of correspondence relating to the purchase of a \"Book of Knowledge\" for the Alert Bay Residential School.\n\nThe records here indicate that a few years ago, when money was plentiful, a few sets of these books were purchased by way of experiment. In a period as critical as this, however, and at a time when we are called upon to use both sides of the paper, a request such as this cannot be even considered.\n\nIndian Agent Todd's reference to canvassers, who sold approximately $1500.00 worth of cheap jewelry to Indians, is somewhat disturbing. I appreciate very fully, of course, that it is exceedingly difficult for Indian agents to keep a close check on such matters. It might be advisable, however, to remind Indian agents again and residential school principals that canvassing on Indian reserves and canvassing at Indian residential schools should not be permitted. Now that the Indian Act is up for revision it is just possible that certain amendments may occur to you that would assist Indian agents and residential school principals in correcting these abuses.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Todd's letter of the 15th instant with enclosures as stated wherein Mr. F.E. Anfield, Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, requests the supply of a set of the \"Book of Knowledge\" which is published by the Grolier Society Limited of Toronto, at a cost of $69.00 plus express, and which it will be observed is not recommended for approval by the Indian Agent.\n\nI have no personal knowledge of the books, their content, nor the suitability for a Residential School. However, if the Department is satisfied that they are of educational value, they will no doubt give the application consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nKT\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEnclos.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nSeptember 15, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe enclosed correspondence and Order Form received from Principal Anfield of St. Michael's School will be self-explanatory.\n\nWhile no doubt this set of books would be valuable equipment for the school, nevertheless I cannot understand Principal Anfield making such a request when the Department are having difficulty in obtaining funds for the essential services which must be provided if our schools are to be kept in operation, and I cannot recommend that the Department make this purchase at this time.\n\nI might add the Agent for this Society called on me, and I gave him no satisfaction and requested that he not prevail upon the Indians to purchase this set of books. I pointed out to him that I felt the Indians should be expected to put their money into Victory Bonds or War Savings rather than into this sort of thing at the present time; however I understand he did sell one or two sets to Indians, and quite a number to the white settlements in this district.\n\nWhile I appreciate the value of this set of books for children in ordinary times, it seems to me these matters should be drawn to the Government's attention when they are striving for a total war effort, as there are thousands of dollars yearly being spent in this way which would otherwise be available to help finance the war if such sales were prohibited for the duration.\n\nI would like to also point out that during the past year an Agent selling jewellery made a canvass of Alert Bay, and it is definitely known to me that he sold approximately fifteen hundred dollars' worth to Indians in the district before I got to know about it and ordered him to leave the Reserve.\n\nNo doubt there will be other Agents in this district at the close of the present fishing season when the Indians have lots of money, and I personally will do everything I can to discourage sales of this nature.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nWe recently had a series of visits from the representative of the Grolier Society, Mr. R. B. McLure. He asked me to consider through the Department the purchase of a set of the \"Book of Knowledge\". He had sundry other endowments in which we are not particularly interested, but a ten volume set of \"Book of Knowledge\" would be of real help in the School, should the department have the inclination and the funds to purchase same. They purchased a set for the School some fifteen years ago, it did yeomen service, and was highly valued by both Teachers and Pupils alike.\n\nI have no wish in these days of war to request unnecessary equipment, and pass attached bids on for consideration should the Department find itself towards the close of the year with a few unnecessary dollars from School Votes.\n\nThanking you,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\n\nIndian Affairs.

Our Graduating Exercises are set for June 20th\u201421st, and if granted it is hoped that these will arrive in ample time for this occasion.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\n27th April, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe enclosed requisition for Bibles, Anglican Hymn and Prayer Books and United Church Hymnaries as submitted by Principal Anfield to be used as graduation gifts to pupils this year, is recommended by myself, and it would be appreciated if the Department could give this immediate attention so that the shipment may be made in time to arrive here for the closing exercises of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\nJUNE 16, 1943.\n\nIndian Agent\nAlert Bay B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nAttached please find Supplementary Requisitions for Classroom material.\n\nYou will recall that the main Requisitions were submitted some months ago, and have now been filled by the Department. It is regretted that this Supplementary Requisition is necessary at this time, but it was considered unwise early in the year to try and estimate the texts books required. We have now completed the annual classroom examinations, and these text books have been ordered in the light of the new grading set-up for the next School year. In the Past we have been in the unhappy position of either having too many or too few texts for the grades. And either situation is particularly wasteful in these times of war.\n\nIn connection with the Hymn Books, these are absolutely essential for school use. The Department has not been asked to supply any of these for some three or four years, and extraordinary care has been taken to look after the hymn books supplied. Our present supply is completely worn out and cannot possibly be used next term. We would appreciate the small cloth covered hymn book only, which costs about twenty-five cents retail.\n\nYour approval of these Requisitions will be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFEA/dmw\n\nPRINCIPAL\n**Requisition for School Material**\n\n**SUPPLY OFFICE**\n\n**Date:** JUNE 15, 1943\n\n**For:** Sr. Mississaugas\n\n**School:** KWANKEWLTH\n\n**Agency:** Alert Bay Indian Residential School\n\n---\n\n**NOTE:**\n\nTo avoid delay, teachers should give full particulars regarding each article required.\n\nThe name, series, number of grade, and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\n\nWhen ordering kindergarten material, the catalogue number of some well known firm should be given for each article required.\n\nOnly one item should be specified on each line of this requisition and no entry should be made under heading \"Number Authorized\".\n\n| ARTICLES                        | NUMBER ON HAND | DATE OF LAST RECEIPT | NUMBER REQUIRED | NUMBER AUTHORIZED | REMARKS                  |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| Highroads to Reading            |                |                       |                 |                   |                          |\n| Book 2, Hyerson Press          | 24             |                       | 24              |                   |                          |\n| Highroads to Reading            |                |                       |                 |                   |                          |\n| Book 3, Hyerson Press          | 24             |                       | 24              |                   |                          |\n| Canadian Individual Arithmetic  |                |                       |                 |                   |                          |\n| (John & Co.)                   | 24             |                       | 24              |                   |                          |\n| Canadian Individual Arithmetic  |                |                       |                 |                   |                          |\n| (John & Co.)                   | 30             |                       | 30              |                   |                          |\n| Reading Exercises              |                |                       |                 |                   |                          |\n| Grade 7                        | 30             |                       |                 |                   |                          |\n| Reading Exercises              |                |                       |                 |                   |                          |\n| Grade 4                        | 12             |                       | 12              |                   |                          |\n| Reading Exercises              |                |                       |                 |                   |                          |\n| Grade 5                        | 24             |                       | 24              |                   |                          |\n| Anglican Hymn Books             |                |                       |                 |                   |                          |\n| (Combined)                     | 200            |                       | 200             |                   |                          |\n| School Flag, Union Jack        | 1 only         |                       |                 |                   |                          |\n\nN.B.\u2014Explicit information regarding address must be furnished.\n\n**Name:** THE PRINCIPE, F.

S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncs. 6.\nIndian Agent  \nAlert Bay B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nIt is regretted that we must place before you for consideration the attached School Requisition, which we would ask you to place before the Department with the following explanation.\n\nThe last large Requisition was sent in December 42. In accordance with a circular from the Department this requisition was for supplies for the entire 43-44 School year. Unfortunately our Senior and Intermediate class rooms were in the hands of inexperienced teachers, whom we now find grievously underestimated the requirements of their classes. The Senior class room teacher in particular competely failed to appreciate the text needs of his room.\n\nThis year we are fortunate indeed to have four experienced and highly capable teachers, and a survey of our stock and class room material has proven alarming. After a conference with these teachers and a careful check of supplies I instructed them to prepare the attached requisitions which are minimum requirements to get us through the present academic year 43-44.\n\nThe School is filled to capacity, we have a Grade 5 class of 5 pupils, and it is certified that the texts and material on this requisition are urgently required and essential for the efficient operation of the School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\n\nFEA/dmw\nALBERT BAY\n\n1.

Attached please find Requisition in triplicate for the supply of 30 Bibles, 15 Anglican Hymn & Prayer Books, and 12 United Church Hymnaries.\n\nWould you be kind enough to expedite the enclosed request so that we may get these books in time for our graduation exercises June 19th or 20th.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS.

Driscoll, Supt. of Stationery, Dept. of Public Printing & Stationery, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe Requisition No. 24315.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 9th instant in which you state that an official of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School has advised you that the 3 packages of industrial weaving mats ordered on the above requisition have not been received.\n\nWe have had so much difficulty in endeavouring to have these particular supplies delivered to the Alert Bay Residential School that I would suggest you ask your supplier to send the weaving mats which are ordered on the attached requisition - No. 24742 - by registered mail. My reason for asking this is that the teacher in question has been pestering us with letters about the non-receipt of weaving mats ordered by her and if we can keep her happy by delivering the mats it will certainly have a good effect on the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. P. Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nOn March 3rd I received a note from your official at Alert Bay Indian Residential School stating that he had not received the 5 packets of Industrial Weaving Mats No. 128 on requisition No. 24315. I endeavoured to trace this item but find that the 5 packets of Construction paper went forward by Parcel Post to the consignee on November 15th and the 5 packets Weaving Mats were sent by Parcel Post on December 28th. The Company states that there is very little they can do with the Post Office at this late date regarding proof of delivery.\n\nJ. W.

C.,\nOct. 17th, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nAbout the middle of March last this office forwarded a requisition for school supplies for St. Michael's Preventorium, Alert Bay, B. C., but to date no supplies have been received.\n\nRev. S. J. Wickens, Principal of St. Michael's Residential School, wrote the Department a while ago inquiring when the supplies would be forwarded, and the Principal informs us the Department stated they have never received the requisition. That is rather difficult to understand as the requisition was forwarded from this office. However, a duplicate requisition has been made, which is attached hereto, and it would be appreciated if the supplies could be forwarded at an early date.\n\n(M. S.

Where does that departmental series on Classroom Projects come from? We need a book on crafts for beginners. Where and how much would material be and come from? If here can I get some tasteful and instructively beautiful, framed pictures? Where does one get those wall posters out-outs of farm and city, and how little people live in far-away lands?\nHave you any free horticultural supplies or books on easy agriculture, suitable for bed-side study? What film slides for a little electric projector are available?\n\nIs there by chance a travelling library system I could get in touch with? Is there a similar travelling picture study group available?\n\nYou have never failed to supply information most willingly before, so I shall most happily look forward to my requests being filled as nearly as possible now.\n\nThank you very much,\n\nYours very truly,\n(Miss) Morbo T. Scott\nOttawa, June 18, 1947.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your request for fifty Anglican Combined Prayer and Hymn Books, I have endeavoured to obtain, without success, the type of Combined Prayer and Hymn Book that we supply to our Anglican Indian Residential Schools from both the General Board of Religious Education, 60th Jarvis Street, Toronto, and the Oxford University Press, Toronto, who have supplied us in the past. These books are printed in England and are, therefore, extremely difficult to obtain.\n\nWe have, in stock, a limited number of Combined Prayer and Hymn Books, with words and music, which we supply for teachers' use only. If there is none of these in your school, you might forward a request for one for each teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. S.J.

Our files show that in a letter dated October 30th the Indian Agent forwarded a letter dated October 22nd from Reverend Mr. Wickens stating that they had not received a sufficient number of lead pencils. On the original requisition we had ordered the number of pencils requested by the principal and when we received the letter mentioned above we immediately communicated with the Government Stationery Office and arranged to have them check the matter and send the additional pencils if they had not already done so.

We have not received any reply to that communication and we are anxious to know if the additional number of lead pencils has gone forward to this school.\n\nFor your information I may say that a recent letter from the principal reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Unless a supply arrives soon, I shall have to place an order with a Vancouver firm to carry us through to June\".\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W.J.

We have been in communication with you in this regard from time to time and have had to buy pencils locally, but to date have not received definite word as to when we may expect the balance of this requisition.\n\nThe pencils are urgently needed for the opening of the new term in January, and it would be appreciated if you could arrange for us to receive them at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nB.O.G.

Phelan,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Books and Pictures for Alert Bay School.\n\nYour File: 875-4(36)\n\nThank you very much for the information of your letter of January 31, 1952.\n\nI have written Principal Cheales advising him to see Mr. Todd as soon as possible in regard to borrowing some books from the Indian Day School.\n\nIt is unfortunate that no pictures are available for use in the children's dining-room. The place is rather drab and a few pictures on the walls would have cheered the place up considerably. At a later date I intend looking around to see if some pictures cannot be procured from some other Government Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention: Supt. of Education,\n\nWith reference to your letter 875-4(B6) dated January 28, 1952 and attached requisition for textbooks etc., for Alert Bay Indian Residential School, Preventorium.\n\nAs the Preventorium is a separate unit from the Alert Bay Indian Day School where all the children of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School are educated, it is thought that it would be more advisable to have these items shipped direct and separately.\n\nYour action as necessary or further advice would therefore be appreciated.\n\nM. S. Todd,\nSuperintendent,\nKwawkewlth Agency.\nJanuary 31, 1952.\n\nRev. Canon H.G. Cook,\nSuperintendent,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank St.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 28th regarding books and pictures for the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, we have reviewed our files and note that library books valued at $235. were shipped to the Alert Bay Day School this year and similar allotments were shipped to the day and residential school during the past number of years.\n\nIt is presumed that you would like to have a number of books placed in the reading room adjoining the dormitories in the residential school for the children to use in the evenings. It is felt that a satisfactory circulating library can be arranged between the day school and the residential school for the purpose you mention. The Principal of the residential school should be able to arrange with the teachers to loan a quantity of books from each classroom for a period of two or three weeks and place these in the residential school reading room.\n\nAfter a period agreed upon, these books can be returned to the day school classrooms and new lots brought to the residential school. In this way, the books will serve two purposes and will become more attractive to the children in new surroundings.\nI am forwarding a copy of this letter to Indian Superintendent Todd in order that he may bring this matter to the attention of the principals in both schools.\n\nWith reference to the pictures, I regret to inform you that we have no suitable pictures in stock and are unable to supply them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJanuary 28, 1952.\n\nMr. P. N. Phelan,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Pictures & Books\n\nI've just completed a visit to St. Michael's School, Alert Bay, and noted that there was a lack of reading material for the children in the way of light fiction. Could you please let me know if there is any way the Principal can requisition for a quantity of good fiction for both boys and girls? There are 210 pupils in the School and a goodly number of them like to spend their free time reading.\n\nIt was also noted that the walls in the dining room were rather bare. Is it possible to procure through Indian Affairs Branch six or eight of the cardboard reproductions in frames which one sees in government offices? Such pictures placed about the dining room would do much to brighten what is now rather a plain room.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office.\n\nSuperintendent.\nJanuary 28, 1952.\n\nMr. M.S. Todd,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\n\nAttached I am returning the requisition for supplies and textbooks for the Preventorium at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nAs this is a part of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, it would be appreciated if you would ask the Principal when preparing the requisition for the school to include the items requested on this requisition, as it is felt that all supplies for the residential school should be requisitioned, shipped and stored together.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEncl:\n\nMFT/HM\n17. 8. 51\n\nDept. of Nutrition,\nIndian Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you kindly send me the necessary papers for filing and for badges in cooking for the Indian girls.\n\nThanking you,\n\n(Signed) Eva Kelley,\n(Kitchen Manager)\n\nIndian Affairs.

According to our file this requisition was forwarded to the Department on January 19th, 1952. In the event it has not been received another copy is attached hereto and in view of the urgency for this material it would be appreciated if preference could be given it.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nSt. Michael's Indian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B. C.,\nApril 1, 1952.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou will recollect having discussed with me requisition for Office and School supplies on your last visit to Alert Bay. You mentioned that you would take the requisition with you, have it filled, and supplies sent to our School. As yet we have received nothing, and some office supplies are becoming drastically low.\n\nRecently I sent a reminder to your office in Vancouver and have had no acknowledgment of same. Just this week I heard that you were transferred to Ottawa, and am writing you with the hope that you will look into this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs Education Department,\nOttawa.\n\nP.S. You will recall I placed this requisition several months ago, and you brought it with you when you visited us. Please expedite shipment of at least the office supplies, stationery etc.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-4, part 1)\nApril 7, 1952.\n\nRev. A.B.

By dealing with the requisition after the middle of March the cost of these supplies will be charged against the fiscal year 1952-53.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n**Department of Citizenship and Immigration**\n\nMarch 31, 1952\n\n**PLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF**\n\n| VOTE | PRIMARY | OBJECT | DATE REQUIRED |\n|------|---------|--------|---------------|\n|      |         |        |               |\n\n**SHIP TO**\n\nThe Teacher, Alert Bay Indian Day School, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\n**Purpose for which required**\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 375      |            |       |\n|          | Report Cards & Envelopes, I.A. 416 |       |\n| 12       |            |       |\n|          | pads Day School Returns, I.A. 417 |       |\n\n**Received**\n\nAPR 2 1952\n\n**I hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

It is most unfortunate that, of all items, this one should be left off, as it has been our policy for years to present each graduate of our School with a copy of Holy Scripture. This year we would have had none whatever, had I not, as a last resort, ordered same direct from Vancouver, and paid for them from limited Petty Cash.\"\n\nIt will be appreciated if you will look into this\n\n(P.T.O.)\nmatter and endeavour to have the shortages mentioned made good at an early date.\n\nWill you please advise us of the action you take so that we may notify the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHenry G.

Davey regarding school supplies for the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, we have taken the matter up with the Department of Public Printing and Stationery regarding these items and are advised as follows:\n\n1. #4481 Earnscliffe Paper, 8 x 10\n2. #4185 Bond, Pink, 8 x 9\u00bd\n\nThe above paper is normally packed for requisitioning purposes in packets of 500 sheets. When the above items were sent to the Alert Bay School, one packet of 1000 sheets of each of the above two were shipped, consequently the Principal requested 1000 sheets in two packets and received 1000 sheets in one packet.\n\n3. #3183 T.W. Carbon Paper, 8 x 10\n4. #140 Holy Bibles\n\nThe above items were not in stock when the requisition was received, consequently could not be shipped. The Queen's Printer has back-ordered these two items and they will be shipped when available.\n5. #3279 Fasteners, straight #2\n   3072 Fasteners, straight #4\n\nThese two items will be shipped shortly.\n\nIt is regretted that the shipment of the Holy Bibles could not be made when requested. However, it is expected that these will reach the school within a reasonably short time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am enclosing a requisition in triplicate for a Model 120 Gestetner for the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. The Rev. Principal, Mr. Cheales, has discussed the supply of this equipment with Mr. Parminter and it is considered that the machine requested will best meet the requirements of the school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if purchase of this machine could be made at an early date as the school mimeograph which is quite obsolete is inoperative and the time for preparation of the school's regular newsletter to the parents is drawing near.\n\nW.

I estimate the cost of the buildings as shown and specified to be four thousand dollars ($4000.00), not including the furnishing inside which would include Clothing for the boys and all requisites, this I estimate at $1600, and to this must be added a further sum of $1500 for provisions and payment of employees and $500 more for contingencies making a total of $7600 to get the proposed school fairly started.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) R.

(RC 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo Deputy Minister\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, 3rd April, 1891\n\nThe provisions made for the Alert Bay School in 1891-92 is as follows:\n\nConstruction of the building $2,000.00\nBalance for current year $700.00\nFemale pupils at $70.00 $700.00\n\nTotal $6,800.00\nMemorandum -\n\nThe undersigned begs to submit herewith a letter of the 25th inst. from the Visiting Indian Agent for B.C., as well as one of the 12th inst. from the Indian Agent for the Naramata Agency, having reference to the proposed establishment of an industrial institution on Cormorant Island, Alert Bay.\n\nIn connection with this matter the undersigned begs to report that the plans and specifications, as well as the estimate of the cost of the building submitted by the Agent, are for a regular industrial scheme, whereas the Dept. understood\n\nTo the Hon.\n\nE. Dunbar,\nDept. Sec'y of Ind. Affairs.\nfrom the commencement\nthat it was not proposed\nto establish a school at\nwhich Indian boys should be\nboarded, but that merely\nworkshops were to be erected\nat which young men and\nboys could be instructed in\ntrades, such as carpentry,\nblacksmithing and boatbuilding,\ninstructors being provided\nat the expense of the Dept.\nIt was supposed that the\npupils would give daily attendance\nat the workshops for the\npurpose of receiving instruction\nin these industries, and that\nthey would reside at their\nhomes in the vicinity. Mr.\nAgent Pidcock, in a previous\ncommunication, expressed the\nopinion that, were an\ninstitution of this kind\nestablished at Alert Bay, it\nwould induce many Indians\nfrom other parts to remove\nthere and settle down in the\nvicinity of the institution; and he submitted estimates of the cost of erecting a building for such an institution and of affording instruction in the above lines of industry to the pupils attending thereof. The first estimate submitted by him placed the whole cost at from $1500 to $2000. Subsequently this estimate was amended; and he then stated it as his opinion, in which Mr. Adrian Reserve Comte O'Reilly concurred, that the building would cost $1200; that the wages of the instructors in the three trades above mentioned would amount to $2700 per annum, being $75 a month each; and that the cost of articles required to be purchased in order to admit of the instruction being given would be about $300\u2014making the total amount of his estimate $4200.\nIn the supplementary estimates for 1890-91 this amount was included, and it is still available for the purposes of the institution.\n\nNow, however, Mr. Pidcock submits a more extravagant estimate based upon plans and specifications for a regular industrial school at which pupils are to be boarded, the cost of which he estimates at \u00a34000, without including furniture, clothing for boys and other requisites, which he estimates at \u00a31600, and the cost of maintenance and salaries of employees, which he places at \u00a31500, besides \u00a3500 for unforeseen expenses; thus making a total estimate of \u00a37600 to get the proposed institution fairly started. This last estimate, it will be observed, is \u00a33400 in excess of the preceding one; and no provision has been made for the excess of cost. Mr. Agent Pidcock gives no reason or explanation in his\nletter for his championing his views in regard to the character of the institution to be established.\n\nThe undersigned considers that, before the Dept can intelligently take his proposal to establish an industrial school at which pupils shall be boarded into consideration, he should be called upon to explain why he has made the recommendation in the direction which his last communication on the subject indicates; and that the Visiting Indian Dept at Victoria should also be asked to give his views on the proposed change in the original intention in regard to the suggested establishment.\n\nThe undersigned would add that, in view of the uncivilized character of the Kawawkewth Indians who, as stated in a previous report, are probably the most debased in the Dominion, it is exceedingly questionable whether the time has come for the\nestablishment of a regular industrial school at which children would be admitted as boarders, and whether it would not be more prudent, before expending a large amount of money, to commence operations at Alert Bay in a moderate scale by establishing some such institution as was at first proposed, and for which Parliament has voted the money.\n\nH. Macdonald\nDist. Sect. B.C. q.m.s. assr.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 25th inst., I have the honor to enclose therein a copy of a letter written by Mr. H. A. Pidcock of Alert Bay transmitting plans and specifications for the proposed Industrial School at Gwamant Island. I beg to inform you that my remarks in respect to the advisability of using cedar posts being used instead of stone for the foundation have been noted and are probably correct, also as to the advisability of establishing a school for the training of Indian girls, which proposal, I am sure, will be considered worthy of consideration for\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 1)\nreasons given by you.\n\nI have, however, to call your attention to the fact that the plans and specifications submitted by Mr. Riddoch are for an institution of much larger dimensions & more elaborate in character than it was proposed to establish at the above point, & that no provision has been made by Parliament for the additional cost which will be entailed in the erection of the building proposed.\n\nYou will remember that the understanding from the first has been that workshops were to be erected on premises held at wh. the trades of carpentry, boatbuilding, blacksmithing, &c., shoemaking, were to be taught to young Indians who might resort there or whose families live in the vicinity.\nMr. Capt. Pidcock expressed\nthe opinion in a previous\ncommunication that the\nestablishment of an\ninstitution of the latter\nkind was the means\nof drawing many Indians\nfrom their homes to that\npoint and was intended\nto settle down in the\nvicinity of the institution,\nand the estimates of the\ncost of erecting buildings suitable\ntherefor were submitted\nby him. The first estimate\nwould place the whole cost\nat from $1500 to $2000.\nSubsequently he amended\nthis estimate, placing the\ncost of the building at\n$1200 & the salaries to\nbe paid the three instructors\nin trades at $75 a month,\nor $2700 per ann., besides\n$300 for the cost of tools\netc. with which the\ninstructors and give\nthe requisite instruction\nto their pupils. The total\ncost, therefore, of establishing\nthe institution was,\naccording to that estimate,\nand this has been held by Parliament,\n$4200. The Estimate,\nhowever, Mr. Pidcock\nnow submits, which is based\non the plans to specifications\nfor a regular industrial school\nat which pupils are to be\nboarded, exceeds the\nformer estimate by $3400,\nfor this excess no\nprovision has, as before stated,\nbeen made by Parliament.\nMr. Pidcock furnishes no\nexplanation as to why he\nhas changed his views in\nrespect to the character\nof the institution which\nhe stated in the bill,\nbefore the Department\nintelligently consider the question\nof establishing a regular\nindustrial boarding school,\nthereby the means of both itself\nand the Indians in this\nlarger scheme shall be\nfurnished.\n\nThe S.G. is of opinion\nthat, in view of the\nuncivilized character of the\nKwakwaka'wakw Indians,\nwho are known to be\nthe most degraded in the\nDominion, & the uncertainty\nas to whether the\ninstitution established for\nits improvement & education\nof their children will be\nsuccessful, it is\nexceedingly questionable\nwhether the Board\nshould incur such an expenditure\nfor the establishment\nof a boarding school at\na regular industrial\nschool at which children\nwill be admitted as\nboarders, & the\nconsidering that,\nunder the circumstances,\nit and be better to\ngive effect to the\noriginal proposal for\nwh. funds have\nbeen voted by Parliament.\n\nJ.

I agreed with him that for experimental purposes the institution requisitioned by him at a cost of four thousand two hundred dollars would be quite sufficient to meet the requirements of the case.\n\nSubsequently when forwarding his amended plans and specifications with estimates for same I omitted his letter of the 27 Nov. 1890, now enclosed herewith, which would have explained the agency views on the subject of the proposed change.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYours obediently,\n\nV.

W. Vowell Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B. C.\npresent vote the School might be successfully started. We have many facilities for building here which they do not possess at Metlakahtla, which would considerable reduce the cost. As the Government seem willing to expend a considerable sum of money, I think there would be far less risk of failure attending this than in the one I first proposed. I hope I shall have time to enclose with this a rough plan and estimated cost of a suitable building, but as your letter of 4th Nov. did not reach me till a week ago, 27th Nov. I have not had as much time for plans etc as I could have wished, but I thought that if you can approve of this alteration, the plan could be sent to Ottawa, thus saving much time. In your letter you suggest that it might be better to make three separate buildings in which trades might be taught but when I made the suggestion first, one of the objects I had in view was that part of the building either up or down stairs could be used in the evenings as a recreation room for the young men, which we are sadly in need of here, and also that the instructors could live in the building, without going to the expense of erecting separate dwellings for them. I mention this in case you cannot.\ncannot approve of my proposal to alter the original scheme and to give you my reasons for wishing one large building instead of three separate ones.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt.

Four years ago I sent three lads to Bishop Reder's school at Metlakahtla where they did well and two months since a lad came three times asking to be sent to this \"good\" school.\n\nHe is now with Mr. Scott at Metlakahtle three hundred miles away. Mr. Cooke, my co-worker, has a large school fourteen miles from...\nAlbert Bay and he tells me he could find eight or ten pupils to the industrial school.\n\nIt is almost impossible to educate one of our Indian children except he can be kept at a boarding school similar to the one proposed.\n\nThe habits of the Indians are so migratory, and the attendance of the chief so irregular that the results from our village school are in almost every instance nil.\nHere are reasons why\na boys school should be\nbuilt before one for\ngirls in our agency:\nbut I am preparing to\nopen a school for girls\nabout one year after the\nopening of the school\nfor boys.\n\nKnowing the deep interest\nyou take in the education\nof our Indian children,\nI feel sure I have only\nto bring this subject to\nyour notice to gain your\nsympathy.\nPleasre me, Sir, I feel in my heart it is a most desirable thing that the Department should build the school as soon as possible, and upon the spot selected by Mr. Howell last August, and I hope you will be able to secure a sufficient grant of money this session to insure its erection early next year.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.

From a conversation held with him last month when at Alert Bay, I am convinced that he is quite capable of carrying out his plan by his management of that work.\n\nShould this course be approved of it is most necessary that making provision for payment alluded to by Mr. Riddell, that funds be placed at any disposal for such disbursements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nV.

The building was finally erected satisfactorily by the architect himself for a smaller sum than that offered with lowest tenders.\n\nThe proposed buildings for an industrial school at the same place are of a very plain pattern. It appears to me that if the supervision of the construction of these buildings is given to Mr. Riddell that their construction will be effected in a satisfactory and economical manner.\n\nI think Mr. Riddell might be allowed and instructed to let any portions of the work by piece work, or he may have the whole of it done.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 189\u2014\n\n[Handwritten text]\n\nThat Mr. Edson will see by reference to his letter to Mr. Vowell of 12th March 91\u2014that his estimate of the cost of these buildings was \u00a34000, he should therefore endeavor to keep the expenditure within this amount, and on no account must the cost exceed in all \u00a34700.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSam Brow\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nMemoandum\n\nReferring to the report of the undersigned of the 8th April last, and the remarks of the Superintendent General thereon, respecting the proposed establishment at Cormorant Island of a training school for the Indian youths of the Kootenay Agency, the undersigned begs to report that correspondence subsequently took place with the Visiting Indian Superintendent at Victoria, and through him with the Indian Agent for Kamloops.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs\nthe locality in regard to the decision then arrived at to adhere to the original proposition that the Institution should consist of workshops for the instruction of Indian boys and young men in useful trades, and not of a regular industrial school, as more recently recommended by the Indian Agent.\n\nIt would appear from the correspondence that the latter official, after mature consideration, has decided that such an establishment as that proposed would be useless in the Newcastleth Agency; and the Visitor's Indian Superintendent at Victoria concurs in this opinion; and both these officers recommend that a regular Industrial School\nschool be established on Cormorant Island for the maintenance of industrial and literary education of Indian boys and girls thereat.\n\nThe Visiting Indian Superintendent at Victoria was informed in reply to his own and the Indian Agent's views on the matter, that no money had been provided by Parliament for an industrial school proper on that Island; and that consequently no such school could be established there this year, if at all.\n\nOn the 5th instant a letter was received from the Rev. Albert J. Hall, who is the representative of the Church of England at Alert Bay, expressing\nexpressing deep regret that a building for the purpose of an industrial school could not be built this winter, if at all, on Cormorant Island, and stating that such a school as the Department has at Metlakatla is most desirable for the Kivaw-Kewlth Agency; and that a better site could not be chosen than the one on Cormorant Island and Alert Bay; that there is not the slightest doubt that there are sufficient pupils to fill the school. And as a proof of the disposition of the Indian boys in the Kivaw-Kewlth Agency to be educated, Mr. Hall states that three cadets from that agency four years\nyears ago, entered Bishop Ridley's school at Metla-\nhakta and did well; and that two months\nsince another boy, on\nthree different occasions,\nprayed to be sent to that\nschool, and that he is\nnow at the Metlakahkta\nindustrial school.\n\nMr. Hall further\nstates that his co-worker\nMcCorley, who has a\nlarge school fourteen\nmiles from Alert Bay,\nreports to him that he\ncould send eight or ten\npupils to an industrial\nschool if established.\n\nThe former statement\ndwells upon the impos-\nsibility of educating In-\ndian children except at\nan Industrial boarding\nschool, as the habits of\nthe Indians are so mi-\ngratory.\nmigratory and the attendance of their children at school so irregular that the results from the village school are in almost every case nil.\n\nThe Rev. Gentleman further states that he is preparing to open a school for girls one year after the boys' school has been opened, and he says that, if possible, sufficient money be provided for the erection of a building for an Industrial School on Caribou Island.\n\nWith a view to ascertaining whether the amount voted by Parliament last session for the establishment of an industrial training school would be sufficient for\nfor the erection of buildings for an Industrial school proper, if it was decided to substitute the latter for the former institution, the undersigned referred the question, with a plan and specifications which had been furnished by the Visitor Indian Superintendent at Victoria, to the Technical Branch of the Department, with the result that it would appear that the amount provided for the establishment of an industrial training school, namely, $4,700, will probably be sufficient to cover the cost of the buildings required for an Industrial school proper.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 1)\nIn view of the recommendations made by the Rev. Mr. Hall, the Visiting Indian Superintendent and the Indian Agent for the locality, the undersigned has to submit for favorable consideration the proposition that authority be given for the construction of the necessary buildings for the establishment of an Industrial school proper on Cormorant Island, according to a plan and specifications thereof which have been submitted and which appear to be suitable for the purpose, provided the same be approved of by the Public Works Department.\n\n[Signature]\nDy.

Engaged two men Messrs Davis and Gilchrist at $5 per diem, agreeing to pay their passage to Alert Bay and also their time from the day of leaving Victoria as is the usual custom. The rate of wages does seem high, but Plasterers all belong to a Union which does not allow its members to work for less.\n\nThere are about 2500 square yards of Plastering in the building.\n\nMr Davis' Voucher I quote intended to be paid as was Mr Gilchrist out of the money advanced to me to pay wages, but owing\n\nA W Vivell Esq'\nActing Indian Superintendent\nBritish Columbia,\n\nIndian Office.\n\nAlert Bay, 189\n\nTo Mr Davis not wishing to carry the money with him, he by mistake took the Voucher and presented it at the Indian Office, and I believe the Voucher is not certified to by me in the usual manner.

The passage money to Alert Bay from Victoria is $6 each, and Mr. Davis signed the receipt for two days work before asking for the $2.

The damage is confined to the inside walls of the kitchen adjoining the range, where the fire is supposed to have started, and the stringer supporting the stairs is charred, but not sufficiently so to need any renewal. The damage is not such as to cause any interruption in the work of the School. On the evening of the 25th last, an attempt was made to set fire to the School Building from the outside. Some stove wood had been piled against the building in the wood shed which adjoins the School at the back, and the wood saturated with coal oil and fired by somebody, at present unknown, and the rushes badly charred as high as the roof of the wood shed. At first sight it would appear that the fire which occurred on the morning of the 17th last might have originated from the range in the kitchen, but it appears another fire.\n\nA. W. Dowell Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent.\nfire occurred some months ago under the staircase, which did no damage whatever, and which at the time was supposed to have been caused by the Chinese cook throwing a stick, which he had tried to get into the fire grate of the range, into a pile of kindling wood placed under the staircase. Nothing was thought of this at the time, but since the attempt made on the evening of the 25th to set fire to the School, it appears probable that an incendiary has been at work. Mr. Coker, the Principal informs me, that at 7 p.m Saturday the 16th he went into the Kitchen and there was no fire in the range. He went again at 11 p.m and there was no sign of fire anywhere. The Chinese Cook went into the Kitchen at 12 a.m midnight to get a drink of water and he saw no sign of fire anywhere, and after examining the range carefully it appears highly improbable that the fire could have originated there except by carelessness or design. I think it would be well when the necessary repairs are being made to build a short wall of brick on which to place the ends of the shedding which\nSwawkewlth Agency, B.C.,\n\nIndian Office,\n\nAlert Bay, 189\n\nwhich\n\nform part of the wall of the kitchen near the end of the range, thus obviating any danger of fire from that source. Mr. Cotter examined all the boys separately to endeavour to find out if they knew anything about the fire, and Mr. Woollacott the Provincial Constable was immediately notified, but no clue has yet been obtained as to the origin of the fire.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.H.

I immediately rose and called the pupils. No time was lost before we were all busily employed in extinguishing the flames which were located round the Kitchen store, consequently blocking the staircase, as you will remember has its peculiar position in the corner of the Kitchen.\n\nThe Kitchen fire was out before 7 P.M. on Saturday the 16th (not 2), and at 11 P.M. I went my usual round everything was safe & as usual, the only cause I can give is the close vicinity of the store to the wall.\n\nToo much praise cannot be bestowed upon the pupils for their calm and prompt manner in which they obeyed my instructions for in less than one hour the flames were extinguished.\n\nI cannot today estimate the amount of damage done.

On the evening of the 25th ultimo, I was sitting in my office when my cook called me saying there was a fire outside. On going out I found the North-west corner of the building, which joins a shed, in a big blaze. It was quite evident from the manner in which the wood was piled up and soaked with coal oil that the fire was no accident. After extinguishing the fire I immediately informed the Indian Agent and the Constable.\n\nI am at a loss to know the person who set the fire, or even to understand the object.

Another cistern should be provided as the supply of water in the well during two months in the summer is very limited.\"\n\nThe cost of a cistern would be $45 including erection. The cost of hose, couplings, and buckets\u2014excluding paint for the latter\u2014would also the ladder would not be more than $30.\n\nI may state that Mr. Pidcock's list of requirements appears reasonable and I would recommend that the same be furnished.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nI beg\nI beg to report that in accordance with instructions contained in your letter under consideration the following supplies of buckets have been furnished as follows:\n\n- Rupert Island Industrial School 100 buckets\n- Alert Bay Industrial School 20 do\n- Girls' Home Alert Bay 7/2 do\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent BC\nReferring to your letter No. 55966 dated 19th September 1893 touching the Indian Kia.

With respect to the price given for the clock I think that a time-piece costing $8.00 or $8.50 landed at Alert Bay would meet the requirements of the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR-COPY\nOttawa, October 3, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr. Supt. Vowell has forwarded a letter from Mr. Agent Halliday in reference to previous requisition made by the Principal of the Alert Bay school for equipment and repairs. The Agent states that twenty-five new iron bedsteads complete, with wire and woollen overmattresses are needed, as well as fifteen new spring mattresses to make some of the old iron bedsteads serviceable. The additional equipment asked for is given in detail in the Agent's letter.\n\nThe Agent also states that additional dormitory space is required to enable them to receive the full number of pupils provided for, namely, 35. This extra room could be maximized had material been furnished, as there is a room left by 60 ft. in the attic, which if fitted up would answer. The building is said to be a fire trap without an escape and he recommends that one be put up at once.\n\nThe above recommendation would entail an expenditure of about $500.\n\nMr. Ogilvie in his report on this school makes recommendations for repairs and alterations, which would call for even a greater expenditure.\n\nThis school is in receipt of a per capita grant.\nof $130.00, which barely meets running expenses, without any margin for renewing equipment. Inspector Green, who visited this school in August, also recommended that the Department assume the cost and spoke favourably of the work accomplished by this school.\n\nNo money was specially provided to meet this proposed outlay but as the Girls' school is now closed, although provided for in the estimates, funds would be available, if the Department decided to authorize the expenditure.\n\nThe rule is that schools of this class should keep up the equipment but it is claimed that the increased cost of living prevents their doing so. For repairs and improvements the Department supplies the material. The property on which the school is situated was set apart by the Provincial Government solely for the purpose of an Indian industrial school.\n\nMartin Benson\nIndian Office, Victoria, B.C.\n\nSeptember 3rd 1908.\n\nFile No. 116.947/5.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of 21st December last on the subject of the aid requested by the management of the Alert Bay Industrial School in supplying new bedding etc., for the School; I have the honor to forward herewith letter dated 28th ultimo, No. 267/6 from Mr Agent Halliday drawing attention to the remarks of the Department concerning its reference to the matter receiving attention when the Supplementary Estimates were being dealt with.\n\nIn looking over the copy of the Supplementary Estimates in the office it cannot be seen that any provision has been made in this connection, but before making any statement to the Agent it would seem best that Mr Halliday's letter, & Mr School Inspector Green's report on this school, which is being sent you today, be perused by the Department as other important points have been raised, such as fire escapes etc., which I have no doubt are highly necessary, & concerning which I will be glad to have the instructions of the Department to place before the Agent.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSupt., of Indian Affairs, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept., of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to again direct your attention to my letter of 23rd November last No 670/5, with reference to an application for new beds and tools for the Alert Bay Industrial School. In your letter of December 27th No 730, G.5 you state that your office has been advised by letter of 21st December No II6947/5 that this matter would have to stand over until the supplementary estimates. Since then I have heard nothing of the matter.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon last in company with Mr Inspector Green I visited the Industrial School with a view of knowing the exact condition of the equipment of the school. We thoroughly examined all the beds and found them in a most deplorable condition. Most of the iron bedsteads originally supplied by the Department as part of the equipment of the school are broken to pieces. The wire mattresses on these beds are completely worn out. Fifteen of these could be repaired by purchasing new springs to put on the old frames. I would respectfully request that 25 new iron beds complete with wire mattresses and wool over mattresses be supplied to the school, in addition to repairing the other mattresses.\n\nIn the laundry we found that the copper boiler for heating the water for washing and for boiling the clothes, is worn out and the brickwork and chimney in a dangerous condition.\n\nThere should be also a terra cotta drain pipe supplied to carry away the waste water in place of the wooden box in which it is at present conveyed which keeps rotting away and choking very often.\n\nIn the attic there is a very rough room used as a dormitory, which is absolutely unfit for the purpose but which\ncould by a moderate expenditure for material be made fit for 20 beds. At present the room which is 18 feet x 60 feet is partially lined with rough lumber, and the cracks covered with strips of paper which has burst along the seams, and there are two small windows for ventilation one at each end. This room is dark and unwholesome at present, but if there were three windows (mullion style) put in at each end, and one dormer window in the east side, and the room lathed and plastered, this would make a splendid dormitory.\n\nThere should also be a fire escape ladder put in at the north end, as at present it is a fire trap.\n\nThis School is a credit to the Department in every other way, but the per capita allowance, is not sufficient in view of the increased cost of supplies, to pay for these very necessary repairs.\n\nAt the time of our visit there were only 19 boys in residence, and these had only been there a few days. Mr Green examined them in reading and spelling while I was there, in which they acquitted themselves well.\n\nI would urge upon the Department the immediate need of these repairs to the Industrial School. The boys are quite able, under the management of the Trades Instructor, Mr G. Green, to do all the work, if the Department would find the material.\n\nThe principal of the School informed us that he could easily get 35 boys in residence if the equipment would allow it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nA.W.

(RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, December 4, 1907\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nI beg to report that I arrived at Alert Bay on the evening of Saturday, September 14, 1907, and inspected the Industrial school on the 16 making a measured sketch for future reference.\n\nThe school building is a balloon frame built on mud sills laid on the gravel bottom and is in fairly good condition, excepting a few of the posts which are now showing signs of decay and will in a short time require taking out and renewing.\n\nThe main building is an oblong square 40 x 60 with gable to front and contains on ground floor, dining-room, sitting-room, office, pantry and bathroom and lavatory. The first floor contains six rooms for staff, with storerooms and one large dormitory. The attic contains one large dormitory lighted from the ends only.\n\nIn addition to the main building there is an extension containing sheds and store room immediately in rear of kitchen, also connecting with building at angles is school-room and workshop extension. This portion of building is one story in height only. In addition there are several small out buildings and an elevated wooden tank for water supply which is taken from a small well near the buildings.\n\nThe framework supporting the water tank is showing signs of decay and will require repairs to prevent settlement. The wooden drain conveying sewage to water front is rotten and should be taken up and replaced with a tile or cement drain. The old wooden gutter pipes are rotting and should be taken down and new galvanized iron\neavestroughs and down pipes put up instead.\n\nThe workshop should be increased in size as there is not room enough to build or repair, and this with house carpentry appears to be the mechanical training which is required in this district.\n\nA recreation room is also necessary and this could be provided at little expense if the room at present used as a work-shop is extended by 10 or 12 feet and used for a recreation room and a new work-shop built at a greater distance from the classroom.\n\nFruit can be readily grown in this locality and I am of the opinion that schools such as this should train the children in the care and cultivation of fruit trees and vines as this should prove a profitable undertaking for the graduates of schools in this district.\n\nArchitect.\nOTTAWA, 29th November, 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant enclosing communications from Mr Agent Pidcock and Mr Principal Corker of the Alert Bay Industrial school requesting authority for the purchase of a flag, a clock and a bell for that Institution; and in reply I beg to say that as the Department confines itself to the supplying of actual class-room requirements to such schools, it regrets that it cannot see its way towards complying with this request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nA.W.

I made enquiry as to whether any other machine was available and found that the Ducrest Machine which was manufactured in Victoria was a much more powerful machine having a lifting force of 246 tons as against 47 of the other machine.\n\nThe Ducrest all complete cost $150.00 which with an extra choker and pulley and anchor line amounted to the sum in the invoice viz $178.15 as against $142.50 as quoted. However the machine is worth considerably more than the difference.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

Halliday, for an itemised list of the repairs necessary at the Alert Bay Residential Schools, I have the honour to submit herewith what we consider to be most necessary to enable us to carry on our work until such time as the Department completes the construction of the new school. I might say that our Field Secretary, Dr. T.B.R. Westgate, was at the school when this survey was made, and I am asking him to write you in connection therewith.\n\nGirls' Home.\n\nRoofs. That on the lean-to over back entrance needs re-shingling, with new flashing put in. New flashing is needed all round the main furnace chimney, as water leaks through into the Vice-Principal's bedroom. All gutters should be overhauled, and new stand and down pipes must be installed. These should be at least 3\" in diameter, in order to adequately carry off the large amount of rain that falls through the winter. Nearly all the down pipes in use at present are rotten.\n\nOutside doors. Of the six doors of this type, three need replacing, those leading into each stairs, the furnace room, and the double door leading to the gardens. The other three need overhauling, new thresholds, and new bolts. At present the two big double doors on this building both have to be kept shut with ropes, whilst one is kept boarded up all the time, there being no other way of keeping it closed. This is unsafe from the fire risk point of view.\n\nInside doors. Practically nearly all doors require new thresholds, four require locks.\n\nWindows, in nearly all cases need weather strips, as a great deal of heat is lost through the draftiness from the windows. Seven new wire screen windows are required. These are absolutely necessary in this school on account of the moral question involved.\n\nTransoms. Six require new guide irons, and supports.\n\nRadiators. Four new steam cocks required.\n\nPlay-room, a small room, 17' x 10', should be V-jointed 5 feet above the skirting board. This room is in a disgraceful state of disrepair and is the only play room for 36 girls.\n\nFurnace room. Two new windows are required, and the concrete work on window thresholds needs building up before the windows can be set in.\n\nFurnace. Although the Dept. has ordered the inspection of the boiler and we have applied for such inspection, no-one has yet been to look the boiler over. The entire furnace requires asbestos casing, which should go on at once, as the fire can be seen through the side of the furnace walls.\n\nFront steps of building are in dangerous state and should be relined and strengthened.\nKwawkewlth Agency,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nNovember 8, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing you a letter from the Principal of the Residential Schools at Alert Bay, regarding the necessary repairs on the Girls Home and Boys School in response to your wire of Oct. 29th. These repairs all are necessary and I recommend that they be done. I went over the whole place with the Principal and the Rev. Dr. Westgate, and there is nothing asked for that should not be done, although the price of $300.00 possibly maybe slightly more than will be required to do the work.\n\nIn drawing the plans for the new school building might I respectfully suggest to the architect to take into consideration that our winters here have excessively heavy rains and the roofs should be of a firm steep pitch in order to prevent the shingles or other roofing becoming saturated and causing leaks. It would, also, be as well to have as few valleys in the building in order to prevent leaking. The salt air is very hard on all flashing with the exception of lead flashing, and there is always a tendency to leak in the valleys.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

C.\nNovember 2, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing Voucher No.88, for $509.06, in favor of Alert Bay Saw Mills, for lumber and for material supplied to build the carpenter shop on the Industrial School Reserve, which is being fitted up for a temporary school room.\n\nCompetitive prices were obtained from the two saw-mills, one at Alert Bay and the other Wood and English Ltd., Englewood, six miles from here for ordinary merchantable lumber. Wood & English gave me a figure of $20.00 a thousand f.o.b. scow at Englewood. The Alert Bay Saw Mill, gave a straight rate for that class of lumber at $21.00, but owing to the fact that Englewood is six miles away it would be necessary to hire a scow and have it towed up to Alert Bay, and the scow returned, it was thought that the Alert Bay Saw Mill figure was cheaper. More particularly, as they had the finer grades of lumber such as rustic and flooring on hand, while the other mill does not make them at all and they would have had to be purchased elsewhere.\n\nThere will be another account later on for the lining which is now being put into the school, which is on a separate appropriation. The wages have all been paid up to date, but there is still a little money left over, and the painting is not quite completed, so that the statement and balance sheet will not be sent in until the building is entirely finished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.Halliday\nIndian Agent\n\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Anfield, the Acting Principal of the Alert Bay Industrial School has furnished me with a copy of his letter of the 1st instant embodying a list of the repairs which are urgently required at this institution and the Girls' Home to enable the School work to continue during the approaching winter, and I greatly hope that these may be undertaken by your Department at the earliest date possible. The items mentioned were carefully considered in conjunction with Mr. Indian Agent Halliday during my recent visit to Alert Bay, and approved by him. If the drainage flume mentioned could be made of cement tile instead of plank it would be more satisfactory in the long run.\n\nIn another communication I will place before you certain recommendations with regard to the proposed new School at this centre.

If you could, by any means, arrange to let him have immediately the filing cases you would supply to the new school, it would greatly simplify his work.

In reply I beg to say that Mr. Anfield should forward an estimate of the cost of supplying the filing cases required. This should be accompanied by a cut from a catalogue of the firm from whom he can obtain the lowest quotation for the supplying of the cases required. When we have this information, consideration will be given to authorizing the purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n1. ALERT BAY\n\nNew school at Alert Bay to amalgamate the two existing institutions and have a capacity of accommodating not less than 200 pupils, along with suitable provision for giving instruction in High School subjects. In addition to the main school building which should have a Principal's residence annexed to the site, the following buildings, animals, etc., will be necessary:\n\n(a) Farmer's residence.\n(b) Stock barn with open shed shelter, and six grade Jerseys and one team of horses.\n(c) Wood shed (Necessary on account of the heavy rain fall on the Coast).\n(d) Lumber shed.\n(e) Poultry house to accommodate 200 birds, and 200 White Leghorns.\n(f) Pigsty to accommodate 20 pigs and 1 boar and 5 sows.\n(g) Tool house (unless built in 1928 for class room).\n\nWith regard to (b) the following extract from the report made by Inspector Frank of the Health of Animals Branch, Ottawa, to the Chief Inspector of that Branch in Vancouver, B.C. on Aug. 22nd, 1927, relative to the requirements necessary to maintain a \"supervised herd\" in good standing at this school, should be noted:\n\n\"I have suggested that, (1) the Industrial School Reserve, which is situated on the western end of Cormorant Island, should be fenced across the entire eastern boundary, and so prevent other animals on the Island having access to their grounds. (2) A sufficiently large modern cow barn be built to accommodate between twenty and thirty head, with open shed shelter for the young stock. (There is an added reason why such a structure should have cement floors, gutters, mangers, etc., and a two or three foot side wall of the same material, that reason being the great number of rats which infest the Island.\"\n\nThe fencing referred to above will be 200 rods long. It should be 10 x 10 gauge and would cost about $300. Four gates 12 x 12 gauge would cost about $50.\n\nNecessity for above:\n\n(a) While the Girls' Home is comparatively new and in good repair, the Boys' School is old, leaky, drafty, and rots on timbers which in places have almost completely rotted away.\n\n(b) Neither building is capable of accommodating the number of children awaiting admission.\n\n(c) The cost of maintaining and administering two separate institutions is greater than would be required for one.\n\n(d) The distance from Alert Bay to any centre where instruction in High School subjects may be secured is so great as to place such instruction beyond obtainment by many who desire to have it.\n\nIt is suggested:\n\n(a) That the new building should be erected on an elevation about 250 yds. below the existing institutions.\n(b) That the new building should be known as the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, and have accommodation for 200 pupils.\n\n(c) That a separate class room be provided for importing instruction in High School subjects, unless the existing Girls' Home be set apart for this purpose and operated in conjunction with the Provincial Government of B.C.\n\n(d) That one set of out-buildings including a stock barn, a poultry house, piggery, a wood shed, and an implement shed should be provided for the new institution.\n\n(e) That provision be made in the estimates for 1926 for supplying the school with six good milking cows - preferably Jerseys as the school has now one Jersey bull, two fair Jersey cows and one calf, some Saanen or Taggenberg goats on account of their immunity to tuberculosis. Estimated cost $600. A team of horses and harness should also be provided. Estimated cost $250.\n\nN.B. Provision should also be made for clearing more land. The land set apart for the use of the school comprises 410 acres. Only about 20 acres of this including the sites occupied by all buildings is cleared or under cultivation. The uncleared area is covered with coniferous timber and will cost about $250 per acre to clear ready for the plough, and about $150 per acre for light clearing leaving the stumps in the ground to rot.\n\nAn additional thirty acres should be cleared ready for the plough, at the earliest date possible. Modern machinery will be required for this and provision should be made for a tractor and stump puller similar to that supplied to the Sioux Lookout School, (Fordson Tractor estimated cost $2,128.75 - see my letter Sept. 28th, 1926), or of a stronger make. Estimated cost $2,000.\n\nThe machinery required, according to the list compiled by the Acting Principal is as follows:\n\n\"Tractor, either the 2 Ton Caterpillar (see enclosed letter), or the 10-20 McCormick Deering. Either must be equipped with belt pulley and preferably take off drive. Price of the McCormick is $1100. Stump puller, attachments, freight, etc., $700.\n\nTractor Saw complete for use with tractor to cost $66. Plow, tractor 2 bottom type, P&O, \"Little Genius\" type by McCormick Deering is the best. It will cost $120.\n\nHarrow, 4 section, 20 tooth type, to cost $32.50.\n\nScruffler, McCormick Deering, 5 tooth, to cost $16.50.\n\nWagon, one horse type, steel axled to cost $105.\n\nDisc harrow, McPd. #12-16, to cost $67.\n\nEngine and Pump for school supply. Must be at least 10 H.P. engine, and pump capable of filling tank at rate of at least 750 gals. per hour. I cannot get prices on these things locally and would need an expert to figure exact requirements.\"\n\nRough estimate of total cost $2000.00.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, British Columbia\n\nKwawkewlth AGENCY\n\nTo Alert Bay Saw Mills, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\n| DATE | DETAIL | AMOUNT |\n|------|--------|--------|\n|      |        | $104.27 |\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that all expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nEXAMINED and found correct.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nForm No. II\n\nIndian Affairs.

Kindly make out certified vouchers in duplicate in the usual way and forward them to the Department with these papers, in order that credit may be given for the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.H. Paget,\nChief Accountant.\n\nW.M. Halliday Esqr.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to past correspondence, particularly to your telegrams of Sept. 28th, and Oct. 29th, giving authority for the erection of a new building 25' x 40' to be used eventually as a Carpenter Shop when the New Residential School is built, but to be used for the immediate present as a school building for the Boys.\n\nI am enclosing you a statement showing that I have on hand still $22.72 from the cash advanced of $600.00, which was sent me to meet the labor account and incidental expenses.\n\nI am also enclosing you Voucher No. 95, $104.27, for material which was used in the lining and completion of the building, as well as for the purchase of a heating stove.\n\nWith regard to the balance on hand, I have a man working, doing repairs on the Girls Home, and I would like to have about $75.00 in cash to pay him for his labor. Will it be in order if you will send me an additional cheque for $50.00 and use the balance that I have already on hand of $22.72, or would it be more advisable to send me an accountable cheque for $75.00, and I will return you my check for the sum of $22.72, that is if you wish to keep the account absolutely separate in your files at Ottawa.\n\nIn my original estimate of $1150.00 and the supplementary estimate of $150.00 for lining and completion it was intended that the roof should be painted and the inside walls should be oiled and varnished. The weather has been such that it was impossible to do the roof as it has been one continuous spell of wet weather, so much so that the shingles have never been dry enough.\nsince they were put on to make it wise to spend the money in painting, and as they were anxious to get into the school immediately it was decided not to put on the oil and varnish on the inside for the present.\n\nFrom the various vouchers which I have sent in and statements in connection with this, the building up to date has cost \u00a3116.54, and I can assure you that the greatest economy has been practised in every way in order to keep well within the estimate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

It is noted that there are a number of matters requiring attention in connection with the heating equipment. You will, no doubt, have been supplied with a copy of the Inspector's report.\n\nYou should give the matter of the installing of a new front section your attention. It is noted that the Inspector recommends that this section be installed without delay.\n\nThe Inspector also states that several air cocks should be renewed, and that one steam inlet is in bad order. He also states that the safety valve is too small for the purpose of relieving excess steam, and that another, either flanged or screwed, should be attached to the boiler or to the steam pipes immediately adjacent to the boiler. Its diameter to be not less than 3\" pipe size.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends that an experienced engineer, with a low pressure heating certificate, be in charge during the boilers operation, as, without this attention, his certificate authorizing a working pressure could not be issued.\n\nYou should see that this boiler is placed in good working condition, keeping all costs for the purpose as low as possible. The department will expect you to give this matter your personal attention, and you should forward an itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nRelative to the Inspector's remarks regarding the radiators, I am enclosing herewith copy of a communication to the Principal regarding the authority which has been granted him to have these repairs carried out.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

The Department has noted the recommendation of the Inspector as to the need of a new front section and the other repairs required, and these matters are being taken up with Mr. Agent Halliday.\n\nRelative to the repairs to the radiators, I have to confirm the following telegram to you of today's date:\n\n\"May incur reasonable expense overhauling radiators Girls' Home\".\n\nYou may arrange to have these radiators thoroughly overhauled and placed in a satisfactory condition. You should keep all expense down to the lowest possible point. If necessary, you should obtain the services of a competent man to do the work. Any new parts required may be supplied. An account, in duplicate, covering the cost should be handed to Mr. Halliday to be certified by him.\n\nIt is noted that the Inspector recommends that an experienced engineer, with a low pressure heating certificate, should be in charge during the boilers operation, as per their regulations. It is considered that you should see that the Inspector's regulations in this respect are carried out and that a competent person is employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Earl Anfield, Esq.,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nMay incur reasonable expense overhauling radiators\nGirls' Home.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\n\nCHC. DEPT. I.A.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith the original of the Boiler Inspector's Report on the heating equipment at the Girls' Home. This inspection was requested by the Dept. some months ago, but as the inspector only comes up once or twice a year, it was necessarily deferred.\n\nIt will be noted on the report that there are quite a number of things requiring attention in connection with this furnace, the largest item being that of a new front, the present one being cracked. It is more than likely that this crack was caused by the flood waters which came last Xmas, and rose above the fire box of the furnace, putting it out of action for nearly three weeks.\n\nMight I ask the views of the Department in connection with the urgent necessity of some of these repairs, especially the overhauling of the radiators, many of which have to be kept shut off owing to lack of steam cocks, leaks, etc. We are now in the midst of the bad weather of the year, and the building is cold. As the Indian Agent is at present away on his holidays, and has closed down all repair work at the School until his return, for the life of me, I cannot understand why might I request please telegraphic authority to have the radiators put into shape at once, and leave the furnace front and valves until Mr. Halliday's return.\n\nI should also draw to the Dept.'s attention the absolute necessity of having the flume drainage put in from the fields at the back of this school, and so prevent any possible recurrence of last year's flood. Already this year has exceeded last for rainfall, as it has rained almost continually for the past two months, and the waters in the field at the back of the School are rising.\n\nThe bill for inspection and typewritten copies of same will doubtless be going forward to Mr. Halliday, as I have not received them.\n\nTrusting that these matters may receive early and favourable consideration.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, December 7, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing accounts covering the cost of installing fire gongs on the floors of the Alert Bay Boys' and Girls' Indian Residential School. It is noted that these gongs have been tested and were found to work satisfactorily. The accounts will be paid in due course.\n\nWith reference to the installing of a fire escape for the girls' school, it is noted that neither you nor the principal considered that the sliding pole escape would be satisfactory and that, after careful consideration, it was decided to install a metal chute, leading from the sleeping porch to the ground, and that this is now being carried out. The Department approves of the action taken and of the type of fire escape now being installed, and it is hoped that it will be entirely satisfactory.\n\nWhen the work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure in installing the fire escape.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of Oct. 25th, giving authority for the installing of fire gongs on the floors of the Boys and Girls School, and also of the installation of a fire escape considered to be the most satisfactory to myself and the principal, I am forwarding you Vouchers No. 97 and 98, for $1.66 and $87.79, in favor of the Alert Bay Saw Mills, and the Brettell Distributing Company Limited, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThese gongs have now been installed in the school and on a test have worked very satisfactorily. They have two methods of working. There is a switch in the bedroom of the principal which by being connected will ring the alarm at any time, and the other is a small glass hanging below the gong with a little weight attached to it so that when the glass is broken the alarm becomes automatic.\n\nWith regard to the fire escape for the Girls School, I went into this matter very carefully with the principal, and your suggestion about the sliding pole with a landing on each floor was not considered to be advisable in this building for two reasons. In the first place it would require a well hole to be cut on the first floor which would weaken the building considerably, and would be more or less of a menace for children falling through the hole even with a good railing around it, and the other objection was that as a number of the girls are small it was feared that they would not be able to successfully negotiate the sliding pole and might fall and break an arm or leg, which would create a poor impression in the minds of the older Indians. After careful consideration it was decided to put a metal shoot similar to what is used on the play-grounds of the ordinary public schools, leading from the sleeping porch to the ground. The installation of this is\nnot quite complete yet, but the principle on which it works is that inside of the building there is a small windlass and a pliable wire cable leading from the windlass to a pulley attached on an iron hook outside of the building, and a small counterpoise weight also attached so that it would not come down with a great jerk. In case an alarm is sounded the door on the opening of this will be opened and the outer end of the shoot will be in position and all the children can go out in a very few minutes. The expense is going to be comparatively small in connection with it, and a voucher will be sent from the General Repair Shop for the shoot and fittings later on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Halliday\nIndian Agent\n\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nWMH:S\n| Date       | Items                          | Lumber | Merchandise | Total |\n|------------|--------------------------------|--------|-------------|-------|\n|            | Indian Rugs                    |        |             | 100   |\n|            | Modern Ship Lubricate          |        |             | 3600  |\n|            |                                |        |             | 3700  |\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have informed the principal that there is a great deal of difference between the quotation which he furnished me and the price finally paid, but I am forwarding to you these vouchers to be dealt with as you may think fit.\n\nYou will notice that just about the time this was completed the disastrous fire occurred and the work all had to be done over again. Your authority is file 156-0-5, May 14th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Helliday\nIndian Agent\n\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWMH/S Enc.\nTo,\nW.H. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Halliday:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith vouchers for lubricator and repairs to pump, carried out prior to holidays per authority of yours of the 21st of May of this year.\n\nAt that time you had secured authority for us to install a force feed lubricator on our Petter's Engine, and your letter stated that bills would be paid up to $65, f.o.b. Vancouver, and authorising me to purchase said lubricator and install it.\n\nI went to see Mr. F. Wastell, and he advised me that the price quoted me by the B.C. Equipment Co. was a \"hold-up\", and recommended me to purchase the lubricator alone and have the other parts, including the eccentric, rods, boring, etc., done locally. He stated that he thought the lubricator alone would not come to more than $20 or so. I followed his advice and instructed the Marine Repair Shop to go ahead and install the lubricator. He found that every bearing in the engine was burnt out; that spray nozzle was out of order; that pump for fuel was not working, and that the machine in general was in bad state of disrepair. He built the eccentric and put on the lubricator, but still the machine did not lubricate properly, and much time was spent in adjustments. The job was not finished until some days after I had gone away on my holidays, and when I came back I found the machine and pump house had been burnt up. It was only then that we found out the trouble, the machine had no oil rings in it, and all lubricators in the world would not have stopped burnt out bearings. I am quite satisfied that Jorgenson tried his best to make the engine run properly and also that the time spent on it was entirely necessary, and also that if the engine had been run for as long daily as that at the Sawmill, that it would have been on the scrap heap long before. The lack of the oil rings has cost the Department a lot of money, and the schools a lot too, as the machine was literally loaded with oil all the time, and even then would seldom run more than two or three hours without heating up.\n\nThen the bills came in from the B.C. Equipment Co. for the lubricator, as Mr. Wastell had been forced to purchase it there as they seem to have a monopoly on the Petter Equipment. He at once protested the bill, and a long correspondence ensued. I think that had not the lubricator been destroyed in the fire that Mr. Wastell would have sent it back and purchased another kind.\nIn view of these circumstances, might I ask please, that you will recommend to the Department, the payment of these bills, as from what I can make out, they were unavoidably though regretfully higher than the amount sanctioned.\n\nI might say that since the Dept., through you, had the engine fixed this last time, that it has run beautifully, and I feel that had the oil rings been put in when the machine was first installed here, that there would never have been any trouble.\n\nWith kind regards, Believe me,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nEarl Anfield\nPrincipal\n## TIME SHEET\n\nBuilding New Building for Industrial School\n\n| Name          | No. hrs. | Rate | Amt. | Comp'tion | Amt.Pd. |\n|---------------|----------|------|------|-----------|---------|\n| J.

We felt, however, that in view of the prospect of a new school being provided at this centre in the near future we would not be justified in asking your Department to go to the expenses of having it removed and a more suitable boiler installed instead. As Mr. Anfield points out in his letter referred to above that this boiler has been handled by the ladies in charge of this Home for the past 15 year, with assistance rendered when necessary by the male agents on the staff, I am not convinced of the necessity of incurring the expenditure which would be involved in the appointment of the engineer recommended by the boiler Inspector, and am of the opinion that as Mr. Anfield, himself, is a very practical man, and is assisted by Mr. Connell, who is also a practical man though not a certificated engineer, the management of this part of the equipment at the Girls' Home might safely be left in their hands for the rest of this winter and until the new school building has been completed. Our Society has not made any provision in their estimates for this school for the current calendar year for an engineer, and in the present state\nof our Society's finances, I am quite at a loss to know where we can secure the salary for such an agent. I shall be glad, therefore, to know if your Department will agree to allow the existing arrangement to stand in view of the considerations which I have mentioned above.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, January 21st, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to that portion of your letter of the 4th instant referring to a communication which you had from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School in which he recommends that the new building erected over the pump be completed, I beg to say that you may purchase 3 rolls building paper and a sufficient quantity of rustic to cover it in. The work of completing this building should be carried out by the pupils and staff of the school without expense to the Department.\n\nPlease forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the building paper and rustic.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

HALLIDAY, INDIAN AGENT,\nAlert Bay, B.C., dated January 4, 1926.\n\nOriginal on File 156-1-10\n\nIn another letter from the principal of the School, he recommends that the new building erected over the pump be completed as the lumber that was put in has shrunk so that it leaves the seams wide open. I would recommend that I be allowed to purchase three rolls of building paper and enough Rustic to cover it in and allow the work to be done by the pupils of the school.\nOttawa, January 18, 1928.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to draw your attention to voucher No. 58 which you submitted in August last in favour of the British Columbia Fishing & Packing Company, Limited, of Alert Bay. The voucher was made out for $76.97 and was paid by official cheque No. 2371 at that amount, but the account which was attached to the voucher while made out for $76.97 showed certain alterations, namely, a deduction of $5.25 for \"Cold starters\", and there was a charge of $2.35 for shingle nails. The total amount of the account, therefore, was $74.07, and the total overpayment which the Company received was $2.90. You should obtain refund from the Company to this amount without delay, if, as appears, a deduction of $5.25 should be made for \"Cold starters\".\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H.

WESTGATE, D.D.,\nFIELD SECRETARY, M.S.C.C., 39-45 ALEXANDER AVE.,\n(THE BIBLE HOUSE) WINNIPEG, MAN. JANUARY 25, 1928.\n\nWith regard to the incorporation of the Girls' Home building into the material fabric of the new institution, I can only remind you of the great dissatisfaction which attempts of this kind have given in the past. The remodelling of the Old Sun School, and the fitting up of the old Blackfoot Mission house as a Principal's residence, may be taken as a case in point. Neither are satisfactory, and yet the cost cannot have fallen very far short of brand new buildings in either case.\nResidential Schools,\nALERT BAY, B.C.,\nJanuary 20th, 1928.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nSir:-\n\nre Furnace Installation - Proposed New School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nI have the honour to bring to your attention the following suggestions with regard to the proposed new school at Alert Bay.\n\nAt the present time there is a great deal of difficulty entailed in the securing of coal supplies for plants using this fuel at Alert Bay. For some reason or other, the mines require a great deal of notice before shipment of coal can be made. In addition to this, there is a considerable hazard in bringing coal in large amounts to the Bay. Should the furnace in the new building be of the coal-burning type, sufficient coal will be required to make it almost essential that this fuel be brought in by scow, owing to prohibitive freight rates on the coast cargo carriers. I have figures to show that coal laid down in less than 50 ton lots at Alert Bay costs more per ton than coal delivered by the railload at Lytton, B.C. The relative figures are $11.50 per ton at Alert Bay and $10.25 at Lytton.\n\nIn addition to this question, we have to face the fact that coal brought in to Alert Bay either by scow or freight boat in such quantities as will be required in the new school will mean a tremendous amount of manual labour to bring from either the beach or wharf to the schools. At the Bay we have at present only one horse and one small cart which cannot handle more than 500 lbs. So it will appear that the fuel problem at the proposed new school will be a serious one and one that I feel the Department should take under serious advisement.\n\nI am investigating at present two proposed alternatives to the burning of coal, one being the Oil-o-Matic Burner for installation in standard type furnaces and also a new sawdust burner for standard type furnaces.\n\nWith regard to the former, I should say that in Alert\nBay there are four companies with oil stations and fuel oil could be procured at wholesale prices with a minimum of expense in placing same in the school. The great advantage of this type of burner appears to be its cleanliness and ease of operation, coupled with assurance of steady heat. Although I have not at present the figures, I am given to understand that the initial cost is amply repaid by economy of operation.\n\nThe sawdust burner is a new idea and is at present in operation in several large hotels and apartment houses in Vancouver. However, they have been faced with the problem of a lack of sawdust for fuel, which condition of course would have to be seriously thought out with reference to Alert Bay. There is, as the Department knows, a sawmill there belonging to the B.C. Fishing & Packing Company, which I understand has just signed a re-lease of the Mission property on which the sawmill stands for a period of 99 years. As at present operating, this sawmill will be compelled to put in a modern standard sawdust burner and I feel that were the Department convinced of the assuredness of fuel supply from this mill, that the sawmill authorities would be glad to get rid of the sawdust and could possibly save themselves a large bill for the erection of a new burner. Of course, it must be taken into account that with the present precarious condition that exists in the fishing industry, the time might come within the course of years when this sawmill would cease to operate.\n\nOf the two alternatives, I feel that the Oil-o-matic system presents the best possibilities and I will forward to your Department full literature and particulars of same as soon as I have procured these.\n\nTrusting that the Department will give to these matters their very earnest consideration, I have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nResidential Schools,\nALERT BAY. B.C.\nJanuary 20th, 1928.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA. ONT.\n\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of a communication from Canon S. Gould, Secretary of the M.S.C.C. to the effect that the Department contemplate making replacement of the present buildings at the Residential Schools, Alert Bay. In this connection, there are some points that I wish to bring to the attention of the Department.\n\nSITE\n\nIt has come to my attention that there is some controversy about the location of the new buildings. Some years ago, the Department had cleared ten acres of land for the proposed new school. This site was chosen by our Dr. Westgate, working in conjunction with your Indian Agent, Halliday and a Mr. Myles Morley who, I understand, was appointed by your Department for this purpose. These three gentlemen were unanimous in their opinion with regard to the moving of the location of the school from the present site which is on the beach to a more elevated position, the site chosen being some 250 feet above sea level. Acting on their recommendation, the Department had cleared the necessary land for construction purposes. It is only recently that your Indian Agent, Halliday, seems to have taken objection to the site originally chosen, his claim being that weather conditions, coupled with increased cost of transportation of supplies would render the operating cost of the new plant greatly in excess of what it would be should the school be built down below. Speaking personally, I am quite prepared to abide by the decision of your Department as to location, but I feel that I should inform you that should the field between the two schools be chosen, it will be necessary to have thorough drainage put in to make this building at all safe. All the land at the bottom of the hill is a gravel bar and I feel that were test piles driven water would be found very close to the surface. Your Department will no doubt be aware that when the girls' home was constructed, it was impossible to find solid foundation land. Might I suggest, in closing this subject, that an architect be appointed to proceed to Alert Bay and make definite choice of location, independent of existing opinions at that place.\nACCOMMODATION: As this will be the only school under the administration of the Indian & Eskimo Commission in the Province of British Columbia; and as the field to be served is very extensive, stretching as it does from Cape Mudge to the Naas River and taking in the Anglican children of the Queen Charlotte Islands, we would strongly recommend that accommodation for at least 175 children be incorporated in the new plant. I am under advisement from your Indian Agent at Masset, Queen Charlotte Islands that he would be prepared to give us at least 30 children; and I am also in receipt of communications from Indians of the Prince Rupert agencies expressing a desire to have their children who are Anglicans transferred from the Coquileetza Residential Institute, Sardis, B.C. So it will be seen that we will have no trouble whatever in filling this school and in keeping it filled.\n\nTYPE OF BUILDING: I have to inform you that I have this day returned from Lytton, B.C., where, at the invitation of the Principal, Rev. A. R. Lett, I, with him and the foreman of construction, made a careful inspection of the new St. George's school. Allow me to congratulate the Department on the splendid building that they are putting up for the education of the children of the Interior Indians. I feel that we could not do better than ask the Department to give us at Alert Bay a replica of this building. There are, however, a few changes that might be incorporated in our building and so save the Department the necessity of having to change the plans or add extras on to the initial contract, and I feel that if these suggestions are given due weight that a building will be erected worthy of the best interests of the Department of Indian Affairs. For convenience, I will deal with the building floor by floor.\n\nGROUND FLOOR\n\nPlayrooms: Should the Department build to accommodate the requested number of children, the playroom space in this school will be entirely inadequate. It is well known in Child Welfare Work that segregation of age and type are essential for the best interests of children. One playroom for 100 boys ranging in age from seven to eighteen does not bring an institution of this size in line with modern Child Welfare ideas.\n\nBathroom & Toilets: These I note are placed on the ground floor. Might I suggest that the three shower baths be reduced to one, thus allowing five tub baths, which will be none too many for the number of children using them. Four toilets are far from sufficient and I would suggest that the number be\nincreased to at least six, leaving the urinals as per the plans. If possible, I would suggest the removal of both bathrooms and toilets to another part of the building, and turning the space at present occupied by them into a junior play room.\n\nDiningroom - Staff: As there will be no married staff quarters available at Alert Bay outside of the Principal's residence, all staff members will have to use this dining room, which will be very much too small. The plans show a 12' x 18' room, which should be increased in length at least to 24 ft. In this room there should also be a door allowing direct contact with the kitchen, thus preventing the necessity of staff food and dishes being carried from the kitchen through the children's dining room into the staff dining room.\n\nKitchen: It will be noted in the plans of the St. George's school that there is a 24\" steel girder supporting the walls and ceiling. Below this come the pipes, etc. As there is no great weight supported by this girder, would it not be possible to decrease its depth to, say, 12\", which would raise the piping out of reach of the children. Might I suggest, please, that toilets be installed in the two closets in the corridor outside the kitchen.\n\nSchoolrooms: These rooms are excellent, with the exception of the one immediately adjacent to the Principal's residence, which has blocked the light on one side. If this could in any way be remedied, it would make the work very much easier both for pupil and teacher. There is need in all school rooms for doubling the blackboard space at present granted.\n\nSewing Room: As there will be no continuation class at Alert Bay for a year or two and as there will be a great deal of sewing and dressmaking carried on for the large number of new children to be admitted, might I request please that a double door be placed, allowing access from the sewing room to the continuation class room which could be used as a dress making room, allowing the sewing room to be kept for mending, etc.\n\nFIRST FLOOR\n\nGymnasium-Assembly Hall: We would strongly urge the Department to allow the Assembly Hall to be equipped for a gymnasium, and the windows to be screened as has been done at Lytton. It will be also necessary that radiation should be of the wall pattern, as, should the radiators be placed on the floor as they are at Lytton, children playing basketball or other\ngames are liable to serious injury. As the window screens will be permanent, might I suggest that windows be constructed to open outwards.\n\nPrincipal's Office: Might I suggest that a door be placed between the Principal's office and what is the white children's class room at Lytton, as I intend using this room as an office and receiving room for bales for the use of the Matron in Charge and access to and from the Principal's office would be very helpful.\n\nToilet Accommodation: I notice that there is a room for visiting Indians and that, under the plan of St. George's, such Indians would have to use the only staff bathroom and toilet on this floor. This, I am sure, the Department would not wish to happen and I would suggest that toilet accommodation for the visiting Indians' room be incorporated in a closet built into the room.\n\nFIRST DORMITORY FLOOR.\n\nThere is no method shown on the plans for separating the boys and girls on this floor. It is most essential that a double door be placed at the Infirmary entrance, thus allowing boys and girls to enter the Infirmary from their respective sides of the building without meeting in the passage. This partition would necessitate another staff toilet and bathroom on this floor.\n\nTOP FLOOR\n\nAlthough there are two staff bedrooms on this floor, there are no toilet facilities on the plan and I feel that it is only fair to the staff that such should be installed and that they should not be asked to go downstairs for toilet purposes.\n\nGENERAL\n\nStorage: There is a sad lack of storage space provided in this building. We would bring to the attention of the Department the fact that most of our children are clothed from bales sent by the W.A. and this method requires a very large storage space, as most of the bales arrive at approximately the same time. Might I suggest that two large storage rooms be built off the hall leading from the main building to the Assembly Hall and abutting on this corridor.\nCupboards and Lockers: The plan of the new St. George's school shows no provision for locker space either in the play rooms or dormitories. As the children are away from home and have no place that they can really call their own, might I urge strongly that the Department instal steel individual lockers in the basement playrooms and wooden open type lockers either in the dormitories or corridors adjacent thereto. These lockers would be used for the children's clothing. It will also be most necessary that adequate cupboard and shelf facilities be placed in the sewing rooms and in all storage cupboards.\n\nShould the Department see fit to build the Assembly Hall as a gymnasium, might I ask that the thickness of the floor be double that installed at Lytton. This will be necessary for the installation of gymnasium apparatus.\n\nWater Conservation: The Department is no doubt aware of the excessive rainfall at Alert Bay and I would strongly urge that a large soft-water conservation tank be installed on the laundry roof, large enough and so equipped that it could handle practically all the water from the roof downpipes. As we have to pump all water for the school, such a tank would mean a tremendous saving in operating costs as related to the water supply of the school.\n\nIt is most essential that doors be placed allowing entrance to the rear of the building from both boys' and girls' sides.\n\nPrincipal's Residence: Might I suggest that a window be placed looking out over the playgrounds, similar to that put in Mr. Lett's house at Lytton.\n\nI would recommend and ask that the Principal's residence and the boys' side of the building be placed together and the girls' wing on the other side of the front entrance. With this plan, it will be necessary to place the boiler room and engine house to the rear of the boys' side, with the kitchen and laundry accessible to and to the rear of the girls' side.\n\nI would strongly recommend that some kind of tower be placed on the roof of this building, to take from it the extremely flat looking appearance which the new St. George school has. This might be incorporated in a bell tower.\n\nTo ensure adequate water supply for domestic and fire-fighting purposes, it will be necessary for the Department to\nenlarge the present reservoir capacity and also to install a larger engine and pump. The well supply of water will be adequate to allow of increased pumping facilities.\n\nI am at present working on the equipment to be required for this new school and will be ready to submit same to the Department in a week's time.\n\nTrusting that the Department will favourably view these suggestions and assuring them of our utmost willingness to co-operate in the erection of a building that will be both useful and pleasing to the eye, I have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOffice of the...Ewanakelth...Indian Agency,\n\nJanuary 12th...1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos...124...amounting to $...274.45...in favour of Gurney Foundry Co., Ltd., Vancouver, B.C., for Expansas...rs...Furnace at Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No...156-0-5...dated December 20th, 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 1\nSPECIFICATION\nFOR\nINSTALLATION\nOF\nSIMPLEX IMPROVED TURBINE OIL BURNERS.\n\nBARR & ANDERSON LIMITED,\n1060 HOLLER STREET,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nSIMPLEX IMPROVED TURBINE OIL BURNERS\nSPECIFICATION.\n\nOIL BURNER & STORAGE TANK: This oil burner contractor to provide and install complete Oil Burners and Oil Storage Tank according to the following specifications and the Rules and Requirements of the National Board of Fire Underwriters for the Storage of Fuel Oil and for the Construction and Installation of oil burning equipments shall be considered as part of the specification.\n\nEXCAVATION: Owner to do all necessary excavating for oil tank and oil piping, from tank to burner set and backfill trench after pipe has been installed.\n\nTANK: Tank to be 4'6\" x 15'0\" long of 3/16 gauge shell and 1/4\" heads, and equipped with the necessary pipes, flanges, and manhole cover, complete with watertight gasket.

By the operator of an automobile this feature will be readily appreciated as the true relationship of the proper amount of air that is mixed with the hydrocarbons and the power generated is on a parallel with the efficient combustion of an oil burner. This regulation is controlled either by hand or by attaching the regulating arm to the damper regulator on a low pressure heating boiler.\n\nThe feature of the Simplex Improved Turbine Burner is the pneumatic turbine drive of the rotary atomizing oil cup. With this feature it is possible to attain a centrifugal force of sufficient power to break up the fuel oil into a very fine fog which is the first essential function of a successful oil burner. The spent air then passes through the nozzle and is the power to project the atomized oil into the combustion chamber; here the vaporized oil fog comes into intimate contact with oxygen of the air and a highly combustible mixture is attained.\n\nTests with an Orsat instrument show a combustion gas analysis of over 98% efficiency.\n\nA small motor driven direct connected fan and oil pump unit furnishes the necessary air and oil for the burner. Where there is a multitude of burners to be installed, a large motor, fan and oil pump is used, sizes and capacities varying, as data given on page 3.\n\nNo. 11 and 12 Motor, Pump and Fan Unit Showing Position of Oil Strainer, Oil Pressure Regulating Valve\n\nNo. 11 Fan Unit, Less Oil Pump\n\nPage Two\n\nBUNTING IRON WORKS\nThe Simplex Improved Turbine Fuel Oil Burner can be installed in any cast iron heating boiler or any type of steel or tubular boiler, readily converting it to fuel oil burning. No remodeling of the boiler is necessary. The coal grates are first removed and in the ash pit space is built a fire brick combustion chamber. The Oil Burner is inserted thru the front wall, connected to the air and oil supply, and your plant is ready for operation. The main oil tank can be buried at any convenient point adjacent to your building, and placed in accordance to the underwriters' rules.\n\n### Sizes and Capacities of Simplex Improved Turbine Burners\n\n| SIZE | NUMBER OF BURNERS | Min. and Max. capacity one burner, steam radiation | Min. and Max. capacity one burner, water radiation | Min. combined capacity two burners, steam radiation | Min. combined capacity two burners, water radiation | Min. and Max. capacity one burner, B.H.P. | Min. combined capacity two burners, B.H.P. | Size Motor H.P. | Shipping weight |\n|------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| No. 11 | 1                 | 500-6000                                         | 800-9500                                        | 5-50                                             | 3/4                                            | 225                                      | 290                                      |                |                |\n| No. 12 | 2                 | 500-2000                                         | 800-1200                                        | 6-00                                             | 3/4                                            | 290                                      | 350                                      |                |                |\n| No. 21 | 1                 | 1000-2000                                        | 1600-12000                                       | 10-60                                            | 1                                              | 350                                      | 400                                      |                |                |\n| No. 22 | 2                 | 1000-2000                                        | 1600-12000                                       | 10-60                                            | 1                                              | 400                                      | 450                                      |                |                |\n| No. 23 | 2                 | 1000-3000                                        | 1600-12000                                       | 10-60                                            | 1                                              | 400                                      | 500                                      |                |                |\n| No. 24 | 4                 | 1000-7000                                        | 1600-12000                                       | 10-60                                            | 2                                              | 500                                      | 700                                      |                |                |\n\n*\u2014220 volt 60 cycle 3 phase only.\n\n**Bunting Iron Works**\n\nIndian Affairs.

Halliday, Alert Bay, B.C., the above named child was admitted as a grant earning pupil of this School on February 10th, 1928.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding this admission are especially sad, as both the father and mother have died within the past ten days, leaving a large family of helpless and destitute orphans.\n\nAs the school was full prior to this admission, we are in need of a bed and mattress for this child, so we have no surplus equipment whatever. I have put the youngster on a bed belonging to the Principal's residence.\n\nOn approaching the Indian Agent for permission to purchase this equipment, Mr. Halliday stated that the request would first of all have to go to the Department, and that he would also write and recommend the purchase.\n\nTrusting that the Department will see its way clear to sanction the purchase in view of the emergency of the case.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir:\u2014\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 18th, having reference to voucher #56, submitted in August last in favor of the British Columbia Fishing & Packing Co.

(RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, June 2nd, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, relative to the request of the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School to have the chemicals in the fire extinguishers on hand renewed, and also to be supplied with two new extinguishers.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase of the quantity of chemical required for refills for the extinguishers on hand, and you may also arrange for the purchase of two new fire extinguishers of the Guardene type and two fire axes. The extinguishers should be obtained at the lowest price charged for supplies of this nature furnished the Government. You should arrange to have this fire equipment furnished as soon as possible and the fire extinguishers on hand refilled and placed in a satisfactory condition.\n\nAfter you have made the above purchases, please forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. A. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Industrial School, asking authority to have the chemical fire extinguishers re-filled, which will necessitate the purchase of 64 ounces of Sulphuric acid, commercial, and 5 lbs. of Bi-Carbonate of Soda.\n\nHe also asks that two new fire extinguishers of the \"Guardone\" type be purchased, and two fire axes, and the said equipment to be placed in the new schoolroom and in the Manual Training Shop. As he says the new schoolroom was not completed when the Department took up the question of fire protection last year, I would recommend this purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Halliday\nIndian Agent\n\nSecretary\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 23rd, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the providing of increased accommodation at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have noted your suggestion that a frame building, which could later be used as an engineering shop, be constructed to be used for dormitory purposes until the new residential school is completed, when this building could revert to its intended use as an engineering shop. The Department, after giving your suggestion consideration, is not prepared to authorize the erection of this building. You should not take into the school more pupils than can be accommodated under the present arrangements, as, in the interests of the health of the children, there should be no overcrowding in the dormitories. In complying with these requirements, it is hoped that the school can carry on until such time as a new building is erected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nEarl Anfield, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nIndian Residential Schools,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nMay 14th, 1928.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to bring before you the urgent need of increased accommodation at this school for more pupils. For the past few years this need has been steadily growing until now I do not know what to do to accommodate those you are trying to get in. I have applications on file that have been waiting for three years to get into school and I do not see how they can be accommodated this fall unless something is done in the way of a temporary dormitory. Even now there is serious overcrowding in both schools here and the Indians are clamouring to get their children in to School. It seems too bad that when the pleas for admittance are so urgent that we cannot find room for them.\n\nWhilst I am aware that the Department contemplate building a new school in the near future, it is certain that we cannot occupy it for nearly a year, and I would like to place before you the suggestion that a frame building, suitable for an engineering shop of the same size and capacity as the building erected by your Department last year, to serve as a schoolroom, be constructed at once and used as a dormitory until the new school is finished when it could revert to its intended use as an engineering shop in connection with the Vocational Training programme of the new plant.\n\nWe have sufficient space to handle the teaching of the extra pupilage this would allow us to admit, and we could also take care of the dining room and other facilities required. It is sleeping space that is at a minimum. An alternative could be to utilize the present playroom (the old schoolroom) as a dormitory and use the projected new building as a playroom.\n\nTrusting that this matter will receive your earnest consideration,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nSome time ago I wrote the Department asking their consideration to my recommendation for an oil-burning type of furnace system in the proposed new school to be built at this centre. I have since received word from quite disinterested parties speaking credibly of the economy brought about by this type of heating plant.\n\nI believe that if a low pressure hot water heating system were installed in connection with such oil-burning furnace (should the Department favourably consider it) that operating costs of a plant of this nature would be reduced to a minimum, and that this school could be heated as economically as any in the land.\n\nThe great advantages of hot-water over steam appear to be as follows: A. The oil burners could be started in the morning and run for two or three hours until the radiators are hot, then they could be shut off and the building would remain heated for many hours with no cost for oil during this time, whereas with steam the oil-burners would have to operate as long as steam was required. B. The climate in this part of Canada is such that steam heat is not essential in a building of this type. C. A hot water plant, especially if operated by oil-burning furnaces can be heated up so much more quickly than could a steam installation, thereby effecting a tremendous saving in fuel costs. D. The safety element where there are so many children with access to steam coils on the radiators.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.
