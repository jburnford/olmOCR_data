Your telegram, date Aug. 17th, 1949.\n\nVoucher for payment of shavings, purchased from Wynn's Sawmill, forwarded to your office Aug. 17th, 1949. The lime will be purchased at Yellowknife and a voucher sent to your office for payment.\n\nAccountable advance received at the Bank of Commerce Yellowknife and as soon as work completed at Ft. Rae an accounting will be forwarded to your office.\n\nThe wood for the Ft. Rae Indian Day School is being cut and brought into town by barge. As a number of Natives are doing the work the Hudson's Bay Co. advances them food and clothing and once the wood has been delivered will pay all those engaged and send us the account for the total amount which in this case is $700.00. When the account is rendered by the Hudson's Bay I will voucher it through your office and no accountable advance will be necessary for the wood.\n\nRepairs to Ft. Rae school will be starting tomorrow and I expect them to continue for approximately six weeks.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F.

As we may from time to time be doing building projects that will require local labour I request authority to buy such stamps as may be needed to comply with the Unemployment Insurance Act.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F.

As this trip was made just after the opening of the school term I believe it worth while to report on my observations at each point.\n\nOn September 22nd, I proceeded to Fort Rae to check on progress of repairs to this building. This work is nearing completion and a very good job has been obtained. The entire building has been insulated and the second story as well. This gives a manual training room for future use. The first floor has been divided into two with all old partitions removed, giving two good class rooms. The dividing partition is movable and the school will now make a good hall. All walls of first floor have been lined with gyprock wallboard and painted. Part of the second story has been lined as well, but there was a shortage of material and this will be obtained next year when the work can be completed. This gives a very good fireproof interior and very durable.\n\nThe whole interior has been painted including the ceiling. The windows, which just arrived by last boat of the season, are being put in and when the teacher returns from his holidays, the building should be complete ready for school.\n\nThe two new oil stoves have arrived as well as fuel oil, all noon lunch materials and the teachers ration have been put into Fort Rae on the last boat.\n\nI expect to pick up the carpenter by plane before the middle of October and will then pay all wages and incidentals and send an accounting to your office.\n\nI have seen enormous progress at all the schools since last term and I believe we can look forward with confidence to the results that will be obtained from the new type of school in the Northwest Territories.\n\n(Sgd.)

The railroad accepts this carload on our weight and count, and we pay them for the carload, as such.

Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe alterations and repairs to the Ft. Rae School have now been completed and the balance of the accountable advance as well as the statement of expenditures is enclosed herewith.\n\nThe following work was completed by Mr. James Cull and two Indian helpers.\n\n(1) Outside walls from ground level to top sill have been insulated with shavings.\n(2) Ceiling of second storey completely insulated with Gyproc wool bats.\n(3) First floor class rooms have walls lined with gyproc wallboard and bottom four feet of back wall protected with plywood.\n(4) Sectional partition divides the building into two good class rooms. This partition can be removed if it is desirable to make the building into one room for any purpose.\n(5) All interior partitions that formerly existed were removed as well as the old stair way.\n(6) Temporary stairway erected on outside of building to second floor.\n(7) Outside walls and roof painted.\n(8) Class rooms completely painted both walls and ceiling.\n(9) New and extra windows put in complete with storm sash.\n(10) Two oil stoves installed and tested.\n(11) Small porch over door put on for winter use.\n\nThe above work was done between August 20th. and October 13th. Mr. Cull returning to Yellowknife on the latter date.\n\nIn this district it has been the policy of the Dept. of Public Works to pay their foreman carpenter at the rate of $1.50 per hour and to deduct $1.25 a day for board. The DPW supply this board at whatever it costs and they absorb the difference.\n\nAt Ft. Rae there are no places to eat and at the start we were able to get a woman to cook for $1.50 per day while we were to supply the food. This lasted for one month and then the carpenter was able to stay with the R.C.M. Police and we continued to supply his food while they made no charge for any work they did in preparing any of his meals. There is no doubt we received cheaper board this way than through any other arrangement.\n\nIn order to get carpenters into places like Ft. Rae we have to fly them in and out. I took the carpenter in when I was making a flight and CP Airlines brought him out on one of their regular runs. I paid this fare out of the standing advance.\n\nDon Lafferty and Alex McKenzie who are both Treaty Indians with two dependents were hired as helpers and as both boarded at home no deductions were made from their pay for this.\n\nAt all these out-of-the-way places we are forced to pay the Indians some of their wages as they work, otherwise they will not be able to feed themselves and their families. With this in mind...\narrangements were made with the Hudson's Bay Co. to advance money as the work progressed and that I would make the pay cheques for the Indians payable to the Hudson's Bay for the amount advanced. This will account for the pay cheques being made out as they are, with the extra amount due the workers paid directly to them at the end of the work.\n\nIf we do not arrange for wages of Indians to be paid this way it would never be possible to get a Native to work for more than a few days before he would quit.\n\nUnemployment Insurance stamps and Revenue stamps for all cheques were paid for in cash and cheques were made payable to myself for the amounts.\n\nReceiver General Cheques were made out for Income tax deducted from James Cull, Board deducted from James Cull, Employees share of Unemployment Insurance deducted and the unexpended balance of the advance sent to me here.\n\nThe repairs that were undertaken at this school have, I am sure, made a very good small two room school out of what was an old store. The walls were formerly covered with paper and everything was dirty from smoke and age, it being impossible for any teacher to make it cheerful. As there was a good frame to work from we now have what I would consider is a good two room school and with the addition of combination porch and cloakroom with wash rooms for the winter months and possibly put the building on a low cement foundation this school would make an ideal manual training building at such time as a new school may be erected. As the building is on solid rock it would last for many years if a small wall is put in.\n\nI am quite sure that the building has been put into as good condition as possible with the materials available at Rae. It will be noted that a limited amount of extra building supplies were purchased as instructed in your telegram of August 17th. These supplies as well as lime used in shavings have been vouchered through for payment from Ottawa.\n\nThe unloading of freight and hauling from Frank's Channel was made necessary by the very late delivery of windows for the school, fuel oil and some other extras. The Northern Transportation Co. could not get within six or eight miles of Rae due to low water and we were forced to hire a local man with a power scow. The Hudson's Bay paid this man and sent the accounts here for payment.\n\nI trust this accounting is satisfactory and that all the necessary information has been included.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F. Kirkby,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, October 24, 1949.\n\nI. F. Kirby, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 15th enclosing four cheques made payable to the Receiver General of Canada.\n\nI am returning one which represents the deductions for Income Tax from James Cull. This should be forwarded to the District Income Tax Office, accompanied by a T.D. 2 form which no doubt, you can obtain at the local Post Office. Your District Income Tax Office may be at Edmonton, but I am not sure of this.\n\nAt the end of the calendar year you will be expected to give the employee a statement of the amount deducted for Tax purposes and also forward a similar statement to the local Inspector of Income Tax. Forms for this purpose will also be available from the Post Office. We only handle payments made direct from here.\n\nJHF/G\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 906-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6473)\n\nFile 905-5, part 3\nFort Smith Agency - Hay River Day School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts.\n1948 - 1949\n\nFile 905-5, part 4\nFort Smith Agency - Hay River Day School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts.\n1949 - 1950\n\nFile 905-6, part 1\nFort Smith Agency - Hay River Day School -\nInspectors' Reports. 1949 - 1950\n\nFile 905-8, part 1\nFort Smith Agency - Hay River Day School -\nTeachers' Residence-Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts.\n1948 - 1950\n\nFile 906-1, part 1\nFort Norman Agency - Rae Day School -\nGeneral Administration. 1928 - 1949\n\nFile 906-5, part 1\nFort Norman Agency - Rae Day School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts.\n1947 - 1949\n\nFile 907-1, part 1\nFort Norman Agency - Aklavik Church of England\nDay School - General Administration.\n1946 - 1951\n\nFile 908-5, part 1\nFort Norman Agency - Fort Good Hope Day\nSchool - Building Maintenance-Supplies-\nAccounts. 1948 - 1949\n\nFile 908-5, part 2\nFort Norman Agency - Fort Good Hope Day\nSchool - Supplies-Accounts. 1950 -\n\nFile 909-5, part 1\nFort Norman Agency - Fort Franklin Day School -\nSupplies-Accounts. 1948-1950\n| Reference | Disposal |\n|-----------|----------|\n| Referred To | PA or RF | By | Date | For C.R.

This is too many for the good of the pupils and for the welfare of the teachers. It is I think time that the various Branches of the Dept. of Mines and Resources took over the education of pupils not in residence but who live around Aklavik.\n\nMr McKinnon when here talked over the matter of staff and pupils and I feel sure he agrees with me that we are carrying a burden not in proportion to our capabilities.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 907-1, part 1)\n### DAY PUPILS\nALL SAINTS' RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL AKLAVIK\n\n**QUARTER SEPTEMBER 30, 1946**\n\n| NAME               | RACIAL STATUS | GRADE |\n|--------------------|---------------|-------|\n| John Firth         | HBI           | 2     |\n| Stephen Bennetplume| I             | 1     |\n| Thomas Bennetplume | I             | 1     |\n| Lazarus Firth      | HBI           | 1     |\n| George Sittishinli | L             | 1     |\n| Angus Sittishinli  | L             | 1     |\n| Wilbert Wright     | W             | 1     |\n| Harley Wright      | W             | 1     |\n| Michael Harvey     | W             | 1     |\n| Herschel Havtum    | W             | 1     |\n| Richard Ethier     | HBI           | 5     |\n| David Huskie       | I             | 4     |\n| Grace Ann Oke      | W             | 1     |\n| Irene Greenland    | I             | 1     |\n| Louisa Greenland   | I             | 1     |\n| Elisha Greenland   | L             | 1     |\n| Astrid Garland     | W             | 1     |\n| Agnes Garland      | W             | 1     |\n| Nellie Havtum      | W             | 1     |\n| Ruth Johns         | I             | 1     |\n| Annie Able         | HBI           | 1     |\n| Annie Edwards      |               |       |\n| Sittishinli        | I             | 4     |\n| Jeanne Kendi (Leza)| B             | 3     |\n| Jennie Ethier      | HBI           | 3     |\n| Gladys Kee         | I             | 3     |\n| Susie Huskie       | I             | 2     |\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 907-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 30, 1946.\n\nDr. J. P. Harvey, Indian Agent,\nAklavik, North West Territories.\n\nIt is understood that these two residential schools are bringing in day school students from the local villages and having them attend school along with the residential school pupils.\n\nWe are now informed that this is providing too heavy a load upon the teachers at these schools. At a recent meeting of officials of the Northwest Territories Bureau and Indian Affairs Branch, it was decided to open day schools at each of the residential school plants. The Department is willing to pay for teachers and to provide such extra classroom equipment and materials as are required. It is therefore our intention to pay for one teacher at each of the two residential schools on a temporary basis until a proper day school can be erected. I am sending extra copies of this letter to the Principals of both schools concerned.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOctober 29th, 1947\n\nMajor Gen. C. R. Turner\n\nColonel B. N. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nSalaries of Teachers - Anglican Indian Residential School, Aklevik, N.W.T.\n\nI understand that you are now in the process of taking over from the N.W.T. Administration matters dealing with the education of Eskimo children.\n\nDr. Alderwood has been in touch with Inspector McKinnon of the N.W.T.

Hunter, Indian Agent, Fort Norman, Northwest Territories.\n\nAklavik Indian Day School.\n\nYou will recall our letter of December 30th 1946, concerning the establishment of day schools in the two Aklavik Residential School buildings. Representations were received from the Indians' School Administration of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada for the establishment of a day school at Aklavik to accommodate day school pupils who were going to an Indian Residential School. It is understood that the Administration Branch are sending in a third teacher which relieved us of the necessity of building a day school.\n\nTherefore, steps were taken to have an Order in Council passed providing for the establishment of an Aklavik Day School. This Order in Council has now been passed and the establishment of a day school is authorized. According to a statement received from the M.S.C.C., there are twenty-two day children in attendance at this school. It has been decided to pay Miss Harrington as the day school teacher at the rate of two thirds of the normal salary allowed a day school teacher with her qualifications. Therefore, she will be entitled to a salary at the rate of $104.00 a month. Please find attached Quarterly Returns which should be submitted by her as the teacher of a day school and also Family Allowance forms which should be submitted monthly. Would you please send the Quarterly Returns in accompanied by a voucher requesting payment of salary for Miss Harrington at the rate of $104.00 a teaching month. This voucher should be made out in duplicate.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nBFN/HM.\nOttawa, December 19, 1947.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nAklavik Indian Day School.\n\nI have for answer the late Canon House's letter of December 16th concerning the above. We have received also a statement of qualifications of Miss Harrington. It is noted that she holds a first class certificate and has five years experience in Indian schools. This means that she is entitled to a salary of $1560.00 per academic year on our day school teachers' salary schedule.\n\nIn view of the fact that twenty-two day school pupils are attending this school, we would be willing to pay her two thirds of the rate normally paid to a day school teacher. Therefore, her salary for the 1947-48 academic year would be $1040.00.\n\nI have today written to our Indian Agent at Fort Norman informing him of this fact. I have requested that he submit a voucher covering the payment of this amount to Miss Harrington on a quarterly basis. I have also forwarded him copies of our day school Quarterly Returns and Family Allowance Returns so that these might be submitted by Miss Harrington covering the day school pupils attending the Aklavik Residential School.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MCD\nOttawa, December 30, 1946.\n\nDr. J. P. Harvey, Indian Agent,\nAklavik, North West Territories.\n\nIt is understood that these two residential schools are bringing in day school students from the local villages and having them attend school along with the residential school pupils.\n\nWe are now informed that this is providing too heavy a load upon the teachers at these schools. At a recent meeting of officials of the Northwest Territories Bureau and Indian Affairs Branch, it was decided to open day schools at each of the residential school plants. The Department is willing to pay for teachers and to provide such extra classroom equipment and materials as are required. It is therefore our intention to pay for one teacher at each of the two residential schools on a temporary basis until a proper day school can be erected. I am sending extra copies of this letter to the Principals of both schools concerned.\n\nBernard F.

As Miss Harrington has now left Aklavik, Miss R. F. Lau has taken over the duties of Day School teacher. I am therefore forwarding attached \"Application for Classification on 1948 Revised Indian School Teacher's Schedule.\" Miss Lau informs me that she signed an affidavit before the former agent, Dr. J. P. Harvey, in 1947 and that it is no doubt on file in your office.\n\nI would request that I be advised if Miss Lau's salary is to be vouchered for from this office, and if so what amount.\n\nL. C. Hunter\nSuperintendent.\nFebruary 3, 1949.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nAklavik C.E. Day School.\n\nYou will recall our previous agreement with regard to the above school. Last year, we shared the payment of salary of Miss Mary Harrington. She has been replaced now by Miss R.L. Lau. This teacher has a second Class Manitoba Certificate with two and one half years of experience in Indian schools and five and one half years of experience in Provincial Schools.\n\nThis would entitle her to classification as a Grade 2 teacher at a salary of $1800, an academic year (she has failed to attend the required refresher course to classify her at $1860).\n\nWould you please advise if you are again prepared to pay fifty percent of the salary which would be allowed to this teacher.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Indian Day School\n\nAs you are aware, a number of Indian and non-Indian children are attending the day school operated by the M.S.C.C. in conjunction with their residential school at Aklavik.\n\nLast year we arranged to share the payment of the salary of Miss M. Harrington. Arrangements were made with Mr. McKinnon to continue the sharing of the salary of the present teacher Miss R. Lau. Miss Lau has a Second Class Manitoba Certificate, three years' experience in Indian schools and five and a half years' experience in provincial schools. She has, therefore, been classified as a Grade II teacher at a salary of $1,800.00 and academic year (failure to attend a required refresher course has prevented a higher salary rating). We have paid for her services for the five months, 1 September, 1948, to January 31, 1949, and a cheque for $450.00 has been mailed to her in care of the Indian School Administration, M.S.C.C., 102 Bank Street, Ottawa.\n\nWould you please arrange to send a similar cheque to her in care of the M.S.C.C. This will mean that $900.00 will have been sent to her for the half academic year ending January 31, 1949.\nWhen we receive the necessary returns, we will advise you regarding her payment for the final half of the academic year.\n\nDirector.\nMONTHLY DAY SCHOOL RETURN\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nReport of Indian Day School\u2014Month ending\n\n| Agency | Teacher's P.O.

Indian Day School\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nAs you are aware, we have been paying part of the salary of one teacher at your Aklavik residential school in order that certain children from the village could attend as day pupils. The Northwest Territories Administration has been paying the other part of this teacher's salary.\n\nSince September 1, 1949, we find the enrolment as follows:\n\n- September 1949 - 5\n- October 1949 - 4\n- November 1949 - 3\n- December 1949 - 3\n- January 1950 - 2.\n\nOriginally, there were some twenty day school pupils at this Residential School, but it now seems that the number has decreased very markedly.\n\nWhile we were prepared to recommend the payment of a teacher's salary when twenty children were enrolled, we are not prepared to continue this arrangement with the present low enrolment.\n\nCould you please write to the Principal of your school and find out from him the total number of Day School pupils.\nIn attendance for each month since September. The figures above are, of course, only for Indian children. Copies of this letter are being sent to Messrs. McKinnon and Cranham of the Northwest Territories Administration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nColonel B. F.

Apparently no teachers were forthcoming for the new day school and it did not open on schedule.\n\n(b) The measles epidemic in the community made it necessary to isolate the residential school and the class rooms.\n\nThe Principal also informed that over and above the Indian pupilage figure recorded in your letter of April 4th there was an average of four white pupils and one day school pupil attending classes.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nColonel\n\nAklavik C.E.

The materials are either stored in a local warehouse, or within the shed which was erected by this Department on the school property. Thus sufficient materials are on hand to warrant beginning this work when weather conditions permit in 1949.\n\nShipping instructions as follows:\n\nTo reach Waterways July 15th for forwarding by N.T. Company.\n13 April, 1949\n\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\nAttention: Colonel Neary,\n\nAttached hereto is copy of report dated April 8th from District Engineer W. J. Johnston regarding the installation of an electric generator at Fort Good Hope for use in the two-classroom school and teacher's quarters being constructed there for your Branch by this Department.\n\nMay we have your comments regarding the installation of this generating set in view of Mr. Johnston's remarks that it might be possible to cooperate with the R.C.C.S. to supply electric power, as they have a generator in the immediate vicinity.\n\nEVG/S.\n\nChief Engineer.\nI wrote you on the 6th instant in regard to purchase of a 125 KVA A.C. Electric Generating set for Coppermine, N.W.T. I now wish to draw to your attention the necessity of smaller purchases at other places where such electric generators are necessary, but with more particular reference to the situation at Fort Good Hope, N.W.T.\n\nAt Fort Good Hope, Lots 13 and 14 have been chosen for the Non-Classroom Day School and Teachers' quarters. The building site is within possibly 100 yards of the buildings of the R.C.O.C.S., which are located southerly of the school site. At the Signals' Station it is necessary for maintenance men to be on duty 24 hours per day in connection with the power plant installed there. I understand it may be necessary soon to install additional units for the requirements of the R.C.O.C.Signals, but you can no doubt find this out from firsthand enquiry at their headquarters that they have definitely in mind.\n\nThe cost of an electric generator delivered and installed at Fort Good Hope will be about $8,000 and it will be necessary thereafter to have probably two men on duty throughout the winter season at least, in order to give 24 hours' attention to the operation of this unit. This appears an unnecessary expense, particularly when men are now on duty for just such a purpose. Would it be possible to request that R.C.O.C.Signals supply electric power for school purposes at Fort Good Hope? The economy in this over a period of years would be very considerable and well worthwhile.\n\nFort Good Hope is situated on a bluff, possibly 70 to 100 feet above the river level and the transportation of oil in drums from the waterfront presents a problem. Further, there are little trucking facilities at this point. I believe R.C.O.C.Signals plan to install a pipeline and tank so that fuel oil can be pumped directly from oil tender barge to the storage tank. With some sort of cooperation, a larger tank could be installed and a pipeline re-arranged from the river so that oil storage would be available for both the school and the several R.C.O.C.Signals' buildings.\n\nIt is also necessary to purchase A.C.electric generating sets at Fort Franklin and Arctic Red River. There are no Signals Stations at either place and it will be necessary to make this purchase in these two cases.\n\nW.J. Johnston\nDistrict Engineer.\nOttawa, April 23, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nLANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nGenerating Set - Fort Good Hope Day School.\n\nThe Department of Public Works has written concerning a generating set required for lighting the above school.\n\nIt is felt that the sum mentioned in Mr. Johnston's letter is very high for the installation of lighting. If the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals is unable to provide electricity as mentioned in Mr. Johnston's letter, would it be possible to substitute a less expensive type of lighting set at this school?\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nApril 22, 1949.\n\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention Col. Neary\n\nFurther to my letter of April 13th with which I sent a copy of a report dated April 8th from District Engineer W. J. Johnston, regarding installation of an electric generator at Fort Good Hope, N.W.T., for use in the school being constructed at that place, I now attach herewith a copy of a further report dated April 20 from Mr. Johnston.\n\nWill you kindly consider this along with the former report and let me have your comments as soon as possible.\n\nA. A. ANDERSON\nACTING CHIEF ENGINEER\n\nEVG.EM\nIn letter No.49, on April 8th, I wrote you regarding the necessity of purchasing an electric generator, A.C. power, for Fort Good Hope, N.W.T., in connection with the school project there, unless arrangements could be made with Royal Canadian Corps of Signals to supply electric power. I realize there has been little time possibly, in the interval for Royal Canadian Corps of Signals (Department of National Defence) to be approached and a decision reached in this matter. I would, however, point out that I must shortly make an expenditure involving some $6,000 unless some arrangement can be made otherwise in this matter. It seems wholly unnecessary to make such an expenditure when electrical power could be supplied by Royal Canadian Corps of Signals.\n\nThere is also the question of pipeline from the river to the townsite area for delivery of bulk fuel oil to tanks at the Settlement. Under an overall plan of Royal Canadian Corps of Signals supplying electrical power, this pipeline and tank capacity could be increased to store sufficient oil for the school building also.\n\nThere is the further fact that there are other Dominion Government buildings in this Settlement, who in turn, and in due course, could be supplied by electrical power from a central generating plant operated by Royal Canadian Corps of Signals. These are matters, however, which would not be so pressing as the immediate decision as to how electrical power is to be supplied to the school.\n\nW.J. Johnston\nDISTRICT ENGINEER.\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of National Defence.\n\nFort Good Hope Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department of Public Works will be constructing for this Department this summer a two-room Indian Day School with attached teachers' residence at Fort Good Hope, Northwest Territories. This building will be located on lots 13 and 14, approximately one hundred yards from the station of the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals. At this signal station, it is necessary for maintenance men to be on duty twenty-four hours per day in connection with the power plant installed there. I am advised that some consideration has been given to the installation of generating units for the requirements of the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals.\n\nThe District Engineer of the Department of Public Works has recommended that we approach you concerning the supplying of electrical power for school purposes at Fort Good Hope. The type of power unit required elsewhere for schools of this type is a Diesel engine capable of delivering approximately 18/20 horse power at 1200 R.P.M. The electrical generator is 12.5 K.V.A. 120/240 volt, 60 cycle alternating current unit.\n\nThe District Engineer of the Department of Public Works feels that it would be a waste of public funds to supply a generator to our school at this point when we are so close to a source of electrical power which might be shared by another Government Department. We are quite prepared to pay for this power if you can agree to authorizing its provision by the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals.\n\nYour cooperation in this connection would be sincerely appreciated as we are doing everything possible to bring adequate educational facilities to the Indians, Whites, and Half-breeds of the Northwest Territories. The cost of building these schools is very high and any assistance which might be given by your Department would help greatly in the operation of this particular school at Fort Good Hope.\n\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, May 1, 1949.\n\nC.M.

You will note that the firm has charged an amount of $41.03 more than the amount of the Purchase Order.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nMr. B.E. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs it is now at the close of water navigation on the Mackenzie River I am in a position to report regarding the school supplies which have been received at Fort Good Hope. As a result of a radiogram to the Carpenter Foreman of this Department at that place I received the following reply, dated September 24th:\n\n\"EFFECT SCHOOL TO BE READY FOR CLASSES BY DECEMBER FIRST ONE TEACH DESK, ABOUT 24 SCHOOL DESKS, GROCERY RATION, KITCHEN TABLE AND STOVE STORED AT SCHOOL. BOOKS, CLOTHING AT RCMP SO FAR HAVE NOT FOUND ANY OTHER FURNITURE FOR SCHOOL.\"\n\nEvidently from the above, furniture for the classrooms has been received, as well as grocery rations and a kitchen table and stove, in addition to books and clothing. There appears to be a shortage of furniture to completely equip the living quarters in the manner which is probably required, on a permanent basis. However, this Department (Public Works) has beds, mattresses, kitchen equipment, etc., in connection with a camp which has been in operation for our construction crew. Thus, if your teacher arrives late this fall, there appears a chance of improvising from materials on hand so as to carry on over the coming winter.\n\nThe present indications are that the school will have reached such a stage of completion that classes can begin on December 1st or thereabouts. This is shortly after the end of the freeze-up period when our carpenter crew will have remained there over freeze-up, will be withdrawn from that place.\n\nA general report regarding progress of construction of all schools is going forward to the Chief Engineer of the Public Works' Department and no doubt a copy will be transmitted to you.\n\nFurther work will be necessary in finishing the school next year. This has reference to completion of placing roofing on built-up terraces and level roof, which work it was not advisable to do during the cold weather of this fall; placing of outside siding which was deferred in order to advance interior work when sub-tradesmen of plumbers, heaters, and electricians were at the site; and other miscellaneous finish work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.J.

Hunter, Superintendent, Indian Agency, Fort Norman, N.W.T.\n\nYour account also includes an amount of $4.46 for prepaid freight charges on the stove from Edmonton, to Waterways, Alberta. If you review Purchase Order 44004 you will note that it was issued on the basis of \"supplying stove f.o.b. Waterways, Alberta\".\n\nUnder the circumstances, we are not paying the item of $4.46, and a cheque for $186.00 will be forwarded to you. I am returning the freight receipt.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nPP/ST\nEnc.\nOctober 17th, 1949.\n\nHudson's Bay Company,\nMerchandise Depot,\n10249-104th St.,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe: Purchase Order 45506\n\nWe have just received your account for supplies forwarded to the teacher, Fort Good Hope Indian Day School, Fort Good Hope, N.W.T.\n\nIt is noted that there is an item of $18.38 on the account reading \"Freight to Waterways\". If you review the Purchase Order you will note that it was issued on the basis of \"F.O.B. Waterways\". Consequently, it will be necessary for us to deduct the $18.38 from the account.\n\nThere is also an item reading \"Marine Insurance $5.60\". As far as the Education Division is concerned, we do not appear to have paid such an item in the past. We would like to be advised why it is charged on this account.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nOttawa, 18 October, 1949.\n\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\nFor your information, I am attaching herewith copy of letter #2822 dated October 14th from District Engineer W. J. Johnston concerning the progress in construction of the school at Fort Good Hope, N.W.T. You will note Mr. Johnston anticipates that work for this season will be finished about December 1st and it would be advisable to have a caretaker and teacher dispatched to this location before the carpenter crew left there to maintain continuous heating in the building.\n\nEVG/S.\n\nR. Blais\nChief Engineer\nIn Letter No.2623 of September 30th I submitted a report on the progress of construction in various schools in the Northwest Territories.\n\nIn respect to Fort Good Hope, N.W.T., it was a little difficult at that time to advise definitely as to the stage of construction which might be reached on the school, as the existing weather conditions had a good deal to do with the situation. I am now advised that it would appear all work for this season on the school would be finished by December 1st. It would thus appear advisable for the Department of Education to arrange to have a janitor and teacher go north on the plane of Canadian Pacific Airlines leaving Edmonton Friday December 2nd. The teacher would thus be in a position to take over before our carpenter crew left there, and to maintain continuous heat in this building. It is not wise to close off the heat for a few weeks, if the present plans were that the teacher would arrive for opening of school on January 1st, 1950.\n\nMay this matter be drawn to the attention of Mr. R.F. Neary, Department of Education, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nW.J. Johnston\nDISTRICT ENGINEER.\nOctober 29, 1949.\n\nR. Blais, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nFort Good Hope Indian Day School.\n\nReference your PP 216 of October 18.\n\nWe have noted that the above school will be completed by December 1 and have sent an Army Message to our Indian Superintendent concerning the hiring of a caretaker for the month of December.\n\nWe are advertising widely for a teacher at this school and hope to secure one by January 1, 1950.\n\nBernard F.

B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe: Ft. Good Hope, Indian Day School.\n\nOn this date a copy of an Army message, forwarded to you by Mr. J.W. Mackinnon, School Inspector, has been sent to this office for my information by Mr. Mackinnon, having reference to the electrical power supply for the Ft. Good Hope Indian Day School.\n\nI may state that in September 1949, I was aware that the Signals would be equipped to supply power to the Fort Good Hope Day School. At this time the local power unit had already been installed in the school, and the navigation season had ended insofar as obtaining a power line to be shipped to Good Hope for the purpose of installing a line from Signal power. Mr. W.J. Johnston, of the Department of Public Works, had known for some months previous to the installation of the local school plant that the R.C. Signals intended to install large power units for their own use and it was late September before I had it drawn to my attention that a separate power unit was to be installed in the Indian Day School.\n\nIt may be further stated that I made arrangements through Dr. Moore of Indian Health services to have a power line installed in the local Nursing station to be connected with the R.C. Signal power unit. Although Indian Health Services were contacted by Army message in September, full authority for installation of this power line, sanctioned by the Director of Signals, was not received at this office until December 6. I have not taken any action on this installation to date as I was intending to try and have the necessary materials shipped as far at Norman Wells N.W.T. by R.C.A.F.. The cost of shipping these materials by Canadian Pacific Airlines is exorbitant.\n\nMr. Mackinnon states that the\nTHAT THE caretaker as employed by me at the Good Hope school is incapable of maintaining the Power Unit. This man has been on pay since November 1st, 1949, and under the supervision of the R.C.A.F. and the local I.T.I. foreman, Mr. D.L. Hawkins. I have not received any word from either of these parties, that the man was incapable. At the time this Indian was hired, you will recall that it was our intention to have a teacher at Ft. Good Hope by January 1950, which would mean that only thirteen more days of service would be required from the Indian.\n\nAlthough I concur with Mr. MacKinnon's idea, that power from the R.C. Signals would be a great asset at the School, I do not concur that the cost of operation under the present set-up would be greater than the cost of shipping wire for a new power line by C.I.Airline. I may further state that the power line to the Nursing Station, would have no connection with the power line to the school as the lines would run in entirely different directions.\n\nThe alternative, for the present set-up, would be to make arrangements through the R.C.A.F. at Edmonton, Alta and have the necessary materials forwarded as far as Norman Wells, N.W.T. by R.C.A.F. Aircraft. I intend on being in Edmonton, Alta., on December 22nd, and 23rd, and will approach Dr. Falconer of Indian Health Services with this proposal regarding the shipment of wire for the Nursing station.\n\nL.E.

F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Electric Power for Fort Good Hope Indian Day School\n\nThanks for copy of your letter of January 26, 1950, to Mr. C. R. Anderson, Chief Architect's Branch, Department of Public Works, Ottawa. I would advise you to give the matter of the transfer of the power plant from Fort Good Hope to Arctic Red River considerable study before making any definite decision. It may be that I lack knowledge of just what is involved in this transfer. Wherever this plant is transferred, you should make sure that it will be used to light up the whole settlement. You might be reimbursed from the R.C.M.P. and any others who may connect to the line. It would be a very sound policy to give the R.C.M.P. free light on the understanding that their officer would attend to the plant. Members of the R.C.M.P. are usually mechanically inclined and would be able to attend to this matter.\n\nBefore the 16\u00bd K.V.A. plants were purchased, I advocated the purchase of small 3,500 watt plants for our use. I wasn't invited to the meeting when it was agreed that the larger units would be purchased. Therefore, I did not have any say as to what type of equipment would be provided. However, we have the large plants -- so we must be realistic about the whole matter. It seems to me that it would be much better to move the plant to Fort McPherson and have it used to light up the school, nursing station, R.C.M.P., and any others wishing light. You might be able to make some kind of arrangement whereby the personnel of the nursing station or the R.C.M.P. would look after and maintain the plant for this service. This would remove your Department from the financial responsibility of maintenance and so forth. If the Arctic Red River school is to be made into an outpost school nursing station, it might be practical to move the two small plants from the nursing station at Fort Good Hope to Arctic Red River and use them for the school and nursing station. By having two small plants at Arctic Red River, there would be a stand-by at all times. Furthermore,\nthe R.C.S.S. at Fort Good Hope purchased two 25 K.V.A. plants on the understanding that the nursing station would connect to their power supply, so the nursing station will not require their two small plants.\n\nMr. Hall at Fort Norman is a well-qualified electrician. He informed me that the school at Fort Norman used 3,000 watts with everything turned on. I am inclined to the view that it would be much better to move the large plant to Fort McPherson for the use of the whole settlement and use the two small plants at Arctic Red River. I have discussed the above with Mr. Hall of Fort Norman who knows the local situation. He concurs in the above view and if it is possible to locate a small 2,500 or 3,000 watt plant to be installed along with the large unit, the situation would be clarified. The small plant could be used most of the time. It would operate at least 18 out of the 24 hours per day and result in a saving of at least $100 per month in fuel. It would pay for itself in a few months and result in a saving of a thousand dollars or more each year.\n\nI am submitting the above suggestions for your consideration as I am vitally interested in the complete success of our schools and in economizing wherever possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nMackenzie District, N.W.T.\nFebruary 10, 1950.\n\nMr. J.W. McKinnon,\nSupt. of Education,\nBox 117,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\n\nElectric Power for Fort Good Hope Indian Day School\n\nReference your letter of January 30\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nYour suggestion with regard to the R.C.M.P. seems a sound one and I would suggest that you might discuss this matter with Mr. Hunter when you next see him. Having been in the R.C.M.P., no doubt a satisfactory arrangement can be worked out locally.\n\nI have often wondered how the electrical plants and other equipment for these two-room Day schools in the Northwest Territories were decided. I certainly was not present at any meeting and I note that you were not there either. At the present time they are proving a source of great irritation to our Indian Superintendents and teachers. I wonder if we would not be better off without any type of lighting plant but just return to the old naptha lamp. The only one with which we have not had any difficulty is the unit at Fort Norman.\n\nI would be very pleased if you would go into this whole matter with both Mr. Kirkby and Mr. Hunter and see whether a joint agreement cannot be reached with regard to the units at Fort Good Hope and Fort McPherson. These schools seem to have been designed on a rather complicated basis and therefore neither teachers nor other local...\ninhabitants can handle the electrical equipment. If they give all this trouble when they are new, I shudder to think of the correspondence, Army Messenger, etc., which will flood into here when they are a few years older.\n\nI am sending copies of this letter to both Mr. Kirkby and Mr. Hunter and I hope the three of you in the North can advise what should be done with regard to the electrical equipment and heating of the schools before work begins at Fort Franklin and Arctic Red River.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

W. McKinnon, Superintendent of Education for the Mackenzie District, Northwest Territories, concerning the new Indian School building at Fort Good Hope, Northwest Territories.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nBox 117,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.,\nFebruary 23, 1950.\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esquire,\nDeputy Commissioner,\nNorthwest Territories Administration,\nDepartment of Resources and Development,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn December 17, 1949, I stopped at Fort Good Hope long enough to inspect the new school building and would report as follows:\n\nThis building is in an unfinished state. I understand the Army plans to finish this project this summer. At present, one of the classrooms is on the way to completion; the other has much interior work to be done. The woodwork has not been finished or varnished. The floors are in a rough state. The walls are to be decorated and the outside of the building is to be sheeted.\n\nI understand that this school has been connected with the local R.C.C.S. power supply. This is a good policy in view of the fact that there is no one available to attend to the local plant and that the local R.C.C. Station has an abundance of power for all local buildings.\n\nIt appears that this school is being well constructed and that we should have a very fine building when the interior and exterior work is completed, the plumbing connected to some outside set-up and the building finished in every detail.\n\nA 2,000 gallon water tank, hot water heater, and shower room should be provided as has been provided at Fort Resolution. This is essential in the interests of good sanitation and health.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nMackenzie District, N.W.T.\n9 March, 1950.\n\nMajor D. M.

Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDevelopment Services Branch,\nDepartment of Resources and Development,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nThis will confirm our telephone conversation which arose as a result of your letter of the 9th of March, concerning the use of certain Indian day schools in the Northwest Territories as combined nursing stations.\n\nI attach, for your information, a copy of a letter sent by the Superintendent of Education to Mr. Indian Superintendent Hunter concerning the Arctic Red River School. In this letter you will find quoted in full Dr. Moore's comments concerning the proposal for a joint school and nursing station at Arctic Red River. The same conditions would of course apply at Fort Franklin and Fort Good Hope.\n\nYou will note that a copy of the attached letter has been sent directly to Mr. McKinnon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure.\n| DATE   | PARTICULARS                  | DR. | CR. | BALANCE |\n|--------|------------------------------|-----|-----|---------|\n| Jun 24/49 | 24 Kleener 2/35              |     | 4.20|         |\n| Jun 25/49 | 12 Bars P&G Soap             |     | 1.06|         |\n|         | 24 Bars Lux Soap             |     | 1.96|         |\n|         | 1x70 Drum Sweeping Compound  |     | 3.25|         |\n|         | 4 Tins Dutch Cleanser        |     | .42 |         |\n|         | 1 Case Jiffy Towels          |     | 4.44|         |\n|         | 1 Case Rex Tissue            |     | 9.07|         |\n|         | 1 Cake Pan Ame               |     | .13 |         |\n|         | 12 Tins Gillette Lye        |     | 1.41|         |\n|         | 2 Push Brooms                |     | 5.28|         |\n|         | 1 Broom                      |     | 1.06|         |\n|         | 1 Broom                      |     | 1.43|         |\n| Jun 27/49 | 2 Cocoa Mats                 |     | 6.50|         |\n| Jul 15/49 | 24 Plastic Cups              |     | 14.40|        |\n| Jul 22/49 | Freight Chgs                 |     | 2.37|         |\n|         | Freight Chgs Re Mats         |     | .5  |         |\n\n$57.63\n\nShip To: The Teacher,\nFort Good Hope Indian Da School,\nFort Good Hope, N.W.T.,\nc/o Northern Transportation Co.,\nWaterways, Alberta.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 908-5, part 2)\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to The T.

PROCTOR\n\nFort Good Hope Indian Day School\n\nI gathered from recent correspondence with Mr. Gooderham that Dr. Falconer has written to you requesting a combined school and nursing station at Fort Good Hope. This school is now finished having been erected as a two-room school on the recommendation of Mr. J.W. McKinnon, Inspector of Schools. Mr. Gooderham has recommended the conversion of this building as a combined school and nursing station. He has suggested that a solid partition be placed between the two classrooms. One of the classrooms could be sub-divided by partitions to serve as a nursing station.\n\nThe apartment upstairs would be subdivided to be available as two separate suites.\n\nIf your architect wishes to have a copy of the plans for this Fort Good Hope school he can obtain one by calling Mr. Buck at 7952.\n\nAs this school is now completed with a few minor details to be attended to, the expense of the alterations would have to be borne by Indian Health Services.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received your telegram of the 13th instant stating that you will try and have the teacher stay at Fort Norman, N.W.T., until the school is completed. You also mentioned it was not expedient to have the teacher remain at Fort Simpson, or at some other point temporarily until the teacher could be installed in the new school at Fort Good Hope. My reason for suggesting Fort Simpson was that there is property which I understand has been recently purchased for school purposes but I did not have full information as to what plans your Department might be making for supplying a teacher. In making that suggestion by radiogram I realise I was trespassing on a sphere of work which was not my own, but it was only done as a suggestion if it would relieve the problem of accommodation for several months until the Fort Good Hope school were fully completed.\n\nIn my radiogram I gave two dates of completion, namely October 15th and December 15th. The release of only fifty percent of the funds as supply has meant that we have had to hold back our construction activities so as to be assured the funds would not be exhausted before further money was granted. On this account a smaller crew was sent to Fort Good Hope than would otherwise have been the case, and the completion date of the building is thus set at December 15th. As mentioned in my radiogram, however, if it were possible to have the full grant for Fort Good Hope school made available immediately, further men could still be sent in so that the completion date could be advanced.\n\nIn regard to providing storage space for desks, janitor supplies, and food for the teacher, this will be attended to. I am sending instructions to Mr. D.J. Hawkins, our Foreman at Fort Good Hope, to take delivery of all these articles. Freight bills and the accounts for the purchase of the articles, will have to be attended to and I am asking him to send copies of the Bills of Lading as received by him, to me for forwarding to you. This should answer as your receipt so that the various accounts might be paid.\n\nSince we hope to have the school at Fort Good Hope finished late this fall, the only method open was to send desks, janitor supplies, and food for the teacher. This would permit the building being occupied somewhere between October and December and classes in progress this winter.\n\nIn regard to the school at Fort Franklin, practically all our supplies are currently stored at Great Bear River where this Department has maintained a depot camp with a number of buildings situated there. The point on Great Bear River where the materials are stored is at St. Charles Rapids, where a portage road exists, said place of storage being about 40 miles west of Fort Franklin. It is intended to have all materials moved to Fort Franklin within the next several weeks, as it has not been possible to do so earlier on account of ice conditions in Great Bear Lake. A small carpenter crew is being placed at work at\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, File 909-5, part 1)\nFort Franklin to receive materials, erect temporary buildings, arrange for gravel and pour foundations, and do such other preliminary work as may be possible this year. Actual construction would thus be advanced next spring.\n\nIn regard to Fort Franklin, if the Purchase Requisition has not already been issued for desks, chairs and tables for the teacher, I would suggest this be not done. There are articles of this type on hand owned by this Department at Great Bear River which are surplus to our needs and they would probably answer your requirements. These could be declared surplus to War Assets and no doubt made available to you at a nominal charge.\n\nSimilarly, if you have not ordered desks, chairs and table for the teacher at Arctic Red River, would you please advise, as it is possible I might be able to release articles of this nature also to you, on the same basis as at Fort Franklin.\n\nW.J. Johnston\nDistrict Engineer.\nAll requisitions for desks, junior supplies, rations and teacher's residence furniture have been held up for York & Franklin Day School.\n\nW.T.\n5/8/49\nNOTE FOR FILE:\n\nThere is no Post Office at Fort Franklin.

This Department had several prefabricated buildings erected during previous years at Great Bear River and also had a crew of men at work there during 1948. This crew had the materials for Fort Franklin placed within the prefabricated buildings and also under our tarpaulins and tent shelters which were erected. It is intended to move the materials to destination at first barge in June, 1949.\n\nShipping instructions as follows:\n\nTo reach Waterways Aug. 1st for forwarding by N.T.

Therefore, requisitions for supplies should be cancelled forthwith. If this cancellation is not possible, then shipments should be diverted to the Department of Public Works' warehouse at Fort Smith, N.W.T., where arrangements have been made to store these items over the winter of 1949-50. If these requisitions have not been acted upon, they can be returned here. I have written to the Northern Transportation Company in Edmonton concerning the diversion of any shipments which might reach them.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Colonel Anderson:\n\nArctic Red River Indian Day School\nFort Franklin Indian Day School\n\nThe Director of the Lands and Development Services Branch has forwarded to me a copy of the letter sent to you on April 23rd by Mr. W.J. Johnston, your District Engineer at Edmonton, with reference to the purchase of electric generating sets for the Indian Day Schools at Arctic Red River and Fort Franklin.\n\nWe note that both these schools are in isolated locations, and that no other Government buildings or projects are nearby so that no prospect is presented for the sharing of electric power generator.\n\nTherefore an independent installation will be required, if we are to operate this school efficiently.\n\nWe have reviewed the correspondence sent to you by Mr. Johnston, and one of our officials has interviewed the Electrical Engineer of the Department of Lands and Development Services Branch. They are agreed that Mr. Johnston's recommendation for the purchase of the Lister Diesel Engine as supplied by Medland Machinery Limited be followed.\n\nWould you please notify Mr. Johnston accordingly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n\nColonel A.A.

If you would declare these surplus to your requirements, we will be glad to take them over through the War Assets Corporation. This would effect a considerable saving as desks are very expensive.\n\nI presume that we can proceed in January or February to order the remaining items of furniture, etc., needed for the Fort Franklin school but that no action should be taken with regard to Arctic Red River.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard J.

Owing to the lateness of the season it was impossible for workmen who should have installed the furnace and hot-air heating and also the electrical men, to arrive at this isolated point and complete their work without the danger of being caught over the freeze-up period. Since these sub-tradesmen could not carry out their part of the work, it was impossible for the carpenters to continue on the finish work within the building.\n\nIn regard to Arctic Red River, it was impossible to make a start on this building owing to the curtailment of funds at the first of the season in 1949. Providing funds of the full amount requested are available early in 1950 construction season, there appears a very good chance of completing the school at Arctic Red River in 1950.\n\nIn regard to school supplies, janitor supplies, desks, furniture for the living quarters, rations for the teachers, etc., for the schools, I am having enquiries made now as to what has been received in a general way at each location. It will not be possible to get a complete statement until mails are received after the freeze-up period, as this period is just now beginning in the North. At that time I shall advise you of such information as I have, and give up-to-date suggestions regarding dates of forwarding school supplies, and so forth, for 1950.\n\nIf you will refer to my letter No. 2622, you will note that a large proportion of the school supplies have been received at Coppermine, N.W.T. This is indeed very fortunate, since it will now be possible to begin school sessions once the building is completed. Great care and priority will, however, have to be given to the ordering of teachers' rations, and in this connection I would suggest at that time that one and one-half years' supply be ordered. According to records of the shipping; men there is an occasional year when no boats are able to get through the ice floes and reach Coppermine from Tuktoyaktuk. I do not want to be an alarmist about this, and it does not happen very often, but I have been reliably informed that this has happened.\n\n(over)\nand might happen in some year in the future. Thus it is very important that a heavy surplus of staple foodstuffs be kept on hand at this point.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.J. Johnston\nDISTRICT ENGINEER.\nOctober 11, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nLANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\nDepartmental School - Conner Mine, N.W.T.\n\nWe have received a report from Mr. W.J. Johnston, District Engineer, Department of Public Works concerning the schools under construction in the Northwest Territories.\n\nIn his report he has the following comments to make concerning the school at Copper Mine:\n\n\"If you will refer to my letter No. 2622, you will note that a large proportion of the school supplies have been received at Copper-mine, N.W.T.

In regard to your ordering supplies, however, may I suggest you withhold action for a couple of weeks. In regard to furniture, this Department has some furniture which will be surplus to its requirements at Great Bear River and regarding which I wrote you one time previously.\n\nI am just collecting final data before leaving on a trip to the Lower Mackenzie and while en route shall visit all the places where school buildings have been built, or are under construction or contemplated, for your Department. On my return I shall have more time to give you the information you require. A couple of weeks' delay will not materially affect your placing of orders to go forward at opening of navigation. In this respect I shall give you all particulars regarding dates of shipment, routes, etc., although I think you already have all this data.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.J.

In a recent conversation with Mr. W.J. Johnston of the Department of Public Works, he informed me that his construction crew at Ft. Franklin had a radio Transmitter and Receiver, which would be left at Fort Franklin for use of the Indian Day School teacher.\n\nIn view of the above, one radio Receiver and one Radio Transmitter has been ordered for the Agency office at Ft. Norman, so as to allow communication with the teacher at Ft. Franklin.\n\nIt may be mentioned that the matter of obtaining licenses for these sets, would have to be taken up with the Department of Transport. At the present time the Transmitter at Ft. Franklin is operating on a license to the Department of Public works and uses a frequency of 42 - 70 Megacycles. It is possible that this license could be transferred to Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIt would be necessary to obtain the license for the Fort Norman Transmitter, before the Transmitter could be ordered as it would necessarily have to be set according to the frequency allotted by the Department of Transport.\n\nL.C.

Mr. Hunter, therefore, forwards a requisition for similar equipment for the Agency office at Fort Norman.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would let us know if you consider this equipment should be supplied. If so, it is presumed that it will not be necessary for the appropriation for Indian Education to bear the whole cost, as the equipment will probably be used for other business than that referring to the operation of the Fort Franklin School.\n\nWith regard to the last paragraph of Mr. Hunter's letter, I do not think there will be any difficulty in obtaining a free radio license, as the Department of Transport supply us with free licenses at those schools where a radio is in use.\n\nBernard F.

It is understood that considerable difficulty is being experienced with other similar plumbing installations, due to the permafrost being encountered. I understand that Mr. Johnston will give some consideration to the installation of a chemical toilet in this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nBuilding completed and in operation and no changes suggested.\n\nFORT FRANKLIN, N.W.T.\n\nOnly one classroom to be used at outset for school purposes. Space adjoining accordion doors between two classrooms (as originally planned) to be made solid partitions and sound-proofed, so adjoining classroom might be used for medical examinations. Complete conversion of building to serve jointly as school and nursing station is not suggested at this time.\n\nAs Generating Plant, A.C., is now delivered at site, it is to be installed as originally planned.\n\nPlumbing installation originally proposed to be cancelled, and best terms possible made with sub-contractor. Consideration to be given to installation of some form of chemical toilet.\n\nFORT GOOD HOPE, N.W.T.\n\nComplete conversion of building to answer as school and nursing station recommended. This will require solid partition and sound-proofing between two original classrooms, and subdivision of one classroom by partitions to serve as nursing station. Apartment upstairs to be sub-divided, to be available at any time as two suites in event teacher and nurse may not be man and wife; and also taking advantage of construction crew while at work here and available for alterations. Plans for alterations to be completed by architectural branch.\nFORT GOOD HOPE (Cont'd).\n\nSince electric generator, A.C., is now installed, and arrangements have been made with Royal Canadian Corps of Signals to provide electricity, the generator at school to remain there as reserve unit. A point also to be considered is that R.C.C. Signals, in addition to supplying their own requirements will also supply school building and warden's cabin and a stand-by unit is desirable to be available in case of plant break-down or repairs. Also considerable expense would be involved in dismantling the plant now installed in school building.\n\nARCTIC RED RIVER, N.W.T.\n\nScheme for a Two Classroom Day School and Teachers' Quarters to be abandoned, and instead a One Classroom School and Teacher's Quarters to be built in accordance with existing plans and specifications available.\n\nBills of Materials for One Classroom School and Teacher's Quarters to be checked against materials, either on hand or intended to have been provided for Two Classroom Day School and Teachers' Quarters. Any surplus of materials to be shipped this year to Fort McPherson. School building at Arctic Red River to be built this year, using materials intended for Two Classroom School and Teachers' quarters, and providing any additional material if necessary.\n\nPlumbing installation originally proposed to be cancelled, and best terms possible made with sub-contractors.\n\nHot air heating originally intended for Two Classroom School to be checked on by Architectural Branch to see if it could be used with modifications in One Classroom School and Teacher's Quarters.\n\nElectricity sub-contract now in effect be negotiated on basis of One Classroom School and Teacher's Quarters.\n\nElectric generator to be supplied in keeping with reduced requirements, and arrangements made to install electric wiring in school. If R.C.M.P. desire to share in cost of construction and maintenance, this can be arranged for by providing a larger unit for combined needs.\n\nNo provision of any kind to be made for Nursing Station facilities.\nIndian Affairs 11 May 1950\n\nRe construction of Fort Franklin Indian Day School.......$35,000 00\n\nNOTE: This work is being done under the direction of the Department of Public Works.\n\nAttention: Mr. Gilbert\nMay 11, 1950.\n\nPERSONAL\nand\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nMr. W. J. Johnston,\nDistrict Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\n9937 - 103 Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nFort Franklin Indian Day School\n\nDear Mr. Johnston:\n\nYou will recall our previous discussions with regard to the installation of a solid partition between the two classrooms instead of the accordion doors, as planned. The idea in our minds was that one classroom could be used for medical examinations.\n\nI have been after our Architects on several other jobs and am afraid that they have now enough work before them to prevent the necessary alterations being carried out for at least two months. I was just told that practically every architect has been put on a job at the new Cape Breton National Park and that all our work will be delayed.\n\nTherefore I am afraid that we will have to go ahead with the accordion door plan and leave the classrooms exactly as designed.\n\nIn my letter to the Chief Engineer, I have therefore neglected to make any reference whatsoever to the solid\npartition between the classrooms as I know that you would just be held up for months in the completion of this building. Indian Health Services will only be using the building occasionally and no great hardship should be suffered by them in this change of plan.\n\nYou should get a letter soon from Colonel Anderson concerning the plumbing installations. I am attaching the complete data on the \"Hygeosan\" toilets which we are using in our schools in Eastern Canada and which I believe would be quite satisfactory at Fort Franklin and Arctic Red River. Do not hesitate to write to this company in Toronto concerning these units as we have found them very co-operative. They have university engineers on their staff, who can answer any questions. The cost per seat is $175.00. This includes the bowl, pipe, septic tank, etc. For example, if you order a three-bowl unit, the cost would be $525.00, which would cover everything including the extra length septic tank and also the school type installation. When ordering you should let them know these are for Indian schools, so that you will get fast delivery.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnc.\nOTTAWA, May 16th, 1950.\n\nSir:\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of May 11th, dealing further with your proposal to establish a station at Fort Franklin, which would be used for communication with the RCCS Station, which is located at Fort Norman, N.W.T.\n\nIn this connection I now wish to advise that the Department of National Defence have indicated that their Fort Norman Station is prepared to supply you with the terminal facilities required. If you are still anxious to establish your proposed station, I should be glad if you would complete the forms which were previously forwarded to you and return same to this office, in order that formal action may be taken in this matter.\n\nFor your further information I would point out that the Department of National Defence have also indicated that their Fort Norman Station receives traffic on the frequency 3040 kc/s and not on the frequency 4270 kc/s as was previously advised.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(G.C.W. Browne),\nController of Radio.\n\nB.F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI acknowledge your letter of May 11th and note that the Fort Franklin, N.W.T., Indian day school is to be completed in accordance with the original plan. This means that the accordion doors are to be placed separating two classrooms, as per the plan, and that no additional work is to be done to deaden any noise which might occur if one classroom were used occasionally by the Medical Doctor for his work. Plans will thus be completed here for the carpenter work on this building to be as per original plans and specifications.\n\nThe booklets regarding \"Hygeosan\" Septic Toilet Combinations are also acknowledged, and it is noted that an official letter will be received soon from Col. A. A. Anderson of this Department at Ottawa concerning plumbing installations. We shall await the arrival of this letter since I assume it is intended to abandon the plumbing installation on the original plans and for which a contract is now in effect. Presumably the \"Hygeosan\" septic tank combination will be used instead. In this connection this office will contact the Rural Sewage Disposal Equipment Limited of Toronto, Ontario in order to gain all possible information.\n\nFor your information, I am leaving the end of this week to take up permanent duties at the headquarters of this Department at Ottawa. I shall be glad to be of any assistance to you from now, as in the past. I am turning over the\npamphlets regarding the septic tank combinations and also making the contents of your letter known to Mr. J. E. Kellett, Acting District Engineer, in order that he may have the continuity in the construction programme hereafter I leave. The letter you sent me will still be treated in confidence and not for file purposes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. J.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 909-5, part 1)\nJune 16, 1950.\n\nChief Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFort Franklin Indian Day School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been advised with regard to the difficulty in the present plumbing installations required for the two-room Indian day schools with attached teacherages, being constructed in the Northwest Territories.\n\nElsewhere we have been arranging for the installation of septic toilet combinations which require but a pail of water per bowl per day. There are two companies providing this equipment, some systems of which are particularly designed for school purposes. They are:\n\n1. Rural Sewage Disposal Equipment, Limited,\n   2067 Dundas St. W., Toronto, Ontario.\n\n2. Caustic Sanitation, Limited,\n   189 King Street, Dundas, Ontario.\n\nTherefore, it will be in order to cancel the present plumbing contracts and to make the best possible terms with the plumbing tenderer. I would suggest that this matter be left for negotiating with the present Acting District Engineer at Edmonton.\n\nThe cost per seat of the septic toilets averages $175.00 per seat, which includes the bowl, pipe, septic tank, etc. In the case of the Fort Franklin School, a five-bowl unit would\nbe required with two bowls for the boys, two bowls for the girls and one bowl for the teacher. You will note that they are on thirty-six inch centres so that partitions can be erected between any combination of units. Consideration will have to be given to installing these units in a separate building because of the Permafrost conditions. Installation of these units in the present building might cause foundation settlement due to the heat generated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Murray,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnc.\n\nCopies sent to: Mr. Hunter and Mr. McKinnon\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 909-5, part 1)\nJune 19, 1950.\n\nThe Chief Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFort Franklin Indian Day School\n\nDue to the very isolated conditions which exist at the above Indian Day School, it is desirable that the teacher be provided with a radio transmitter.\n\nWould it be possible for us to obtain from your Department the radio set used by the construction crew? This would save considerable expense in sending in a new transmitter.\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could also be advised as to the call letters of this radio station.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. L. C. Hunter\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 20th with attached letter from the Superintendent of Education, Indian Affairs Branch, concerning the plumbing installations at Fort Franklin Indian Day School.\n\nThe plumbing contractor - H.Kelly & Company - has been instructed to present his claim on the cancellation of the plumbing installation at the Fort Franklin school. No materials were delivered to the site at Fort Franklin but they are held in stores at Fort Smith. The Contractor has given no indication to date of what action he is taking towards the disposal of these fixtures but it is presumed that he is waiting for the results of a call for Tenders on plumbing installations in the buildings now under construction by this Department at Fort Smith and Hay River, and if H.Kelly & Company are successful in obtaining the work of this season, the surplus equipment can be utilized to their gain; otherwise they will have to dispose of it as best they can and may insist that the Department take these materials over.\n\nThe suggested septic toilets have been given some study by the Engineers of this office and from their knowledge of the terrain at Fort Franklin the opinion is that the Hygeosan Septic Toilet is not feasible for this location.\n\nThe Fort Franklin school is sited on a southern slope leading down to the lake. This slope is moss-covered and in the perma-frost area with very little over-burden above the solid rock. Reports from workmen who placed the piers under this building are that many of the piers are on solid rock, and the balance of them not far from rock. Under these circumstances it will be difficult to obtain cover for the septic tank under the toilet. The ground conditions are subjected to continual freezing and unless this steel tank was well insulated, it is very doubtful if the installation would work even in the summer time. The discharge from the septic tank is by continual overflow with no siphoning, and it is believed that with the low temperatures prevailing at Fort Franklin the pipe leading from the septic tank to the cesspit will soon ice up and the installation be inoperative.\n\nIn view of the above opinions it is felt that the installation as suggested is not feasible. This, however, is only the opinion formed by the Edmonton District Office and it is possible that the Indian Affairs Branch may have made installations in other northern areas, and if so, I ask that we be given more detail on the installation of this type of fixture and on what methods are taken to safeguard it from freezing. The folios and literature presented by the manufacturers give no assurance or indication that this equipment will operate under the conditions that will be experienced in the school installations not only at Fort Franklin, but also at Fort Norman, Arctic Red River, and other points in the Northwest Territories.\n\nIn view of the ground conditions prevailing in this area, my recommendation is that standard outside toilets be constructed by the Department of Public Works' construction crew this summer, as these are a necessity at all points, as it is the rule rather than the exception that inside toilet installations are inoperative a great deal of the time through uncontrollable factors, mainly weather.\nNo action will be taken by the District Office towards the installation of the septic toilet combinations until further advised by your office.\n\nJ.E.

Kellett at Edmonton, with instructions to look after the installations as requested by you and report when the work had been completed.\n\nI am attaching hereto a copy of Mr. Kellett's reply dated June 28th in which he states the original plumbing contractor, H. Kelly and Company, has been instructed to present his claim on the cancellation of the plumbing installation at the Fort Franklin school. He states no materials were delivered to the site at Fort Franklin, but they are held in storage at Fort Smith.\n\nMr. Kellett further states that due to the difficult ground conditions and lack of any depth of soil near the school at Fort Franklin, he does not think that the septic tank type of toilets will prove satisfactory. His recommendation is that standard outside toilets be constructed and he states that no action will be taken towards the installation of the septic toilet accommodations, until he receives further advice from us.\n\nWould you kindly study the contents of Mr. Kellett's letter and let me have your further instructions at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.A.

His reply is as follows:\n\n\"To Be Safe Would Estimate 12,000 Gallons Fuel For Franklin School Plus Fuel and Lub Oil For Lighting Plant Stop To-day Have Had No Experience With These Lighting Plants And Cannot Estimate Consumption\"\n\nWould it be possible to use the additional funds from the Arctic Red River project for the purchase of this oil? I doubt how much extra of this money will be spent at Fort McPherson this year as I do not visualize that the crew will be able to do more than move the materials from Arctic Red River to Fort McPherson. This would mean that additional funds will be available for use in the purchase of oil at Fort Franklin.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Kellett, Acting District Engineer, Edmonton, in which he states that this transmitter is now in use on the Great Bear River road but could be transferred to you for use of the schoolteacher at Fort Franklin school about the end of August when it is expected that the road work will be completed.\n\nCall letters of this machine are XLA 41 and it operates on a wave length of 4270. Mr. Kellett also states that the carpenter crew now engaged on building the school at Fort Franklin are using a small combined transmitter and receiving set but they will be finished with it some time in November. Will your Branch require the transfer of this small instrument also?\n\nRobert Blais\nChief Engineer\n\nMemo:\nWould the teacher or other operator have to be (a) qualified (b) licensed (c) \"security-screened\"?\n925\nMisc 4-1 Fort Franklin\n\n9937 - 103 Street,\nEDMONTON, Alberta.\nJuly 11, 1950.\n\nR.BLAIS, CHIEF ENGINEER, OTTAWA,\n\nIn reply to your letter June 22, in which you enquire if the radio transmitter in use on the Great Bear River Road will be available for transfer to Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship and Immigration, when the school teacher takes over the duties at Fort Franklin school, I have made enquiries of the engineer in charge of this work regarding this transfer.\n\nHe states that the call letters of this machine are XLA4L operating on wave length of 4270. The work will be completed at Bear River Road at the end of August and the radio set can be transferred at that time.\n\nThere is also a small combined transmitter and receiving set available from the Bear River Road. This instrument is presently in use by the carpenter crew engaged building the school house but they will be through with this instrument in October or November at the latest. Will Indian Affairs Branch require the transfer of this small instrument also?\n\nJ.E.Kellett,\nA/District Engineer.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 909-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| Dept. | Qty. | DESCRIPTION          | Price, each | Amount |\n|-------|------|----------------------|-------------|--------|\n|       |      | **Order #57767**     |             |        |\n| 15    | 1    | Alarm Clock          | 2           | 79     |\n| 6     |      | Forks                | 1           | 14     |\n| 1     |      | Butcher Knife        | 95          |        |\n| 1     |      | Paring Knife         | 19          |        |\n| 6     |      | Knives               | 1           | 50     |\n| 6     |      | Dessert Spoons       | 1           | 14     |\n| 6     |      | Tea Spoons           | 1           | 90     |\n| 082   | 1    | Dinner Set           | 7           | 55     |\n| 53    | 1    | Grater Set           | 45          |        |\n| 1     |      | Muffin Pan           | 37          |        |\n| 1     |      | Percolator           | 1           | 35     |\n| 1     |      | Potato Masher        | 29          |        |\n| 1     |      | Potato Peeler        | 35          |        |\n| 1     |      | Rolling Pin          | 49          |        |\n| 1     |      | Sink Strainer        | 35          |        |\n| 1     |      | Skillet              | 2           | 15     |\n| 1     |      | Basting Spoon (Substituted) | 19 |        |\n| 1     |      | Measuring Spoon      | 18          |        |\n| 1     |      | Slotted Spoon        | 19          |        |\n| 1     |      | Mixing Spoon         | 20          |        |\n| 1 set |      | Meshed Strainers     | 35          |        |\n| 1     |      | Double Boiler        | 2           | 20     |\n| 1     |      | Egg Beater           | 65          |        |\n| 1     |      | Flour Sifter          | 50          |        |\n| 1     |      | Food Chopper         | 2           | 05     |\n| 1     |      | Fork, 2 tangs        | 19          |        |\n| 1     |      | Frying Pan           | 1           | 45     |\n| 1     |      | Bread Board          | 1           | 15     |\n| 1     |      | Bread Knife          | 49          |        |\n| 1     |      | Bread Pan            | 29          |        |\n| 1     |      | Cake Tin             | 25          |        |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6473, file 909-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| Dept. | Qty. | DESCRIPTION                  | Price, each | Amount |\n|-------|------|------------------------------|-------------|--------|\n|       |      |                              |             |        |\n| 83    | 1    | Cake Turner                  | 1           | 19     |\n|       |      | 4-pce.

There were about twenty Indian families at the post at the time of my visit. They live in log shacks and tents. There is great need of education at this point as sanitary conditions have much to be desired.\n\nThere were about twenty-five children of school age in the post at the time of my visit. The children appeared to be badly neglected.\n\nFort Franklin is, without a doubt, the most unattractive place in the Mackenzie District. The settlement borders on the western end of Great Bear Lake. It appears to have grown up without any plan or purpose. A long growth of vegetation covers the swampy ground. This is infested with mosquitoes and bull flies. At the time of my visit, the place was alive with flies and mosquitoes. Besides this, the air was filled with the smell of dogs as they are tethered in the settlement. The teacher engaged for Fort Franklin will require a sympathetic, helpful hand from Ottawa as his task will be an arduous one.\n\nThe school building has been built about 100 yards or more from the edge of Great Bear Lake. It is located in the swamp and mud. The building may sag and have out of shape this coming winter. As I took some pictures of this site, I shall send you some of them as soon as they have been developed. You will recall that W. J. Johnston, Chief Engineer, D. P. W., and I selected a good site close to the new Hudson's Bay Store; this site would have been ideal as it is on dry, high land. It was also fairly central for the children; whereas the present site is at the far end of the settlement. It will be necessary to level the grounds...\nabout the school, otherwise it will be impossible to use it for playground purposes.\n\nThe building is well under construction. It should be completed this summer. A well-qualified engineer should periodically check the work on this building in order to ensure good work.\n\nThe large 12 K.V.A. alternating current generator (similar to that installed at Fort Good Hope and Fort Resolution) will be a continual source of irritation if steps are not taken to prevent same. I have discussed the suitability of this type of generator with officers of the R.C.C.S., and others who are familiar with this type of equipment. They are not in favour of this type of lighting plant as it is too large for our needs. These generators are quite large and beyond the stage where a handyman can care for them; they require the care of an expert. As Fort Franklin is isolated from the rest of the world for many months of the year, a small 1000 Watt emergency A.C. generator should be provided or else a D.C. generator should replace the A.C. plant which I understand is now on site. You will realize that it is necessary to operate an alternating current plant twenty-four hours a day in order to keep the electric furnace operating; whereas a direct current plant will require eight or ten hours of operation per week. With a direct current plant, I believe the savings in fuel alone would amount to well over $100.00 per month.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nMackenzie District, N.W.T.\nSeptember 7th, 1950.\n\nMr. E.V. Gilbert,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Gilbert:\n\nRe: Fort Franklin Indian Day School\n\nWe have just received a report from Mr. J.W. McKinnon, Superintendent of Education for Mackenzie District, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The school building has been built about 100 yards or more from the edge of Great Bear Lake. It is located in the swamp and mud. The building may sag and heave out of shape this coming winter.

We are particularly interested in the last paragraph of Mr. McKinnon's letter which reads as follows:\n\n\"The large 12\u00bd K.V.A. alternating current generator (similar to that installed at Fort Good Hope and Fort Resolution) will be a continual source of irritation if steps are not taken to prevent same.

I might add that we have had considerable trouble at Hay River and Fort Good Hope, where similar equipment was supplied.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPP/ST\n\nDirector.\nR.A.

H. Greenaway, Esq.,\nRocher River, N. W. T.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of the petition forwarded on behalf of the residents of Rocher River with regard to the establishment of a school.\n\nThis letter was forwarded to me by Mr. J. W. McKinnon, Superintendent of Schools of the Bureau of Northwest Territories and Yukon Affairs.\n\nWe have included in our estimates a sum for the construction of an Indian day school at Rocher River. At present these estimates have not yet been finalized but we hope that this amount will be left in for action. However, the big difficulty will be, naturally, the actual construction of the school. We have experienced great difficulty in building day schools this last year, as contractors are simply not interested in this type of building. We have even been experimenting with prefabricated schools in order to overcome the great shortage.\n\nI would appreciate any comments from you as to the possibility of interesting anyone in the construction of a school at Rocher River.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

B. Henry\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 9th instant, I wish to say that the Rocker River school would suit me, as I'm very fond of the North.\n\nIf possible, I would appreciate your supplying me with a map of the N.W.T., so I'll know the exact location of the school in question.\n\nI would also appreciate particulars about the living accommodations there, so I'll know what I need to take along in the line of furniture, bedding, and kitchen utensils.\n\nThere is one suggestion I wish to submit for your consideration with\nregard to dental care among Indians. I've often wished I had known how to freeze gums and pull teeth, as most Indian reservations are not within easy access of a dentist, and consequently, Indians have to suffer weeks (if not months) before they can have an aching tooth attended to. If the Department were willing to reimburse the dentist's fees, I would be only too glad to arrange with a local dentist to give me the license required to enable me to perform this needed service to Indians.\n\nIf you have any available information as to the means of travel in order to reach Rocky River, I'd be glad to have it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6474, file 910-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRocher River.\n\n42 Indian families, totalling 96 Indians live at Rocher River. The Half-Breed and white people increase the population to 140. Approximately 25 miles up the Talton River is another settlement - Rat River, where a few Indians and white trappers live. For the purpose of this report Rocher River and Rat River are considered as one settlement.\n\nRocher River is an ideal location for an Indian Village. Fishing is good and caribou are available during the open season. Fur is by no means plentiful but there is enough, including the spring rat hunt, to afford a living to an Indian who will try to support his family.\n\nIn spite of the above, and even though the Indians are Chipewyans of the same band as those at Fort Resolution and Snowdrift, Rocher River is the dirtiest and most poverty-stricken settlement in the agency. I flew into Rocher River early last June and the stench of garbage and rotting caribou hides tossed out of the front doors and along the river bank where the dogs are tied the uncleanness of the homes and the general filth of the settlement were a revelation. The place was cleaned up somewhat when I threatened prosecution under the Public Health Ordinance but probably will be just as dirty this spring.\n\nThe people at Rocher River make very little effort to support themselves and none at all to improve their conditions. During a recent visit I found caribou drying in only one house, that of the Chief, Pierre Frise. The usual routine is to sleep all morning then to loaf and play cards for the remainder of the day and all night.\n\nThese people are almost completely demoralized. I recently treated a 14 year old girl for V.D.C. and found her to be four months pregnant. Three white trappers, brothers, of Rate River have been fathers of illegitimate babies by Treaty Indian women, the youngest brother becoming a father in January of this year. Several girls have had more than one illegitimate child and several Treaty Indian women, some of them married, are living with Half-breeds in common-law status.\nThe only reason I can see for the situation at Rocher River is the influence of the white people who live in that settlement. Mr. E.R. DeMelt, a free trader and his common-law wife, Mrs. Rose Metcalfe, came to Rocher River approximately ten years ago. They run a small store and a small sawmill. In addition, Mr. DeMelt has a trapping license.\n\nThe Rocher River Indians require help, not financial assistance but mental stimulation. The natural resources could very easily sustain the population. There is no place within a hundred miles of Rocher River and Rat River which is as suitable for people living in the Indian fashion.\nJuly 16, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Bellavance:\n\nI understand that you are interested in two of our schools, namely Roche River, in the Northwest Territories, and Seine River, in the Fort Frances Agency, Ontario.\n\nI am now able to advise you that the Roche River School will not likely be completed by the end of the summer holidays and therefore will not likely be open during the 1948-49 academic year. However, we do have a school in the Northwest Territories, at Fort Norman, which might interest you. It has now been open for two years and has been operated by the wife of one of the Signallers stationed there by the Department of National Defence. As pointed out in my letter of June 9, you would be entitled, in all probability, to a Northern Living Allowance if you accepted this school.\n\nI would like to hear from you as soon as possible as to whether you wish to accept either the Seine River School or the Fort Norman School.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMr. Norbert Bellavance,\n150 Provencher Avenue,\nSt. Boniface, Manitoba.\nExtract from report from Mr. Johnston, District Engineer dated October 15th on the Rocher River Day School.\n\nRE: ROCHER RIVER.\n\nThe 2 Classroom Day School and Teachers' Quarters has been erected and has outside finish on the walls and a built-up tar and gravel roof recently completed by a roofing contractor from Edmonton. The roughing-in has been done for electricity. The hot-air furnace and heating ducts are now being installed. It was not possible for the plumbing contractor to deliver materials to destination this year, owing, in part to the lateness in which the contract was let, and also to the fact that there are only about four boats per season from Fort Smith to this point. Carpenter work has advanced to a point where three carpenters could finish by early December. Work on this project was closed down for the season on the 16th instant, largely due to the impossibility of having a generator delivered which was necessary for operation of the blower in connection with the hot-air furnace. I wrote you by letter # 2961 on October 6th, in reference to specifications calling for a fully automatic electric generating machine and the reluctance of firms to supply this unit. I am still awaiting your instructions if a manually controlled machine could be installed.\n\nSo far as I know, no desks or classroom fittings have been received at Rocher River, and there is no furniture on hand for the teachers' quarters. In fact the arrival of these fittings, furniture and so forth, at a settlement where there is little, if any, warehouse storage space, presents a problem and it is doubtful if such should be delivered until the school building is ready to receive these articles, which represent a considerable investment. It should, however, be possible to begin work next spring on the school project and have it completed early in June when the first boat arrives there. Incoming shipments of furniture, classroom supplies, fittings, rations for the teacher and so forth should be scheduled to arrive on the first boat arriving at Rocher River next year. That would permit the opening of school by July 1st if this were desired.\n\nTO REACH WATERWAYS MAY 15TH FOR FORWARDING BY HUDSON'S BAY CO.\nOTTAWA, December 13, 1948.\n\nCol. B. F.

McKinnon, Esq.,\n342 Lisgar Road,\nRockcliffe Park,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThank you for your letter of October 16th.\n\nRegarding the school supplies, most of these have arrived and in my warehouse at present there is a very heavy case which I have reason to believe contains school stationery, pencils, etc. There may be more stored in Demelt's warehouse. I know the little furniture that came in is stored there at present. No school desks arrived yet.\n\nMail continues to arrive for the principal and I am taking care of that end of it. There is also a complete sound movie projector for the school and a radio and gramophone record player for the teacher.\n\nBefore a teacher could commence duties here, the school-room would have to be finished and temporary desks made for the pupils. The installation of an electric plant is essential for both light and heat. The heating system is already installed but power is required to force the heat to the various rooms through the circulatory vents.\n\nI need not remind you that everyone here is anxiously awaiting the completion of the school building so that the children can start with their studies. Should you decide to send in a teacher before the rest of the school building is completed we could always put him up at the \"Bay\".\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n'sgd' G. E.

As you are probably aware, no further building can take place at Rocher River until the question of re-designing the heating unit has been settled. I have already wired Mr. Hunter concerning the arranging of local watchman services for this building. It is quite likely that Mr. Duncan could arrange to see that no vandalism occurs, pending the arrival of a teacher next summer.\n\nBernard F.

Mulvihill,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nFort Resolution, N.W.T.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of May 26th, in connection with my transfer, I wish to state that I accept Rock River, there being no other choice.\n\nI would not consider staying on here, even if there were three teachers to help me, simply because I don't enjoy living among narrow-minded people such as are some of the local Protestants who were opposed to my taking charge of the school on the grounds that I am Catholic.\n\nFrom a financial angle, however, I would be tempted to consider being hired as janitor for the school, as the janitor's monthly salary is $25.00; which is $3.00 more than the teacher's salary; and I doubt if he works an average of four hours per day.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHarley Bellavance\nOttawa, June 27, 1949.\n\nJ.W.

I have been trying to interest Mr. Bellavance who originally planned to transfer to this school from Hay River to accept a school in Northern Saskatchewan. I feel that the Rocher River School is a preferable one for you as it is closer to civilization at Yellowknife and Fort Resolution; it is easier to reach and the school will be completed in the next fortnight.\n\nTherefore I wired Mr. Bellavance today, requesting a decision from him concerning his immediate plans. I will write to you as soon as I get a reply. In the meantime I thought I would write you to ensure that you are still interested in Rocher River. The school building is of course identical with Fort Good Hope.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN: MHCN\nColonel B. F.

In other words, during the summer months you would both receive salary as indicated above.\n\nWith regard to the payment of Northern Living Allowances, I am referring this matter to our Personnel Officer so that he can advise me whether you would both receive the allowance, or not.\n\nWith respect to transportation, I am advised that the best way of handling this is for you to pay your transportation in to Fort Good Hope (that is for your family and yourself) and then submit the receipts here by airmail, when a travelling expense cheque can be mailed to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDuring the past month I have been able to visit the three Indian Day Schools in this Agency as well as the Fort Resolution Residential School. As this trip was made just after the opening of the school term I believe it worth while to report on my observations at each point.\n\nOn September 14th proceeded to Roche River with Agency boat. This school had opened for the first time on September the 6th, and was progressing very favourably. The day I attended this school 35 pupils were in attendance and a few more were expected to come in. Not too much past this number or possibly a few more will be the limit. Some of these children will move out with their parents for the winter hunt but I believe well over 25 will be in attendance at all times.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education was contacted and permission to construct a limited number of tables and benches to accommodate the extra pupils was obtained. These tables were to be so constructed that they can be used as ping-pong tables in a games room once more desks are obtained.\n\nA large number, if not all the natives at this settlement are in the settlement for the greater part of the summer and now that we have a welfare teacher at this point, I believe we should encourage gardening, etc., if we are to improve the welfare of these natives. Mr. & Mrs. Blackburn are very enthusiastic about doing just this work and as we have a tractor at Resolution, I will have it taken to Roche River and plow up a section of the school yard as well as an area for communal gardens. It is my understanding that this type of work is part of the Welfare teachers job and in this country the first requirement is to improve the Indians standard of living by better methods of obtaining his food and clothing. A request for rakes and hoes for the spring gardening was noted and is on attached requisition.\n\nAs to Mr. Blackburn's status, it is obvious that he expects\nto be second teacher when there are over 30 pupils and wants to hire a man to haul water, carry in wood and do the janitor jobs. I understood that Mr. Blackburn was to look after the school and we were not going to hire a janitor. From my talks with him I gathered that he felt that the teaching of the extra pupils and the night classes he took made it impossible to do the janitor work. As Mrs. Blackburn is the welfare teacher, I thought it was her place to teach the older persons and to contact the Indians in the settlement.\n\nBoth these people seem enthusiastic and should, I hope, help to make Bowser River a better place for the Indians. I would at the same time like to know whether we are to hire the services of an extra man as janitor. I cannot see how two teachers on full time pay are needed to teach 50 pupils, but can be corrected.\n\nI have seen enormous progress at all the schools since last year and I believe we can look forward with confidence to the results that will be obtained from the new type of school in the Northwest Territories.\n\n(Sgd.) I.E.Kirkby,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies,\n\n/oc\nExtract from R.A. Gibson's letter dated Sept. 2, 1949.\n\nThrough some stupid error the hardware for the Hay River school was shipped to Kocher River and the man building the last mentioned school did not report it until he had finished the job. The hardware is being transferred.\n\nExtract from R.A. Gibson's letter dated Sept. 2, 1949.\n\nThe Kocher River school is far enough ahead for the school teacher to start using the building. There is still the outside water and sewer installation to be constructed, also the fencing on the property. There is some carpenter work and some work on the accordion doors still to be done.\nRaphe River B.W.T.\nOct. 23rd 1949.\n\nMr. Murray,\nDept. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Murray:\n\nPlease find enclosed all the required receipts covering our expenses for train transportation from Edmonton.

A. Gibson, Esquire,\nDeputy Commissioner,\nNorthwest Territories Administration,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI inspected the Rocher River Indian Day School on Tuesday, November 29th and would report as follows:\n\nThere were 37 pupils in attendance at the school and I was under the impression that the children were learning considerable under Mrs. Blackburn's supervision. Complete report of this school will follow as soon as time permits.\n\nDuring my visit to this settlement, the local people requested that I attend a public meeting in the school. At this meeting, Mr. Duncan was elected unanimously, by all present, as a school trustee. He said that he would be willing to act as custodian of school property and do everything possible to further education. All of the parents in this district are Roman Catholic, yet they were very disappointed that religious education was given at the school. They told me that they had informed the local priest that they would withdraw their children from the school if he continued to enforce their children to remain during the religious education period. The priest told them that they would be excommunicated from the church, to which they replied that this made little difference to them. He further informed them that he would cut their Family Allowance payments if they did not remain for religious education.\n\nThe local people also acquainted me with the fact that the Blackburns had announced that they would like to have the local priest live in the school residence while at this point. The local people greatly resented any interference in the school by the local priest and informed me that they would withdraw their children from the school if a satisfactory solution was not arrived at immediately.\n\nIn order to keep this school operating, the parents so desiring demanded that they have the right to submit a written statement to the Principal requesting that their children be exempt from the religious education period from 3:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Mrs. Blackburn indicated that this plan would work quite well.\n\nI am submitting this statement in order that you will be informed of the developments in this\narea. I would advise that this matter be left entirely in the hands of the local people at Rocher River and I am confident that this is the only possible means of arriving at a satisfactory settlement as far as the local residents are concerned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nLackenzie District, N.W.T.\nOttawa\n\nDecember 10, 1949.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nCapital Theatre Building,\n220 Queen St., Ottawa.\n\nFor your information, we are forwarding a copy of a letter received from Mr. J. W. McKinnon, Superintendent of Education for the Mackenzie District, Yellowknife, N.W.T., concerning the Roche River Indian Day School.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nOttawa, 29 December, 1949.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR,\n\nLANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nSCHOOL BOARDS - INDIAN SCHOOLS,\nNORTHWEST TERRITORIES.\n\nWe have noted with some concern Mr. McKinnon's action in apparently forming School Committees or School Boards in the Northwest Territories. As you are aware, the Indian Act does not provide for the establishment of these School Boards nor has it been felt necessary to establish these in view of the fact that the entire cost of Indian education is borne by the Government.\n\nOur Indian Superintendent has written at some length concerning the Roche River School and I felt you would be interested in his comments regarding Mr. McKinnon's action:\n\n\"At Roche River we have two factions, one the Hudson's Bay trader and the other a free trader. In between there is a group of no good white trash who are dead beats anywhere. To establish a school board of this type of person or in a community such as this will only give the teacher untold grief. None of the whites are out of the funding, which it is in no uncertain terms and the Bay Manager is just as much a part of the whole thing as any one else. Even the Police dislike going to Roche River because all one hears is a long series of fantastic tales about one party when he visits one store and then hears equally as fantastic from the other store when he visits it. To make the teacher responsible to any of these individuals would be to drive him out by the first plane.\"\n\"The above probably does not interest you but it is one of my objections to having a trustee out of the Roche River whites appointed. If these people were a little more interested in the school and incidentally the Indians than they are about their own fairy tales, which do cause plenty of trouble then I would be in favor of a trustee but not the way things stand. A trustee from any section of the Roche River whites would be a stool pigeon who would haunt the teacher day and night.\n\n\"I feel the school work is progressing very favorably and the Indians seem only too willing to attend. There is no trouble with them and all social activities are very orderly and very well attended by these people. The only ones who do not seem to know their places are some of the whites who as in most places have been the real offenders where it comes to bringing alcohol to the Indians. I think this is answering a long felt need in Roche River and if the Teacher can be kept out of the petty jealousy that exists then we need not worry about the final outcome being a success.\"\n\nDirector.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso auxquelles je consens par les pr\u00e9sentes.\n\nOttawa, December 2, 1946.\n\nMr. J.

Blackburn,\nAddress Roche River, N.W.T.,\nSchool Roche River Indian Day\n\nRATIONS - INDIAN DAY SCHOOL TEACHERS\n\nAt some of the settlements in the Northwest Territories the assortment of groceries and provisions available for purchase is rather limited. In many cases, the stocks are meagre and there is little variety in the items offered.\n\nTo overcome this situation and as a measure of assistance to the teachers, arrangements have been made with the Hudson's Bay Company to have requisitions for rations filled at Edmonton and shipped directly to the individual teacher.\n\nThe Nutrition Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare has prepared a ration list of the items required for one person living for one year in the North. We have secured approximate prices as quoted by the Hudson's Bay Company in Edmonton. Attached is this list, with the prices, of course, being subject to variation.\n\nOn the basis of this list the teacher may then prepare an order and forward same to this office. We will then place the order with a wholesale grocery firm in Edmonton and the items will be shipped by water transportation. The cost at wholesale price of the rations purchased in this manner on behalf of the teacher, together with transportation charges on same, will be deducted on a monthly basis from the living allowance paid to northern employees of the Department. The maximum that can be deducted from the Northern Living Allowance is $35. a month (i.e.) $350. for Day School Teachers and $420. from Welfare Teachers.\n\nIn cases where the cost of the rations and transportation charges is in excess of the above possible deductions, the teacher will be obliged to pay the difference.\n\nThe requisition showing the requirements must reach Ottawa prior to March 15, 1950, complete with express address and shipping instructions to ensure delivery during the navigation season.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nCopy to Indian Superintendent Kirkby.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6474, file 910-1, part 1)\n| Quantity | Food       | Details                  | Price |\n|----------|------------|--------------------------|-------|\n| DAIRY PRODUCTS |\n| 96 lbs.  | Milk       | Evaporated               | 14.34 |\n| 90 \"     | \"          | Powdered, whole          | 47.88 |\n| 10 \"     | \"          | Powdered, skim           |       |\n| 25 \"     | Cheese     | #1 Baby rolls            | 12.28 |\n| 60 \"     | Butter     | Canned                   | 43.80 |\n| 17 \"     | Eggs       | Dried                    | 32.88 |\n| 30 doz.  | \"          | Processed                | 18.00 |\n| FRUITS   |\n| 72 cans  | Canned     | 12 cans Peaches          | 3.24  |\n|          | (20 oz.cans)| 12 \" Pears               | 4.44  |\n|          |            | 12 \" Apricots            | 3.60  |\n|          |            | 12 \" Plums               | 2.16  |\n|          |            | 12 \" Raspberries         | 3.84  |\n|          |            | 12 \" Strawberries        | 3.60  |\n| 72 cans  | Part concent-| 24 \" Apple Juice         | 2.83  |\n|          | rated Juices| 24 \" Grapefruit Juice    | 3.45  |\n|          | (20 oz. cans)| 12 \" Tomato Juice        | 1.58  |\n|          |            | 12 \" Pineapple Juice     | 2.10  |\n| 24 cans  | Tomatoes   | 12-15 oz. pkgs.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nWhen we arrived in Rocher River last September, there was no food or ration which we expected to be in already. We placed an order with the Hudson's Bay Co. for the amount of $640.00.\n\nMay I ask you to pay that amount to the Hudson's Bay Co. at Edmonton and take out a monthly payment out of my salary and allowance starting from February until August inclusively.\n\nThe situation should be different next year since we shall be right in Rocher River and in a position to order whatever we really need with what will be left from this year's mess.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to the Manager of the Hudson's Bay Co. in Edmonton.\n\nHoping that my request meets your approval,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMrs. Annette Blackburn.\nRocher River, N.W.T.,\nJanuary 15, 1950\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nThis is to inform you that Mr. Blackburn has not received any salary yet for his teaching or any other work he has been doing since the first of September.\n\nHe has been teaching the Junior classroom with beginners from 6 to 15 years of age. Adult Education takes all his nights. You must have received a report on that subject from Mr. McKinnon, Superintendent of Education at Yellowknife, who suggested on his visit in the last days of November that Mr. Blackburn should receive a monthly salary of around $160.00 for the work he has been doing. The plant and the janitor work take most of his free hours. The school, unfinished as it is, requires continuous heating day and night and I do not exaggerate. He has to be up every hour and a half to keep the fires going to keep the rooms not warm but only cool. We have to go in the furnace room to warm up during school hours.\nMr. Kirkby, who came yesterday, was surprised to hear that Mr. Blackburn had received nothing yet.\n\nI do merely hope that Mr. Blackburn's position will be cleared up in the near future.\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMrs. Annette Blackburn,\nRochor River, N.W.T.\nDear Sir:\n\nSchool maintenance and the maintenance of the light plant and engine at Rocher River school have been one continual source of worry from the time this school was taken over. I am enclosing a copy of each wire received from Mr. Blackburn at Rocher River and also the reply on the action taken. From these wires it will be seen that Blackburn knows nothing whatsoever about equipment and he has made himself so highly disliked by his attitude and actions that no one will give him any assistance when it comes to looking after the plant.\n\nA complete instruction book; both for the engine and the battery bank; is left on the tool bench beside the engine and as the Lister is simplest engine to handle anyone with the ambition to read the instructions should be able to handle the plant. The changing of a fuse seemed to me to be lack of the very simplest of common sense rules.\n\nOn my last trip into Rocher River I received a wire that the plant had played out and that it was impossible to start it. I took in the Dept. of Transport mechanic from Resolution and Blackburn was sure that the lad who ran the plant last fall had purposely damaged it. On examination it was found that the fuel tank had run dry and the engine stonked so that when the tank was again filled an air lock was caused and the plant would not start. Blackburn had been filling the engine with the radiator half full and when the plant would not start had started to pull things off and had drained oil over everything. It was after seeing this mess that I requested the fire extinguishers and ordered the plant cleaned up. I consider this man will ruin the plant in very short order and he has only made the settlement of Rocher River into a more disorganized place than it ever was before.\n\nI believe that Mrs Blackburn may be a good teacher but Mr. Blackburn thinks he is boss and is ruining all the good she is doing. The first requirement at Rocher River is to run a good school and make it a credit before moving out to try and run the Indians and whites, when he cannot run the establishment he is in without wrecking it when ever our back is turned.\n\nThis school has a light plant and the furnace is dependant on power for circulation. If we do not have a teacher or teacher's husband who can run these two simple units we will not be able to install our water system and other equipment for fear of it freezing up for lack of care or knowledge of the simplest equipment. I have done all I can to help keep these schools on the go and to make life pleasant for the teacher but when a man is receiving pay to do a job it should either be done right or the man must be replaced.\n\nThe number of pupils in attendance at this school is from 30 to 35 and it is very doubtful if it will be higher.\nin the near future, in fact it is much more likely to decline with the moving of families of T.B. patients to Residential school.\n\nI am very anxious to see these school establishments operate smoothly and that we should get the most out of them for the money spent. If the physical plant itself cannot be looked after by the man we now have the only solution is to get rid of him and put in someone who will show a little initiative and common sense which must be done if we are not going to ruin the whole equipment now installed.\n\nThe following wires have been exchanged and results are as indicated.\n\nWire: Electric plant needs to be serviced by experienced repair man stop One battery connection burned with a flash when starting motor afraid # batteries will discharge not using motor until checked, signed Blackburn.\n\nAnswer: Please explain fully where flash occurred as I wish to take in repairs first trip, signed Kirkby.\n\nWire: Flash occurred at battery post and almost burned one post off battery stop Post still holds but badly damaged would suggest one new battery, signed Blackburn.\n\nWire: Motor running good but no registration of charge on panel stop waiting George to return this week and check and will wire results. Signed Blackburn.\n\nAnswer: Did you check reverse current relay to see if it is making contact when engine running at full speed stop Check points and hold in with insulated screw driver in not making contact stop also check fuses. Signed Kirkby.\n\nWire: George McCallum checked plant yesterday and found defective fuse on switchboard stop plant running satisfactorily, signed Blackburn.\n\nWire: Oil pressure gauge shows no pressure on plant engine stop do you wish McCallum to check. Signed Blackburn.\n\nAnswer: Have service man clean oil lines, filters and screens also check pump to restore pressure, signed Kirkby.\n\nWire: Plant stopped operating at two forty pm today suggest expert checkup stop done everything I know, Blackburn.\n\nFlew into Rocher River with one mechanic and found plant in filthy condition, plant had been let run dry of fuel oil and air lock had formed. Instruction book on table and if this had been read by Blackburn he could have fixed it.\n\nWire: No registration of voltage on panel stop motor runs good but no oil pressure indicated have closed school as too cold for operation, signed Blackburn.\n\nAnswer: Local engineer advises engine must not be run without oil pressure. Signed E.C. Devlin, Clerk.\n\nOn my return I wired you at Ottawa for permission to take in engineer and electrician to check equipment. This series of wires are the work of a man who has no knowledge of equipment at all and as we are not able to have an electrician make a trip into Rocher River every time a fuse blows or a mechanic every time the man forgets to put oil or fuel into the plant I believe that it is time to remove him from the job otherwise we will ruin the whole plant and still in the end have to get a new man in to operate the equipment.\nI do not feel that Mr. Blackburn has made any attempt to make the school equipment run and even though this school is of very poor construction I am sure that the equipment can be run in a much better way. It is not possible to hire the local Indians so to this work as none of them have any ideas regarding mechanical equipment, although it would be impossible to do less than is done now. This school is situated in a very small settlement and it would not be possible to have both a teacher and a janitor, but if the teacher was to have some knowledge of mechanical equipment and give him authority to hire local help to wash floors, polish and wax, carry wood, bring in ice, clean up the engine room, keep fuel in the engine and so forth then we should not have the present grief we do have. All the extra jobs should be done on an hourly wage basis and the teacher given an extra $30.00 per month to check the light plant himself. It is impossible to hire anyone with mechanical knowledge in Roche River and no man will look after the light plant for $30.00 if this is all he has to do.\n\nI believe that the janitor work and the light plant and wood and ice hauls should be a full time job and whether the principal has to hire it done or whether we put in a married woman and her husband to do the work we are going to be forced to pay out at least $150.00 per month for the work done. Mr. Blackburn has only received the $30.00 per month that I have mentioned through to him and he felt that he was to receive a stated amount whether teaching or not and that when he was teaching he would not attend to the plant but would turn over the $30.00 to someone else to do the work. I have a copy of your letter of August 15th, file 910-1 (E) and I must admit that it is slightly misleading if not carefully examined and as Mr. Blackburn is too excitable to concentrate he took your letter to mean that he would receive a salary whether teaching or not and when not teaching an extra $30.00 to look after the plant, also that when he did start to teach he would pass the $30.00 on to someone else. This is his complaint about salary but everything has gone haywire from the day he arrived and he needs daily supervision regarding the equipment. I cannot give this as it costs $150.00 for every plane ride into the place therefore I find that I have to agree with Mr. McKinnon that we need a local school board or sub-trustee or a home and school association that will take the well being of the school serious and check up on teacher and janitors who donot perform their required duties.\n\nIn the Northwest Territories we have to rely upon each man to run his or her own establishment without daily supervision and unless we receive this type of person everything will go downhill. A service man cannot be on call every hour of the day to out-of-the-way places, and as they are large establishments with much technical equipment, then we must have teachers who know the rudiments of electricity and mechanics or we will never keep our schools open. At many settlements schools are hooked up to the Army Signals or Dept. of Transport and at such a place maintenance amounts to sweeping and oiling one motor. At my two large schools we have self contained units that rely on their own plants and equipment and we must have teachers or teachers husbands who can qualify enough to do the very simplest of mechanical chores such as changing fuses, keeping plant and motors oiled and fuel in the tank.\n\nI know these schools are set in isolated settlements and that teachers are hard to get, but from the very location of these schools it is a must that we get couples who can be relied upon to run the place on their own in order that we may receive the full benefit of the moneys spent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI.F.

Mr. Barlow has already been notified.\n\nMay I ask you to verify if the refund cheque for expenses has been sent to the bank and notify the Manager of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Portage and Donald Branch, Winnipeg.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6474, file 910-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Canadian Bank of Commerce\nPORTAGE & DONALD BRANCH\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\n13th January, 1950\n\nMr. J.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nYou will find enclosed a copy of a letter which I have just sent to Mr. Kirkby, also a cheque of $90.00 covering the plant maintenance and janitor allowance for October and November.\n\nMay I ask you to permit me a few complaints or remarks as to what that cheque implies. Firstly we feel that we are being abused by having to pay the janitor expenses for the three months ending October 31 because Mr. Kirkby told us that it should come out of the $40.00 monthly allowance for that purpose. We spent less than that doing a lot of the work ourselves. Our intentions on that subject are exposed in my letter to Mr. Kirkby. In that same letter you will note the statement made on the plant maintenance. I wish to state here that Mr. Johnstone, of Edmonton, made a special note of the plant stating it had not given satisfaction even being put to use for its purpose. It is in need of repair or expert checkup because nobody seems to know the trouble.\nMr. Kirkby was surprised to hear my statement, two weeks ago, that I had to run the plant from 8 to 15 hours every day. Mr. Kirkby thought that a two day operation every week was sufficient.\n\nTeaching: We have over 35 children registered and the ages of the children of the lower grades, mainly grades 1 & II, vary from 7 to 15. Some of them will make two grades this first year. 6 Beginners are doing a very strong Grade 1 already.\n\nNight School: Mr. McKinnon, Superintendent of Education, has witnessed, through a meeting of the Indians, of the work accomplished in that sphere. The results obtained are similar to the ones in the day school.\n\nThe Indians have been organized, by a committee of Indians, and they manage the expenses of the Xmas tree and dances held every other week. Plans have been made for next year's Xmas tree. Games have been bought and the school is the real Community centre as it was expected. All that has not prevented them to go trapping or hunting as proved by a weekly checkup.\n\nI figure that the salary mentioned by Mr. McKinnon is fair with all the work and responsibility it calls for. It is with reluctance that I return the enclosed cheque hoping that everything will be duly adjusted.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6474, file 910-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRocher River, N.W.T.,\nJanuary 23, 1950\n\nMr. I. F. Kirkby,\nSuperintendent of Indian Agencies,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\n\nDear Mr. Kirkby:\n\nI wish to notify you that I have just received a cheque of $90.00 covering the allowance for the light plant maintenance and janitor work for November and October. Nothing is mentioned for September and December, the date of Invoice or cheque being as at December 1.\n\nIt was understood, before we left for Rocher River, that the allowance of $30.00 was for the plant maintenance. Nothing was mentioned of any janitor work. I am not satisfied with the treatment I am receiving for all the work done. I am returning the $90.00 cheque to Mr. Neary with a letter stating the situation of Rocher River. I am enclosing a copy of said letter. In the meantime, I wish to let you know that I cannot work from 5 in the morning till 11 at night, and get up every 90 minutes to try to keep the building warm or as close to it as possible.\nThis continuous upkeep of the fires is absolutely necessary to keep the school opened all day. Afternoon sessions would be the only alternative.\n\nNothing has been received for the teaching done although close to 40 children are registered.\n\nAdult education seems to be of no value although results obtained vouch for the work done.\n\nShould there be no adjustment before the first of February, I regret to ask you to appoint someone to look after the plant and the janitor work. Speaking of janitor work, you told us that the sum of $40.00 per month was allowed and we went on that basis. We are not to be held responsible for the amount spent for that purpose until the end of October and shall not pay same. The sum of $60.00 was paid to Mr. G. McCullum for the upkeep of the plant for the time I was away. I wonder who should refund that amount.\n\nI sincerely hope that the matters mentioned in this letter will receive your attention and I would greatly appreciate your decision at your earliest convenience.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6474)\n\nFile 910-1, part 1\nYellowknife Agency - Rocher River Day School -\nGeneral Administration. 1948 -

Annual Report on Rocher River of the Fort Resolution Northwest Territories Agency, dated 1947-48.\n\nRocher River.\n\n42 Indian families, totalling 96 Indians live at Rocher River. The Half-Breed and white people increase the population to 140. Approximately 25 miles up the Talton River is another settlement - Rat River, where a few Indians and white trappers live. For the purpose of this report Rocher River and Rat River are considered as one settlement.\n\nRocher River is an ideal location for an Indian Village. Fishing is good and caribou are available during the open season. Fur is by no means plentiful but there is enough, including the spring rat hunt, to afford a living to an Indian who will try to support his family.\n\nIn spite of the above, and even though the Indians are Chipewyans of the same band as those at Fort Resolution and Snoudrift, Rocher River is the dirtiest and most poverty-stricken settlement in the agency. I flew into Rocher River early last June and the stench of garbage and rotting caribou hides tossed out of the front doors and along the river bank where the dogs are tied the uncleanness of the homes and the general filth of the settlement were a revelation. The place was cleaned up somewhat when I threatened prosecution under the Public Health Ordinance but probably will be just as dirty this spring.\n\nThe people at Rocher River make very little effort to support themselves and none at all to improve their conditions. During a recent visit I found caribou drying in only one house, that of the Chief, Pierre Frise. The usual routine is to sleep all morning then to loaf and play cards for the remainder of the day and all night.\n\nThese people are almost completely demoralized. I recently treated a 14 year old girl for V.D.G. and found her to be four months pregnant. Three white trappers, brothers, of Rate River have been fathers of illegitimate babies by Treaty Indian women, the youngest brother becoming a father in January of this year. Several girls have had more than one illegitimate child and several Treaty Indian women, some of them married, are living with Half-breeds in common-law status.\nThe only reason I can see for the situation at Rocher River is the influence of the white people who live in that settlement. Mr. E.R. DeMelt, a free trader and his common-law wife, Mrs. Rose Metcalfe, came to Rocher River approximately ten years ago. They run a small store and a small sawmill. In addition, Mr. DeMelt has a trapping license.\n\nThe Rocher River Indians require help, not financial assistance but mental stimulation. The natural resources could very easily sustain the population. There is no place within a hundred miles of Rocher River and Rat River which is as suitable for people living in the Indian fashion.\nExtract from annual Report on Rocher River of the Fort Resolution Northwest Territories Agency, dated 1947-48.\n\nRocher River.\n\n42 Indian families, totalling 96 Indians live at Rocher River.

Excellent progress has been made under Mr. Kellett's supervision. The framing of the school is almost completed, and the crew of men on the job were working efficiently. The school grounds have been cleared of underbrush and should be well dried out by the end of this month. A drain has been dug to the river and has successfully drained the low spots in the school grounds. The foreman reported that he was short of nails, and on my return it was arranged that these would be shipped to him at once.\n\n'sgd' Fred Fraser\n\nFred Fraser,\nDistrict Agent.\nOTTAWA, August 24, 1948.\n\nCol.

However it will be noted that prepaid transportation charges are included on this invoice and that the Company failed to forward a receipted freight bill of the carrier.

Past experience with the Department has been that they will not pay prepaid transportation costs unless the invoice is accompanied by a receipt freight bill of the carrier. However in this instance I have passed your account for payment and would request that you forward a receipted freight bill of the carrier to Col. B.F. Neary, Supt. of Education, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont., and quote this letter.

J.\nJohnston's report on building operations at Kocher River,\nN.W.T.\n\nDeputy Commissioner.\nOctober 7, 1948.\n\nR. A. Gison, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am attaching hereto for your information and advice copy of letter, dated October 6th, from District Engineer Johnston concerning the school building at Rocher River, N.W.T.\n\nYou will particularly note Mr. Johnston's statements concerning the electric generating unit and advise me in the matter. You will also note that apparently there will be no possibility of this school being used during the present winter since no furniture has arrived and the suggestion that work on the building be suspended until next spring when the work which is practicable to do this year is completed. Will you please let me have your comments on this.\n\nK. Bleis,\nChief Engineer.\n\nEncl.\nwork has been in progress on the two-classroom day school and teacher's quarters at Roche River during the present summer, and a stage of construction reached whereby the building is erected, built-up roofing placed, chimney installed and the finishing work well advanced. The hot-air heating system has also been installed. There remains incomplete the following:\n\n(a) Water supply\n(b) Plumbing\n(c) Electric lighting generating plant\n\nRegarding (a), water supply, an effort was made during the past summer, using native labour, and without obtaining an oil-digging outfit, to sink a well by hand in the hope of obtaining water. If water could have been obtained in the vicinity of the building, it would have been an advantage to the project; however, when water was not obtained at a reasonable depth, it was considered too much expense would be incurred to continue. However, the effort was abandoned. Incidentally, the well area was enlarged so as to provide storage space for vegetables, so as to obtain some benefit from the expenditure made.\n\nIt is now proposed to pipe water from the Nelson River by a water pipe contained in an insulated box carried on top of the ground. The pump and piping for this, however, will have to await delivery after opening of navigation next year. The pump itself has been purchased.\n\nWith reference to (b), Plumbing, H. Kelly & Company have delivered the materials at Fort Smith this fall and will deliver to destination and make the necessary installation next year.\n\nRegarding (c), Electric generating unit, there is attached copy of specification received from Engineering and Construction Division of the Department of Mines and Resources. When this specification was submitted to electric supply firms in this city, the response was very disappointing - three firms replying \"unable to quote\", and Canadian Railroads-Morse Limited submitting a quotation practically under protest. The gist of the objection was the phrase in the specification: \"Will run on small automatic start when a load of 100 watts is demanded, and shall continue in operation until full load drops below this value, at which time it shall automatically stop.\" The local manager of Canadian Railroads-Morse called at this office and stated that, although his firm could supply a unit fulfilling completely the specifications demanded, they were very reluctant about doing so. It was claimed that the electrical part of the generator in a fully automatic machine could, very easily, go out of commission, and should have a fully-qualified electrical man available to make repairs. If their machine were shipped to isolated points such as in the Northwest Territories, there would be no qualified electrician (and it took a particularly good one for this repair work); and their equipment would get a bad name through poor service. Likewise, this Department would be without electricity, possibly at a very critical time during the winter season with short days and the need for electric lighting. Another objection to the fully-automatic machine, from the manufacturer's point of view, is that there would be a tendency for people to neglect the generator.\n\n(OVER)\nitself, not use gas and oil when required, with the result that the engine would run dry. In view of these circumstances, the manufacturers strongly recommend cancellation of the automatic feature, and supplying a machine which is manually controlled. The price of such a manually-controlled machine is $3,538.00, f.o.b. Waterways, Alberta.\n\nThe generator, which had to be imported from the United States, would require an Import Permit; also, it was so late in the season before the situation was fully realized, that delivery could not be made by water transportation in 1948.\n\nMay I have your instructions, please, if the specifications for the generator may be amended by deleting the fully-automatic features. An order will then be placed for the supply of such a machine, to be delivered during the present fiscal year to either Edmonton or Waterways, so that it can go forward at opening of navigation early in 1949.\n\nIn a late radiogram received from Kocher River, I learn that no furniture for the classrooms, nor other necessities, have been received at Kocher River. This would presumably mean that no furniture has arrived for the teacher's quarters. Under these circumstances, I would suggest that construction proceed as far as it is practicable to do so this year without incurring unnecessary expense, and that the work be suspended until next spring. At that time, the small amount of carpenter work remaining to be done can be attended to and arrangements for the delivery of classroom furniture and supplies for the teacher's quarters. By this means, the school would probably be completed soon after the arrival of the first boat and, if the furnishings were received at the same time, classes could begin about July 15th. It is considered this information should be passed to Mr. J. W. McKinnon, Inspector of Schools for the Northwest Territories, and a spare copy of this letter is enclosed for this purpose.\n\nMay I have your instructions in the above matter, please.\n\n(Sgd) W. J. Johnston\n\nW. J. Johnston,\nDistrict Engineer.\nProvide crated, ready for freight shipment the following:\n\n1 only fully automatic diesel electric lighting plant. The engine shall be diesel compression-ignition type, capable of delivering approximately 15 H.P., at 1200 R.P.M. when burning No.1 or 2 light fuel oil. The engine shall be water cooled using pump and radiator with other type fan. The engine shall be direct connected through a semi-flexible coupling to, and mounted on the same base as, a 7k K.V.A., 120/240 volts 60 cycle single phase alternating current generator with exciter automatically controlled to give 2% regulation and mounted at end of generator shaft. Provide electric starting motor battery and automatically regulated battery charger. (The plant shall automatically start when a load of 50 watts is demanded and shall continue in operation until the load drops below this value, at which time it shall automatically stop). Provide control panel containing all automatic controls and also push button station for manual control. Provide voltmeter, ammeter frequency meter and manual reset circuit breaker. Supply automatic shutdown for low lube oil pressure, high water temperature and continual cranking on failure of engine to start on load demand. Provide 300 gallon oil storage tank for mounting outside of building on supports as directed and furnish 50 feet of 3/4\" copper (type K) pipe for oil suction line between tank and diesel engine. Provide 3/4\" bossed tapping on steel pipe nipple and brass fitting coupling for connection between 3/4\" galvanized steel nipple and 3/4\" streamline copper fuel line to diesel engine.

Johnston to the Chief Engineer of the Department of Public Works.\n\nIn this report he draws attention to two problems which have arisen with regard to:\n\n(a) Water Supply. An effort was made during the past summer, using native labour, and without bringing in a well-drilling outfit, to sink a well by hand in the hope of obtaining water. If water could have been obtained in the vicinity of the building, it would have been an advantage to the project; however, when water was not obtained at a reasonable depth, it was considered too much expense would be incurred to continue farther and the effort was abandoned. Incidentally, the well area was enlarged so as to provide storage space for vegetables, so as to obtain some benefit from the expenditure made.\n\nIt is now proposed to pipe water from the Taltson river by a water pipe contained in an insulated box carried on top of the ground. The pump and piping for this, however, will have to await delivery after opening of navigation next year. The pump itself has been purchased.\n\n(b) Electric Lighting Generating Plant. There is attached copy of specification received from Engineering and Construction Division of the Department of Mines and Resources. When this specification was submitted to electric supply firms in this city, the response was very disappointing - three\nfirms reporting \"unable to quote\", and Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Limited submitting a quotation practically under protest. The gist of the objection was the phrase in the specifications: \"The plant shall automatically start when a load of 60 watts is demanded, and shall continue in operation until the load drops below this value, at which time it shall automatically stop\". The local manager of Canadian Fairbanks-Morse called at this office and stated that, although his firm could supply a unit filling completely the specifications demanded, they were very hesitant about doing so. It was claimed that the electrical part of the generator in a fully automatic machine could, very easily, go out of commission, and should have a fully-qualified electrical man available to make repairs. If their machine were shipped to isolated points such as in the Northwest Territories, there would be no qualified electrician (and it took a particularly good one for this repair work); and their equipment would get a bad name through poor service. Likewise, this Department would be without electricity, possibly at a very critical time during the winter season with short days and the need for electric lighting. Another objection to the fully-automatic machine, from the manufacturer's point of view is that there would be a tendency for people to neglect the generator itself, not use gas and oil when required, with the result that the engine would run dry. In view of these circumstances, the manufacturers strongly recommend cancellation of the automatic feature, and supplying a machine which is manually controlled. The price of such a manually-controlled machine is $3,538.00 f.o.b. Waterways, Alberta.\n\nThe generator, which had to be imported from the United States would require an import Permit; also, it was so late in the season before the situation was fully realized, that delivery could not be made by water transportation in 1948.\n\nMay I have your instructions, please, if the specifications for the generator may be amended by deleting the fully-automatic features. An order will then be placed for the supply of such a machine, to be delivered during the present fiscal year to either Edmonton or Waterways, so that it can go forward at opening of navigation early in 1949\".\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could have the comments of your engineers on the specifications as suggested\nby Mr. Johnston for the lighting plant.\n\nActing Director.\nExtract from report from Mr. Johnston, District Engineer dated October 13th on the Rocher River Day School.\n\nRE: ROCHER RIVER.\n\nThe 2 Classroom Day School and Teachers' Quarters has been erected and has outside finish on the walls and a built-up tar and gravel roof recently completed by a roofing contractor from Edmonton. The roughing-in has been done for electricity. The hot-air furnace and heating ducts are now being installed. It was not possible for the plumbing contractor to deliver materials to destination this year, owing, in part to the lateness in which the contract was let, and also to the fact that there are only about four boats per season from Fort Smith to this point. Carpenter work has advanced to a point where three carpenters could finish by early December. Work on this project was closed down for the season on the 16th instant, largely due to the impossibility of having a generator delivered which was necessary for operation of the blower in connection with the hot-air furnace. I wrote you by letter # 2961 on October 6th, in reference to specifications calling for a fully automatic electric generating machine and the reluctance of firms to supply this unit. I am still awaiting your instructions if a manually controlled machine could be installed.\n\nSo far as I know, no desks or classroom fittings have been received at Rocher River, and there is no furniture on hand for the teachers' quarters. In fact the arrival of these fittings, furniture and so forth, at a settlement where there is little, if any, warehouse storage space, presents a problem and it is doubtful if such should be delivered until the school building is ready to receive these articles, which represent a considerable investment. It should, however, be possible to begin work next spring on the school project and have it completed early in June when the first boat arrives there. Incoming shipments of furniture, classroom supplies, fittings, rations for the teacher and so forth should be scheduled to arrive on the first boat arriving at Rocher River next year. That would permit the opening of school by July 1st if this were desired.\n\nTO REACH WATERWAYS MAY 15TH FOR FORWARDING BY HUDSON'S BAY CO.\nFT NORMAN NWT OCT 16 1100\n\nCOL B F NEARY\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH OTTAWA ONT\nREURTEL FURNITURE ROCHER RIVER SCHOOL STOP FURNITURE ARRIVED AND\nSTORED WITH MR ER DEMELT STOP PAYMENT FOR THIS ORDER PASSED\nON VOUCHER NO ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE DATED SEPT SIXTEEN\n\nL C HUNTER\nOttawa, November 3, 1948.\n\nAttention Colonel Neary\n\nRe: Two-Class Room Day School and Teacher's Quarters, Rocher River, N.W.T.\n\nAttached hereto is memorandum from Mr. R.

The bill of materials was based on oil fuel, the intention being that the necessary changes needed to burn any other fuel, would be furnished by letter, upon advice to this Division that construction of the building would be proceeded with in an area where a fuel other than oil was to be used.\n\nTo satisfy the requirements laid down by the heating design, it was necessary to have electrical energy available whenever the room temperature dropped below a pre-determined value, at any time in a 24 hour period during the heating season. To supply such a service with an alternating current type of generating unit, it is necessary that it be operated continually or that the unit be equipped with automatic controls to start the unit whenever power is required.\n\nIf we provided a continual operating source of A.C. power, it would be necessary to house the unit in a building isolated from the school to eliminate noise and it would also be advisable to\nprovide a standby unit. To keep our design in accordance with conditions laid down, it was necessary that an automatically controlled generating set be specified.\n\nWe included space on the rear of the school building to house the generator set, as it was felt that three or four short operating periods required during sleeping hours would not be a disturbing factor.\n\nThis Division is of the opinion that a 110 volt direct current storage battery electrical system would be more applicable to the site, as with this type of installation the generator set would be operated for charging purposes, only several times per week, and a supply of power would be available at all times. Due to the relatively small number of operating hours per week of this equipment, as compared with an alternating current unit, a standby generating unit is not considered a requisite. This system would also prove more economical from the standpoint of operation and maintenance.\n\nThe use of such equipment would eliminate the required automatic feature as specified, about which the manufacturers express concern because of the lack of electrical maintenance in this area in cases of breakdowns. We do not recommend a manually controlled A.C. set without a standby because it would, in all probability be run continually to furnish power as required for heating and lighting and the availability of maintenance service would be questionable.\n\nIt will be necessary to prepare new electrical drawings and bill of materials as well as specifications for electrical power plant if the above suggestions are adopted. Electrical equipment used in the heating system will have to be specified to suit the direct current power supply, as at present the equipment specified is based on a power source of 110/220 volts A.C.\n\nThe above suggestions are contrary to the decisions reached in this matter as outlined in Mr. Lamberton's memorandum, but we believe this system is better suited to the conditions than an alternating current installation and would prove more reliable than the manually controlled A.C. generating unit suggested by Mr. W. J. Johnston.\n\nWe have no information in connection with the progress of the construction and assume that the wiring changes necessary to convert from 3 wire 110/220 volt A.C. to 2 wire 110 volt D.C. and arrangements for the provision of different types of lighting fixtures can be made.\n\nT.

As this furniture was ordered from the Robert Simpson Company and the T. Eaton Company in early July, we felt that it should have arrived at Rocher River by now. Therefore, an army message was sent to Mr. Indian Superintendent Hunter at Fort Norman. We have now received a reply from him stating that the furniture has arrived and is stored with Mr. E.R. Demelt. Would you please advise Mr. Johnston accordingly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\n\nBFN/HM.\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\nMarch 16, 1949.\n\nEducation Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. Phillip Ibelan,\n\nRe: Purchase Order #37742\nDated January 17, 1949.\n\nReference the above and your circular letter requesting that the account covering the cost of goods on this purchase order be submitted. I wish to advise that this covers the purchase of desks for the Roche River Indian Day School, from Vilas Furniture Company Limited, Cowansville, Quebec, which are to be shipped via the Northern Transportation Company on the opening of the navigation season.\n\nAs these desks cannot possibly arrive at Roche River before June 1949, I am holding the matter in abeyance pending receipt of invoice from Vilas Furniture Company and also word that the desks have arrived at their destination.\n\nL. C. Hunter,\nSuperintendent.\n30th March, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nRe: Purchase Order 37749\n\nThe above covers the cost of desks in the amount of $605.90 being shipped to the Roche River School. The desks cannot be shipped until navigation opens, and consequently, I would appreciate it if you would transfer the amount mentioned above to the 1949-50 appropriation, and release the same amount in the 1948-49 appropriation.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\nI am replying to your letters of December 23rd, 1948 and February 16th, 1949 in reference to electrical power to be supplied at school at Roher River, N.W.T.\n\nAttached to letter of December 23rd was a memorandum prepared by T.E. Mills, Chief Engineer, Engineering and Construction Division, Department of Mines and Resources. Mr. Mills recommended that a direct current generating unit be supplied rather than the Alternating Current automatically controlled unit which had been earlier recommended.\n\nAttached hereto is a cost estimate for a direct current power plant for Roher River. This estimate has been prepared by Mr. J.E. Kellett of this office.\n\nWhen the decision is made to change from alternating current to direct current, it will be impossible to provide but very space, and also space for the direct current machinery, in the school building itself. It is thus necessary to take advantage of a warehouse building which was constructed for general storage, and to remodel same to house the direct current batteries and machinery.\n\nThe cost for a direct current set with batteries, as per attached estimate, is $6,222.29 for the purchase of equipment and its installation in the building at Roher River, ready to function. The life of batteries in a direct current installation is 360 chargings.\n\nBy comparison, I am attaching estimate herewith for the cost of the alternating current unit it was originally intended to install, namely:\n\nCost of Unit, f.o.b., Waterways $3,997.00\nSales Tax, 5% on $3,997.00 219.75\nFreight, Waterways to Roher River 50.00\n\nCost of Installation:\nLabour $100.00\nOne Air Fare (Edmonton, Roher River, return) 270.00 270.00\n\n$4,726.75\n\nCALL FOR QUOTATIONS FOR DIRECT CURRENT UNIT:\n\nCall for quotations for the materials and equipment for a direct current installation including batteries, was made to six firms. Appendix \"A\" attached, gives a list of the firms asked to tender, and the results therefrom:\n\nMumford Medland Limited of Winnipeg, Manitoba, (a re-organization of Firm now bears the name of Medland Machinery Limited) submitted the lowest bid of $4,635.00. However, they quoted on a battery of only 250 ampere hours, and required six months' notice before delivery could be guaranteed.\n\n(over)\nThe next highest tender was received from Bruce Robinson Electric Limited of Edmonton for $4,758.00. This firm quoted on a 450 ampere hour battery and promised delivery in from three to four weeks from receipt of order. I therefore recommend acceptance of the tender of Bruce Robinson Electric Limited for a price of $4,758.00 f.o.b., Waterways, Sales Tax included. This firm promise delivery in from three to four weeks and it is necessary to have shipment so forward from Waterways early in the season. I would therefore ask that I be notified by telegram as soon as approval is given for this purchase.\n\nThe original tender as obtained from Bruce Robinson Limited is attached hereto. I do not consider it necessary to send all the other tenders received, but these are on file here.\n\n**CITATION OF DIRECT CURRENT AND ALTERNATING CURRENT UNITS:**\n\nYou will note from the above, that the D.C. Unit costs $8,822.29 as against $4,758.76 for an A.C. Unit. However, I believe it is the feeling in Ottawa that the lower maintenance costs of a direct current installation would more than pay the initial capital expense. That is a matter of electrical maintenance economics which I do not care to enter into, and am not thus expressing any opinion; In other words, the decision to switch from an alternating current to a direct current installation was made in Ottawa. Thus my recommendation for the purchase of a direct current installation and the acceptance of Bruce Robinson Electric Tender for $4,408.00 is only following out the decision handed me, to install a direct current machine.\n\n(Sgd.)

Johnston, District Engineer\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Lighting Plant specifications for Roche River School\n\nWe appreciate the opportunity of quoting on equipment for the above school and feel confident that the plant and battery specified below will give you the most trouble-free service, economical operation and requiring the least attention.\n\nThe Lister diesel engine has established itself in the North as a most sturdy piece of equipment and if service parts are required at any time they can be procured immediately from our Edmonton stock.\n\nWe agree to supply, f.o.b. Waterways, and crated for water transportation, the following -\n\n1 only Diesel electric lighting plant consisting of the following -\n\n1 20 H.P. two cylinder Lister diesel radiator-cooled engine operating at 1200 r.p.m.\n\nThis engine is full diesel, cold starting battery cranking and has a dual compression patented cylinder head, and the famous patented chromium lined sleeves, giving 400% greater life than Nitrogen hardened sleeves. The engine would also be equipped with filter, and low oil pressure cut off.\nThe engine is mounted on a steel base, together with a 12.5 K.W. 140 volt shunt wound Marble-Card generator, direct connected to the flywheel through a flexible coupling. This generator is equipped with interference eliminators, ball bearings, interpoles, and a rheostat for varying the charging rate to the batteries.\n\nThe switchboard would include volt meter, ammeter, service switch, reverse current relay, starting switch and rheostat.\n\nThe batteries would be of the Hart manufacture, 450 ampere hour capacity with glass wound separators, 1220 specific gravity acid and having a weight of 2250 lbs.\n\nWe would also supply the following -\n\n1 60 gallon steel fuel tank\n1 Fuel tank stand\n50' 3/4\" copper tubing and necessary fittings between the tank and engine pump\n10' 2\u00bd\" exhaust pipe and muffler\n8 Foundation bolts\nNecessary wiring between plant, switchboard and battery\n1 set maintenance tools\n1 set instructions\n\nF.O.B. Waterways for the sum of $4,798.00\nThe above equipment is guaranteed to be of the best obtainable and is further guaranteed to be free from defects in workmanship and material.\n\nAll equipment except the generator is available from stock, and in answer to a telegram enquiry, the generator could be shipped from St. Paul, Minnesota, within four weeks from receipt of order.\n\nAny variation from your recommendation and the capacity of batteries quoted would be adjusted upon advice from you as to the capacity desired.\n\nTrusting that we may have the privilege of serving you, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBRUCE ROBINSON ELECTRIC LTD.\n\n(Sgd.) A. McMullin\nSales Manager\nColonel Henry:\n\nElectric plants for N.W.T. Schools:\n\nIn his memo of Nov. 5, 1948 Mr. Mills says that the D.C. plant is to be housed in the school. Mr. Johnson in para 4 of his letter of April 6 says that the space is inadequate and an outside building must be used.\n\nThis point should be settled as it affects the provision of additional space at the four other schools.\n\nC.A.F. Clark\n\n12/24\n\n1. Extension could have been made to main block.\n2. Might still be made in later years. Meanwhile,\n3. Batteries might be housed in school and a small outbuilding used.\n\nEstimate for D.C. plant should be\n\nSet with batteries $4,798.00\nfreight (C) $774.29\nHousing $100\nTune-up $370\nTotal $6,042.29\n\n+ freight\n\nAmount to complete school $20,500\n\nHow was it calculated (1-1-5 NWT)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6474, file 910-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 1, 1949.\n\nDear Colonel Anderson:\n\nRocher River Indian Day School.\n\nThe Director of the Lands and Development Services Branch has forwarded to me a copy of the letter which you received from Mr. W.J. Johnston, your District Engineer in Edmonton, dated April 6, 1949, concerning the provision of an electrical generator for the above school.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to the provision of either a direct current unit or an alternating current generator. Although the direct current unit is more expensive to purchase originally than the alternating current generator, we feel that in the important matter of operating costs, the direct current unit will prove to be not only less expensive but also easier to maintain. We note that the estimate for the D.C. plant should be only $4,798, as this apparently includes the set with the batteries. It is presumed that the tender of Bruce Robinson Electric Limited of Edmonton is the one Mr. Johnston is favouring in view of the promise of delivery within three or four weeks.\n\nIf this is the case, then his cost estimate of a D.C. power plant would seem to be much higher than the actual cost of the unit agreed on by this firm. His estimate is for $6,500 for the plant, whereas the actual cost is $2,000 less.\n\nWe also feel that the extension necessary for the housing of the D.C. plant could have been made to the main building. However, we note that this is not now convenient, and that he intends to convert the warehouse previously constructed.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector.\n\nColonel A.A.

J. Johnston concerning an order for the oil supplies for the D.C. Generating set at Rocher River, N.W.T.\n\nEVG/S.\n\nR. Blais\nChief Engineer.\nI refer to my telegram of July 26th and your telegram of July 27th in reference to purchase of Diesel oil and necessary lubricants for electric light plant at Roche River, N.W.T.\n\nThe reason I telegraphed you was to find out for sure if I should order this material, as Indian Affairs Branch had ordered the firewood for the wood-burning furnace. Roche River was the only place where a wood-burning furnace was installed, and all other schools burn oil. Thus there was no chance that when Indian Affairs Branch were ordering the firewood for the furnace they might also be ordering the oil supplies for the Direct Current Electric Generating set.\n\nYour letter of December 22nd, 1948, gave instructions that oil for the first year's supply should be considered a charge against the construction programme. Thus from this letter I had the authority to make the purchase, but wanted to be positive there was no chance of duplication in ordering.\n\nThe amount of the order placed is $699.67, f.o.b., Waterways, Alberta, and freight and handling charges on same may bring the total purchase to $1,000 when delivered at school at Roche River.\n\nWork was suspended on the school on July 31st but there are still some unfinished items of carpenter work remaining to be done due, in part, to the non-arrival of necessary hardware. Some ten days' work of a workman would complete the phase of the project. The Electric Generating set, although delivered and installed, is not fully operating possibly through unfamiliarity of the workmen sent in to set up this unit. I am having this matter checked on further when a starting motor arrives and some small expense will be required further, to complete this installation.\n\nI shall let you know shortly if I require extra funds for the purchase of the Diesel oil and lubricants.\n\nI am writing L.C. Hunter, Superintendent of Indian Agencies Fort Norman, sending a copy of the Purchase Requisition placed for the several grades of oil and lubricants. This will both advise him that the purchase has been made and also serve as a sample or types of oil and lubricants required for the D.C. Generating set when re-ordering of materials is necessary next year.\n\nI would suggest this letter be drawn to the attention of Col. B.F. Henry, Department of Education, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nW.J. Johnston\nDistrict Engineer.\n\nP.S. I presume the teachers at the various points where oil is being supplied are being instructed to apply for the refund on deposit which is available when empty steel drums are returned. The return will not be possible until next year.\nAugust 15, 1949.\n\nMr. W. J. Johnston,\nDistrict Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\n9937 - 103rd Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nRocher River Indian Day School.\n\nDear Mr. Johnston:\n\nYour report of July 28 was forwarded here by your Department. We have appointed a man and his wife as teachers at this school. I am quite certain that he will be able to operate the electric generating set as he has had considerable experience previously in the North. Mr. Blackburn and his wife are leaving Edmonton on August 20 and I will get him to see you in Edmonton before he proceeds north. You can then arrange to discuss with him your plans for sending in a workman when the starting motor arrives.\n\nI am pleased to note that you have sent Mr. Hunter a copy of your purchase requisition so that he will be aware of the types of fuel required for his schools next year.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. L. C. Hunter\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6474, file 910-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAugust 8, 1949\n\nMemorandum\n\nCol. E.F. Neary  \nSuperintendent, Education Service  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nFor your information we are forwarding to you herewith a copy of a report received from Mr. Fred Fraser, District Administrator, Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, relating to the school plant at Rocher River, Northwest Territories.\n\nDeputy Commissioner\nMr. W. J. Johnston,\nDistrict Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\n9357 - 103rd Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Johnston:\n\nI was at Kocher River on the 28th of July last and left the package of filters which you sent for the lighting plant for the school.\n\nGeorge McCallum is acting as caretaker as you know. He appears capable and has a sense of responsibility.\n\nI have the following comments to make about the building:\n\nLiving Quarters\n\nBathroom--The linoleum has not been laid although there is some available. The vent pipe for the plumbing fixtures passes through the floor and the ceiling and is open to view. It should be painted. The holes in the floor and ceiling were cut much too large and should be covered up with some kind of trim as they are very unsightly.\n\nLiving Room--There is a vent pipe that passes through this room which is open to view and should be painted. The holes through the floor and ceiling were very roughly cut and should be filled in or trimmed since a bad draft will come through them.\n\nThe hall and stairway from the lower floor to the living quarters, including all trim and doors, have been left unpainted.\n\nSouth Bathrooms--There is a vent pipe open to view here also which should be painted. The holes in the floor and ceiling here too are much too large and should be filled in or trimmed.\n\nDownstairs\n\nThe storeroom for school supplies, including the ceiling, should be painted. The school furniture is lying scattered around the rooms partly assembled. Assembling of the furniture should be completed. Furniture and supplies now stored with the Hudson's Bay Company and Mr. Defelt should be delivered to the school. The sliding doors were not installed properly and if an attempt is made to open them, they are more than likely to fall over and tear loose from the hinges. This should be investigated and the proper work carried out. Evidently some mistake was made in wiring the school and when the lighting switches were being tested, it was found that the hall lights did not operate. It was then necessary to cut a hole in the ceiling of the hall and this has been left uncovered. Possibly there was not sufficient plaster board left over to make a repair although something should certainly be done about it.\n\nPower Plant Building\n\nThere was apparently not sufficient asbestos siding to complete two sides of this building. The interior should be painted. Has no arrangement been made for a stove for this building? If it is not properly heated, the batteries will freeze and the lighting plant will be of no use.\nThis is a Lister lighting plant than which there are none better made. A special arrangement is provided on this plant for starting the engine by throwing a switch which turns the generator into a motor; the current from the batteries turns the generator over and starts the engine. The wiring of this part has evidently been done wrong, because, when the switch is thrown the motor does not turn over and the battery terminals heat up so much that there is danger of their melting. Apparently the batteries are just shorting the current going to the motor. The electrician who did the job stated that he knew nothing whatever about this class of work. Although the engine is not difficult to start by hand, it requires two men to do so and I do not think the plant should be left as it is.\n\nYou should be sure that the watchman or caretaker has adequate instruction in the running of this plant. An ample supply of distilled water for refilling the batteries should be on hand as well as proper grade of lubricating oil for the machine. I would strongly recommend that a man completely familiar with the maintenance and operation of this plant be sent in to properly instruct the caretaker, otherwise we are liable to have the machine out of repair and this will entail heavy expense.\n\nThere is a small warehouse at the rear of the school in which is stored a certain amount of surplus material from construction. There is a considerable pile of other material including lumber, bricks and fencing lying outside which will disappear if not properly stored. I think there is room in the building for it and arrangements should also be made to look after it properly.\n\nThe school yard has been left littered with scrap ends of lumber and all of the miscellaneous left-over building materials. It is very unsightly and I certainly think it is the responsibility of your department, in constructing buildings, to clean up before you leave.\n\nI am writing to our Head Office asking that proper arrangements be made for the employment of a caretaker.\n\nYours truly,\n\n'sgi' Fred Fraser\n\nFred Fraser,\nDistrict Administrator.\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS, CANADA\n\n9937 - 103 Street,\nEDMONTON, Alberta.\n\nAugust 26, 1949.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nYour file reference: 910-5\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am replying to your letter of August 15th, advising that Mr. Blackburn and his wife were leaving Edmonton on August 20th for Rocher River. Actually Mr. and Mrs. Blackburn only arrived in Edmonton today and, according to present arrangements, are expected to arrive at Rocher River on September 1st. I have arranged the various train and airplane reservations for them via Fort Smith, N.W.T., and feel there will be no difficulty in their arrival.\n\nThe D.C. electric generating plant is not working satisfactorily, and the manufacturer's agents here of this plant have promised to send a representative to Rocher River to inspect it and put it in first-class running order. I am delaying the arrival of this mechanic until after Mr. and Mrs. Blackburn have arrived at Rocher River, in order that Mr. Blackburn may receive first-hand instructions.\n\nMr. Blackburn showed me a letter you had written him, and I gather it is the intention for Mr. Blackburn to assume the responsibility for the maintenance and operation of this D.C. electric generating plant. A man is presently looking after this unit and performing general watchman and janitor services while the building is unoccupied, but I am leaving the final permanent arrangements to be worked out by Mr. Blackburn after his arrival. I have also contacted the engineer of this Department at Yellowknife to discuss the matter with Mr. I. F. Kirkby of Indian Affairs Branch, Yellowknife. It is my understanding that the permanent arrangement regarding janitor services and a maintenance man for electric generating plant,\n\n(OVER)\nelectrically controlled hot-air furnace and so forth, should be arranged for by Indian Affairs. However, any assistance possible the Public Works Department can give in effecting a smooth changeover from construction to maintenance, should be attempted, and we are trying to operate on this policy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. J. Johnston,\nDISTRICT ENGINEER.\ncopy sent Mr. Kirkby.\n\nSeptember 6, 1949.\n\nMr. W.J. Johnston,\nDistrict Engineer,\n937 - 103 Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nRocher River\nReference your 2064 of August 26\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of August 26th and wish to express my thanks for your action in assisting with train and aeroplane reservations.\n\nI am pleased to note your action with regard to the mechanics for the electric generating plant. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Kirkby in Yellowknife.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMr. B.F. Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached please find Requisitions covering janitor supplies, noon lunch requirements and wood needed for the school term beginning Sept. 6th, 1949.\n\nAs at Hay River I do not believe that any of these items have been ordered and they are all urgently needed to start the school in operation. Items of supplies that are needed immediately will be purchased locally at the store until such time as the above order arrives.\n\nThe order if shipped immediately should be in time to catch the last boat of the Hudson's Bay into Rocher River this fall before freeze up. If not the shipment could be sent by boat as far as Fot Smith c/o Fred Fraser District Administrator and sent to Rocher River in small quantities whenever the Mines and Resources plane was making a trip to Yellowknife or other point in the North. In this way items could be put into a very out-of-the-way place at no extra cost. Most of the items with the exception of soap are not stocked at Rocher River and we must ship them in.\n\nThe cook stove at Rocher River is a wood burner and takes a fourteen inch stick. As all the wood in the yard is in four foot lengths for the furnace it will either be necessary to re-cut the wood or have a supply of cookstove wood brought in from the woods. If we cut the furnace wood up we may run short and be required to get more cut during the winter. As we will need wood for another season in any case I believe it would be more economical to have the wood cut and delivered directly as cook stove wood. I therefore request authority to cut ten cords stove wood at a cost of approx. $25.00 per cord.\n\nThe furniture and kitchen utensils supplied at this school is very skimpy and as at Hay River I believe we should put in a complete unit of standard equipment. I believe Mr. Martin was asked to submit a list and although he does not know what the list contained it is reasonable to expect that Rocher River should get the same. When I inspected the school last week it was noted that no dishes nor cutlery was delivered but that pots and pans had come. As the stores at Rocher do not stock dishes etc., it will be necessary to either ship them in by air immediately or purchase locally at Yellowknife and take them into the school first chance we have. Will it be in order for me to make these purchases or will it come from Edmonton.\n\nNo water system has as yet been installed but the Public works are to complete next summer and in the mean time enough old barrels can be found to hold water hauled from the river.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F.

As this trip was made just after the opening of the school term I believe it worth while to report on my observations at each point.\n\nOn September 14th proceeded to Roher River with Agency boat. This school had opened for the first time on September the 6th, and was progressing very favourably. The day I attended this school 33 pupils were in attendance and a few more were expected to come in. For the most part this number or possibly a few more will be the limit. Some of these children will move out with their parents for the winter hunt but I believe well over 25 will be in attendance at all times.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education was contacted and permission to construct a limited number of tables and benches to accommodate the extra pupils was obtained. These tables were to be so constructed that they can be used as ping-pong tables in a games room once more desks are obtained.\n\nA large number, if not all the natives at this settlement are in the settlement for the greater part of the summer and now that we have a welfare teacher at this point, I believe we should encourage gardening, etc., if we are to improve the welfare of these natives. Mr. & Mrs. Blackburn are very enthusiastic about doing just this work and as we have a tractor at Resolution, I will have it taken to Roher River and plow up a section of the school yard as well as an area for communal gardens. It is my understanding that this type of work is part of the Welfare teachers job and in this country the first requirement is to improve the Indians standard of living by better methods of obtaining his food and clothing. A request for rakes and hoes for the spring gardening was noted and is on attached requisition.\n\nAs to Mr. Blackburn's status, it is obvious that he expects\nto be second teacher when there are over 30 pupils and wants to hire a man to haul water, carry in wood and do the janitor jobs. I understood that Mr. Blackburn was to look after the school and we were not going to hire a janitor. From my talks with him I gathered that he felt that the teaching of the extra pupils and the night classes he took made it impossible to do the janitor work. As Mrs. Blackburn is the welfare teacher, I thought it was her place to teach the older persons and to contact the Indians in the settlement.\n\nBoth these people seem enthusiastic and should, I hope, help to make Roche River a better place for the Indians. I would at the same time like to know whether we are to hire the services of an extra man as janitor. I cannot see how two teachers on full time pay are needed to teach 30 pupils, but can be corrected.\n\nI have seen enormous progress at all the schools since last term and I believe we can look forward with confidence to the results that will be obtained from the new type of school in the Northwest Territories.\n\n(Sgd.)

Neary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe have for the short time the Rocher River school has been in operation been having constant trouble with the light plant as supplied for this school. The last power failure being when one battery post was burned off.\n\nAs it was necessary for me to make a trip into this Settlement I had Mr. W. Smith of Yellowknife Electric go in to give the plant a check before any more damage was done. When we examined the plant we found the following defects that were due to faulty installation and nothing else.\n\n(a) All battery cells were set up and the posts still had paint and dirt from packing still on them.\n(b) All connectors were dirty some with paper still on and all had been coated with vaseline before being fastened to cell post.\n(c) Five cells in the middle of the bank were reversed so that we had 90 volts instead of 112 volts.\n(d) With low voltage the points of the reverse relay cut-out were fused and were fixed until new arrive.\n(e) Several cell posts had started to burn but after cleaning were servicable.\n\nWith cells set up and no paint or dirt removed from post and with the addition of vaseline between post and connector a resistance was set up that burned off the one post and started to burn several others. The posts were all cleaned and connected. Several iron bolts were used in place of lead and copper ones. One afternoon was spent cleaning up battery bank.\n\nFive cells were put in backwards and this reduced voltage to 90 volts. This was corrected and the fact that the plant was not in operation was all that saved these five cells from being ruined. It appeared as though these cells are still good but will report on them later if they do not hold charge.\n\nWith the low voltage at the cut out when starting and stopping the points were almost completely burned off and were fixed for the present until new ones are sent in. These points fused and would not cut out the first time we tried the motor after the battery bank was cleaned and put in operation.\n\nThe new cell has not arrived at Rocher River at the present time but I picked up the burned cell and will forward to you from Yellowknife, this will enable you to get it before it would have been available through Ft. Smith.\n\nPlease send in the following parts to me at Yellowknife so that I can take them into Rocher River on my next trip in.\n\n6 Battery connector strips, to replace burned out ones.\n6 Battery post bolts & nuts, Lead & copper. For connecting end cells to line etc.\n12 Lugs for line wire and cross connection.\n\n1 Set, Reverse Current Relay Points., No name on panel board but presume you know the type. Possibly one complete cutout would be better and we can return old one to you.\nI believe that this information covers the defects that have been encountered so far and I might add that since returning to Yellowknife I received a wire from the Teacher at Roche River stating that the plant was operating very satisfactorily and all the troubles seemed to be eliminated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F.

F. Kirkby,\nSupt of Indian Agencies\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\nOctober 18th, 1949.\n\nMr. B.F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 14th., file 910-5 (El) regarding the three Radiograms listed on my Voucher No. 148 I have the following explanation.\n\nWhen the Blackburns arrived at Roche River there was no sign of mess supplies nor their baggage and in the confusion they wired, first to Waterways about their baggage to make sure that it arrived at Ft. Smith in time to be picked up by the Mines and Resources Plane.\n\nWhen no order could be found covering rations for the coming winter they wired someone in Edmonton to send in an order and then when the Invoice arrived for their ration they had to send a wire to cancel the first one.\n\nI presume that these were moving in expenses and as such were charged against the Branch. It may be that these items should have been charged against Mrs. Blackburn's travelling expenses and not on the account that I rendered.\n\nIf the above three wires are considered a charge against Mrs. Blackburn and not payable by the Indian Affairs Branch I will advise the Blackburns accordingly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nI.F. Kirkby\nSuperintendent.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOctober 25th, 1949.\n\nMr. I.F. Kirkby,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\n\nRe: Voucher No. 151 issued in favour of Hudson's Bay Company,\nPurchase Order 45586\n\nThe above Voucher was issued in an amount of $581.00 in favour of the Hudson's Bay Company. The following amounts have been deducted:\n\n(1) $3.44 for Marine Insurance.\n\n(2) $12.49 for freight to Waterways.\n\nIf the Company reviews the Purchase Order, on which the goods were ordered, it will be noted that the prices quoted read \"F.O.B.

Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFreeze up on the lake was late this year and it has only been within the last week that we could fly from the North side of the lake to the south shore. I made a trip into Rocher River yesterday and can make the following report on this school.\n\nThe heating of this school is very unsatisfactory and it is almost impossible to keep the class rooms warm enough to even stay in them for an hour at a time. The forced air does not seem to be working at top performance and I will write Mr. W.J. Johnston of Dept. of Public Works to see if he can suggest anything. The furnace jacket itself was too hot to put ones hand on it but little heat seemed to get into the rooms. The floors are too cold to put your hand on them and in all the wash rooms the water in the barrels is freezing and any water spilled on the floors freezes at once. With this wood furnace the heat is there because the jacket and duct for some distance is hot but if we cannot find the trouble there is no way of keeping the school warm once it gets down to fifty or sixty below.\n\nAt this point the Dept. of Public Works left many small things undone when they left with the understanding that they were to return next summer to complete the painting, put in the water system and complete the floors. Here as well as at Hay River there is no water except what is hauled from the river and all that can be heated to wash the floors is what can be heated on the small cook stove in the teachers residence. This makes it impossible to scrub floors when it would take several pails to do the job. The water would also freeze to the floor before it could be wiped up. Mr. W.J. Johnston stated that these hardwood floors should not be scrubbed if possible.\n\nMr. McKinnon complained about the dirt but as we do not have polishers or wakers at this point, not is the varnish jobs completed it is much exaggerated. The Ft. Smith and the Yellowknife schools are held up as examples but the point that at these points the schools have been going for some years, power and power polishers have always been used, running hot water can be had by turning a tap and the local conditions of pure sand or gravel make untold differences. I know that the Administration schools are being held up as such good examples and how poor the Indian Affairs are but once we have been in operation as long as the others we will be just as good or possibly a little better when we take into account the type of workmanship that went into some of our buildings.\n\nThe furniture at Rocher River is very skimpy and it is very poor in quality as compared to the Administration school of the same type at Resolution that just opened up. I realize better than some of our critics that we cannot get supplies into Rocher River except during the summer and we must therefore make the best of what we have. I am enclosing\na list of items that were ordered from Eaton's catalogue and which should be sent into Roche River next summer. The teacher will no doubt change from time to time and we should not have to move any furniture for them but supply it all. I feel that a washing machine is a must and that it should be used in her Welfare work if need be. The refrigerator is also needed as one was supplied in the new Administration school at Resolution.\n\nThe Blackburn's are using boxes to add to their book shelf space and also for many other purposes. I have enclosed a list of what is supplied and though it is meager I believe that the Teacher understands the problem at Roche River and that it will be remedied next summer. Here again I feel that once we have furnished the residence that so long as we are sure that the building and contents are being maintained in good condition then the residence is the man's own home. He is paying rent for it and officials should not barge through every or any room except by permission.\n\nMr. Blackburn is to do all the janitor work and look after the maintenance of the light plant as well as to assist with the Welfare work of the community. Mr. Blackburn will not run the light plant himself but as he is paid for this work then he can pay another party to do the job and we only have to hold Blackburn responsible.\n\nThe water and wood must be hauled for some little distance and I have authorized him to hire an Indian to do the job. This work must be done by dog team and cannot be expected of the man.\n\nAt Roche River we have two factions, one the Hudson's Bay trader and the other a free trader. In between there is a group of no good white trash who are dead beats anywhere. To establish a school board of this type of person down in a community such as this will only give the teacher untold grief. None of the whites are out of the feeding, which is in no uncertain terms and the Bay Manager is just as much a part of the whole thing as any one else. Even the Police dislike going to Roche River because all one hears is a long series of fantastic tales about one party when he visits one store and then hears equally as fantastic from the other store when he visits it. To make the teacher responsible to any of these individuals would be to drive him out by the first plane.\n\nThe above probably does not interest you but it is one of my objections to having a trustee out of the Roche River whites appointed. If these people were a little more interested in the school and incidently the Indians than they are about their own fairy tales, which do cause plenty of trouble then I would be in favor of a trustee but not the way things stand. A trustee from any section of the Roche River whites would be a stool pigeon who would haunt the teacher day and night.\n\nI feel the school work is progressing very favorably and the Indians seem only too willing to attend. There is no trouble with them and all social activities are very orderly and very well attended by these people. The only ones who do not seem to know their places are some of the whites who as in most places have been the real offenders where it comes to bringing alcohol to the Indians. I think this is answering a long felt need in Roche River and if the Teacher can be kept out of the petty jealousy that exists then we need not worry about the final outcome being a success.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F.

For the wires it was not possible to determine the causes so while in Roche last week I made an examination of the heating unit and have the following report to make.\n\nThe class rooms and all the cloak rooms did not have circulation enough to be able to keep them either warm enough for classes or, in some cases, above freezing. The floors of the class rooms were too cold to hold your hand on for any length of time and the blackboards at the far end of the room were cold at all times. In the wash rooms and the cloak room halls it was impossible to raise the temperature above the freezing point and there was over an inch of ice on the water barrels and any water that spilled on the floors froze at once.\n\nI checked the furnace itself and as the wood burned at this point is fire killed spruce and jack pine there was an abundance of heat right at the furnace. I have been assured that fires are kept on all day and that at night fires are stoked up at ten or eleven and started again at four in the morning. I do not believe that the fault lies with the fires in the furnace but in the air circulating system.\n\nI went to all registers and, for the amount of fire, there was not the amount of hot air coming through that should have been. I did not have any heating plant and some registers in unused rooms were closed off to try and get heat into the class rooms but even there the heat was limited. The hot air seemed to be available at many registers but the cold air would not return to the furnace.\n\nThe furnace hot air jacket was too hot to put one's hand on and the hot air duct the full length of the furnace room was hot. From this I would presume that there could be some obstruction in the cold or hot air ducts or that the circulating fan is running too slow. I am sure now that the trouble does not lie in the wood burner itself.\n\nAs no circulation seemed possible before the teacher opened the class room door and the door between the hall and the furnace room, this put two doors opposite open and then they took the back of the air conditioner off exposing the fan. In this way the cold air return was through the doors and not though the cold air return. This had been done the day before I was there and this was the warmest the school had been for weeks. I felt that the cold air return must be faulty but I could not say where. The above arrangement does get heat into the class rooms but all the other cloak rooms and halls are below freezing.\n\nOn the day before I checked Roche River I went into\nFt. Resolution and here the class rooms and all the building was too hot for comfort even though the furnace was not on full. When standing out in the centre of the class rooms one could feel the hot air blowing in his face while at Roche River even with your face right up to the register there wasn't as much heat coming out.\n\nThere is no reason why the wood furnace should not give out as much heat as the oil burner and if the installation of all ducts were the same in both schools I believe the same heat should be available. We have no Engineer nor anyone who knows the first thing about it at Roche River, therefore it will be necessary to take a man from here if I can get one.\n\nIf you can suggest any remedies that might be applied to this unit we will try them out as it is not going to be possible to operate this building once the weather drops below -40 below without some changes.\n\nAt the present time Mr. MacCallum checks the light plant and does a few odd jobs around but from what I have seen of him I am sure that he would deliberately prevent it from working and I do not believe he is capable of doing any repair work of any importance for us. Some of the trouble might be eliminated if one were to experiment with the system, but as no one in Roche has any ideas or is of any help I feel an Engineer should spend a couple of days in this school when the weather is below -40 degrees and then he can either correct the faults or give an accurate report on why the system does not work, something that no one knows now.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. B.F. Neary our Supt. of Education and if you feel that you can offer any explanations he will be pleased to hear from you direct.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.V. Kirby.\nI. F.

With this poor janitor service the heating equipment often fails and any type of water extinguisher freezes, rendering it useless.\n\nWe have a large light plant and also a large furnace at this point and I request authority to purchase two fool proof extinguishers of the Ansul type, one for the engine room and one for the furnace room. Also two Pyrene extinguishers as stand-by for the same rooms. The local price on the small Ansul type is $38.25 and the large $92.50.\n\nBoth these types are not effected by freezing and should be provided at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI. F.

I note your suggestion that we communicate with Bruce Robinson Electric Company with regard to the installation of this plant. This building was erected for us under the direction of the Public Works Department and we were not informed regarding the firm who supplied the lighting plant. I suggest that you correspond with the Public Works engineer Mr. Johnston, whose office is in Edmonton, and supply him with a report regarding your visit to the school. You should explain to him that you consider the difficulty in operating the lighting plant was due to faulty installation rather than faulty maintenance. He will then be in a position to check up the matter with the firm. In the meantime the account is being paid.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nYellowknife, N. W. T.\nJanuary 21st, 1950\n\nB. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince commencement of operation of the Rocher River School light plant much difficulty has been experienced in the operation and early in October I made a trip into this school with Mr. Will Smith, Manager of the Yellowknife Power Company and many of our difficulties were found to be due to faulty installation. I wrote Bruce Robinson Electric on Oct 13th, my file #139-6-1, Rocher River and explained all the faults found, copy of this letter was sent to you at that time.\n\nAt the time it was thought that the low voltage had only burned the relay points but this unit has never worked since and later was found to be completely burned out. I wired Bruce Robinson for a new part and this is covered in Voucher #315. I believe this repair was necessary through faulty installation and not faulty maintenance and should be supplied free by the supplier of the equipment. If you feel this is the case will you please contact Bruce Robinson Electric Ltd. before making payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI. F. Kirkby,\nSupt of Indian Agencies\nOttawa, January 25, 1950.\n\nTeacher Mrs. J.E. Blackburn,\nAddress Roche River, N.W.T.,\nSchool Roche River Indian Day\n\nRATIONS - INDIAN DAY SCHOOL TEACHERS\n\nAt some of the settlements in the Northwest Territories the assortment of groceries and provisions available for purchase is rather limited. In many cases, the stocks are meagre and there is little variety in the items offered.\n\nTo overcome this situation and as a measure of assistance to the teachers, arrangements have been made with the Hudson's Bay Company to have requisitions for rations filled at Edmonton and shipped directly to the individual teacher.\n\nThe Nutrition Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare has prepared a ration list of the items required for one person living for one year in the North. We have secured approximate prices as quoted by the Hudson's Bay Company in Edmonton. Attached is this list, with the prices, of course, being subject to variation.\n\nOn the basis of this list the teacher may then prepare an order and forward same to this office. We will then place the order with a wholesale grocery firm in Edmonton and the items will be shipped by water transportation. The cost at wholesale price of the rations purchased in this manner on behalf of the teacher, together with transportation charges on same, will be deducted on a monthly basis from the living allowance paid to northern employees of the Department. The maximum that can be deducted from the Northern Living Allowance is $35. a month (i.e.) $350. for Day School Teachers and $20. from Welfare Teachers. In cases where the cost of the rations and transportation charges is in excess of the above possible deductions, the teacher will be obliged to pay the difference.\n\nThe requisition showing the requirements must reach Ottawa prior to March 15, 1950, complete with express address and shipping instructions to ensure delivery during the navigation season.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nCopy to Indian Superintendent Kirkby.\n\nFort Resolution Agency\n| Quantity | Food | Details | Price |\n|----------|------|---------|-------|\n| 40 lbs.  | Fish | Canned, Dried or Fresh |       |\n|          |      | 24 tins Cohoe Salmon | 6.90  |\n|          |      | 12 \" Chicken Haddie   | 3.10  |\n|          |      | 20 6 oz. tins Lobster | 16.90 |\n|          |      | 24 4 oz. tins Sardines| 2.16  |\n\n**CEREALS**\n\n| Quantity | Food | Details | Price |\n|----------|------|---------|-------|\n| 175 lbs. | Flour| Canada Approved White | 11.05 |\n|          |      | Brown   | 4.56  |\n|          |      | Graham  | 4.77  |\n| 36 \"     | Rolled Oats |         | 3.15  |\n| 5 \"      | Cream of Wheat |         | 1.78  |\n| 4 \"      | Corn Meal |         | 1.40  |\n| 12 pkgs. | Prepared Whole Grain Cereals (Shredded Wheat etc.) | 1.80 |\n| 10 lbs.  | Macaroni, Spaghetti & Catelli | Bulk | 1.20 |\n| 4 \"      | Rice | Canada | 1.20 |\n| 2 \"      | Cornstarch, Wheat Germ |         | .68   |\n| 60 \"     | Lard or Shortening |         | 15.00 |\n| 36 \"     | Sugar, | White, granulated, Brown | 3.78 |\n| 16 \"     | Jams, Honey & Syrups (asst.) |         | 1.52  |\n|          |      | 2 tins # 2 Strawberry Jam | .92   |\n|          |      | 2 \" Raspberry Jam | .84   |\n|          |      | 1 \" Apricot Jam | .42   |\n|          |      | 2 \" Marmalade | .66   |\n|          |      | 1 \" Peach Jam | .39   |\n|          |      | 10 \" Honey | 3.80  |\n|          |      | 2 \" Plum Jam | .60   |\n|          |      | 10 \" Syrup | 2.50  |\n\n**MISCELLANEOUS**\n\n| Quantity | Food | Details | Price |\n|----------|------|---------|-------|\n| 14 lbs.  | Salt | Iodized | .77   |\n| 8 oz.    | Pepper |         | .84   |\n| 8 oz.    | Mustard |         | .64   |\n| 12 tins  | Mixed Spices |         |       |\n|          |      | 2 tins 1/2 oz.

As this organ is cheap and essential to the cultural development of the community, it would be a shame if the Department passed up an opportunity to purchase this item at little cost. Kindly give this matter due consideration and let me know as to the outcome of your decisions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nMackenzie District, N.W.T.\n8 February, 1950.\n\nMr. J. W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nMackenzie District,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\n\nRocher River Indian Day School\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nI wrote to Mr. Kirkby on January 5 concerning the organ and asked that he examine it on his next visit to Rocher River. Before purchase of this kind can be made, one of our officials must examine the article and declare the price to be fair and reasonable.\n\nI believe that we will shortly hear from Mr. Kirkby concerning this matter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\nFebruary 7th, 1950.\n\nP. Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Education Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nReference your wire of Feb. 1st. I wish to report that Rocher River School light plant has been repaired and the only cost involved was for the plane trip into Rocher River settlement and to purchase one drill for work on the panel board.\n\nThe aircraft company supplied their Mechanic and the pilot gave his time, also the manager of Yellowknife Electric Power Co. also went along and gave his time. The bill for flying time into Rocher River was $150.00 and will be forwarded as soon as received from the Airways office in Edmonton.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F.

If Indians did the supplying of ice and their account was paid through DeMelt this should be stated.\n\nIn future please insure that the Indians are given first preference in any small jobs that might come along. I might add that a $9.00 freighting bill on the organ is very high indeed for a job as small as this one appears to be.

Blackburn and Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nIn our letter to you 28th February 1950 we gave you a complete excerpt dealing with the case.

Ginnae,\nDept'l Purchasing Agent.\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Education Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of March 30th, 1950 in which you give me authority to purchase hygiene supplies for the schools in this Agency.\n\nI note that you refer to my three schools but your list of supplies is from the Requisition for the Roche River school only and before I place three orders I would like to be sure that you intended identical orders be placed for all three, or will lists for the other schools follow.\n\nI would like to point out that there is a great difference between these schools and that what is required at one place is a waste at another and visa versa. At Hay River we do not use dustpans but we do use paste wax with the new wares supplied. All the class rooms at Hay River are equipped with fluorescent lights and as these are beginning to dim and burn out we need replacements. The establishment at Hay River is well over twice the size of Roche River with four times as many pupils, while Ft. Rae is very small with only summer attendance being of any consequence.\n\nI will attempt to adjust any items that are not needed and omit them from the schools where they do not apply, but I have no authority to add or substitute at the other schools, thus my enquiry as to whether the list is for the three schools in the Agency.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.F.

Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith please find vouchers #7 & 8 covering local purchases of miscellaneous supplies for the Rocher River Indian Day School.\n\nAs most of these supplies were breakable and the chance of delivery by boat was not too good without breakages these items have been delivered by myself when making a trip into this point on inspection duties.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.F. Kirkby,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies.\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the past week I was able to make a trip into Pecher River and the school there is not being held at this time. I was able to inspect the building both in maintenance and to amount of supplies used and any possible shortages that might occur during the coming season.\n\nWith regard to fuel and light supplies requisitioned for on my annual estimate I note that the light plant has not used a fraction of the fuel oil sent in last fall and at this school we still have enough to last us for two or three years. It would appear that the item for fuel oil be deleted but that the lubricants etc., be delivered as requested. On the same sheet I had requisitioned for sixty cords of wood for the furnace but now that the winter is over we find it takes more than expected and the wood item should be increased to eighty cords of furnace wood.\n\nThe establishment seems to be operating satisfactorily now and once the D.P. Works complete their painting and the installation of the water system next summer we should have little complaint with the exception of the wood floors which are going to be a source of irritation for the life of the building. The floors that were put in were hardwood that was not thoroughly dry and since being put down has shrunk so that many of the cracks are very wide and unsightly. This floor was only given one coat of light varnish, which wore off in a very short time and with the weekly scrubbing that is necessary to keep the place clean, the wood floor is wearing out real more year than it should and is rapidly deteriorating. There is a great deal of conflicting views as to the best method of preserving these floors and if they are not scrubbed spotless there is a section that complains that the teacher is not keeping the place respectable and another section who complain that the floors are being ruined because they are scrubbed. It is unfortunate that the floors were not battleproof linoleum as are all the Government offices, which incidentally do not receive one quarter as much wear as the school floors.\n\nThe floors at Pecher River are in need of immediate refinishing and I would request that an order be placed for twenty (20) gallons of Florence light oak varnish to be shipped by reach Waterways not later than June 5th, 1930. As I believe D.P. Works will be working at this school early in the season it might be possible to have them do the varnishing of the floors while they are there.\n\nMy former requisitions did not include this item as the teacher had not requested it and it is not apparent that we must have it for the floors as soon as possible.\nEnclosed please find my supplementary requisition for varnish and brushed that were omitted from the last orders sent in early in the month.\n\nA great deal of difficulty is being experienced at this school in keeping the children conscious of the value of cleanliness and of keeping a clean and tidy school. At this point all the pupils regret having to clean up at close of school and have shown open opposition to being made to clean up before entering the building. This is, as far as I am concerned, indicative of the home life and training of the Indians and has made life very unpleasant for the school teacher.\n\nMy letter of December 14th, this file outlined the conflict between the advocates of scrubbing the floors and those against it which is still going on.\n\nIt is the intention at this point to hold school all summer but as this is a two room school there is no reason why one class room cannot be completed while the other is being used and then make the change. This is going to inconvenience the carpenters who will be back to finish the job but as we have put up with a half finished job all year they should not complain for a few weeks.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.E.

Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nThe following extracts from reports received from Mr. I.M. Marshall of our Engineering and Construction Service, who made an inspection trip to the Mackenzie District this summer, are forwarded for your information. They refer to the school buildings constructed by the Department of Public Works for the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n\"Rocher River School - Both Rocher River and Fort Resolution have the same fault in the double doors of the school. Both, also, have a more marked gap on the southerly side. They will all need attention before winter.\n\nThe reason the Rocher River school was so cold last winter was because the plumber removed some of the shiplap and insulation and did not replace it. It is replaced now.\"\n\n\"Fort Norman School - In the school the accordion doors cannot be locked as the floor has dropped so that the bolts will not engage. The two doors at the back entrance will not close by three inches even though they were planed off by the Dept. of Public Works less than a month ago. This is another school erected by D.P.W. on concrete blocks, 6 feet deep, (a scant five feet buried) four feet square at the base and one foot square on top. My investigation showed five feet before frost was encountered. Dept. of Public Works started to put in a septic tank in June but abandoned the effort at about 3/2 feet of depth.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nAIR MAIL\n\nAugust 23rd, 1950.\n\nMr. I.F. Kirkby,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\n\nRe: Rocher River Indian Day School\n\nMr. T.M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Aklavik Roman Catholic Residential School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30th, 1965.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: September 30th, 1965.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ROMAN CATHOLIC RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31st 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 2nd 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Aklanite N.W.T. this 22nd March 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will provision be made for any average attendance an excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginat No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ROMAN CATHOLIC RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st, 1948.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: Dec. 28th, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this January 10th, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the ROMAN CATHOLIC RESIDENTIAL School at AKLAVIK, N.W.T.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When going to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return; use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Akivik Roman Catholic Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1949.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated October 24th, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Fort Norman, this 16th of December, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Aklavit Roman Catholic School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 24th, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Simpson, N.W.T.\n\nthis 16th of December, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Immaculate Conception School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1950.\n\nPrincipal: Sister M.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Immaculate Conception School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 27th 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Norman this Oct. 17th 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Immediate Connection School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: Sister M.

ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the R.C.

Bishop Breynat sent me a word concerning the two electric generating plants which you have offered him. He would like to have one of these plants sent this year to the following address:\n\nM.C.R. Aklavik, c/o H.B.

The Department has a plant of a type that would be satisfactory surplus to requirements at the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School, Cardston, Alta., and we are requesting Mr. Commissioner Graham, Regina, to arrange to have the batteries recharged and the plant crated and forwarded addressed to you, c/o Hudson's Bay Company, Waterways, to go forward by boat about the middle of June, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Sister A. McQuillan,\nPrincipal, Residential School,\nAklavik, N.W.T.\nOttawa, May 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department wishes to have the complete generating plant and batteries, at present surplus to requirements at the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School, forwarded addressed to:\n\nRev. Sister A. McQuillan,\nPrincipal, Residential School,\nAklavik, c/o Hudson's Bay Co.,\nWaterways, Alta.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will arrange to have this equipment crated in a proper manner for shipment and forwarded to the above address, prepaying the freight charges to Waterways. For this purpose, you may engage an engineer of the company that supplied the generating plant and have him examine it, to see that it is in good condition before shipment. He should also have the batteries freshly charged at the school before they are shipped.\n\nThe cost of this service and the freight to Waterways will be paid upon receipt of the usual voucher, in duplicate. The shipment should be at Waterways in time to go forward by boat about the 15th of June.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant No. 141-2-5, and as requested I have arranged with the R.A. Lister Company to have a man proceed to the Blood School at once, and dismantle and crate the lighting plant for shipment to the address given in your letter.\n\nThe batteries will be recharged before shipment, and I have requested the man who is undertaking the work to make sure that after they are charged they will give 100% efficiency, as it would be a serious mistake to send batteries to this remote point that were not in A1 shape.\n\nI expect that the cost will be in the neighborhood of $150.00, although I cannot say for sure; this is just an estimate. I am issuing a transport Requisition to cover the freight, and I presume this will be satisfactory.\n\nI presume you have made arrangements to have this plant installed at Aklavik. If not, the Lister Company tell me they can send a first-class man up to do it at a reasonable figure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6474, file 915-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 19, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11A R.C. of the 12th instant, with reference to the lighting plant at the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School which is to be forwarded to Aklavik. It is noted that you have arranged for the placing of this equipment in good condition and for the crating and shipment of same.\n\nWhen this plant arrives at Aklavik, it will be installed at the expense of the Church authorities by a lay brother of the Oblate Order who, we understand, is competent to do the work.\n\nAccounts covering the cost of the dismantling, crating and recharging the batteries should be forwarded in the usual manner.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, May 19, 1931.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform Your Lordship that this Department is arranging to have a generating plant, complete with batteries, which is surplus to requirements at the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve, forwarded to Aklavik, for use in the Indian Residential School at that point. This plant is now being crated and will go forward to Waterways and thence by boat to Aklavik this summer.\n\nI would request that Your Lordship arrange to have a lay brother, who is competent to do the work, install this equipment when it arrives at Aklavik. The batteries for this plant have been recharged and all equipment put in good condition, and Your Lordship will understand that if the plant is not properly installed serious damage would occur in the running down of the batteries, and it would be very difficult to have them recharged.\n\nIt is hoped that, when this equipment arrives and is installed, it will prove entirely satisfactory for lighting purposes at the Aklavik Indian Residential School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRt.

Co. Ltd., Edmonton, at the total aggregate price quoted by them, viz., $350.93.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nWestern Seating Company,\nEdmonton,\nAlta.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Department No. 141-2-5 of the 5th ultimo, I have just received a letter from the Northern Waterways, Limited, acknowledging receipt of a shipment of the generating plant and batteries surplus at the Blood R.C. Indian school, which were recently shipped to Waterways for transhipment to Aklavik. I regret to state that when the Northern Waterways Limited took over the consignment they found that the liquid in some of the containers had been spilled owing to the loss of stoppers and that one of the cases was definitely in bad order, the container itself being badly damaged and one of the batteries inside being broken.\n\nThe Winnipeg Manager of R.A. Lister and Company was in town and called at my office this afternoon. He informs me that the damage will not affect the utility of the plant. The actual extent of the damage however will not be known until the consignment reaches Aklavik, but I thought it as well to forewarn you in case of any complaint which might reach the Department from the school authorities there. I am definitely assured by the Lister people's representative that the shipment was carefully packed and left Cardston in good order. They state that Mr. Pugh supervised the packing and can vouch for the care which was taken. It is most unfortunate therefore that after all these precautions had been taken prior to shipment the plant should reach Waterways in a defective condition. The Lister Company will write me a letter setting out their case and the cost of the batteries which have been damaged, and upon receipt of these I will lodge a claim against the carriers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6474, file 915-5, part 1)\nOttawa, June 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11A R.C. of the 15th instant, informing the Department that certain damage occurred to the shipment containing the generating plant and batteries surplus at the Blood R. C. Indian School recently forwarded to Waterways for transhipment to the Aklavik R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that the manager of R. A. Lister & Company informed you that the damage will not affect the utility of the plant, and it is hoped that when same arrives at Aklavik there will not be any delay or difficulty in utilizing same. It is noted that you will make enquiry regarding the damage and will lodge a claim against the carriers. Should it be necessary to replace any of the damaged parts and containers, I shall be pleased if you will arrange with R. A. Lister & Company to supply and forward same to Aklavik before navigation closes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M.

This last figure is\nonly approximate, as I left at Fort McMurray the invoices regarding this Mower but, there might be a difference of $2.00 or $3.00 only.\n\nWe have been somewhat surprised to see\nthat no provision had been made for our Residential School of Aklavit, and we would appreciate very much\nif the Department could take in consideration the fact\nthat we have been purchasing this year for that school\na new equipment amounting to the sum of $795.00, and\nconsisting of three reservoirs for water, and an\nElectric Bread Mixer, same as the one purchased for Fort Resolution.\nIn any case, if the Department prefers to transfer to the school of Aklavik the amount granted for the school of Fort Providence we would think that there should be some compensation for the expenses incurred by purchasing the equipment mentioned above.\n\nThanking you for past favors,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nFr.

I regret that I did not advise you regarding the amount provided for the Aklavik School.\n\nIn our appropriation for the current fiscal year the following amounts were provided:\n\n- Aklavik - $300.00\n- Fort Resolution - $300.00\n- Fort Providence - $300.00\n\nTotal $900.00\n\nI understand from your letter that you have purchased the following equipment for the above mentioned three schools:\n\n- Fort Resolution - Bread Mixer - $394.25\n- Fort Providence - Mower - $106.00\n- Aklavik - Water reservoirs and Bread Mixer - $795.00\n\nTotal $1295.25\n\nYou may forward the accounts to the amount of $1295.25 for our consideration. It may be possible to pay the full amount, but at least we will allow the total amount provided in the current year's appropriation. All accounts submitted should be in triplicate and properly certified.

May I say that I am somewhat surprised of your letter. In fact this is the first intimation I ever received regarding this matter. Your office is aware that all accounts for the night watchman's services at any of the four residential schools located in the Mackenzie Diocese have always been forwarded direct by the school to Ottawa without my interference in this matter. Payments used to be made to the R.C. Episcopal Corporation of Mackenzie through our Bank in Edmonton, and none of the above said accounts passed through my office.\n\nAs I do not know for what reason exactly you wish me sending vouchers for the services of the night watchman at the Indian Residential School of Aklavik, I would appreciate it if you would kindly have your attention directed again to this matter and whatever will be your decision, I shall gladly comply with it after having informed our schools of the wishes of the Department.\n\nThe accounts sent with your letter are returned herewith in order that you may have them for your files. The cheque of $120.00 has been received lately.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nFather J. Serrurot, O.M.I.,\nBursar, R.C.

I thought that when you visited the Department you stated that the vouchers for night watchman grant would come from your office.\n\nI now infer from your letter that you would prefer to have the vouchers submitted direct from the schools. There is no objection to this. As pointed out above, I was under the wrong impression in connection with your wishes in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J.

Residential School ... $700.00\nFort Resolution \" \" \" $700.00\nProvidence Mission \" \" \" $2500.00\n\nTotal ... $4000.00\n\nAll of the above-mentioned schools are in the Diocese of Most Reverend G. Breynst, O.M.I., Archbishop of McKenzie, and his Bursar has submitted for payment an account of $1024.00 covering the cost of a Kelvinator unit purchased by the Archdiocese from the Somerville Company, Edmonton, Alberta, for use at the Aklavik R.C. Residential School. In submitting this account the Bursar writes in part as follows:\n\n\"We know that the amounts appropriated for the Providence Mission will be all required for the payment of the electrical installation at the school there.\n\n\"We have no special equipment or repairs at the Fort Resolution Indian School that would justify spending the amounts voted for that school.\n\n\"On the other hand, we feel confident that your Department will give favourable consideration to the amount spent at the Indian School of Aklavik for a...\"\nkelvinator unit bought on August 22nd last at the price of $1,024, as per receipted invoices enclosed herewith.\n\n\"We are aware that the purchase of this material should have been done through your purchasing branch. Nevertheless, as you will realize from the enclosed letter of the Sommerville Co., we felt that there was no other means for our school to have this equipment before freeze-up than to buy it according to the quotations given by the Sommerville Company.\n\n\"Your Branch knows how far distant from the railway Aklavik is located. Consequently, we could not take the risk of having this necessary equipment delayed for another year owing to the time required for correspondence between your purchasing department and our office and the number of weeks required for transportation.\n\n\"We hope that with the $700. voted for Aklavik and the $324. taken out of the Fort Resolution appropriation, you will have no difficulty in refunding us for the expenses incurred at Aklavik this year.\n\n\"Kindly have the cheque in settlement of this account addressed to the R.C. Episcopal Corporation of MacKenzie, c/o Banque Canadienne Nationale, Edmonton, Alberta.\"\n\nI recommend that favourable consideration be given to payment of this account and in order to do so I enclose Memorandum to Council authorizing transfer of $324.00 from the amount provided for the Fort Resolution Residential School to the Aklavik R.C. Residential School, also an amount of $30.00 to the Providence Mission Residential School. The reason for the transfer of the latter amount is explained in another memorandum of concurrent date.\n\nDirector.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Treasury Board, approved by His Excellency the Administrator in Council, on the\n\nMINES AND RESOURCES:\n\nThe Board had under consideration a memorandum from the Honourable the Acting Minister of Mines and Resources reporting:\n\n\"That it is found necessary to make certain amendments to P.C. 40/1628 of June 24, 1939, and that the following transfers be authorized:-\n\n1.

School you request 12 new desks, also 4 fronts, 4 rears and 2 teacher's desks and chairs. School desks are difficult to obtain at the present time and before ordering them I desire to know if they are really necessary for the Indian children at the Aklavik R.C. School. The December quarter return from your school only shows 24 Indian children enrolled and we were under the impression that you had sufficient desks for this number.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nSister J. Dussault,\nPrincipal,\nR.C. Indian Residential School,\nAklavik, N.W.T.\nR.C. Indian Residential School,\nAklavik, N.W.T.\nMarch 24th. 1943.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Supt.\nDept. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAnswering your letter of the 12th. inst., which has just come to hand, would say that we are really in great need of the desks we are asking the Department to supply our school.\n\nAlthough we have had only 24 Indian pupils enrolled this year, please note that we also had 40 Eskimos and 5 day scholars, besides 7 boarders. I beg to state also that the teachers have never been supplied with desks and chairs. In one of the classes, the teacher's desk is a kitchen table which has become very shaky with age. In the other class, the teacher's desk is a home-made one which would be better placed in another department in our school.\n\nTrusting that you will see fit to procure these desks for us as requested and thanking you for past favors,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister J. Duesault\nIrin.\nOttawa,\nApril 9, 1943.\n\nMr. A.L. Cumming, Supt. Mackenzie District and Secretary Yukon Affairs, Lands, Parks & Forests Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nOn a recent requisition Sister J. Dussault, Principal of the Aklavik R.C. Indian Residential School, requested 4 single school desks No. 5, 4 No. 4, 4 No. 3, 4 fronts No. 5, 4 rears No. 3, 2 teacher's desks and 2 teacher's chairs. The December quarter return only showed 24 Indian children enrolled at the school and our records indicate that we have supplied desks for all the Indian children. We wrote to Sister Dussault on March 12, 1943, for an explanation regarding her request. We have just received a letter from her dated March 24, copy of which I enclose. From this letter it would appear that in addition to the 24 Indian pupils enrolled as residential school pupils, there are 5 day pupils, a total of 29 Indian children for whom, as stated above, our records indicate we have supplied desks. It would, therefore, appear that the desks are being requested for the 40 Eskimos and the 7 boarders. I presume that the latter means white children. Under the circumstances I am submitting the request to you for your consideration.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nR. A. Hoey, Esq., Superintendent of Welfare and Training, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAklavik Residential School.\nYour File - 141-2-5\n\nReferring to your memorandum of April 9 addressed to Mr. Cumming, this Administration does not furnish equipment for any of the day or residential schools of the Northwest Territories. Our assistance is confined to payment of grants of $200 per annum for day schools operated in Indian or southern territory, $250 for day schools maintained in Eskimo or northern areas, $400 for all residential schools and expendable school supplies.\n\nIf a departure were made in the case of the Aklavik R.C. residential school it would mean that we would be called upon to furnish equipment for the other schools as well.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nApril 17, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWe have had considerable correspondence with the Principal of the Aklavik R.C. Residential School requesting 4 single school desks No. 5, 4 No. 4, 4 No. 3, 4 fronts No. 5, 4 rears No. 3, 2 teacher's desks and 2 teacher's chairs. There are only 24 Indian pupils at this school and, while our records may not be exactly accurate, they indicate that we have supplied desks for the Indian children. It would, therefore, appear that these extra desks must be required for Eskimos or white children. I took up the matter with the Northwest Territories Branch, but they state they do not supply desks at residential schools.\n\nEven if the desks were installed they would involve a considerable expenditure and would reduce the amount available for repairs and improvements at this school during the fiscal year 1943-44. If the desks were supplied, there would likely be considerable trouble having them transported to Aklavik this summer, as the boats will probably be busy. Under the circumstances I thought it advisable to submit the matter to you for your opinion.\n\nBishop Trocellier was in the Department recently and requested beds for one of the schools in the Diocese. I am not certain whether it was Holy Angels, Providence Mission, Fort Resolution or Aklavik. I should appreciate it if you would let me know which school it is, also the number necessary. Beds are difficult to obtain and practically the only size available is 6' x 3'. It is,\n\nRev. R.L. Lafleur, O.M.I.,\n9916 - 110 St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\ntherefore, our intention to supply this size. Please let me know immediately so that the order may be placed through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nR.C. Residential School,\nAklavik, N.W.T.\nJuly 17th, 1943.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey, Supt.,\nDept. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, CANADA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs I have not yet received an answer to my letter regarding my requisition for school desks, I take the liberty to ask you again if it would not be possible to send at least the 12 pupils' desks requested. We could wait another year for the teachers' desks, but for the pupils we are certainly in urgent need of desks, having had to use empty cases to this effect for the last two years.\n\nThanking you in advance for complying with our request\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister J. Dussault\nPrin.\nOttawa,\nJuly 28, 1943.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to desks requested for the Aklavik Residential School. For your information I quote from a letter forwarded to Rev. R.L. Lafleur, O.M.I., on April 17 last:\n\n\"We have had considerable correspondence with the Principal of the Aklavik R.C.

The only thing we can do under the circumstances, is to try to get delivery of the necessary D.C. motor and then make delivery of the machine complete with motor as soon as possible. This is very indefinite we know, but under the circumstances, there appears to be nothing else we can do. We suggest you therefore write to the party placing the order through you, advising him that delivery date is uncertain and not even an approximate delivery date can be suggested now. If therefore he can secure his requirements from any other source, it will be quite all right with us and we think he should have that privilege, in which case of course, we should be advised to cancel the order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBEATTY BROS.

School, a copy of our purchase order No. 1429 was forwarded to you on March 8. However, the firm subsequently advised us that they could not supply that particular washer and it was necessary to obtain new prices. We have now secured a washer from J.H. Connor & Son, Limited, Ottawa, and I enclose, for your information, a copy of our purchase order No. 3873.\n\nYou will note that this particular washer will not reach Waterways much before August 9. This may mean that it will be too late to be shipped to Aklavik this year. I regret this delay, if it occurs, but I wish to assure you that it is due to circumstances entirely beyond our control.\n\nWhen the washer does reach Waterways it might be possible for you to have the account certified and forwarded to this office so that payment can be made from the current year's appropriation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev.

I sincerely appreciate your efforts in obtaining this machine.\n\nEven though the washer reaches Waterways around August 9th, I think there may still be time to ship it to Aklavik before the close of the transportation season.\n\nI shall notify the Father in charge of our mission at Waterways-Charlbury, to see to the signing of the waybill and to the speedy shipment north of the washer.\n\nThanking you very kindly for your favor, I remain,\n\nvery truly yours,\n\n+ J.

Boarding School at Aklevik, has recently reached Waterways, where it will be put in storage for the winter. Even though it will not reach Aklevik until next summer, it is a case of \"better late than never.\"\n\nEnclosed you will find invoices covering transportation from Ottawa to Waterways.\n\nI take this occasion of saying that I would consider it a great favor if you would kindly let me know just what you have been able to order from the requisition lists which were recently sent to you from Fort Smith for the fiscal year. In the event that you are unable to obtain what we have asked for, we may thus be in a position to complete the orders ourselves. You can readily understand the importance of this information, especially when it is a case of building materials or repair work.\n\nWith sincere personal regards, I remain,\n\nvery truly yours,\n\n+ F. J. Caron\n\nBishop J. Trocellier O.M.I.,\nVice Apostolic of Mackenzie,\nTitular Bishop of Adramyttium.\nOttawa, 29th November, 1945.\n\nDear Bishop Trocellier:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant in which you advise the washing machine for the Aklavik School has reached Waterways. You forwarded a certified account for freight but you did not send the account covering the cost of the machine itself. If you have this account I would appreciate it if you would certify and forward immediately.\n\nI trust the following statement supplies the information requested in the last paragraph of your letter:\n\n**Aklavik R.C. School**\n\n| Amount provided 1945-46 | $700.00 |\n|-------------------------|---------|\n| Amount expended         | $545.00 |\n| Balance                 | $155.00 |\n\n**Providence Mission School**\n\n| Amount provided 1945-46 | $800.00 |\n|-------------------------|---------|\n| Amount expended         | $414.58 |\n| Balance                 | $385.42 |\n\n**Holy Angels School**\n\n| Amount provided 1945-46 | $500.00 |\n|-------------------------|---------|\n| Amount expended         | $383.88 |\n| Balance                 | $116.12 |\n\nThe above three schools show an unexpended balance of $656.54.\n\nA total amount of $1,300.00 was provided for Fort Resolution but we have expended $2,207.98 which means that $907.98 has been expended over and above the amount specifically provided. This was due to the fact that account\n\n......2\nFor materials ordered in early winter of 1945 did not reach us until the books for the year 1944-45 had been closed and consequently we were obliged to pay them from the current year's appropriation.\n\nIn view of the above situation, we will be obliged to use the unexpended balance of $656.54 of the three schools first mentioned to offset part of the over-expenditure of $907.93 at Fort Resolution, consequently we are not in a position to incur further expenditure at these four schools during the current fiscal year.\n\nHowever, the requests made on the requisition lists which you sent from Fort Smith are being included in our estimates for the fiscal year 1946-47. If they are approved by the Minister we will be in a position to place the orders early in 1946 but until our estimates for 1946-47 are approved no action can be taken. I can assure you that I will keep the matter in mind and if the approval is granted, the necessary action will be taken to order the supplies requested.\n\nAt the present time I am not in a position to give you definite assurance that all your requests will receive favourable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Reverend J. Trocellier, O.M.I.,\nFort Smith, N.W.T.\nDecember 5, 1945.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI have received your letter of November 20th, with information relative to the various amount provided and expended in favor of our schools during this current year.\n\nIt is to be hoped that in future the goods destined for these institutions will arrive during the shipping season, to offset the difficulties arising from failure to deliver the materials during the year for which they had been ordered.\n\nIn the event that certain requisitions cannot be filled, I would be grateful indeed if you could notify us of such a shortage. As we depend very much upon all these articles for the smooth progress of our work, you can readily understand the importance to us, of knowing if one or more orders may be cancelled. This year, for example, we had looked for certain kinds of wood for the completion of interior construction work, which has already been going on for a long time, but it was only at the end of the shipping season, that we realized that nothing had been sent, nor had any notification been given in this regard.\n\nWith full appreciation of your kind attention to our requirements, I remain,\n\nvery truly yours,\n\n+ M.

As that Department had already supplied a sufficient quantity of desks for our Indian pupils, you wrote to me on March 1, 1944, and I inferred from your letter that I was to apply to another Department for procuring school desks for our Eskimo pupils. As the War was then raging, I let this matter drop, but I am now sending a requisition for additional desks to the Department of Mines & Resources.\n\nHowever, as our school has never been supplied with teachers' desks and chairs, I have included these two articles in this year's requisition list and I would greatly appreciate it if you would take this matter into consideration.\n\nThanking you in advance for your kind attention to this matter and wishing you the compliments of the season,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister J.

I am herewith enclosing copies of the requisitions in favor of our four Indian Residential Schools.\n\nAs it is imperative that these items reach their destination during the transportation season for river navigation, you will understand why it is important that I know for certain just which items you are sending, so that if substitutions must be made, or orders cannot be filled within the season, other arrangements of a temporary nature may be made.\n\nIn the case of the requisition for Fort Chipewyan, I have noted that the Range asked for, was really part of the requisition for the previous year. Now, in addition, all these requisitions are reaching you after the end of the fiscal year for which they were intended, but as you will notice by the date of the copy of each list, the requisitions were sent at an early date.\n\nI ask you therefore to let me know whether we can expect to receive the various items which are asked for, so that we can depend upon the reception of same during the course of the summer.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n+ J.

We feel that it would be advisable to supply a saw to each of these schools and the funds for the purpose are available in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48. The necessary order in council has already been secured authorizing disbursement of the amounts specifically provided in the estimates. This type of saw is especially useful in the districts in which these schools are located and should serve for many years.\n\nI would like to recommend immediate purchase.\n\nDirector.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Laundry Machinery for Aklavik Indian Residential School\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nOn October 18 last, I wrote to the Department regarding the mechanical equipment of the above school and mentioned particularly that of the laundry.\n\nSince then I have had occasion to secure approximate prices from both the Beaver Laundry and the Canadian Laundry Companies, which I take the liberty of listing below:\n\n1. \"Leonard\" boiler 12 H.P., 100-lb pressure, complete with ordinary fittings . . . . . . $664.00\n2. 26\" Beaver, motor driven, Laundry Extractor . . . 962.00\n3. 36 x 30 Beaver Heubsch laundry drying tumbler complete with \u00bd H.P. motor . . . . . . . . . . . 485.00\n4.

However, His Excellency Bishop Trocellier has offered to do the purchasing himself and supply the balance of the money if the amount standing to the credit of his four schools should be found insufficient.\n\nWould you let me know as soon as possible what plan you desire to follow.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

He stated that with the help that was available such as carpenters and engineers he was able to construct the school for the above amount. This is the only reference to the cost of either of these schools.

This could be operated with the present electric power plant.\n\n3: Cement: Last year you supplied one thousand sacks of cement, for a new foundation under the school. Another five hundred sacks are necessary to complete this work.\n\n4: Paint: The school has not been painted for over ten years and it is felt that it should be done during the coming summer. The estimate of the quantities of paint needed is as follows:\n\n1: One hundred gallons of white paint for exterior work.\n2: Fifteen gallons of linseed oil.\n3: Ten gallons of Turpentine.\n4: Four 4\" paint brushes.\n5: Four 2\" paint brushes.\n\n5: Lionelum: Two hundred and fifty yards of battleship linoleum to cover worn out floors. It is estimated that this will be cheaper than laying new floors.\nThe above must be shipped to Aklavik R.C.School, N.W.T., C/O Mo Innes Transport, Waterways, Alberta, and the transport charges should be paid in advance, if it is possible to do so.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

Diesel Engine and a D.C. Generator 10 K.W., 120 volts, complete with rheostat. A suitable set of batteries for the above will cost $1200.00, making a sum of $4288.00 for the complete Plant. The above prices are F.O.B. Montreal.\n\nThe Resolution School requires a Washing Machine, the description of which follows:\n\"New 30\" x 48\" Beaver Handy Laundry Washer, monel metal outercase, with soap door. Monel metal cylinder, fitted with direct connected reversing type motor and controls. 110 volts Direct Current, with thermometer, and water level indicator.\"\nThe price of this Washing Machine is $1609.00, F.O.B. Toronto.\n\nThe same school also requires 500 Sq. Yd of LINOLEUM to cover floors which otherwise will have to be replaced.\n\nWe estimate the above to be worth $1250.00.

But he is willing to supply the balance out of missionary funds, provided he is authorized to purchase the above and he will submit receipted invoices, on receipt of which your Department will issue a check for the amount standing to the credit of his schools.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, o.m.i.\nOTTAWA, March 9th 1949.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Laundry and Electrical equipment for the Aklavik and Resolution Schools.\n\nThe Aklavik School requires a Lighting Plant comprising a Diesel Engine, a Generator and a set of batteries.\n\nThe Fairbanks-Morse Co. of Montreal have quoted the sum of $3088.00 for a 20 H.P., two cylinder, four cycle, 1200 R.P.M. Diesel Engine and a D.C. Generator 10 K.W., 120 volts, complete with rheostat. A suitable set of batteries for the above will cost $1200.00, making the sum of $4288.00 for the complete Plant. The above prices are F.O.B. Montreal.\n\nThe Resolution School requires a Washing Machine, the description of which follows:\n\n\"New 30\" x 48\" Beaver Handy Laundry Washer, monel metal outercase, with soap door. Monel metal cylinder, fitted with direct connected reversing type motor and controls. 110 volts Direct Current motor with thermometer, and water level indicator.\"\n\nThe price of this Washing Machine is $1609.00, F.O.B. Toronto.\n\nThe same school also requires 500 Sq.Yd. of LINOLEUM to cover floors which otherwise will have to be replaced. We estimate the above to be worth $1250.00.\n\nThe amount now standing to the credit of the group of schools in Bishop Trocellier's territory is $6301.69. But he is willing to supply the balance out of missionary funds, provided he is authorised to purchase the above. He will submit receipted invoices, on receipt of which your Department may issue a check for the amount standing to the credit of his schools.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, 16th March, 1949.\n\nMemo randum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Aklavik R.C. Residential School\nFort Resolution R.C. Residential School\nProvidence Mission R.C. Residential School\nHoly Angels (Fort Chipewyan) R.C. Residential School\n\nThe above mentioned schools are Church-owned and are in the Diocese of the Most Reverend J. Trocellier, O.M.I., Vicar Apostolic of Mackenzie. Bishop Trocellier has obtained estimates of the costs of the following items which he states are urgently required at the undermentioned schools.\n\n(1) Aklavik R.C. Residential School:\n   1 Lister Diesel Engine driven generating unit, approximate cost... $4,045.00\n   1 Set of Batteries for above............. $1,200.00\n\n(2) Fort Resolution R.C. Residential School:\n   1 Beaver \"Handy Laundry Washer\", 30\" x 43\", with necessary attachments.......................... $1,609.00\n   500 Yds. Linoleum, approximate cost...... $1,250.00\n\nThe purchase of the above items involves an expenditure of slightly over $8,000.00.\n\nIn the appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49, there is still unexpended slightly less than $7,000.00, from\nthe amount specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for the four schools in Bishop Trocellier's Diocese, namely, Aklavik R.C., Providence Mission R.C., Holy Angels (Fort Chipewyan) R.C., and Fort Resolution.\n\nBishop Trocellier requests authority to proceed immediately with the purchase of the items shown above for Fort Resolution and Aklavik, with the understanding that the Department will allow towards the cost of the items, the amount unexpended at the four schools in his Diocese. In other words, he is prepared to purchase the items for Fort Resolution and Aklavik R.C. Schools, and will pay their cost and their transportation to the two schools over and above the amount of $7,000.00. Before the Department's payment is made, Bishop Trocellier will submit receipted invoices for the expenditures he incurs.\n\nI feel that his proposal is reasonable and similar authority has been granted previously. Therefore, I would appreciate it if the Minister would approve Bishop Trocellier's request.\n\nPP/3T\n\nDirector.\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso auxquelles je consens par les pr\u00e9sentes.\n\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa March 21 1949\n\nMost Reverend J Trocellier\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie\nFort Smith Northwest Territories\n\nRE: REQUEST DIESEL ENGINE AKLAVIK RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL - stop -\n\nUNDERSTAND AKLAVIK POWER COMPANY OPERATING IN TOWN - stop - COULD POWER BE PURCHASED THAT SOURCE VICE PURCHASE DIESEL OIL -\n\nBernard F Neary\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\n\nCharge Indian Affairs\nMines and Resources\n\nBERNARD F NEARY\nSupt of Indian Education Ottawa\n\nAKLAVIK TOWN POWER TWENTY CENTS PER KW VERY EXPENSIVE WE WOULD SAVE MONEY WITH OUR OWN DIESEL PLANT STOP IF AKLAVIK POWER COMPANY GIVES MORE REASONABLE PRICES WE COULD TAKE POWER THERE AND THEN GIVE THE DIESEL PLANT TO OUR RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL OF PROVIDENCE REGARDS -\n\nBISHOP J M TROCELLIER\nSend the following message, subject to the conditions on the back thereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\nOttawa, 30th March 1949\n\nRev.

Indian Residential School\n\nIn a memorandum under date of the 23rd instant regarding the above, this office advised you that additional information was being sought regarding the likelihood of obtaining electrical power from the local privately owned plant.\n\nReplying to a telegram on the matter, Bishop Trossellier wired Col. Henry of Indian Affairs as follows:\n\n\"Aklavik Town power twenty cents per K.W. very expensive we would save money with our own diesel plant STOP If Aklavik Power Company gives more reasonable prices we could take power there and then give the diesel plant to our Residential School of Providence\"\n\nAt Aklavik, in addition to the R.C. school, another Indian Residential School is operated by the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada. Canon Cook, Superintendent of the Indian School Administration, R.S.C.C., was contacted by Col. Henry, for information in connection with the matter of power, and conditions which likely apply to both schools, were described by Canon Cook as follows:\n\nThe Aklavik Power and Supply Co., Ltd., has two diesel operated machines, with a capacity of 37\u00bd K.W. each. The Company has in mind adding a third unit, which would raise capacity to between 80 and 90 K.W.\n\nMr. Puffer of the power company canvassed the Church of England school authorities and offered to supply 110 volt, single phase 60 cycle A.C. power for a flat rate of $175.00 per month, provided the school load did not exceed 3240 kilowatt hours per month. The company would install power line, transformers and meter if required. Charges for metered current would be as follows:\n\n| Current for Power Operated Equipment | Current for Lighting Purposes |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Up to 100 K.W.H.                     | 10\u00a2 per K.W.H.                |\n| From 100 to 200 K.W.H.               | 15\u00a2 per K.W.H.                |\n| Above 200 K.W.H.                     | 16\u00a2 per K.W.H.                |\n\nThis office has never been in possession of record drawings or data in connection with either of the schools mentioned, and Indian Affairs are unable to furnish data on the demand imposed. Consequently we are not in a position to make an intelligent recommendation on the action that should be taken until a thorough inspection of the R.C. residential school has been carried out, and an investigation of possible arrangements with the power company made. To date no request for such action has been received from Indian Affairs.\n\nR.K. Odell, Esq.,\nChief Administrative Officer,\nAdministration and Personnel Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nLangevin Block,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIn his memorandum dated March 16th to our Deputy Minister, the Director of Indian Affairs indicated a degree of urgency regarding purchase of the lighting plant, and if available funds are to be used approval must be given in the next few days.\n\nIt is the opinion of this office, nevertheless, that if purchase of the unit can be deferred without endangering the heating plant of the school, and as a result, the health of the pupils and staff, the time should be taken to investigate the matter thoroughly.\n\nT.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMajor MacKay\n\nRe: R.C. Indian Residential School, Aklavik,\n- Additional Power Unit.\n\nAttached you will find a report from the Chief Engineer, Engineering and Construction Division, respecting the purchase of a Lister Diesel engine driven electrical generating unit for the above school.\n\nIn conversation with Colonel Neary the urgency of this purchase was emphasized and consequently the Minister's approval was secured.\n\nMr. Mills has suggested that the power situation at Aklavik should be thoroughly investigated. Will you please have the matter of proceeding with an investigation taken up with Mr. Gibson.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, 7th April, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Obtaining Electrical Power, Aklavik, N.W.T.\n\nThe Deputy Minister has forwarded to this office Mr. Mills' memorandum of March 28th addressed to Mr. R.K. Odell regarding the above.\n\nIt is noted that your Branch does not possess record drawings or data in connection with either Aklavik C.E. Residential School or Aklavik R.C. Residential School. We would appreciate it if you would arrange to have both schools inspected and a thorough investigation made regarding possible arrangements that might be made with the local power company to supply electricity to these schools.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that both these schools are Church-owned, and the cost of the electric current consumed is paid by the school management from their per capita grants and other receipts. Consequently, both of them will be interested in the cost of securing power from a local company.\n\nPP/ST\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum for Council dated April 8th, 1949.\n\nFORT RESOLUTION\n\nBalance to credit April 8, 1949........$1,240.49\nPurchase Orders transferred to 1949-50:\nCement $225.00\nRefrigerator 702.00 927.00\n$2,167.49\n\nAKLAVIK\n\nTransfer from Providence Mission.......$ 969.05\nTransfer from Holy Angels..............3,045.96\nTransfer from Cariboo..................800.00\n$4,815.01\n6th April, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Aklavik R.C.

Beatty, Secretary of Department\n\nTo Hon. Frank Oliver,\nMinister of the Interior\nOttawa.\nExtract from Report of Inspector H.A. Conroy on the Boarding Schools in Treaty No.8 and Mackenzie District.\n\nDated December 18/11. Original on File 160370-18E.\n\nRESOLUTION\n\nAt Resolution the Roman Catholic Mission erected a new school building, which has only been occupied a year. An addition is shortly to be added, which will make it the largest building north of Edmonton in Treaty 8 District.\n\nAt present it is three stories high: a main building measuring 40 x 30; and two of 20 x 40 each. It is an exceedingly well-built frame structure, with a good stone foundation.\n\nThe ground floors of both wings are used as class rooms: the second floor of one wing is the chapel, with the dome obliterating the third floor. The second floor of the other wing is the recreation room, and the third floor the girls dormitories. The boys dormitory is the third floor of the main building.\n\nThe building is on the whole, well divided, though the staircases are a little dark, and pretty narrow and steep. However, there are outside staircases descending from the dormitories and recreation rooms, so there is practically no danger of accident in case of fire.\n\nThe ventilation of dormitories and class rooms has been well attended to. The windows open at both top and bottom, and are so arranged that a good current...\nResolution con.\n\nair can be obtained at any time. Doors open onto spacious galleries from dormitories, class rooms and recreation rooms. Eight large windows in each of the above rooms give ample light; coal oil lamps, of course, are used at night.\n\nThe class rooms are equipped with two blackboards, two maps. Three long desks accommodate twenty four pupils; the rest sit at long tables. They are in need of a geography globe; two maps each of the world, the Dominion of Canada and the North Country. They need also two blackboards and brushes, and a couple dozen slates.\n\nThe Department last year sent in 25 iron bedsteads and springs but no mattresses. Each child now has four good blankets and a feather pillow. They have of course, their individual towel, comb and basin.\n\nThey require a dozen ordinary tubs; and if possible a dozen iron bedsteads.\n\nWater is supplied from a well under the kitchen and is pumped to the kitchen and the girls dormitory. I understand that when the new wing is built, a system of pumps will be extended to the rest of the main rooms.\n\nTwo rooms are reserved as infirmaries, one for the boys, one for the girls. They were not used this year, as there was not a single case of illness.\n\nTwo cellars 40 x 16; 18 x 16 both 8 feet high and joined by a passage 22 x 4 keep the building from dampness. These are neither floored or walled as yet but that will be attended to later on. The cellars are used as store rooms and contain also two large hot air furnaces which give every satisfaction.\nResolution con.\n\nBesides the school building there are two ice houses, two store houses, one barn two closets, a large house for the priests and one now used as a store house, formerly the old school.\n\nThe stock comprises five milch cows, four oxen and two spring calves.\n\nThe garden is good. The soil seems to be exceptionally fertile, and under systematic cultivation, yields a surprising crop of vegetables. About four acres are under garden at present, but this area is steadily being added to. This year's crop of vegetables included beans, peas, turnips, onions, cabbage, cauliflower, carrots and tomatoes, which latter, however, did not ripen on the vine, though they grow to a fair size. Cucumbers and squashes were tried without success; but last autumn saw close on to four hundred bushels of potatoes in the store houses.\n\nThe grounds around the school building are kept clean and tidy. The building itself is on high ground; and the hundred yards between it and the lake have been cleared, so that the school is the most prominent landmark at Resolution, and I would strongly recommend that the present grant be materially increased. The accommodation will be greatly increased by the erection of the new wing to be occupied next autumn. This wing is to be 22 x 50: three stories high, and will contain three large class rooms. This will necessitate purchasing blackboards, desks, maps, a globe, etc. The present rooms are not too extravagantly equipped in these respects, to say nothing of providing equipment for three more rooms.\n\nThe dormitories measure as follows:\n\nGirls dormitory .......... 8268 cubic ft. accom., 16\nBoys \" ........... 11890 \" \" \" 23\nSmall boys \" .......... 6270 \" \" \"\n\nTotal accommodation for ..................\nResolution concl.\n\nRegular fire and military drill vary a curriculum which follows strictly along the lines set down by the Department. The boys help in the garden, and with the wood and furnaces; the girls do all the sewing and knitting for the school. Each girl over twelve takes her turn in the kitchen for a month, and at the end of that time they have learned to do all the cooking for the children's refectory. The food is as good and as plentiful as could be desired anywhere in civilization.\n\nFor fire protection as stated before, there are outside stairways from the dormitories, class rooms and recreation rooms. There are also two chemical engines provided by the Department, and pails of water are always ready and filled in convenient places.\nOttawa, January 19, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nThe pupilage at present provided for at the Fort Resolution Boarding School, Treaty 8, is 25. An application has been received from the Principal in which he asks for an increase in this number to 50. Mr. Inspector Conroy has reported very fully upon the accommodation at this school and it is shown that they have proper accommodation for the number asked for by the Principal. I am attaching herewith a photograph of the existing building. I may add that they are at present erecting a new wing, which will be ready for occupation next autumn. The present policy of the Department is to pay the grant for the number of pupils for which a school has accommodation and I would recommend that the request of the Principal of the Fort Resolution Boarding School be complied with and the grant paid for 50 pupils from the first of the current quarter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6474, file 916-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 24, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nThe school vote will stand an increase of ten pupils from the 1st instant and provision for the additional number asked for (15) can be made in the Supplementary Estimates.\nOttawa, January 26, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of July 17th last, in which you ask for an increase in the pupilage at the Fort Resolution Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to grant an immediate increase of ten from the first instant. Parliament will be asked to vote the necessary funds to make a still further increase of fifteen, or fifty pupils in all, and as soon as funds are available the increase will go into effect and Your Lordship will be advised.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev.

This will make the total pupilage fifty.

L. MacDonald, the Department's Medical Officer, upon the 5th inst.\n\nThis School is conducted by the Grey Nuns, and is under the direct supervision of Bishop Bregman. The building, which is a frame one, three stories high, consists of a main building, 40 x 70, with a wing at either end, 30 x 40; it fronts upon the lake, with a well kept and fertile garden between; all kinds of vegetables and flowers were in a flourishing condition and totally unharmed by frost.\n\nThere are seventy-five pupils, who appear to be, as a rule, healthy bright children. The sanitary arrangements are excellent, and cleanliness is evident, both in the persons of the children and in every department of the building. There is a well equipped laundry, and the kitchen is large and well appointed; the dormitories are clean, well ventilated and comfortable, and the heating arrangements are ample, consisting of a large basement wood-heater with radiators.\n\nI would recommend that fire escapes be provided for the upper stories.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6474, file 916-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFive cows are kept at the Home Farm, and Potatoes and Beets are raised in large quantities.\n\nThe children learn English and French, and appear to be equally proficient in both languages. My wife, who accompanied me, was greatly pleased with the sewing and leather work done by the girls.\n\nSister Nephtalin attends to the medical requirements of the establishment, and is quite proficient in Dentistry; there is a well equipped Infirmary and Isolation ward. No epidemics have occurred in recent years.\n\nThe Institution, in a word, is a magnificent one, and entirely worthy of the support given by the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.J.

Accommodation is now provided for 75 scholars and the ventilation, heating and dormitory arrangements are everything to be desired.\n\nA good supply of water is provided by a well in the kitchen of the school, although the water from Great Slave Lake is excellent for drinking purposes.\n\nThe general school equipment is a little lacking in some respects, especially blackboards, maps, class-books, desks, etc.\n\nAt the time of inspection there were 17 boys and 83 girls at the school and all exhibited a well cared for appearance. The proficiency of the scholars was well up to the standard, especially with regard to writing and reading.\n\nThe boys have been receiving physical and military drill at the hands of C. Stephens of the R.N.W.M.P. at Resolution and take a keen interest in the training.\n\nThe girls receive instruction in housekeeping and needlework and many articles, such as dresses, moccasins and fancy work of caribou and deerskin were to be seen.\n\nNearly four acres of land in the vicinity of the school are given up to gardening and the different crops of vegetables and roots are sufficient for the upkeep of the school. Facilities are provided for the boys to take part in the fishery and trapping with a view to preparing them to earn their livelihood after leaving the school. The health of the scholars was in every way satisfactory, for, although two rooms in the school have been set aside as infirmaries for the boys and girls they are very rarely occupied.\nOttawa, May 5, 1916.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to Your Lordship's personal application for an increased number of grant earners in the Fort Resolution Boarding School I beg to say that, as the additions recently made to the school buildings will afford accommodation for more pupils than the number now authorized, the Department will consent to ten more pupils being enrolled as grant earners.

J. Bury on the Boarding Schools of Treaty No. 8, Northern Section. Date October 6, 1916. Original on\n\nRESOLUTION BOARDING SCHOOL (Roman Catholic)\n\nThis large school is now well able to accommodate 75 scholars, as the right wing has been completed.\n\nThe school itself is perhaps one of the most up-to-date, and the ventilating and heating arrangements are everything to be desired. The water supply is derived from a well on the school premises.\n\nAt the time of my visit the pupils were having vacation. The total number of pupils at the school at this time was 47.\n\nThe school dormitories are light and airy and the general living rooms provide ample space for the requirements. Spacious playgrounds are also provided.\n\nThere is a certain amount of laxity in the manner in which Indian children are brought into the schools from their homes. No medical inspection is made and at the time of my visit to Resolution, a band of no less than 14 children of the Dog Rib tribe was brought all the way from Fort Rae in an open York boat and admitted to the school without an inspection. In my opinion there is a considerable risk attached to such conduct, as any contagious disease once contracted by the pupils would be very hard to check or eradicate.\n\nAt present the standard of health is very good.\n\nA list of the present pupils and a record of the ex-pupils is attached.\n\nSgd.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nRE Losses of boats and fishing implements by the Indian B. Schools at Fort Resolution and Providence, N.W.T.\n\nDuring the last three years exceptionally heavy losses in boats and fishing implements have been sustained by the Indian Boarding Schools of Fort Resolution and Providence, N.W.T., as the following facts readily show:\n\n1918\u2014Loss of 2 scows;\n1919\u2014Loss of 3 scows, 150 nets and accessories;\n1920\u2014Loss of 1 tug boat, 3 scows, 1 large barge with steel frame.\n\nThose losses have occurred through extraordinary storms and have placed the Schools in a rather bad plight as the above were being used for fishing purposes in connection with our Indian Boarding Schools at Fort Resolution and Providence.\n\nConsequently, we have been in the necessity of ordering:\n\n1 tug boat (42 ft) for Providence $3,500.00\n1 Schooner (50 ft) for Fort Resolution with auxiliary engine $2,000.00\n3 Scows ($250.00 each) $750.00\n150 nets and accessories ($6.00 each) $1,200.00\nmaking a total of: $7,450.00\nUniversity of Ottawa,\n\nOttawa, Canada, May 14th\n\n552738\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing our conversation of yesterday I herewith enclose a MEMORANDUM showing the losses sustained by our Indian Boarding Schools of Fort Resolution and Providence, in connection with fishing apparatus and operations, during the last three years.\n\nAs you kindly requested I am also including an estimate of expenses entailed in ordering new material. The Steamer and Schooner, both built by the H.B.E.C. of Edmonton, are on their way to destination. We have still to order our nets and scows.\n\nIf you find in order to give us any help in this matter amount could be forwarded to the undersigned or, as usual, to Rev. Fr C.J. Lefebvre O.M.I., 9948-110th Street, EDMONTON, Alta.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention and court.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6474, file 916-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJune 14th, 1922.\n\nDear Father Guy,\n\nI have given consideration to letter from His Lordship Bishop Breynat enclosing a memorandum showing the expenditure entailed by the Indian boarding schools at Fort Resolution and Fort Providence, N.W.T. in replacing boats and fishing implements lost by these institutions during the past three years, amounting in all to $7,450.00 for which His Lordship asks to be recouped.\n\nWhile I sympathize with the management of these schools in the losses sustained, I regret exceedingly that I am not able to find funds to assist them in replacing this equipment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

Rev. G. Breynat, O.M.I., Vicar Apostolic of Mackenzie River Diocese, forwards a statement regarding the loss sustained by the Indian residential schools in his Diocese during the past three years as a result of the damage to the boats and fishing gear used by the schools through exceptionally stormy weather. These schools are located at Fort Resolution and Providence Mission.\n\nIn order to obtain food supplies for the use of the pupils and staff, which consist principally of fish, the boats and fishing gear had to be immediately replaced, thus entailing an extraordinary and unforeseen expenditure. His Lordship states that an expenditure of $7450 was incurred in replacing the boats and nets, and he requests that some financial assistance be granted to recoup him.\n\nHis Lordship asks that the unearned portion of the per capita grants provided for these schools for the present fiscal year be applied towards this purpose. This unearned grant represents the difference between the amount provided in our estimates for each of these schools and the amount of the grant as actually paid, which latter is calculated on the average attendance as shown by the quarterly returns.\n\nThe returns for each of the quarters of the present fiscal year are not to hand, but, based on those received, it is estimated that there will be approximately $3000 of unearned grant at the end of the present fiscal year. There was a falling off in the pupilage enrolled at each school occasioned chiefly by sickness among the Indians, and, as a result, there was a lower number of pupils in residence at each school than the per capita grant is provided for. The schools did not, on that account, receive the full grant provided by our appropriation for Indian education.\n\nHis Lordship's request is an unusual one, but, owing to the difficulties encountered in conducting these schools, and the cost of their maintenance in this northern country, I am disposed to favourably consider the Bishop's request, and recommend for your approval that at the end of the present fiscal year we transfer the unearned portion of the per capita grants for these two schools towards the cost of reimbursing the church authorities for the expenditure incurred by them in replacing the boats and fishing gear lost through the exceptionally stormy weather.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nRt.

Rev. G. Breynat, O.M.I., Vicar Apostolic of the R.C. Diocese of Mackenzie River, has requested that the unearned portion of the per capita grants made to these two schools during the last fiscal year be applied towards reimbursing the church authorities for the losses among the boats and fishing gear which, according to a statement signed by the Vicar Apostolic, cost $7450. to replace. The records of the Department show that the unearned portion of the Providence Mission school amounted to $2643.32 and of the Fort Resolution school to $2486.98, last year, amounting in all to $5130.30. There was a falling off in the enrolment of pupils last year, due chiefly to sickness, and the religious body conducting the schools of course lost in proportion to the lack of pupils on the roll.\n\nThe request is an unusual one but owing to the difficulties and expense experienced in conducting schools in the northern district in which these two schools are situated the question of the partial reimbursement might properly be favourably considered in this instance.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, June 26, 1922.\nThe Board had under consideration a memorandum from the Honourable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, reporting that owing to the prevalence of exceptionally stormy weather during the past three years the boats and fishing gear used by the Providence Mission and Fort Resolution Indian Boarding Schools, N.W.T., for obtaining food supplies for the pupils and staffs of the schools, have sustained losses which, according to a statement furnished by the Right Reverend the Vicar Apostolic of the Roman Catholic Diocese of the MacKenzie River, cost the church authorities $7,150 to redeem; that in order that the church authorities may receive financial assistance in this connection, the Vicar Apostolic has requested that the unearned portion of the per capita granted provided by Parliament for \u2014 among others \u2014 the two schools above mentioned during the last fiscal year, and amounting to $5,130.50 (Providence Mission $2,645.52, Fort Resolution $2,486.98) be devoted to this purpose.\n\nAlthough the request is an unusual one, the Superintendent General is in favour of acceding thereto to the extent of $5,000 and accordingly recommends that this amount be charged to the Vote for Indian Education for 1922-23 for the purpose above referred to, on the understanding that this payment is not to form a precedent for future requests of a like nature.\n\nThe Board concur in the above recommendation and submit the same for favourable consideration.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nTo payment as compensation for loss sustained to boats and fishing gear used in connection with the obtaining of the food supply, etc., for the pupils and staff of the Providence Mission and Fort Resolution Indian Boarding Schools, N.W.T.\n\nPaid by authority of P.C. 62/1574,\n\nApproved July 27, 1922.\n\nCertified Correct\n\nHead Clerk, Schools Branch.\n\nAug. 3/22.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1922 Aug. 3 | To payment as compensation for loss sustained to boats and fishing gear used in connection with the obtaining of the food supply, etc., for the pupils and staff of the Providence Mission and Fort Resolution Indian Boarding Schools, N.W.T.

Although this request was an unusual one, the Superintendent General is in favour of acceding thereto, to the extent of the above amount, on the understanding that this payment is not to form a precedent for future requests of a like nature.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform the Rt. Rev. Bishop Breynat of this payment having been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. G. Lefebvre, O.M.I.,\nSt. Joachim's Church,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nRev. Father Lefebvre has forwarded to me your favour dated Aug. 4 File No 134-4-1, informing us that your Department had allowed by cheque No 1421 the sum of $500.00 in payment as a compensation for loss sustained to boats and fishing gear at Providence and Resolution Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nIs it necessary for me to tell you that the cheque has been the most welcome and will prove a great relief to the priest and brothers whose share is to go on the lake and take out from it the fish yearly necessary to keep our children alive.\n\nAs for myself, I consider it as new token of the generous interest you always have been taking in our work amongst the Indians. Please accept my most heartfelt thanks and believe me\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBishop of Adr.\nVic. Apost. of Mackenzie.\nJanuary 21, 1925.\n\nMEMO:\n\nIn letter dated November 19, 1924, on file 141-2-1, Rev. Sister A. McQuillan advises the Department that she will no longer be principal of the Fort Resolution Residential School as she has been transferred by her religious superiors to Aklavik.\nMay 29, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nMr. Moran, of the Northwest Territories Branch, Department of the Interior, has shown me their files with reference to hospital wings in the Fort Resolution and Hay River Indian Residential Schools. That Department has refused to designate these schools as hospitals, the Department of Health having advised them that it would be \"an extremely dangerous situation to set up. Children are potential subjects of all of the infectious diseases, and during such an outbreak a school seems to me to be contrary to all the recognized principles of health protection. I certainly think a hospital (separate building) is required and should be insisted upon.\" On the grounds, the Interior Department are not paying grants for the hospitalization of patients being treated at the Fort Resolution or Hay River Indian Residential Schools.\n\nOur Department is allowing grants for patients at both schools (Files Nos. 74-139 and 50-139). The Department has written to Dr. Bourget, the Indian agent, regarding the advisability of keeping a patient with an infectious disease at the Hay River School. As a matter of policy, should we allow hospital patients in our residential schools? There is no question but what the authorities of the schools were prompted solely by charity, as they have kept this patient for 24 years without grant.\n\nI presume that the Interior Department will probably cooperate with us in the provision of funds and in the erection of hospital which may be found necessary in the Northwest Territories. The present discussion leads me to believe that a hospital to be constructed either under Royal tax or state surplus funds could be established at Hay River, where the land is suitable for gardening. Further, it appears that Fort Resolution requires a hospital and this fact was brought to our attention by Mr. Lord Bishop Breynat in October, 1923 (114-145). There is a physician at Resolution but not at Hay River. Bishop Breynat's scheme was a combined residential school and hospital, which was changed eventually and which would certainly not be a proper arrangement.\n\nIf funds are provided by either the Department of the Interior or this Department, or by both, the Department of Health would submit plans for suitable buildings.\n\nThis memorandum has been written, following Mr. Moran's visit, in the interests of the health of the Indian children in residential schools and in the interests of all members of communities who require hospital treatment.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nI have the honour to report on conditions of the Agency during the month of November 1925.\n\nAn inspection of all the classes was made, and good progress appreciated at Resolution. Even in the youngsters the way they learn the language is very encouraging, showing good talent in the children and patience from the teacher's part.\n\nThe children, new comers this year, were immunized against diphtheria, during the month of November, keeping all the school children safe against that disease.\n\nThe winter promises to be hard for the Indians and old people especially. The rabbits are very scarce, the ptarmigans were also few this fall, and apparently the fur animals are not getting much food, mice which were so numerous last year are not seen this fall, either extint or migrated.\n\nThe mode of living of the Indians in this country is changing with time and, they now have ambition to build houses, and possess gas boats, leaving all the old industries of building canoes aside, and I often wonder if industrial school should not be more important than the teaching of English, French grammar and Geography, etc.\n\nThe knowledge of one language takes the rest of the time devoted exclusively to teaching some thing that would be practicable to the Indians would make them more self dependent and it seems to me the style of education would appeal more to the Indians. Certain branches of industry specially adapted to their needs with the idea of improving their abilities in making a living. Their talent is good and they have good ability in carpenter's work, mechanical talent well on the way to progress, and if science could be brought in their way of fishing, trapping and even stock raising or \"fur farming\" could do a great deal towards the improvement of their life. As soon as they leave school, under present conditions they have no means of keeping in touch with what they have learnt, and forget everything in no time; besides they are handicapped when trying to make their living, and this is the fear of the Indians when sending their children to school. Only very few positions on interpreters are needed and the supply is always great. Of course the knowledge of the two languages is an asset to a man, but their time in school is too short for them to learn from the beginning the two languages then well enough to remember them well, so that if one was learnt well, and all other time devoted to industries for their living, they would be better equipped for life, from their point of view.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Bourget, M.D.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 21, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your report, dated the 2nd ultimo, which is relative to conditions and training at the Resolution Indian Residential School. I should be grateful if you would discuss with the Rev. Principal the advisability of giving more vocational education to the boys and explain that the Department favours the half day system, i.e., morning or afternoon in the classroom and the other part of the day in farming, gardening, care of stock, carpentry, or whatever will assist them when they graduate. If instruction can be given along lines which will make the graduate a better trapper, fisherman, etc., it should receive an important place in the school life. This should be the practice at all Indian residential schools and I will be very pleased to learn that some steps have been taken at Resolution to make the training more practical.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. Bourget, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nResolution, N.W.T.\nOttawa, Canada, March 19th, 1927\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe authorities of Fort Resolution Indian Residential School have advised me of the sad plight in which they are placed during this present year on account of the low earnings of the school.\n\nYou are perhaps aware that twenty seven children from Fort Rae did not return for the school term of 1926-27. I can not help but state that the school authorities are not solely to blame for this misfortune.\n\nTherefore, taking into consideration this fact and the heavy expenses incurred in the management of such a distant school, I take the liberty of asking from you if a special consideration could be given in order to alleviate the burden.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6474, file 916-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMarch 23, 1927.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, concerning the small earnings of the Resolution Indian Residential School during the past few months. The Department regrets the delinquency of the children from Fort Rae, and, in view of the circumstances, I have asked Mr. Ferrier to make the new per capita grant rate in the case of this school effective for the whole of the current fiscal year. This will considerably assist the management with their financing.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Joe Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFort McMurray September 21, 1927.\n\nTo D.C. Scott, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of the Interior, Ottawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUp to the present, the two Indian Boarding Schools of Resolution and Providence have received a grant for, respectively 50 and 65 children. Owing to the fluctuation which always occur in those establishments, it happens sometimes that the pupils in one of those schools outnumber the total for which the grant is being paid, while they run short in the other.\n\nI would therefore respectfully suggest and recommend that a global grant for 120 pupils be arranged for, so as to enable us to maintain a good standard in any of those two schools.\n\nRespectfully yours,\nSeptember 29, 1927.\n\nDear Bishop Breynat:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, requesting that a combined pupilage of 120 be allowed at the Resolution and Providence Indian Residential Schools. I may state that, at the present time, the pupilage at Resolution is 60 and at Providence, 65 - a total of 125. I have directed that a combined grant for 125 pupils at the rate of $180 be allowed in the case of these two institutions in future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Dr. Bourget, in a very general way, appeared to be somewhat concerned as to the problem of food supply among these Indians but as stated above nothing further has been heard from him and no specific request made for any relief other than that usually accorded.\n\nI regret that I cannot give you more definite information and that it is not possible to have immediate communication with Dr. Bourget.

The sermons are preached to them in English French or Chipewyan but they have to make a resume in English for the Monday school. This particular sermon was in French, and when we consider that the two languages are not their language, the age of the children it is a satisfaction to know that they learn to write letters fairly well when they come out of school.\n\nIn this particular instance the best three copies were two half breed children and one Treaty girl, but often the Indian children are first.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

We actually have over one hundred children.\n\nMay I ask you to be kind enough to raise the actual number of pupils to 80, and have necessary appropriation included in the estimate for the coming fiscal year.\n\nInspector C.C.

Before giving consideration, it will be necessary to know the exact dimensions of the dormitories that are used for the pupils. I should be grateful if Your Lordship would have the Reverend Principal give the Department the information. Three dimensions for each dormitory should be given.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. G. Breynat, O.M.I., D.D.,\nFort Smith,\nN.W.T.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6474, file 916-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit to the Department, for consideration, a question that Bishop Breynat, since his return from the Arctic, asked us to give our attention to.\n\nThe point relates to the possibility, in the near future that the Department may consider to take in treaty quite a few of our half breeds of Resolution, Rae and others and in that event, the number of children admitted to our Indian school, specially of Resolution, will be increased, or at least the proportion under our Department care should be augmented, and Bishop Breynat asked us if the time was not suitable to increase the grant of children, from sixty, as at present, to about ninety. We promised to submit this important question to the Department immediately, so that the scheme change may be effected when the half Breeds are taken under the treaty protection. We hope that we are not too late, if the Department views are favorable to that increase of the grant.\n\nThe size of the building at Resolution would speak in favor of this innovation. The school is large, substantially built, and can accommodate that number of children, and be within the desirable amount.\n\nThere are three large dormitories, two for girls, one for boys, and two class rooms, one of which is rather large, and the other, smaller, is only for the beginners. Each dormitory has a fire exit direct outside, and the dimensions of each are submitted:\n\n| Dormitory for boys | 56x36x10-20,100 feet C |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| 1st Dormitory for girls | 56x36x10-20,100 \" \" |\n| 2nd Dormitory for girls | 40 x22 x10-8,500 \" \" |\n\n| Class room | 56 x36 x10-20,100 \" \" |\n|------------|------------------------|\n| Class room | 28 x 36 x 10-10,680 \" \" |\n\nMany large windows in these dormitories and class rooms supply a good ventilation, and light is ample.\n\nWe also understand that next summer the Mission has intentions of making extensive alterations to the roof, giving more room if any thing.\n\nWe intend to exercise more persuasion every year in order to get more children to the schools, and we figure that the Indian children shall always have the preference, because the half breeds who are not on treaty yet, and those who do not contemplate to join the treaty are sending their children to school, often without any remuneration whatsoever; and as they are not considered destitutes in the full sense of the word, they are taking the place of Indians, at the expense of the various Missions.\nTo the present may children, half Breeds, whose parents are alive, are in the three schools of the agency, these missions do not get any compensation from the parents who can not afford often the expenses, and as they are not destitutes in the strict meaning of the law, nobody pays for them and the missions have to keep them and clothe them also and it would be only fair that when some of the parents of these children do take the treaty, the grant would be included for these children. It would leave quite a few still kept clothed and educated by the schools without any help. Because the half breeds are not eligible, or will not take treaty, and often have large families with two or three children in boarding schools.\n\nIf the Department favors this change, I would be pleased to inform Bishop Breynat of the increase.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Bourget M.D.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 18, 1929.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to refer to the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of the 13th instant, asking for information concerning the size of the dormitories at the Resolution Indian Residential School. The Department has just received this information from Mr. Indian Agent Bourget, and I am pleased to inform Your Lordship that it has been decided to allow a pupilage of 80 as from the first of April next, which is the earliest date that funds can be provided for the purpose.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. G. Breynat, O. M. I., D.D.,\nFort Smith,\nN. W. T.\nOttawa, November 18, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, urging an increase in the pupilage at the Fort Resolution Indian Residential School. The Department has been in correspondence with His Lordship Bishop Breynat in this connection, and, as you have now given the dimensions of the dormitories, a decision can be reached. As from April first, next, the beginning of the new fiscal year\u2014which is the earliest that the necessary funds can be provided\u2014a pupilage of 60 will be allowed. If the school authorities find that a further small increase is required, they should bring the matter to the Department's attention next year.\n\nThe question of admitting half-breeds who are about to take treaty can be decided after any such have been formally admitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mackenzie, Acting Assistant Deputy Secretary, dated November 18, 1929 in which he informs me of the allowance of pupilage to $60 for our residential school at Resolution.\n\nHis Lordship received the news with satisfaction, and he directed me to convey his heartfelt thanks for this new grant on the part of your Department.\n\nHe also wants me to tender you his sincere greetings for the coming holidays and especially for the new year.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nActing Secretary.\nSir,\n\nWe have started the violet rays treatment of many children in the Convent, and have also inoculated all the new comers, first injection, the others to come every three weeks, before our departure if we have to go, and vaccination next. We hope to finish this before the middle of December. The majority of the children look fairly well, this fall, and all precautions are taken to avoid these severe colds. The food is very good. This Mission having killed fourteen steers, a good supply of frozen fish, and the diet will be combined with the best, to our liking, hundreds of sacks of vegetables, beets carrots, turnips, cabbages, and potatoes as much as the children can eat.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) C.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Doctor,\n\nI respectfully beg to call your attention to the fact that, owing to tremendous rates we have to pay for the transportation of our annual outfit from railways terminals to our residential schools in the Mackenzie District, we cannot give to our school children all the proper food and care they would need.\n\nAs a result, our annual accounts wind up with a serious deficit.\n\nConsequently I instantly request that the Department raise the actual per capita grant to two hundred dollars a year for our two residential schools of Fort Resolution and Providence which are respectively 516 and 670 miles from the terminals of the Northern Alberta Railways.\n\nFrom McMurray to Providence the actual freight rate is $100.00 a ton, and to Resolution $80.00 a ton.\n\nHoping for a favourable consideration of my demand,\n\nI remain, Dear Doctor,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nBishop of Adr.,\nVic. Apost. of Mackenzie.\nDecember 20, 1930.\n\nDear Bishop Breynat:\n\nI have your Lordship's letter of the 3rd instant, asking for a substantial increase in the per capita grant at the Resolution and Providence Indian Residential Schools. I am aware of the difficulties of financing when transportation costs are high, and for this reason these schools get a higher grant than those near the railroads. I should like to make the grant still more generous if funds for the purpose were available, but there are so many claims on our appropriation that our estimates this year had to be prepared with more than usual care. Next October when we are striking estimates again, I shall be glad to keep your Lordship's request in mind.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRt. Rev. G. Breynat, O.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop of Mackenzie,\nFort Smith,\nN.W.T.\nMonsieur le Docteur,\n\n\u00c0 l'occasion de sa visite de notre mission, Monseigneur Breynat a constat\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n\nPendant ces derniers temps, Mr J. Donevan, domicili\u00e9 au Fort R\u00e9solution, a entretenu, avec une de nos jeunes filles de l'\u00e9cole, Augustine Boucher, enfant du trait\u00e9, que nous a confi\u00e9 son p\u00e8re, en mourant, des relations qui font br\u00fbler \u00e0 la discipline et que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de nos enfants et la bonne r\u00e9putation de notre couvent nous interdisent de supporter plus longtemps.\n\nMr J. Donevan avait connu ladite Augustine assez famili\u00e8rement lorsque, pour un certain laps de temps, elle v\u00e9cut en dehors de l'\u00e9cole.\n\nD\u00e8s la rentr\u00e9e de la jeune fille au couvent, il commen\u00e7a \u00e0 lui envoyer des fruits et lui en envoya plusieurs reprises. Les envois se renouvelant, crus bon d'avertir Mr J. Donevan que les fruits ne seraient pas leur destinataire.\n\nC'est alors qu'arriva une premi\u00e8re robe.\n\nComme mon attention avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en \u00e9veil par l'envoi r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 des fruits, la robe fut gard\u00e9e \u00e0 la mission, et, en m\u00eame temps que j'avertissais le donateur de vouloir bien mettre fin \u00e0 des relations qui pouvaient devenir compromettantes, je l'invitai \u00e0 venir reprendre possession de son bien. Ce qu'il se garda bien de faire.\n\nAu contraire, peu de temps apr\u00e8s mon avertissement, une nouvelle robe arriva pour la jeune fille. Sans h\u00e9siter, je la renvoyai avec la premi\u00e8re.\n\nEt voil\u00e0 que la semaine derni\u00e8re un kodak \u00e9tait apport\u00e9 par Lois Brown, de la part de Donevan, pour \u00eatre \u00e9chang\u00e9 contre un autre, envoy\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Augustine, qui s'avouait troubl\u00e9e par ces instances r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9es, renvoya tout simplement les deux kodaks au donateur.\n\nIl y eut aussi des lettres introduites clandestinement. Augustine n'osa pas les montrer \u00e0 personne et les br\u00fbla.\n\nOr vous savez que cette jeune fille \u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 un jeune homme, Leforty, \u00e0 un tel point que la publication des bans \u00e9tait faite et que le jour avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 pour la c\u00e9l\u00e9bration du mariage... La veille du jour fix\u00e9, la jeune fille rompit ses engagements.\n\nJ. Donevan ne cache pas la joie que lui causait cette rupture.

Bourget\nIndian Agent\nFort Resolution, N.W.T.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the occasion of his visit at our mission,\nBishop Breynat noticed what follows:\n\nFor sometime, Mr. J. Donovan, domiciled at\nFort Resolution, has kept, with one of our young\nschool girls, Augustine Loucheur, a child of the\nCree, which was instructed to us by her dying\nfather; relations which are against the discipline\nand the interest of our children and the good\nname of our convent. Forbids us to allow such a\nthing any longer.\n\nMr. J. Donovan had known the said August-\nine quite familiarly when, for a certain time,\nshe lived out of school.\n\nAt the very beginning of her return at the con-\nvent, he started to send her gifts, and did so in\nseveral occasions. The sending being renewed,\nI thought well to warn Mr. J. Donovan that\nthe gifts would not be delivered to the girl.\n\nIt is then that he sent a first dress.\n\nAs my attention had been drawn by the\nrepeated delivery of gifts, the dress was kept at the\nMission, and at the same time I notified the\ndonor to put a stop to relations which might\nbecome compromising. Invited him to take\nback his belonging. But he dared not to do.\n\nOn the contrary, shortly after my warning a\nnew dress arrived for the young girl. Without\nhesitation, I sent it with the first one.\n\nLast week a Kodak was brought by Louis.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 916-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nfrom Donovan, to be exchanged for another which was sent previously. Augustine, who admitted he was troubled by such repeated attention, simply returned both Kodaks to the donor.\n\nThere were also letters introduced in a clandestine way. Augustine did not dare show them anybody else.\n\nYou also know that the young girl was engaged to a young man, J. Safery, to such an extent that the church banns were published and the date set for the wedding. The day before the fixed date the young girl broke the engagement.\n\nJ. Donovan did not hide the joy that the rupture caused him. He even boasted in presence of several witnesses that he would have other marriages broken. By such bragging was he not showing that he had caused the breaking off which was giving him such great satisfaction? Rumors even go so far that he intends to marry Augustine when she leaves the convent, yet everybody knows that Donovan is already married; that his legitimate wife is still living and that he is over sixty years of age.\n\nIn presence of these facts, His Grace has requested me to ask you if there is not sufficient reason to take judicial action against J. Donovan to safeguard the honour of our school and to prevent renewal of such condemnable actions.\n\nIn the affirmative you will kindly take the necessary steps to have the matter judged without delay.\n\nThanking you in advance, I beg you, Sir, to receive the expression of my respectful acknowledgements.\n\n(Signed) A. Manson, Priest\n\nO.M.I.\nSir,\n\nI beg to send to the Department, one letter received from the Mission, concerning a resident of Resolution, interfering with the discipline of the school. Unfortunately as Justice of the peace we could do nothing in that case, and we send the letter of complaint in the hope that the Department may be able to give some advise.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nC.

Feeding, clothing and so on, of our pupils, becomes a real problem to me; and I am compelled to make a further appeal for the increase to $200.00 in the per capita grant, as per my letter of December 3, 1930, at the Residential Schools of Beaulieu and Providence.\n\nI hope that you will see your way to relieve the situation in this matter in the near future.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Adromute,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie.\nOctober 31, 1931.\n\nDear Bishop Breynat:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 12th instant, urging the Department to increase the per capita grant in the case of the Resolution and Providence Indian Residential Schools.

School at Fort Resolution.\n\nAt the time of my visit there were 75 children present, although it was holiday-time, and no school was being operated.\n\nI found that the girls were being taught the usual household duties of sewing and mending, cooking, &c. The boys do the chores and gardening, and are also taught to make snow-shoes, do a small amount of trapping, &c. I saw samples of the work done in the class-room, and as far as I could judge, it was fairly well done. Of course these children are not kept in school for very many years, and the highest standing they attain is Grade V.\n\nThe main building of this school was erected in 1908, and has been added to periodically since that time. It is situated in the Fort, and is right near the lake, and they depend entirely on driftwood for their firewood.\n\nThey keep a few cattle and do a little farming, and the following is the stock that is kept there: 6 oxen, 3 horses, 10 cows and 6 other young cattle.

One of the exceptions was a little chap from Simpson who was recovering from an attack of Broncho-Pneumonia (the second in two years) and we can thank Nursing Sister Desrochers for his regaining his health. She never left him for more than twenty minutes during his entire illness. When I examined him I found him improving almost hourly and beginning to eat well, so I have every confidence that he is now entirely recovered. I also attended a number of the residents of Providence and extracted as always a large number of teeth. I have pulled so many teeth there that I almost think at times that one person does the chewing for all his nearest neighbors.\n\nDr. W. A. M.

Neary:\n\nI discussed the report with Mr. Inspector McKinnon. There were certain points which required clarification as the report was made by Mr. Lambert from notes supplied. The report has been revised and will be sent out.\n\n22 Aug 47\nAugust 9, 1947.\n\nMr. Meikle\n\nRe - Fort Resolution Roman Catholic Residential School\n\nI inspected the above mentioned school on June 7th and 8th, examined the building and observed the instruction given by the staff.\n\nRepresentatives of the Mission informed me that the school building is quite inadequate and should be replaced as soon as possible. After checking the building carefully I concur in this view. The building presents a real fire hazard. The foundation is decayed and heaved. The class rooms are small and unhealthy. It is therefore recommended that the replacement of this building be an item on the Educational Building Program for the Northwest Territories.\n\nI encountered considerable criticism of the school on the part of Residents of the Settlement. Many complained that the children were not learning very much by attendance. While such statements are not uncommon wherever a school is functioning, I do feel that a good deal of such criticism could be mitigated by making the instruction in each class more practical and vocational. For example, the instructional program in every school ought to include some training in sewing, home economics, woodwork, leather craft, motor mechanics and machine shop practice. I have endeavoured to make an immediate start in this direction, and instructions have been issued to Mr. L.E. Drummond, Departmental Agent, to send forward to the various Residential schools in the Territories a bundle of mixed woods together with a kit of tools to be used in working same.\n\nThe members of the teaching staff are as follows:\n\nSister Edna Gagnon - holds a Model Diploma for the Province of Quebec, and has 13 years teaching experience. She teaches Grade 1 and 2, and has 23 Residential pupils and 16 Day school pupils, making a total enrolment of 41. Attendance at the time of the visit was 23, most of whom were beginners. The teacher is conscientious and interested in her work. The reading is very good, the writing is excellent, and the pupils are making good progress in their number work.\nSister Marguerite Bourlai - holds no teaching certificate but has fifteen years experience. She teaches Grades 1 and 2, has 25 Residential pupils and 16 day school pupils, making a total enrolment of 41. There were 29 pupils in attendance at the time of the visit. I examined some of the hand work being done by the pupils, listened to their reading, and enjoyed the singing.\n\nSister Oliva Lavoie - holds a second class permanent Alberta Certificate and has taught for 19 years. She has Grades 3 to 6. The total pupilage is 125, made up of 78 Residential and 47 day school pupils. The school is equipped with a silent film projector. It does not receive Radio Broadcasts. The children received a medical examination and are X-rayed for T.B. on their arrival at school. They also received Dental and Eye examinations. This teacher is very industrious. The children's notebooks were exceptionally good.\n\nThe teachers in the Territories quite understandably are not familiar with the enterprise method of education now being used so successfully in the Provinces. Its most valuable feature is that it encourages and trains the children in self expression. On subsequent visits I hope that there will be an opportunity to discuss this method fully with the teachers at the various settlements.\n\nI would suggest that this school be furnished with a good set of Basic Readers. These are required in order that the native children may learn to read by the use of the most modern technique. The teachers have requested readers, knitting wool, prints for making aprons and dresses, and a sound film projector.\n\nThe teachers at these schools complain of the poor attendance and feel that some measures should be taken to remedy the condition. They feel that some authority other than the church should impress upon the parents the importance of sending a child to school. The teachers feel that school attendance is an important means of fighting the spread of T.B. They say housing conditions are very poor and that in many cases families are living on a starvation level.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.W. McKinnon,\nInspector of Schools.\nAugust 9, 1947.\n\nMr. R. A.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended 30th June 1930.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 30th June 1930\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at St. Regis 1930\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Fort Resolution Agency**\n\n**Report of the St. Joseph School at Fort Resolution on Great Slave Lake Reserve

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Resolution School for the Quarter ended 19.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: 19.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Resolution this 29 day of March 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Saint Joseph's School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal Sister Olivia Savio\n\nDated July 2nd 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Ft.

CANADA**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the..............................................................School for the Quarter ended.........................................................10.\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................10.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at.................................................................10.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 408\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Saint Joseph's School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal: Sister Olivia Savoie\n\nDated January 7th 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonag No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI Hummly Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................School for the Quarter ended .........................................................19 .....\n\nPrincipal ...........................................................................\n\nDated .................................................................19 ....\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at .................................................................this .................................................................19 ....\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 3rd 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Resolution this 5th of April 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9.

ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 21st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet; paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan. 7th 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Resolution this 17th Jan. 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter for all pupils shown on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Fort Resolution Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Sacred Heart Residential School at Fort Providence on Mackenzie River Reserve for Quarter ended September 30, 1953**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                |     |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0317            | Cecilia Martin | 9   |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0320            | Jane Antoine   | 10  |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0321            | Josephine Leves | 10 |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0325            | Violet Dickens | 12  |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0327            | Rose Conchita  | 11  |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0328            | Mabel Hardy    | 8   |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0329            | Georgina George| 11 |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0330            | Emma Sanchez   | 9   |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0331            | Margaret Tom   | 10  |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0332            | Mary Intelli   | 15  |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0333            | Jane Lalle     | 16  |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0335            | Laura Matin    | 9   |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0336            | Annette Matin  | 11  |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0337            | Rose Mary Takahon | 8 |     |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0338            | Sarah H.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: September 30, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: Yellowknife, R.W.T., this 10th Oct. 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the Sacred Heart Residential School at Fort Providence on Mackenzie River Reserve for Quarter ended September 30, 1946**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                 |     |     |      |                |                   |                         |                             |            |\n| 271             | Joseph Taylor   | 12  | 1   |      |                |                   |                         |                             |            |\n| 272             | David B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1951.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated March 31st, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Yellowknife, R.W.T., this March 31st, 1951.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. IA-403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the ST.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will allowance be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. JOSEPH'S RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30th, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated JUNE 29th, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nDated at Yellowknife, July 20, 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. JOSEPH'S RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: SEPTEMBER 28th 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Yellowknife, N.W.T.\n\nthis Oct. 13th 1951.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Agency**\n\nREPORT of the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarter's per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. JOSEPH'S RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended SEPT. 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal: Sister J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.
