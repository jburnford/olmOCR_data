MAVEETY\n\nPRINCE ALBERT N.W.T.\n\nSUNDAY CHURCH SERVICES\n\nNEW YORK\n\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 17, 1888.\n\nTHE BEER QUESTION.\n\nThe regulation allowing barley to be imported and still beer will be, we fear, not prove satisfactory. We assume that it is the wish of the people of these Territories to have beer. But the people do not wish to import it. It is just as easy to say that rye is as good barley as any in the land for making gin-seeds, and that we can manufacture as good an article as any made elsewhere. Again, the beer we are to be allowed to import must be of such strength that it contains alcohol. Beer of that description might answer very well along the line of railway where there will be no difficulty of importation, but will not be the Saskatchewan. It will be impossible for the beer to arrive up here in the winter months; therefore a hotelkeeper will have to lay in his winter supply before cold weather, and beer of the strength limited will scarcely keep from Winnipeg to here. Well, beer will likely be all winter; it is simply what is called \"pot beer,\" made to be drunk forthwith. We require an article containing at least seven per cent. alcohol. Until we have had experience established, it occurs to us that we are as well off with the beer now present manufactured in such enormous quantities all over the Territories, and from which the Government derives one million dollars revenue. We believe, as we said before, that Lieut.-Governor Royal has taken a step in the popular direction, but we think that His Honour should have gone a step further, he should have given the maximum strength of our beer at four per cent., and he should assert himself in the direction of some manufacture by using his influence for the establishment of a brewery in districts of population. No doubt there are a large number, and strong amongst them, such as the Dominion Attorney, who will do object to any concessions made in this respect, but speaking from our own personal information we can say they do not make any concessions of a majority of those immediately interested, and should not be allowed more than such influence as their numerical strength entitles them to in such matters. This question will eventually have to be taken hold of by the Dominion Government and settled, either by direct\nA HANDSOME DONATION.\n\nThe following has been handed to me by a prominent citizen of Prince Albert, who desires me to make known existing between the police and the Hudson's Bay officers and clerks.\n\nDear Major Perry,\n\nThe officers and members of the Hudson's Bay Company, serving in the Saskatchewan District, desire to present a cup to F. and C. Division of the North-West Mounted Police, for the purpose of doing a good turn to the men of the force who have been so kindly feeling that exists between the officers, non-commissioned officers and constables of the two troops and companies.\n\nWe enclose a cheque for $100, and will be pleased if you will forward it to Sergeant Major McPhee. We also, if successful, will be in Toronto to purchase a cup and kindly bring it back with him.\n\nIf possible, Mr. Captain Howe, of C. Division, would assume the responsibility of deciding under what conditions the cup shall be competed for, you will consider it a favor.\n\nWe are, dear Major Perry\n\nSincerely,\n\nL. Clark, J. H.

I have forwarded a copy of your letter to Captain Howe and will confer with him regarding the conditions of competition. I will inform you as to what conclusion we come to. It will be the endeavor of the officers of F Division to retain your handsome trophy.\n\nAgain thanking you and the officers and gentlemen of your company for the generous gift.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nMy dear Mr. Clark,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.

Rebellion Against Canada Expected.\n\nWASHINGTON, August 5.\u2014A Democratic Congressman of prominence, in the course of his speech last night before the Republican Senate caucus, the Fisherman Treaty the President will take the earliest opportunity to carry out the resolutions of Congress, and that military measures even to the extent of proclaiming non-intercourse with Canada. He said: \"There is no question but that in the speeches of the Republican Senators on the Fisheries question. The Canadian government, of course, never took any steps to prevent the passage of American fishing vessels, and the first case of outrage clear enough to awaken popular indignation will be answered by a proclamation of non-intercourse. There will be no lack of opportunity when he is on the look-out. The President will not be able to throw the whole burden of responsibility on the Republican Senate with the full knowledge of the situation.\"\n\nThe Senate will undoubtedly reject the treaty. No different result is expected by anybody.\n\nTHE N.W.M. POLICE WILL LIKELY BE ABOLISHED IN THE NORTH-WEST, IN THE NEAR FUTURE, AND THE MILITIA SYSTEM INTRODUCED.\n\nSeveral North-West papers are urging the extermination of the Mounted Police in the North-west and abolishing the police. It is becoming evident to the militia authorities that this will have to be done. It is found that the expense incurred by the Mounted Police is more than the expenditure required for the whole of the militia force. The Hon. Mr. Justice of Mitika was interviewed on the subject. He said: \"Oh, yes, I have seen all that has appeared in the newspapers upon the subject. It is a very large question, however, and nothing can be done until parliament decides, but course shall be followed.\"\n\n\"Are you in favor of the militia system being introduced in the North-west?\"\n\n\"There is no question about it but that every province should be treated alike. Force is required there as much as here.\"\n\n\"Do you think the militia could be introduced?\"\n\n\"I am sure it will come to that sometime or other. At any rate parliament will decide the question.\"\n\nIt is believed that if the question is raised at all and is decided to have militia in the North-west, that the levies made will consist for the most part of cavalry, as the militia, under certain circumstances of troops at various points would be a very easy matter.\u2014Ottawa Free Press.\n\nMr. T. Oram, the popular hotel-man, gives us some advice. Says he: \"I have no expectations to make a short time with the necessary requirements for a first-class bar, under the new regulations in regard to the sale of beer.\"\n\nA FRIGHTFUL SKIN DISEASE.\n\nA Frightful Skin Disease\u2014Body Covered with Sores\u2014Cured by Paine's Celery Compound.\n\nMrs. Stevens & Bremer, Monroe Co.

My husband was afflicted with eczema for a long time, and I thought it best to try your remedy. After using it twice daily for three weeks, his skin became smooth and soft, and the eczema disappeared.

It has been decided to take steps to have the walls of the church painted. The work will be done by a crew employed by the church.\n\nFORT MACLEOD.\n\nFrom the Gazette, August 1.\n\nA colonist gentleman arrived from Calgary by train Monday morning. He had been away for several weeks, but returned by rail.\n\nREGINA.\n\nFrom the Leader, August 7.\n\nThe Hon. E. Dewdney arrived from Regina on Monday morning.

A large quantity of grain was loaded on William's Lake a field of thirty-five acres of grain was eaten perfectly clean. The grain was loaded in the attempt to drive the grain shippers out of business. At Calmar the hoppers were filled so thick as to prevent the cattle from feeding.\n\nA correspondent sends a receipt for the prevention of cattle from bloats. It is said that the receipt is made by boiling two quarts of oil of colic 1 oz, of olive oil 1 oz, of linseed oil 1 oz, glycerine 2 oz, per acre.\n\nThe herd of cattle brought from the Stewart ranch, which it was expected would be loaded to-day for Montreal, was loaded to-day for Winnipeg on the prairie. It is said that a large number more of cattle will be brought to the prairie to-day. It is thought that the herd will be loaded to-day for Montreal, where a steamer will be chartered to carry the Calgary consignment.\n\nFrom the Herald, August 6.\n\nA new departure in wool shipping from Calgary is being made by Mr. D. W. Wilson. This innovation of shipping in bulky cases is having it pressed by horse power with a pressing machine. The cases are said to be more convenient to handle and will enable him to get 24,000 pounds in a car. It is thought that other wool growers will follow Mr. Wilson's example.\n\nFor why not the wool raisers combine and start a wool factory in Calgary? The factory shipper could be here at 3 o'clock to-night. It consisted of fourteen cars containing 225 head. The owner was Mr. Wilson. Mr. Eakin, members of an eastern syndicate, and were consigned to R. Bickerton & Co., Montreal. The train, which will run through Winnipeg, will be loaded with padding, left here with a twenty-five mile order, which brings them to Winnipeg on Wednesday morning.\n\nNEW GOODS NOW OPEN.\n\nLacies' Jerseys and Jackets, Corsets, Bustles, Hosiery and Gloves, and a full line of General Dry Goods.\n\nMen's and Boys' Hats!\n\nIn Fall and Spring.
