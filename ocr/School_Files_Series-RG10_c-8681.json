Phelan.\nRe: School Children of White Fish Lake\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Reverend Father Ducharme, Missionary at La Loche Saskatchewan, in which he says that during the last week in August he chartered a plane to bring back to the Beauval School twelve Indian Children from White Fish Lake. None of these children were willing to return so his trip was a useless one. It appears that your sub-agent, at Ile \u00e0 la Crosse, Mr. Tunstead notified Mr. Packman, agent at Meadow Lake about this matter. Mr. Packman answered that he could do nothing more than cancel the family allowance for the parents of these children.\n\nIt seems to me that if the above lack of interest in such a vital matter as school attendance, the agent should be reprimended and told that recruiting is one of his personal duties as Indian Agent.\n\nIf I am correctly informed Beauval has more than its authorized number of children and it does not matter very much whether these children from White Fish Lake are in attendance or not, but it is unfortunate that such a large group of children should remain without any education through the fault of an Agent of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOctober 28, 1948.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWe have your letter of the 28th instant with reference to children from Whitefish Lake Reserve whom you wish to recruit for the Beauval Residential School.\n\nBefore communicating with our officials regarding the matter, I would like to know if Father Ducharme communicated with either the Sub-Agent, Mr. Tunstead or the Superintendent, Mr. Packman before he proceeded to Whitefish Lake Reserve.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nNovember 4, 1948.\n\nRev.

I do not recommend this as it is indefinite and whether she remains in the school till she is seventeen years of age or longer she will still be in the same position when discharged from the school.\n\nWith regard to pupil 0316, Rosalie Heneault, apparently this girl is unusually bright and might be considered for further education, I would therefore recommend that if her parents are willing she continue for at least another year on trial, with a view to continuing on through high school if her work in the next year appears to justify.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nAIR MAIL\n\nJuly 21st, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Bldg.,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nRe: Beauval Indian Residential School. Your File 1747-25-2-171\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant regarding 2 Indian girls at the above school who have passed the age of 16.\n\nWith regard to Bella Smallboy, No. 0290, we are not exactly certain what you mean when you say she is destitute. Does this mean that she is an orphan and has no relatives with whom she can live, or does it mean that her parents are unable to support her? In order that there will be no misunderstanding on the part of all parties concerned, it is felt that the Principal should be requested to state definitely if in the event of the girl's remaining in the school, she will simply be used as an unpaid member of the staff, or if she will obtain either additional classroom education or a special training which would be of advantage to her. For this purpose I enclose a form which the Principal should complete and have returned to this office.\n\nIn view of the contents of the last paragraph of your letter, pupil No. 0316, Rosalie Heneault, may remain in the school for another year.\n\nBernard F.

Schieff of Brochet, Manitoba, transporting Indian school pupils in an unlicensed aircraft.\n\nIn telephone conversation with Mr. Jones of Prince Albert, he informed me that this offence occurred in connection with the Reverend Father recruiting and transporting Indian pupils to the school at the commencement of the term.\n\nIt is quite possible that Mr. Schieff's aircraft was used by more than one school Principal. I do not think there will be any reoccurrence, as I have issued instructions to all Indian Superintendents that they will impress it upon the Reverend Father, in charge of the schools, that Indian pupils must not be conveyed in any aircraft unless both the plane and the pilot are licensed by the Air Transport Board.\n\nJ.P.B.

The R.C.M.P. have been requested to investigate his alleged illegal operations.\n\nIn view of the information received, the Board directed that this matter be brought to the attention of your Branch as you will, no doubt, wish to issue instructions to your Field Officers to refrain from requesting air transportation from air carriers other than those licensed by the Board.\n\nWould you please investigate the alleged illegal transportation of school children by Schieff on behalf of your Department and inform the Board of the result of your investigation.\n\nYour co-operation in this respect will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGerald Morisset,\nSecretary.\nJune 21st, 1950.\n\nThe Secretary,\nAir Transport Board,\nNo. 3 Temporary Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 2-R61\n\nWith reference to your letters of April 6th and June 3rd, which we acknowledged in our communication of June 9th, we have now received a report from Regional Supervisor Ostrander, and I enclose for your information a copy of his reply.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Ostrander has issued instructions to all Indian Superintendents in the Province of Saskatchewan to immediately advise the Principals of the residential schools in that Province, that Indian pupils must not be conveyed in any aircraft unless both the plane and the pilot are licensed by the Air Transport Board.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

I had this young lad out to the Beauval School last winter up to the end of the school term and owing to poor direction of this lad from Beauval School he was brought back to here in error when he was slated to go to either Brochet or to Sturgeon Landing where he was to attend school on the commencement of the fall term of this year. And so it is that he is still here and being very much of a problem to this agency.\n\nIn a very recent letter from Reverend Father F.X. Gagnon Principal, Beauval School, Beauval, Sask., he has stated that this boy has a step-father living near Brochet and that the step-father wishes to have the boy, but the means of getting him to Brochet is a problem, unless we try to obtain authority from the Superintendent of Education, Indian Affairs Branch to have him flown out to Brochet. This is the only means, as I had to go through this procedure to get him into Beauval.\n\n.......2\nIt would be very much appreciated if you would kindly advise any suggestions you may have and to get this boy back to his step-father and back to the band that he belongs to, there is no information here as to what band he belonged to or even band number, also no record of parents other than that of the step-father.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.D.

Neary\n\nEnclosed herewith is this Agency's voucher #135 of today's date in favour of Saskatchewan Government Airways which covers fare for John Baptiste Dantouze #1 Barren Lands Band.\n\nI also enclose copy of letter received from Mr. L.D. Ward, Assistant Indian Agency, of Athabaska Indian Agency, in connection with the lad who was flown from Isle la Crosse to Stony Rapids. I was never informed of this flight and never knew that same had taken place until I received invoice and Mr. Ward's letter of November 29, 1950. You will note that this boy is at present at Stony Rapids, still not having reached his destination which was Brochet. As he is 16 years of age he would not be returning to residential school, and I would be obliged if you would inform me as to steps to be taken in regard to transportation from Stony Rapids to Brochet.\n\nAs stated earlier, I had no knowledge of flight which has taken place but trust that voucher can be honoured as submitted.\n\nE.

This latter explains why I have been induced to exceed the quota of children, authorized by your Department for the Beauval School.\n\nMay I point out to you, dear Sir, that in the case of Meadow Lake children, I have followed as near as possible the terms of your telegram: \"all children previously in attendance\" here. If I have been induced to admit five new-comers from the Meadow Lake reserve, it is only after entreaties from the part of the parents or guardians and for some good reasons, as most of these five children are orphans or assimilable to orphans, whose homes are too far from the Day school or whose home conditions are unfavorable and unsatisfactory.\n\nI trust, dear Mr. Phelan, that these explanations will meet your approval and beg you to accept once more the best regards of the whole Staff of Beauval Indian School.\n\nYours very gratefully & sincerely,\n\nM. Landry, O.M.I., Principal.\nOctober 13, 1952,\n\nMr. S. L. Walker,\nClerk in charge,\nMeadow Lake Indian Office,\nMeadow Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDue to the fact that I am a probationer in the charge of Principalship, it has been quite difficult for me to foresee what enrolment the School would have for this term. As it is, we now have one hundred and thirty-eight pupils registered; but in spite of the fact that we have exceeded the quota authorized previously, I feel that sanitary conditions are satisfactory since we have provided extra sleeping quarters for both boys and girls. In case we have the benefit of a visit from Mr. Conrad or any other Government Official in the near future I presume that this will meet their approval as it did that of Mr. Gervais, this last week.\n\nI wish to make clear to you, however, that amongst the registered pupils there are at least eight below school-age who were admitted for special reasons; for instance, two little Mioulteho girls aged 4\u00bd and 3 years who were accepted because of their mother's death. Mr. J.F. Ostrander authorized me to do this when I had the pleasure of meeting him at Meadow Lake in the first days of this month.\n\nAt the time of my interview with Mr. Ostrander there were hardly more than a hundred pupils enrolled for the term, hence room for about twenty more. Therefore, on receiving Mr. Phelan's telegram, I left for Meadow Lake to gather the children who had been at School here before. At least this was my intention! Once there, however, I found it difficult to resist the plea of certain parents or guardians, like those of Bruno Baer and Lester, both orphans, and Victor Matche whose home is so far from school. Thus, instead of having twenty some pupils on returning, I had twenty four, and then also, a few more arrived from the Northern reserves.\n\nI hope my procedure did not appear to have been dictated by a spirit of competition against the Meadow Lake agency. This was not at all my motives. Although it is true that the school here was built for the benefit of the children of the Northern regions, we must admit that there will always be exceptions for pupils of Meadow Lake and Water Hen reserves, whose homes are too far from the Day school or whose home conditions are unfavorable, as it is so clearly explained by Mr. Phelan.\n\nI trust, dear Mr. Walker, that your zeal for the good of the Indian children will help you to understand my point of view and that our efforts for this good cause may be always blessed with a whole-hearted co-operation on our part and yours.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM.

The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him.

The Department is very anxious to know whether anything can be done to help prevent such a severe loss in future, or whether anything could have been done to minimize it on this occasion.\n\nThe Department is quite prepared to accept your estimate of the devotion of the School Staff, and of the Doctor. It is always wise, however, to try to profit by experience, and the Department would like to be sure that nothing is left undone, particularly by itself, to provide in advance for an outbreak of this kind.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes\nfor Director of Indian Affairs\n\nS. L. Macdonald Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nBattleford, Sask.\nBeauval Indian School,\nBeauval, Sask.,\nJune 17th, 1937.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn accordance with the inquiry received from the Department of Indian Affairs, the undersigned have the following report to make of the epidemic which occurred at the Indian Residential School at Beauval, Sask., during the months of February and March last, and which resulted in the serious illness of almost all of the pupils, and the subsequent death of fourteen.\n\nThere is good accommodation at the school for occasional sickness among the children, and supplies of medicine were sufficient for their care in the emergency. The epidemic started with influenza about February 10th; it was general among the children, but not serious. They were rapidly recovering from this sickness (at that time it was general all over Canada in a fairly severe form) when a few cases of measles appeared among them, and rapidly spread until all were infected. Influenza in some of the children had developed into pneumonia. Many had weakened constitutions due to the prevalence among the Indians of tubercular diseases, sore throats, and diseases of the eyes, teeth and skin. The medical authorities noted that most deaths occurred among persons weakened by such ailments, which are agreed to have a debilitating effect upon the system.\n\nFour different sick-rooms were in use, for children in various stages of sickness. A supplementary staff was used in the school to do routine work, leaving the Sisters free to act as nurses. Doctor Lavoie was called five times, and his instructions carefully followed. A trained nurse was in charge of the sickrooms, and a staff of fourteen persons gave all their time to the care of the sick. Mr. Macdonald, of the Battleford district of the Department, was in continual touch with the situation, and gave his full approval and close attention to all measures taken. Under Dr. Lavoie's direction, and supervised by the principal of the school, everything possible was done for the children.\n\nThere is no way of knowing just how the epidemic started. It is possible that it was communicated through, or its virulence increased by, the presence of people from the village at religious services at the Mission church. There is no church in the village, and the presence of these people at services must carry a continual danger of infection to the children, when an epidemic is prevalent. They will build a church this summer, with the co-operation of the principal of the school.\nThe Indians have many congenital weaknesses: tuberculosis, throat diseases, bad teeth, eye troubles, and others. They generally are quickly infected by, and often succumb to, whatever infectious diseases they contract, because of weakened constitutions. It would seem that it is necessary to increase the health of the natives generally, as well as of the school children. Although the Department is not obligated to do so, no doubt if there were greater co-operation with the doctor at Isle \u00e0 la Crosse, and if more medicines and equipment were placed at his disposal, much could be done in this direction. It would be advisable to send a specialist to the school every autumn to prescribe for diseases of the eyes, nose, throat, teeth and skin among the children. As for tuberculosis, the Department has taken care of this, and at the school the medicines supplied by the Department are given to the children, particularly those intended to build up their resistance; and a general good health regimen is insisted upon.\n\nFrom this general description of the epidemic of influenza, pneumonia and measles, and suggestions as to the prevention of future ones, it is evident that everything possible was done for the sick, and that their inherent physical condition made them easy victims of these three serious diseases which successively afflicted them.\n\nSigned\n\nPrincipal of Beauval School\n\nIndian Agent, Battleford\n\nHealth Officer, Isle & La Crosse\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nBattleford, Sask.,\nJune 24th, 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nPer Department letter No. 132-1-23, May 10th re epidemic and serious loss of children at the Beauval School, with request that this be taken up during my visit up there, I beg to report as follows:\n\nWhile North, I had both Rev. Father Bleau and Dr. Lavoie on the whole circuit with me, and the matter of health and care of children was taken up and discussed there from all angles. I am attaching in duplicate a report on this, written by the Rev. Father Bleau, explaining the action taken during the epidemic and precautions for the future, which has been signed by all three of us. I believe this pretty well covers the situation.\n\nIt will be noted that the general impression is that some of the contagion was contracted through outsiders at Church services, so that arrangements are now being made to have a separate Church, and people from the settlement across the river will not again be in direct contact with the children of the school. However, as the epidemic was apparently general, and would most probably have hit the school in any case, it is hard to say whether the contacts in church are actually to blame. In any case, the necessary precautions are being taken.\n\nIt will also be noted that a request is made for a dental and Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat clinic, and I can assure the Department that this is very necessary as there are several bright and otherwise healthy children who are in serious need of eye attention. If it is not possible to send in a clinic after reopening of school some of these children should be brought out for attention as there are at least two girls that are in danger now of losing their eyesight for need of this attention.\n\nIn conclusion, I might say that the care of the children at the Beauval School is exceptionally good, and any loss or sickness is most certainly not through the neglect or carelessness of any of the staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nH. W. McGill, Esq.,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSIM/JE\nJuly 7, 1937\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you be good enough to read and return the enclosed correspondence about hospital accommodation at the Beauval Indian Residential School. Any definite recommendation you may wish to make would be appreciated. I send this in the belief that you will visit the school some time next Fall.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. R. L.

They were rapidly recovering from this sickness (at that time it was general all over Canada in a fairly severe form) when a few cases of measles appeared among them, and rapidly spread until all were infected. Influenza in some of the children had developed into pneumonia. Many had weakened constitutions due to the prevalence among the Indians of tubercular diseases, sore throats, and diseases of the eyes, teeth and skin. The medical authorities noted that most deaths occurred among persons weakened by such ailments, which are agreed to have a debilitating effect upon the system.\n\nFour different sick-rooms were in use, for children in various stages of sickness. A supplementary staff was used in the school to do routine work, leaving the Sisters free to act as nurses. Doctor Lavoie was called five times, and his instructions carefully followed. A trained nurse was in charge of the sickrooms, and a staff of fourteen persons gave all their time to the care of the sick. Mr. MacDonald, of the Battleford district of the Department, was in continual touch with the situation, and gave his full approval and close attention to all measures taken. Under Dr. Lavoie's direction, and supervised by the principal of the school, everything possible was done for the children.\n\nThere is no way of knowing just how the epidemic started. It is possible that it was communicated through, or its virulence increased by, the presence of people from the village at religious services at the Mission church. There is no church in the village, and the presence of these people at services must carry a continual danger of infection to the children, when an epidemic is prevalent. They will build a church this summer, with the co-operation of the principal of the school.\nThe Indians have many congenital weaknesses: tuberculosis, throat diseases, bad teeth, eye troubles, and others. They generally are quickly infected by, and often succumb to, whatever infectious diseases they contract, because of weakened constitutions. It would seem that it is necessary to increase the health of the natives generally, as well as of the school children. Although the Department is not obligated to do so, no doubt if there were greater co-operation with the doctor at Isle \u00e0 la Crosse, and if more medicines and equipment were placed at his disposal, much could be done in this direction. It would be advisable to send a specialist to the school every autumn to prescribe for diseases of the eyes, nose, throat, teeth and skin among the children. As for tuberculosis, the Department has taken care of this, and at the school the medicines supplied by the Department are given to the children, particularly those intended to build up their resistance; and a general good health regimen is insisted upon.\n\nFrom this general description of the epidemic of influenza, pneumonia and measles, and suggestions as to the prevention of future ones, it is evident that everything possible was done for the sick, and that their inherent physical condition made them easy victims of these three serious diseases which successively afflicted them.\n\nSigned\n\nPrincipal of Beauval School\n\nIndian Agent, Battleford\n\nHealth Officer, Isle \u00e0 La Crosse\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nFort Qu'Appelle, Sask.,\nAugust 12, 1937.\n\nDear Doctor Stone:\n\nAs requested I am returning herewith correspondence enclosed with your letter No. 132-1-23 dated July 7th, 1937.\n\nAccording to present plans Beauval Indian Residential School will be visited some time this fall.\n\nWhen the children are being examined I will try to bear in mind the contents of the inquiry you received, and will be pleased to submit a full report as to my findings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.B. Simes, M.D.\nMedical Superintendent,\nQu'Appelle Indian Health Unit.\n\nDr. E.L. Stone,\nDirector Medical Services,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nC. STATEMENT OF INDIAN AGENT\n\n1. Having heard and read over the statements of the Principal and the Physician, do you consider that all essential circumstances relating to the death of Ann Darasele have been recorded? Yes. If not, you are required to add here any further particulars which strike you as essential.\n\n2. In this space record any recommendations which the Board consider should be made to the Department in relation to the health or safety of the pupils of this School.\n\nAs, apparently, this child was found to be suffering from tuberculosis, when examined by the t.b. clinic two years ago, it would appear that some action should have been taken sooner to have her admitted to proper treatment. The diagnosis that she was suffering from t.b. was the result of the report of the doctor. Detailed instructions should be issued covering future cases of t.b. found in residential schools. If treatment in the san cannot be permitted in the future, what should we do with such pupils?\n\nChairman\u2014Indian Agent.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nMemorandum of an Inquiry into the cause and circumstances of the death of Ann Darasele (Marie A.

A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nForm No. 414.\nA.

Father F.X. Gagnon re: death of Hermas (Jacquot) Piche.\n\nOn the second of July, at about eleven o'clock A.M., I Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Gagnon, C.M.I., principal of the Indian Residential School at Beauval, Sask., driving the school truck on my way back from the Beauval village, had with me in the cab two kids and Mr. B.G. Brown riding in the box with a couple kids.\n\nAfter I had passed the gate at the school yard, coming up the hill, I saw Jacquot Piche running down towards the right side of the truck. At the time I was driving on low, at about 8 miles per hour. When I passed him, he was about 25 feet from the truck and then lost sight of him; the road turning to the left about 45 degrees. I then changed gear on the top of the hill, slowed down a little bit and then picked up a little speed, about ten miles per hour. As the boy was coming towards the right side of the truck, at the speed I was going, I thought he was trying to follow or run after the truck behind. So I did not pay any more attention to him.\n\nAt the same time, the older kid in the cab said in Cree to Jacquot: \"Come on and step on the running board of the truck.\" I answered right away: \"Don't do that.\" Almost instantly the truck passed through a little hole and jumped up a little, and almost immediately, I felt like the right hand wheel of the truck had passed over a stone. As I know there was no stone there, I stop right away, jumped off the truck and ran at the back to see what it was. Then I saw the boy just getting up, lifting up his arms towards me. Right away, I had the impression that he had passed under the wheel and while getting up I could not prevent telling him: \"Keep away from the truck while running,\" and at the same time I took him in my arms to the infirmary at the school. On my way, I could hear rattles in his throat or lungs. In the infirmary, I laid him down on a bed, put a wet towel on his head and ran for the nurse. As soon as I found her, we rush back to the infirmary. Then, the nurse helped by the other Sisters untied his shirt, took the pulse, put ice on his head and turning towards me she said: \"I am afraid, he is going to pass away.\" Then I ran for my prayer book and when I came back a few minutes later I just had the time to anoint him and he breathed his last breath. Before he died he vomited a little blood.\n\nAfter that, I immediately notified the Coroner, Dr. Lavoie and the Police and sent a wire to the Indian Agent at Battleford.\n\nThe boys of the school very seldom run after the truck and on many occasions, I told them to keep away from the truck while in motion, as I was always afraid that one of them would get hurt.\n\nJacquot Piche, his brother Jean and his sister Marguerite have been in school three years. Their father was drowned about 4 years ago. They are living at Tchepwayan Prairie. They are Tchepwayans.\n\nThis statement is true to the best of my knowledge.\n\nSigned: F.X.

Brown.\n\nI Bertrand Gavin Brown of Beauval states as follows:\n\nOn July the second about 10.50 a.m., I went with Father Gagnon of the Beauval Indian Residential School from the Beauval Village in the school truck to the Indian School situated about two miles north of the Village. Father Gagnon was driving the truck. He had two children with him in the cab.\n\nI was riding in the box, standing at the front, leaning on the top of the cab. As the truck came through the school gate and started up the small hill close to the school yard, I noticed one of the boys belonging to the school come running down towards the right side of the truck. I thought he was going to try to step on the running board of the truck, but he drew back as he got closer to the truck. In doing so the front part of the truck went past the point where the boy was standing. I was standing in the front of the box looking towards the front. I did not see him after that and I thought that the truck had passed him by. At that moment the truck suddenly stopped, and I turned around and saw the little boy standing at the rear end of the truck. He looked as if he had been hit by the truck as it went by. I saw Father Gagnon get out of the cab immediately and rush to the boy, and the little boy stopped towards Father Gagnon and the father held him close. Then the boy collapsed and Father carried him to the school.\n\nI have often driven with Father Gagnon in the truck and I have always found him a careful driver. I have never noticed the children at the school running after the truck, so due to this reason I did not expect the deceased boy to try to get on. At the time of the accident the truck was travelling about ten miles per hour.\n\nThis statement is true to the best of my knowledge.\n\nSigned: B.G. Brown.\n\nCertified a true copy.\n\nCoroner:\nStatement of Rev. Sister Tucker.\n\nI Sister Francis Catherine Tucker states as follows:\nI am in charge of the dairy at the Indian School at Beauval. About 10:30 a.m. on July the second I was upstairs in a room of the second floor. I was alone. I saw the Mission truck coming the yard towards the priests house. It was about half way from the gate to the Fathers' house. I saw a man standing in the front of the box, and two little boys who from my position looked also to be in the box towards the rear end. Both seemed to be on the left side of the box about half way. I saw one of the boys lying on the ground just behind the truck. I could see the right side of the truck only. The truck stopped a very short distance ahead and the other boy jumped down, and he ran towards his companion who was still lying on the ground. I saw Father Gagnon going towards the boy. As the Father was close to him, the boy seemed to stand on his feet, and I saw the Father gather him in his arms, and he carried him to the school. Not thinking that the accident was serious, I continued my work. Shortly afterward Sister St. Adelin came and told me that the boy was dead. It was not until the boy had died that I knew who he was. This happened about 200 yards from the school. At the time of the accident the truck was driving quite slow. I did not know who was driving at the time; I saw often Father Gagnon driving and he is very careful about the safety of the people who are around. I know that he always make sure that none of the kids are around when he drives or back up, and tells them to keep away.\n\nThis is a true statement to the best of my knowledge.\n\nSigned: Sister Francis A.C. Tucker.\n\nCertified a true copy.\n\nCoroner.\nStatement of Marie Rose Couillonneur.\n\nI Marie Rose Couillonneur states as follows:\nI work in the kitchen of the Beauval Indian School. About ten o'clock July the second I went up to the sewing room on the second floor. I heard the truck coming. I went to the window at the end of the corridor. The truck was coming in the yard and going towards the Fathers' house. I saw one man in the back and two children. The children were standing to the back of the truck. I saw a boy running about half way from the gate to the Fathers' house towards the truck. He was Hermas Piche a boy about eight years old running to the right side of the truck. He got hold of the side of the box on the right side, and suddenly I saw him falling down and the right rear wheel passed over him. The truck stopped immediately and Father Gagnon hurried towards the boy. As the Father got close the boy got up and threw himself in the arms of the Father. The Father then carried him to the school. The truck was driving slowly, and the boy caught up with the truck without any difficulty. His little brother Jean Piche 10 years old was also running towards the truck but he was farther back and did not catch up. Hermas before falling down ran a little distance holding the truck. I do not know what made him fall unless he stumbled. I could not see quite clear what happened from where I was.\n\nThis is a true statement to the best of my knowledge.\n\nSigned: Marie Rose Couillonneur.\n\nCertified a true copy.\n\n[Signature]\nCoroner.\nStatement of Jean Piche.\n\nJean Piche aged 10 years states as follows:\n\nAbout ten o'clock the second of July I was in the school yard with my brother Hermas. I saw the truck coming the hill towards the school yard. My brother ran after the truck on the right side, and I kept on walking. I saw Hermas catching the right side of the box and run alongside hanging on with his left hand. He was trying to climb to the box, and all of a sudden he fell down. As he fell down, the side of the box hit the right side of his head. I did not notice the truck go over him. Immediately this happened the truck stopped. Father Gagnon took him in his arms. Father Gagnon was driving the truck. Father lifted Hermas and took him to the school. The truck was not driving very fast as he was going upgrade of a hill. The Father always told us kids to keep away from the truck when in motion, and due to this reason I never saw any kids running after the truck in the yard. My brother and I have been three years in the school. When Hermas grabbed the truck I was quite close to him; when he fell I was about 40 feet behind the truck. From where I stood, I could see what happened quite clearly.\n\nThis statement is true to the best of my knowledge.\n\nSigned: Jean Piche.\n\nCertified a true copy.\n\nCoroner.\nStatement of Victor Desjarlais.\n\nI Victor Desjarlais through an interpreter states as follows:\n\nI am six years of age.

As the truck came to the school yard I saw Hermas Piche run towards the truck on the right side. When he got close, he grabbed the gasoline pipe between the cab and the box, hanging on with both hands. All of a sudden the box hit him on the left side of the jaw, then he spun around and was hit on the right temple and the side of his body causing him to fall down. The truck hit a bump and stopped right away. Father Gagnon went out and picked up the boy and took him to the school.

With reference to the above, at 11:45 A.M. of this date Dr. LAVOIE, Coroner at No. 6 La Croise, called at this office and informed me that he had just received a message from Father GAGNON of the Indian Residential School at Beauval, to the effect that the emotionally upset juvenile had been killed by a truck operated by Father GAGNON at 10:00 A.M. of that date; the child being injured or dead that he died five or ten minutes afterwards.

In the early P.M. of same date I, in company with Sgt. Johnson patrolled to Beauval, per telephone order code #353. Upon arriving at the Indian Residential School, the deceased was examined under the directions of Dr. LAVOIE, Coroner. The boy was a Chippewa Indian, age eight years, upon the occasion of his death. The following injuries were noted: A bruise about two inches long and one inch wide on the left side of his neck about an inch below the jugular vein; another bruise about two inches square on the right side of his temple halfway between the eye and the top of his ear; a further bruise about three inches long and half an inch wide on his right cheek; he had no indication of broken bones, and there was no sign whatsoever that the truck had passed over him.\n\n3. Father GAGNON, the driver of the truck, and also the Father in charge of the school, was interviewed and upon being questioned he gave the following statement:\n\nSTATEMENT OF FATHER R.L. GAGNON, O.M.I.\n\nOn the second of July, at about eleven o'clock in the A.M., I Francis Xavier Gagno, O.M.I., principal of the Indian Residential School at Beauval, was driving the school truck on my way back from the Beauval village, had with me in the cab two kids and a Mr. B.A. Brown riding in the box with a couple of kids.\n\nAfter I had passed the gate of the school yard coming up the hill, I saw (Jacquet) Herman PICH\u00c9 running down towards the right side of the truck. At this time I was travelling on low at about eight miles per hour. When I passed him, he was about twenty-five feet from the truck and then I lost sight of him as the road at this point turns a little to the left at an angle of about forty-five degrees. I then changed gear on top of the hill, slowed down a little and then picked up a little speed of about ten miles per hour. As the boy was coming running towards the right side of the truck at the speed I was going, I thought he was trying to follow or run after the truck behind, so I did not pay any more attention to him.\n\nAt the same time, the elder kid in the cab said: \"Come on and stop on the running board.\"\n\nFILE NUMBERS, HEADING AND MARGINAL REFERENCE ARE TO BE PROPERLY FILLED IN.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6302, file 650-23, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRUNNING BOARD of the truck\". I answered right away: \"Don't do that\". Almost instantly the truck passed through a little hole and jumped up a little, almost immediately I felt the right hind wheel of the truck had come over a stone, as I knew there was no stone there. I stepped right away jumped off the truck and ran at the boy to see what it was. Then I saw the boy just getting up, lifting up his arms towards me. Right away I had the impression that he had passed under the wheel, and while getting up I could not prevent from telling him \"Keep away from the truck while running\" and at the same time I took him in my arms to the Infirmary of the school, on my way I could hear rattles in his throat or lungs. In the Infirmary I laid him down on a bed, put a wet towel on his head and ran for the nurse. As soon as I found her we rushed back to the Infirmary, then the nurses helped by the other sisters untied his shirt, took his pulse, put ice on his head, and turning towards me she said \"I am afraid he is going to pass away.\" Then I ran for my prayer book and when I came back a few minutes later, I just had time to anoint him and he breathed his last breath. Just before he died he vomited a little blood. After that I immediately notified the Coroner Dr. LAVOIE and the Police and sent a wire to the Indian Agent at Battleford.\n\nThe boys of the school very seldom run after the truck and on many occasions I told them to keep away from the truck while in motion, as I was always afraid that one of them would get hurt.\n\n(Jacquet) Hermas PICHE, his brother Jean and his sister Marguerite have been in the school for three years.

Father GAGNON was driving the truck; he had two little children in the cab with him. I was riding in the box standing at the front leaning on top of the cab. As the truck came through the school gate and started up the small hill close to the school yard, I noticed one of the little boys belonging to the school came running towards the right side of the truck. I thought he was going to try to step on the running board of the truck but he drew back as he got close to the truck, in doing so the front part of the truck went past the point where he was standing and as I was standing in the front of the box looking towards the front I didn't see him after that, and I thought the truck passed him by. At that moment the truck suddenly stopped, and I turned and saw the little boy standing at the right rear end of the truck, he looked as if he had been hit by the truck as it went by. I saw Father GAGNON get out of the cab and rushed towards the boy, and the little boy stepped towards Father Gagnon and the Father held him close, then the boy collapsed and the Father carried him to the school.\n\nI have often ridden with Father GAGNON in the truck and I have always found him a careful driver.

The deceased brother Jean PICH\u00c9 who was with him at the time of the accident was also questioned and the following statement obtained:\n\nBEGIN:\n\nJean PICH\u00c9, age 10 years, of Beauval Indian Residential School, states as follows: About ten A.M., July 2nd, 1942, I went out to the school yard with my brother Hermas. I saw the truck coming up the hill towards the school yard. Hermas ran towards the right side of the truck; I kept on walking. I saw Hermas grab a hold of the right side of the box of the truck and run along side of it hanging on with his left hand; he was trying to climb into the box; all of a sudden he fell down in doing so; the side of the box hit the right side of his head, and I am sure the wheels of the truck did not go over him.\n\nImmediately this happen the truck stopped. Father GAGNON who was driving the truck rushed towards my brother who was still laying down on the ground; the Father lifted him up in his arms and took him to the school. At the time of the accident the truck was not travelling very fast, as it was coming up a little grade. Father GAGNON has often told me that raising the school to keep away from the truck while it was in motion, and due to this reason I seldom see any of the kids running after the truck in the yard. Hermas and I have been at this school for about three years. At the time Hermas grabbed the side of the truck, I was quite close to him and it would be about four feet after that that he fell down from where I stood. I could see everything that happen quite clear. This statement was read over to me and its the truth to the best of my knowledge.\n\nWitness, Cat. MacLeod.\n\nSgd. Jean PICH\u00c9.\n\n---\n\n6. Statements were also taken from Victor DESJARLAIS who was in the cab with Father GAGNON along with another juvenile also named KIMBLEY one of the kids that were riding in the box. Sister Francis A.C. TUCKER and Mary Rose COULIBELIER who had seen the accident from the school building were also interviewed and questioned. The statements of the above witnesses are as follows:\n\nBEGIN:\n\nStatement of Victor DESJARLAIS.\n\nVictor DESJARLAIS, age 6 years, of Beauval Indian Residential School, states as follows: In the morning of July 2nd, 1942, I was riding in the front seat of the school truck along with Eugene KIMBLEY, age three or four years, and Father GAGNON. As the truck entered the school yard, I saw Hermas PICH\u00c9, age about eight years, run towards the right side of the truck; as he caught up to it, he grabbed a hold of the gas pipe between the cab and the box hanging on with both hands; all of a sudden the end of the box hit him on the neck below his left jaw causing him to spin around; in doing so, the side of the box hit him on the right side of his temple and the right side of his body, causing him to fall down. The truck then hit a bump and it stopped right away. Father GAGNON got out immediately and rushed towards Hermas PICH\u00c9 who was still laying down.\n\nCon't. Page 4.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As the truck entered the school yard, I saw Hermas PIGHE run towards it. When he got up to it, he grabbed the gas pipe between the cab and the box with both hands. He was running alongside the truck. The truck began to get a little faster and all of a sudden Hermas fell down. I did not see what happened to him; the truck stopped right away, and Father GAGNON lifted the boy up and took him to the school. This statement was read over to me and it's the truth to the best of my knowledge.\n\nWitness, Cat. MacLeod.\n\nSgd. Marcel KIMILY.\n\nENDS.\n\nStatement of Mary Rose GOUILLOCHER.\n\nI Mary Rose GOUILLOCHER, state as follows: I work in the kitchen at the Beauval Indian Residential School. About 10:00 o'clock in the morning of July 2nd, 1942, I went up to the sewing room on the second floor of the school, as I was entering the sewing room I heard the truck coming so I went to the window at the end of the corridor. I saw the truck entering the school yard and go towards the Father's house. I could see one man standing in the box at the back of the truck; there was also two children in the box with him; they were standing closer to the back of the truck. About half way between the yard gate and the Father's house, I saw Hermas PIGHE, a boy about eight years old, run towards the right side of the truck. When he got close to the truck he grabbed a hold of the side of the box; all of a sudden I saw him falling down and the right rear wheel of the truck pass over him. The truck stopped almost immediately and Father GAGNON who was driving the truck rushed towards the boy who was still laying on the ground. As the Father got close to him the boy got up and threw himself in Father GAGNON's arms. The Father then carried him to the school. At the time of the accident the truck was travelling slow and the boy caught up to it without any difficulty. Hermas' closest brother Jean was also running towards the truck but he was further back and did not catch up to it. After Hermas got a hold of the side of the truck he ran a short distance before he fell down. I don't know what cause him to fall unless he stumble. From the school to where the accident took place is about two hundred yards, so I could not see everything that happen very clear. This statement was read over to me and it's the truth to the best of my knowledge.\n\nWitness, Cat. MacLeod.\n\nSgd. Mary Rose GOUILLOCHER.\n\nENDS.\n\nStatement of Sister, Francis A.C. TUCKER.\n\nI Sister, Francis Ann Catherine TUCKER, state as follows: I am in charge of the Dairy at the Beauval Indian Residential School. On July 2nd, 1942, I am not sure of the time but I think it was about 10:30 A.M. I was in a room on the second floor of...\nAt the completion of the investigation Dr. Lavioe Cerney advised that due to the circumstances of the case that he did not consider an Inquest necessary, and he therefore released the body for burial.\n\nThe statements of Jean Piche and Victor Desjarlais who were quite close to the deceased at the time of the accident seem to indicate quite clearly what had happened and their story also corroborate the injuries noted on the deceased body. In view of this the Cerney and the writer came to the conclusion that the accident occurred as follows; The boy having caught up to the truck in all probabilities he intended to climb on the step beside the cab as the intake gasoline pipe for the gas tank is located beside this step. It would be the only suitable thing for him to hang on to. This pipe extends about four inches above the tank and is located on the right side of the truck between the cab and the box as the truck began to gain speed at the top of the grade, the boy lost his balance or else the truck began to travel too fast for him and the result that the corner of the box hit him on the left side of the neck causing him to spin around so that his right side would be nearer the box. In doing so the box caught him again on the right temple and probably as he fell down outside tire on the dual wheels at the rear could easily have come in contact with his groin.\n\nThe scene of the accident was carefully examined but nothing could be learned which might assist in the investigation. The truck was also checked its a two ton Chevrolet 1942 Model, Box. License No. 72693. It has a large box 12 ft. 7 inches long seven feet wide and forty five inches high, the box extends Cent'd. Page 6.\nThe box measures twelve and one half inches from the end on both sides, and it measures five inches back from the end. It has dual wheels on the rear extending about five inches out from the box. The truck is equipped with a grid rear view mirror; the brakes were tested by the writer and they are in first-class condition. Father GAGNON stated that he had been driving off and on for the last ten years, and that he had driven this truck continually since it was purchased in 1941. He was in receipt of a Saskatchewan Driver's License No. 113627 for the year 1942-43.\n\nThe writer was advised by Father GAGNON that the death of the child mentioned would also be investigated by a board of three men appointed under the direction of the Indian Agent at the completion of which the Agent will comply with the provisions of the Vital Statistics Act.\n\nIn the F.M. of this date the writer in company with S/Cst. Johnson per cutboard meter Code #7374 returned to No. 2 La Crosse upon arriving at the Detachment the following telegram was received from the C.O., Prince Albert Sub-Division:\n\nIndian Agent reports having heard Indian child killed by truck at Beaupr\u00e9 wire me if authentic step you will contact Father Gagnon for particulars.\n\nI immediately sent the following telegram to the C.O., Prince Albert Sub-Division:\n\nHerma PICH\u00c9 eight years old Indian child killed at Beaupr\u00e9 accidentally by a truck operated by Father GAGNON ten o'clock date investigation completed by Dr. Layce and writer step Dr. Layce Coroner advised no Inquest necessary report following.\n\nIn view of the facts surrounding this case and the Coroner's decision no further action will be taken by this office unless otherwise instructed and the file will therefore be considered closed.\n\nCONCLUDED,\n\nEXPENSES shown on F.93 July 1/15th 1942.\n\nJ.

Seaman, A.C., Cate, Trace and Sutton, and the writer, to Neota, per P.C. code 3064. Subsequent investigation into the matter revealed that the above named BILL NIGHT, treaty Indian, was one of the persons involved. He was found in a state of intoxication and it was learned that he had been in the company of two other persons, namely Alex Ross, treaty Indian, and Cyril MORIN, half-breed, who were also found in an intoxicated state at Neota this night. All three men were taken into custody and conveyed to N/Battleford and placed in the RCMP cells overnight, in charge of the night guard.\n\nIn the name of this date the above named BILL NIGHT appeared in RCMP court charged under Sec.(135) of the Indian Act, and the case was disposed of as shown on page 1 of this report. Accused entered a plea of guilty and on examination by J.S.B. Ostrander, Indian Agent, trying the case, he admitted to having got drunk with Morin and Ross, and that Alex ROSS Indian, had given him the wine. In view of the previous very good character of accused, Mr. Ostrander was lenient with him and imposed a fine of $200 & costs, in default 1 month in P. Albert common gaol. Accused allowed until 26-10-42 to pay fine and costs.

With reference to the above and previous report submitted by this Detachment dated 20-7-42, also memo of O.C. Prince Albert Sub-Div., dated 10-9-42, I wish to report that on the above date the Rev. Father ROSSIGNOL, O.M.I., the local Registrar for the Vital Statistics at Ile a la Crosse, was again interviewed in the above connection, and he was made acquainted with the contents of the letter received from the Indian Agent, Battleford, Sask., dated the 8-9-42, in which it was requested that the death of the optionally noted juvenile be registered at this point. Father ROSSIGNOL again advised that Indians have never been registered at Ile a la Crosse except from November 1936 to April 1937. This procedure was apparently not very satisfactory with the Dept. in Regina, with the result that during Treaty time in 1937, Mr. MacDONALD, who was Indian Agent at Battleford at that time asked Father ROSSIGNOL to discontinue the procedure.\n\n2. Father ROSSIGNOL also stated that he has been in Ile a la Crosse District for the past thirty one years, and became Registrar in 1916, and to the best of his knowledge all Indian Deaths, Births and Marriages that have occurred in the district since then have always been registered by the Indian Agent during Treaty time, and he fails to understand why there should be such a difference in this case, in view of this, before he will proceed to register the death of this juvenile, he wants to have instructions for so doing, either from the Dept. of Indian Affairs or from the Registrar General in Regina.\n\n3. Due to the above information I again respectfully request that this matter be handed over to the Indian Agent at Battleford for whatever action he deems necessary. Apparently the Registrat at this point does not wish to undertake the registering of this juvenile in accordance with the Vital Statistics Act, until such time as he is in receipt of proper instructions in that regard.\n\n4. With reference to Para.3 of the above mentioned memorandum, the matter mentioned therein will be attended to as soon as conveniently possible, in view of this could the Diary Date please be extended to read the 30-10-42, at which time a further report will be submitted.\n\nCARRIED FORWARD.

(RG 10, Volume 6302, file 650-23, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 132-1-23 of the 27th ultimo regarding the unsatisfactory registration of Vital Statistics at Ile \u00e0 la Crosse.\n\nSome time before your letter reached this office I received a Police Report on this and immediately telephoned the Registrar General here, and as I was going through Battleford I advised him I would talk over the matter with Agent Ostrander, which I did. Upon my return I again got in touch with the Registrar General's office and arranged for a meeting with him today. I have just returned from that meeting.\n\nUpon investigation of this case I found that in 1936 Mr. MacDonald, then Agent, wrote to the Registrar General's office suggesting that five different Priests in the North country be appointed as registrars for Treaty No. 10, and since that time this has been carried out in a haphazard way. In fact this method has been found very unsatisfactory and my recommendation to the Registrar General was that the registration for Treaty No. 10 be left entirely in the hands of the Indian Agent, and Mr. Ostrander has agreed to this, that is when he pays Treaty he will attend to the registration of the different bands in that part of his agency. In my opinion this is the only way that it can be done satisfactorily, and I am now writing to Agent Ostrander to bring it about.\n\nRegarding the registration of Hermas Piche, the Treaty Indian Juvenile who was killed in a truck accident last Summer at Beauval, I am instructing Agent Ostrander to register him accordingly.\n\nWhile I was at the Registrar General's office I learned that some of our Agents are sending in the certificates registering births and deaths in a very sloppy manner, and if they only knew it there is no use sending these in to the Registrar General unless they are completed. In very many cases I was told they are not completed and it is necessary to write two or three times in order to get the required information. I shall endeavour to see that these reports are filled out properly and the Registrar........\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nproperly and the Registrar General's office has promised to let me know if they have any trouble in this connection in the future.\n\nI presume the same haphazard way of registration has been carried out in the Carlton Agency and I am writing now to find out just what procedure has been followed in this regard.\n\nI am herewith returning the Police Reports on Hermas Piche as requested in your letter and I might say that I receive all Police Reports for the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nC. STATEMENT OF INDIAN AGENT\n\n1.

These members of the Board shall, in each other's presence, complete this memorandum, which shall then be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, in one copy.\n\nThe Board of Inquiry shall, if at all practicable assemble within 48 hours of the pupil's death.\n\nThe parents or guardians of the deceased pupil shall be given notice of this inquiry and be permitted to attend it or to send a representative. They or their representative shall be asked if they wish to make a statement. In the event of their so wishing, their statement shall be attached to the report. The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nFORM NO. 414.\nA.

For instance if we take the regions of Fort Pelly, Crooked Lake, Moose Mountain, Fort Ellice &c where there are a large number of Indians among whom a considerable number of R.Catholics and a great number of Pagans, you will remark that whilst the Protestants have six schools supported by the Government, viz:\n\n1 Industrial School, 3 Boarding Schools, and 2 Day Schools, there is only one Day School held by the Catholics at Fort Pelly; this making the very considerable difference that whilst the Protestants have\nhave schools at proximity of all Indian Reserves, we have many of the same Reserves which are very distant from any of the R.C. Schools.\n\nFor any one, who knows how the Indians hate to send their children far away, it will appear evident that our condition for recruiting school children is far inferior to the condition of other denominations, and that we have not really the necessary accommodations to receive all the children of catholic or pagan belief whom their parents would like to sent to R.C. Schools, but whom they refuse to send to Qu'Appelle Industrial School on account of the great distance; this being particularly the case when those children are young.\n\nThis deficiency in the number of our schools will be felt worse in the future, as I hear that the intention of the Department is to admit at the Industrial Schools only the children who will have attained the age of 14 years, and to have the younger children sent to boarding or day schools.\n\nIf the Department takes into consideration that in the whole District of Assiniboia and in all the regions of Manitoba West of Portage la Prairie, we have only three schools supported by the Government, viz: one Industrial School at Qu'Appelle, one Boarding School at Touchwood.\nTouchwood Hills, and one day school at Fort Pelly, whilst the Protestants have not less than ten schools also supported by the Government, viz: three Industrial Schools at Brandon, Elkhorn and Regina, five Boarding Schools at Birtle, Crooked Lake, Fort Pelly, Pile Hills and Touchwood Hills, and two day schools at Pelly and Sioux Reserve; we will not be found too exacting and asking for more than our share of the Government help in asking to have the number of Roman Catholic Schools augmented.\n\nI beg therefore hereby to make application for the establishment of a Boarding School for the education of Indian children at the R.C.Mission at Crooked Lake where there is a large number of Indians, and where we have now two residing Missionaries. And I ask you to be kind enough to recommend my request to the favourable consideration of the Department of Indian Affairs, and to see that the funds required for the erection of a school building as well as for the tuition and boarding of twenty children are included in the estimates to be submitted to the Indian Department.\n\nI have the honour &c.\n\nJ.P.

As there is no appropriation for this during the current fiscal year, I have informed Rev. Father Magnau that nothing could be done for the present.

Father Campau has requested me to write you in support of his application, which I understand he has made direct to you, for the establishment of a Roman Catholic Boarding School on Cowessess Reserve to be built in the valley near to the end of Crooked Lake.\n\nI must state that I am greatly in favour of good boarding schools on the Reserves for the following reasons,- That they are able to take younger children, that they are more homelike, that a closer and more family like supervision can be kept over the smaller number of pupils kept; that the parents prefer the Schools on the Reserves to those at a distance and that they will make good feeders to the Industrial Schools to which the older pupils might be transferred to finish off their training.\n\nI shall be pleased, if the necessary funds can be provided, to see this School established as there are a lot of young children which the parents would probably\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nWinnipeg.\nmore willingly send to this School being near to their homes, and also that it may prove of use in persuading \"She Sheeps\" party to allow their children to attend it, being at the other end of the Lake from their Reserve and almost within sight.\n\nI understand some Sisters are already on their way to begin the School in the Mission House, so it would appear that the Roman Catholic Authorities have determined on their course.\n\nIf only a little could be now done by giving the grant for a few pupils, that may be available from other Schools where the full number is not in attendance, it might be the beginning of a school that would in time draw in all the young children of school age.\n\nI feel almost certain if this school were running it would be the one chosen by \"She Sheeps\" party if they are compelled to send their children to School.\n\nThere are a number of Roman Catholic children who could be sent to this School at once.\n\nProvision could be made in the Estimates next year for the number decided upon to be required or for which they had accommodation.\n\nI have the honour &c.\n\nJno.

Father Magnan, Superintendent of Missions, that nothing could be done at present, I should not have thought any further action necessary just now, but as you informed me a few days ago that you think it best to deal with such applications when first presented, instead of waiting until the Estimates are being prepared, I beg to give the following information in connection with the present application.\n\nIf the object of the proposed boarding school were to supply the wants of the children in the Crooked Lakes Agency, there would not appear to be any great necessity for such a school, judging from the remarks under the head of \"Education\" made by the Indian Agent for the district, Mr. J. P. Wright, in his annual report up to the 30th June last. His remarks are as follows:-\n\n(1)\n\nIndian Affairs.

This grant has now been increased to provide for forty. In March 1900 Mr Miller of Moosomin wrote to Mr Douglas M.P. stating that the Presbyterian body was dissatisfied with the action of the Government in agreeing to pay a grant to the Roman Catholic church for the building of a mission at the Round Lake reserve. This letter was not made official and is not on file but I have before me a memorandum I prepared on the 19th March of that year in reference to this protest, which is on file 117080 and turned out here-with. This protest refers to the building of a Roman Catholic mission at Round Lake and not to the establishment of a school at Crooked Lake on Cowesses Reserve, both these places being in the Crooked Lakes Agency.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-1, part 1)\nThe Roman Catholic school was in operation and recognized by the Department before this protest was received and the religious profession of the Indians in the Crooked Lakes Agency would show that their claims to have a boarding school are even greater than those of the Presbyterians.\n\nThe Presbyterian boarding school at Round Lake has been established since 1884 and has received the per capita allowance since 1887.\n\nA grant for forty pupils is now provided for each of these schools and judging from Mr Inspector McGibbon's report there is ample field for both of them without clash of interests.\n\nThe Presbyterians claim to have spent $7000 on their school building without any assistance from the Government and if the Roman Catholics receive compensation for their outlay, it is most likely that they will feel dissatisfied and make a similar claim.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The difficulty is that the Presbyterian Church, which already had built a school at its own expense on the same reserve and was practically in possession of the ground, protested against the Roman Catholic Church being permitted to establish a school at this particular point, they assuming at the time that the Government had not only given its permission for the building of the school but was making a grant towards the cost of the building. The Government gave its assurance that no grant was being made to the building referred to and that they were practically in the same position in that only\n\nHis Grace\nThe Archbishop of St. Boniface,\nSt. Boniface,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of these circumstances I do not think that it would be proper now for the Department to undertake to provide any moneys on account of the building which your church has erected at this point.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\nOttawa, 14th October, 1901.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Benson may be quite right with regard to the mission building at Round Lake, but I am satisfied that a protest was made, and I think possibly through Mr. Douglas verbally, against the Department giving any assistance or even permitting the building of the Roman Catholic School at the Crooked Lakes. I remember satisfying him by assuring him that the Government was giving nothing whatever towards the building, but I explained that a per capita grant was being given to the school to cover a certain number of pupils who would receive instruction in it, and he expressed himself as quite satisfied.\n\nDeputy Supt.

He however adds that \"it has been a rule with the Roman Catholic Schools to be generous to the parents of pupils they expect they may get, and this may have given rise to the report\".\n\nI may remark that this \"generous\" practice is not confined to R.C. Schools, and I have had occasion within the last year to censure what appeared more like a payment for pupils than mere generosity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of the 10th of April 1901, in which the pupilage of the Coweses Boarding School was increased to forty, the additional number to be paid out of the General School Vote.

McLean, Secretary of Indian Department.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI beg to be authorized to state special demand to your Department in favor of our school.\n\nThere is now in construction a rural telephone line which shall come within three miles of our school. Unfortunately, on that distance there is no farmer who could help building the line closer to us. Now the Indian Department is aware that our school is at a distance of eleven miles from the nearest railway station. A telephone line would be a great help to get in touch with the rest of the world and would render to us as well as to the Indians of the Reserve generally, many important services. This school is at the same time the Post Office of the Indians, and it would help them in many ways. Many a time would this school or the people around be in trouble and expenses, if they could have information in time, specially from the railway station.\n\nThe cost of this line would be $500.00.\n\nI humbly would ask you, honorable Sir, if you would help us in getting this line to the school. We would have to pass it, if built in a straight line, through a small part of the reserve, but only through land unsuitable for cultivation.\nConfident in your earnestness to work for the prosperity of the Indians, I remain\n\nvery respectfully yours,\n\nMarieval Sask.\n\nFrom the Cowesses Indian Boarding School\nCrooked Lake Agency\nMarieval P.O., Sask.\nI herewith beg to transmit a petition, addressed to you, from the Reverend Principal of Cowessess Boarding School, supplicatory to the Department rendering assistance in order to connect this institution with a rural telephone line which is being built from Dubuc to a point within three miles of the school. The advantages of the telephone is so well known that it is unnecessary for me to speak thereon.\n\nAt the time of this application being made the Principal was under the impression that the line from almost the point of connection to the school would have to be built across certain parts of the Indian reserves, but as a road allowance runs practically straight (east and west) from the point of connection to the land owned by the school on which the institution is built the crossing of the reserves need not be considered. The fact of the road allowance referred to, which is a well travelled road, being available for such purposes was not thought of by the reverend gentleman until I pointed same out to him when he readily saw that to cross\n\nThe Secretary.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nthe reserves was not necessary.\n\nIf the Department decide to render assistance in the building of the proposed telephone line, the Principal informs me that the cost of maintenance would be borne by the school, so that it is only the initial cost which the Department is asked to bear.\n\nAs the line to the point within three miles of school is now being built, the Principal wishes to have the department's reply as early as possible, as in the event of assistance being rendered authority to construct along the road allowance will of necessity have to referred to the proper authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Taylor\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 5, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo enclosing a communication received by you from the Principal of the Cowessess Boarding School asking the Department for a grant of $500.00 to assist in connecting that institution with a rural telephone line which is being built in that neighbourhood.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the Department recognizes the advantages of a telephone for this institution, there is no money available for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Under the precedent Government, more than forty miles of telephone line have been built in order to connect the Lebret School with the neighboring lines, and I could point out many other such examples.\n\nAs it was only three miles in our case, and of a telephone that would have been even more helpful, I may say, than some others built by the Departement, as I am well acquainted with the conditions of some of the other localities, I felt justified in expecting the Government would help us in this enterprise, at least in a near future.\n\nHoping this explanation will prove satisfactory to this Departement,\n\nI remain, Honorable Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am under the impression that Mr. Inspector Murison is in possession of the measurements of the dormitories and classrooms, and the Department would be grateful for information concerning the number of pupils that can be placed in residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nIn response to the request contained in Department letter No. 109-5-1 of the 8th inst., I beg to forward, herewith, cross-section of the dormitories, and a plan of the class rooms at the Cowessess Boarding School, the measurements of which are given. The dormitories, of which there are two, have a capacity of 13,540 cubic feet, and the class rooms, of which there are also two, have a capacity of 8050 cubic feet. Thirty boys and twenty nine girls utilise the dormitories and class rooms set aside for the respective sexes. I trust these particulars will furnish you with the desired information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, March 1, 1922.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nFather Guy has brought to my attention the extreme desirability of increasing the pupilage at the Cowessess Boarding School from 60 to 70.\n\nNo provision has been made in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year, but, in view of the excellent work done by the Rev. Principal (Father Carriere) I am strongly recommending that the request be favourably received. The accommodation at this school warrants the increase.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOTTAWA, March 1st, 1922.\n\nDear Father Guy,\n\nWith reference to our conversation of a few days ago regarding an increase in the pupilage at the Cowesses Boarding School, I now beg to inform you that it has been decided to increase the pupilage at this school from 60 to 70 from April 1st, next, the beginning of the new fiscal year.\n\nWe have taken this matter up with our Commissioner and have ascertained that there is ample accommodation in the dormitories and classrooms for this increased number.\n\nI will be pleased if you will inform the Principal of the school accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOTTAWA.\nOTTAWA, March 1st, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, in which you enclose a sketch showing a cross-section of the dormitories and a plan of the classrooms at the Cowessess Boarding School, I beg to say that the measurements given show that this school has dormitory accommodation for 74 pupils.\n\nIn view of this, and at the request of the church authorities, we have decided to increase the pupilage from 60, the present number allowed, to 70 pupils, from the beginning of the new fiscal year, April 1st, next.\n\nMr. Agent Taylor and the church authorities are being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOTTAWA, March 1st, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that it has been decided to grant an increase in the pupilage at the Cowessos Boarding School from 60 pupils, the present number provided for, to 70 pupils, from the 1st of April, next, the beginning of the new fiscal year. The church authorities and Mr. Commissioner Graham are being informed accordingly.\n\nI may say that from the information recently submitted by Mr. Commissioner Graham as to the size of the dormitories and classrooms, there is accommodation for 74 pupils, and the school may, therefore, recruit up to 70 pupils, and, in addition, may have in residence one pupil for each 20 or fraction of that number, or a total of 74 pupils in residence, which should not be exceeded.\n\nYou may inform the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nE. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nMr. Russell Morrier,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRev. Fr J. Carri\u00e8re, O.M.I., Principal of Cowesses Indian Boarding School, wishes to be authorized to receive 80 children, instead of 70, as provided for in the last estimates.\n\nThe Reverend Father had already asked for that number as he has the necessary accommodation and I can say that considering the latter and the number of children of school age on the Reserve, I would strongly endorse the Rev. Principal's request.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJoseph [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I regret that we are unable to increase the pupilage at the present time, as the Vote for Indian Education for this fiscal year has been completely assigned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nThe Oblate Missionaries of Manitoba and Southern Saskatchewan, through their Provincial Administration, wish to offer to the Department, the last of the four schools the latter intends to purchase. That school is called COWESSES INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and is situated at MARIEVAL (via Grayson) Sask., in a magnificent locality.\n\nThe first draft of our proposals concerning that school was as follows:\n\nSchool building (basement, 3 stories, brick veneer, 100 x 37, new)........$45,000.00\nBarn, fully modern, 60 x 32..................5,000.00\nGranary, boiler room, shop...................1,500.00\nPrincipal's house.............................2,000.00\nFarm Implements..............................3,000.00\nLive stock, cattle and horses...............3,000.00\nLand (160 acres).............................3,000.00\n\nTotal: $62,500.00\n\nIt is our desire to keep close as close as possible to the above figures but we wish to note the following:\n\n1o-We believe that a sufficient quantity of land must be assured for farming purposes as it was the case with the Muscowequan and Pine Creek schools. We had mentioned 160 acres in our offer but we beg to change the latter as follows: the least that should be taken over by the Department are two parcels of land, one of 206 acres, including the site of the school and outbuildings, and ano-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nther of 282.70 acres, situated at about half a mile from the site of the school, which we had bought for farming purposes solely for the benefit of the school. Exhibits A, B and C herewith annexed give the exact location of those tracts of land. I also beg to state that a substantial bridge is erected between the latter.\n\nWe even deemed that quantity of land to be insufficient as 3 or 4 years we bought a half section to be used as pasture for the cattle of the school. However we do not bring in this piece of land within the scope of our offer.\n\n2o-In our offer of 1921 the principal's house (or rather the rectory) was included at a valuation of $2,000. We would now move for reserving this building and a small parcel of land adjacent to it, containing the church and graveyard. However other buildings have been erected on the school site, since 1921, such as the laundry, the farmer's house, and a cesspool has been installed, all of which more than make up for the removal of the rectory from our list.\n\n3o-The valuation of 1921 was giving rather too low figures for the land, farm implements and live stock. The actual commercial value of the land in the Qu'Appelle valley is from $30.00 to $35.00 an acre and that without any construction on the land. We are offering the Department a land with a substantial house and two granaries erected thereon. That and other lands are worth one third more than the valuation price of 1921. The present value of the farm implements and live stock is 4\u00bd times more than that shown on our 1921 list. The price then stated was $6,000. A complete and detailed inventory has revealed a value of $28,213.40 (Cf exhibit F, herewith annexed)\nActing upon the above remarks, we take the liberty of setting forth what we believe to be the real value of our property and then the price we wish to submit for the Department's consideration as follows:\n\n1o\u2014ACTUAL VALUATION OF THE PROPERTY OFFERED:\n\nA\u2014LANDS:\na\u2014Portion of the site of the school, 206 acres at $30.00: $6,180.00\nb\u2014Farm site, 282.70 \" \" $30.00: $8,481.00\n(Cf exhibits A,B,C,E) $14,661.00\n\nB\u2014BUILDINGS:\na\u2014School building, 37x104, 3 stories, brick veneer, basement, with furnace building, 12x25: $45,000.00\nb\u2014Laundry, 14x30: $2,000.00\nc\u2014Shop, 20x30: $1,500.00\nd\u2014Steel storage: $100.00\ne\u2014Farmer's house, 14x14: $500.00\nf\u2014Cesspool and septic tank (cost): $1,000.00\ng\u2014Main stable, 35x60, modern: $5,000.00\nh\u2014Log buildings, Implement shed, granary, hen house, hog pen, boiler room: $2,000.00\n(Cf exhibits D and E) $57,100.00\n\nC\u2014CHATTELS:\na\u2014Farm Implements: see exhibit F.p.l: $4,890.00\nb\u2014Shop equipment: \" F.p.3: $1,861.00 \u2014 $159.00\nc\u2014Live stock: \" F.p.4: $4,752.00\nd\u2014Dairy, laundry, bakery, shoemaker's shop (equipment) see exhibit F.p.5: $2,571.00 \u2014 $91.00\ne\u2014Furniture: \" F.p.6-7: $3,772.70 \u2014 $196.70\nf\u2014Clothing: \" F.p.8-9: $4,442.70 \u2014 $22.70\ng\u2014Chapel: \" F.p.10: $924.00 \u2014 $28,213.40\nTOTAL: $99,974.40\n\n2o\u2014PRICE ASKED FOR THE ABOVE PROPERTY:\n\nA\u2014LANDS: described above: $10,000.00\nB\u2014BUILDINGS: \" \" $50,000.00\nC\u2014CHATTELS: \" \" $10,000.00\n$70,000.00\n\nThe price asked for is therefore about 30% less than the actual value of the properties offered. The difference between this last offer of $70,000.00 and the first one for $62,500.00 comes specially from the larger quantity of land proposed (viz 488.70 acres instead of 160). At Lestock (Muscowequan's), 640 acres.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In connection with these 3 of his letter, under the heading \"Actual value of the property\" (church authorities' valuation) I wish to point out that under \"lands\", 206 acres was purchased in 1908 from the Indian reserve at $15 per acre. The 282.7 acre parcel was secured evidently in the open market. This parcel is across the Qu'Appelle river, approximately a mile from the school.\n\nAs far as buildings are concerned, the main building was completed in 1917. The Department provided a total of $1344 capital expense (fiscal years 1907-10). With reference to chattels, (page 3, Father Guy's letter and Exhibit F.) farm implements $4,890 appears satisfactory. Under Shop Equipment, whiffletrees, irons, clevises, chains, oils, bolts, screws, nails, iron, solder, etc., belting and stove pipes, a total of $292 should be subtracted from $1561, leaving $1269. The live stock inventory is satisfactory; but from the dairy, laundry and bakery shops should be deducted the refrigerator, which was built by the Department; flour, soap and lye, leather, tacks and thread, a total of $1680, leaving a balance of $591. In connection with furniture, the desks, clocks, 12 sewing machines and kitchen outfit were supplied by the Department, and the trunks could not be allowed - a total deduction of $805, leaving $2967.70. The whole clothing item of $9442.70 should be struck out, as also should the chapel equipment of $924.\n\nI note that the bake oven, $266.14, and laundry machinery, $816, supplied by the Department, 1924-25, are not included in the inventory.\n\nTo recapitulate, the church valuation of the property that we should acquire is as follows:\n\n| Item       | Value   |\n|------------|---------|\n| Lands      | $14,661 |\n| Buildings  | $5,756  |\n| Chattels   | $15,069 |\n| Total      | $85,486 |\n\n* Department expense deducted.\n\nThe church is asking that the purchase price be\n\n| Item       | Value   |\n|------------|---------|\n| Lands      | $10,000 |\n| Buildings  | $50,000 |\n| Chattels   | $10,000 |\n| Total      | $70,000 |\nJune 4, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nIt is the intention to purchase the Cowessess Indian Residential School, in Saskatchewan, from the Oblate Order.

Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, June 17, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Holden:\n\nThis Department is considering the purchase of the Cowessess Indian Residential School, at Mariewal, north of Broadview. The property is owned by the Oblate Fathers of the Roman Catholic Church, with whom we have been negotiating. It is our intention to purchase 206 acres in Sections 5 and 8, T. 19 A., R. 5, W. 2nd, on which the school buildings are situated; 282 acres in Sections 3 and 4, T. 19, R. 5; and Sections 33 and 34, T. 18, R. 5 - a total of 488 acres. Enclosed you will find Township Plan with the property in question marked in blue.\n\nBefore final arrangements can be made with the present owners, I wish to have a valuation of the property by an independent valuator and I should be pleased if you would undertake the commission of appraisal for the Department. The valuation should show the actual present value of the land in question, the main and other school buildings, furniture, machinery, farm implements and livestock. The church and rectory near the school are not situated on the parcel of land that we are purchasing.\n\nIt is the Department's wish that the transfer be completed in the near future and I shall be grateful if you will undertake this work at your earliest convenience. Please advise me if you will act for us in this connection and indicate the probable date of your valuation and report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

The appearance of the tables after the meal showed a lack of judgment. There was altogether too much waste. At nearly every place there were large portions of meat, bread already buttered, pudding etc. left over. This waste was so general that I had to comment upon it.\n\nGeneral I regret that the Principal was absent as I would have liked to direct his attention to the conditions as I found them. I am of the opinion that his staff have not had the training or experience to enable them to carry on the work in the manner that it should be done at an institution of this kind.\n\nOWESSESS BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on the 23rd June accompanied by Agent Pugh. This school is under the auspices of the Roman Catholic church. The Principal, the Rev. J. Carriere O.M.I. is assisted in his work by six sisters, two of whom are teachers, a lay brother and a mechanic.\n\nBuilding. The main building is brick with a basement and three stories. The basement provides play-rooms, kitchen, dining room and laundry. The first floor provides office, staff room and two bright classrooms. The second floor provides a sewing room infirmary and staff room, and the top floor provides dormitories. There is...\nsplendid separation between the boys' and girls' dormitories. The building is steam heated, and lighted with electricity and is well equipped. There is an abundant supply of good water available. I found the building scrupulously clean throughout.\n\nAttendance. There are 82 pupils enrolled, all but four of whom were present. They were neatly dressed and presented a clean and well nourished appearance. They were dressed for the occasion and were very neatly clothed. I had called at this school unexpectedly on the evening of the 19th and saw the children in their everyday clothing which I found clean and good.\n\nFood. There is plenty of good wholesome food provided including all the milk the children desire. A large garden supplies all their vegetable requirements and these form an important item of the children's diet.\n\nThe crop sown this year consists of 65 acres of wheat, 43 acres oats, 30 acres barley and 6 acres of garden stuff and potatoes. The grain and vegetable crops look fine and there is an excellent prospect for an abundant yield.\n\nThe cattle number over 50 head. They were milking 15 cows. The stock provides a large proportion of their meat supply and butter. They keep a large...\nflock of poultry and the produce from their farm and stock is an important factor in keeping down the expense of carrying on the work.\n\nIn my opinion this school is being conducted in a satisfactory manner. The general appearance and atmosphere of the institution shows that the Principal and his staff take a pride and interest in their duties.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nRegina, Sask., July 4th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an inspection made at the two boarding schools in the Crooked Lake Agency by Mr. Inspector Murison.\n\nThe report on the Cowesses school is encouraging and shows that everything is well looked after and that the children are getting a proper training.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

This consists of 206 acres. 150 acres of this land is under cultivation and it is also in good condition.\n\nThe crop at the present time on this land is good and their garden is extra.\n\nAbout 56 acres is pasture land. This 56 acres in my opinion is too low for cultivation.\n\nTherefore the price of 206 acres @ $30 per acre is $6180.00\n\nOf the land in sections 3 and 4, Township 19A, Range 5, and sections 33 and 34, Township 19, Range 5, (282 acres), about 200 acres is under cultivation. 25 acres is wasteland on the bank of the valley and 57 acres of hayland. This land is not in a good state of cultivation.\n\nTherefore 282 acres @ $25 per acre $7050.00\n\nTotal cost of land $13230.00\nIndian Head, Sask.,\nJuly 10th, 1929.\n\nMr. Duncan,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nEnclosed you will please find my valuation of the Cowessess Indian Residential School at Marieval.\n\nI found the school building in a good state of repair, and the contents in the best of order.\n\nThe ice house listed at $1200 to you by the Oblate Fathers is cut out of my valuation as they claim it was donated to them by the Government in 1924.\n\nThe farm house listed to you as 14' x 14' has had an addition added, making it 14' x 28'.\n\nI checked up both bedding and clothing, also cotton and other materials in stock. I found much more than the Oblate Fathers listed to you. But as you did not ask me to value these I am sending no valuation on them.\n\nI find the valuation the Fathers put on this property very reasonable except on a few articles.\nThe School could not be built at the present time for the amount they have valued it at. That is, with the steam heating system, the electric lights, and the cesspool or septic tank, which I consider part of the equipment of the building; also the plumbing system and fixtures throughout the building.\n\nThis is not a new building, although in the very best state of repair, and I consider that $40,000.00 is a very fair valuation, I consider with the heating, plumbing, septic tank and the lighting system that the building is worth at least $40,000.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSamuel Otis Holden\nDear Sirs:\n\nBelow, you will find the bill for the valuation of the Cowessos Indian Residential school, Buildings, Implements, Land, Stock and Furniture at Maniwa.\n\nMileage for Car to Maniwa and return:\n150 miles at 10\u00a2 per mile $15.00\n\nAssistant Earl O.

It is the intention to acquire title to 206 acres in Sections 5 and 8, T. 19 A., R. 5, W. 2nd, on which the school buildings are situate, and 282 acres in Sections 3 and 4, T. 19 A., R. 5, and in Sections 33 and 34, T. 18, R. 5 - a total of 488 acres.

Reilly, D.L.S., which has been approved by A. C. Garner, Chief Surveyor, and a letter from the Surveyor stating that the said parcel to be transferred to the Department of Indian Affairs contains 206 acres more or less and that all the school buildings to be transferred are situate thereon. I understand that Rev. Father J. B. Beys, O.M.I., 340 Provencher Ave., St. Boniface, Man., has the certificate of title for this property and also two certificates of title (No. T.91 G and T.92 G) which together refer to the second parcel that comprises 282 acres more or less. This Rev. Gentleman will act for the vendors.\n\nThis Department is purchasing the lands, buildings and chattels. The consideration for the real estate is $60,000 and for the property included in the bill of sale, $10,000.

I should be glad of any observations you may have to make as to the draft transfer and more particularly the descriptions of land therein contained.

As to the Ford car and the tractor and such articles as the International Engine, where such a course\n\n\"Encl.\"\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nis possible, identification might be secured by giving the factory engine number, while farm implements might be described by the maker's name as has already been done in the case of the Verity Walking Plow and the International Separator.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Sec.34 appears to be correct, and the area of the portions of Secs.3 and 4 in Tp.19-A does not agree with the Tp.plans but I think there must have been a re-survey made and that these descriptions prepared in the Registry Office must be according to the re-survey, if so, they must be considered correct and sufficient. In any case, we have no plan sufficient to check them and the only method I see of handling the matter is to write Mr. Garner and call attention to these matters, asking him to give us a copy of the latest plans registered with him and check the description with them.

McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nI have the honour to advise receipt of communication from our agent dated October 21st going to show that he has had some correspondence with Mr. Garner, Chief Surveyor at the Land Titles Office, Regina, relative to the descriptions. It is apparent that upon a comparison of the descriptions of the transfers with the Chief Surveyor's copies of the township maps there were found several discrepancies. Our agent gathers that Mr. Garner has gone into the matter very fully with the Registrar of Land Titles at Moosomin and that the registrar had said that although the descriptions contained in the draft transfers agree with the existing certificates and the transfer could therefore be registered in accordance with these drafts, he would suggest issuing a new title using more concise descriptions and making some consolidation of descriptions in which he would appreciate Mr. Garner's assistance. Our agent points out that Mr. Garner suggests that we require the registrar to revise the descriptions when issuing titles based on the transfers in question. If this suggestion meets\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-1, part 1)\nwith your approval I should be glad to write our agent accordingly in order that he may see that the registrar gets our request. He proposes sending in the transfers as completed and suggests that he do not register them until further word is had from us. Mr. Thomson reports that the transferors have paid up the taxes on these properties for this year and that he holds certificate from the Secretary Treasurer of the Rural Municipality to that effect.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

D.M.J.\n\nThe Chief Accountant,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nOttawa, February 3rd, 1926.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing a request from the Principal of the Cowessess Indian Residential School to be supplied with a number of fire extinguishers. In making this request, it is noted that the Principal states as follows:\n\n\"I would advise that when we had the fire at this school on the 15th of November, 1925, we used up our number 12 small ones, and this we found was not enough to cope with the fire and had to resort to water, but I am satisfied that the extinguishers are very good.\"\n\nThis is the first intimation the Department received that a fire occurred at this school. I have to request that you will furnish a report stating fully the cause of the fire, the location of same and the damage caused, if any. It is considered that a matter of this nature should have been promptly reported to the Department, giving full particulars. If you reported the fire to Mr. Commissioner Graham, I shall be pleased to have a copy of your letter.\n\nThe Principal states that 12 small fire extinguishers were used up during the fire. Does this mean that the chemical in these extinguishers only was used, and, if so, would it not be satisfactory if a new supply of chemical is furnished? Please state the number, size and type of the extinguishers at present in the school, and whether you could arrange to obtain any chemical refills that may be required. When we have full information as to the condition and number of the extinguishers at present on hand, consideration will then be given to authorizing the supplying of a further number of new extinguishers.\n\nPlease give the information asked for regarding the fire, and the number and condition of the extinguishers on hand, as early as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, May 21st, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is desirous of learning if the older girls at the Cowessess Indian Residential School are being trained in milking cows. As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular. The Department expects that the older girls, under proper supervision, will be given a course of instruction in milking, and I shall be pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Carriere, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCowessess Indian Res. School,\nMarieval, Via Grayson, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have received a letter from Sister Saint Augustin at the Cowessess Indian Residential School at Mariieval, asking if the department grants premiums to teachers who have spent a long term as such with the Department. She states that some sisters have so been favored. I was not aware that this practice had been followed, and I shall be glad if you will advise me. If it has been, sister Augustin would come within the category of those whose long and satisfactory services are worthy of consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 28, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-11 of the 22nd instant, relative to a communication received by you from the Sister Superior of the Cowessess Indian Residential School, requesting to be informed whether premiums are granted to teachers who have given long service. In reply I beg to say that the Department has never made any grants, such as premiums, pensions or gratuities, to teachers of residential schools upon retiring after long service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe classroom work is carried on in two class rooms, one for the boys and one for the girls. Sister Arsenious is in charge of the girls' room in which work is carried on from Grade 1 to Grade 6. The roll calls for 42 pupils and the attendance is good. The sister I understand is a qualified teacher and the class work was good considering the children had just returned from holidays.\n\nThe work in the boys' room is in charge of sister St. Odilon who is also qualified. There are 36 boys enrolled and the register showed the attendance to be good. The grades range from 1 to 6, and the children appeared to understand their work and to be properly graded. I was surprised to find the Dominion Catholic Readers and other text books being used and not the Saskatchewan text books.\n\nThe building throughout was clean and the work in the various departments progressed under splendid order and with apparently little effort on the part of those in charge.\n\nThe new boiler room, although not completed, was well under way and is one of the finest I have seen. It - is built about -\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nis built about twenty feet from the main building and joined by an underground passage. The basement is twelve feet underground and measures about 32' x 42'. Part of this basement is to be used as a root cellar; while the other half is taken up with the furnace and boiler. The ground floor is used as a workshop and storage room for the electric light plant, while above this, sleeping accommodation is made for the night watchman and furnace man. The danger from fire is practically eliminated due to the location of the building and its construction.\n\nSince my last visit the horse barn has been refloored with cement and is now in good condition. The new chicken house was badly needed and will undoubtedly be made good use of.\n\nA hog barn is also needed, as the old buildings now in use are a disgrace and should be removed.\n\nAbout twelve cows are being milked at the present time and this gives plenty of milk for the needs of the school.\n\nThe crops this year in the valley are very poor and the Reverend Father Carrier informed me that all told he only threshed about 450 bus. of grain.\n\nI was present at the noon-day meal and there appeared plenty of well prepared food which the children enjoyed and which undoubtedly satisfied them.\n\nI believe this school is well managed, and one could not help but be pleased with the conditions and with the care and supervision given to the children.\nCOPY OF LETTER FROM COMMISSIONER GRAHAM,\nHIS NO. 304-11, dated September 25, 1929.\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a report on the two Boarding Schools in the Crooked Lake Agency. This report was written by Mr. Inspector Hamilton and the inspection took place between the 29th of August and the 6th instant.\n\nThe report on the Cowessess School shows that everything at this institution is in first class shape and good work is being done.\n\nYou will take notice of the Inspector's remarks regarding the readers that are being used at this institution. I am not prepared to say whether they should or should not be used. The Department should, however, be aware of this fact.\n\nThe hog pen, which is needed, is provided for in the Estimates which have recently been submitted to the Department.\nOttawa, October 3, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your 304-11 of the 25th ultimo, enclosing Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the schools of the Crooked Lake Agency, I wish to inform you that the Dominion Catholic Readers, in use at the Cowessess Institution, are authorized by the Department. In the main, the texts used in Indian schools are those prescribed by the Provincial Department of Education; but the Department allows our Roman Catholic schools to use Roman Catholic readers, provided suitable ones can be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nEXTRACT OF THE REPORT OF MR. INDIAN AGENT OSTRANDER,\nFOR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER, 1929, ON THE COWESSES\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 108-2-7.\n\nEfficiency of the Staff:- generally good. Father Carriere still away and his position being ably filled by Father Bousquet; girls' class-room teacher good; boys' teacher not very good.\n\nGeneral Management:- The general management of this school is good.\n\nSuggestions: I suggested a change in boys' classroom teachers in my last report. No change has been made as yet.\nOttawa, January 17, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Ostrander reports that he is not satisfied with the discipline in the boys' classroom at the Cowessess Indian Residential School. Would you please discuss this with Mr. Ostrander, to make sure that you understand his criticism, and then write the Department concerning the advisability of making a change. I may say that the reports received are, on the whole, quite satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. Carriere, O. M.

Carriere, O. M. I., Principal of the Cowessess Indian Residential School. It is expected, in the course of the next few weeks, that the Order will nominate a successor to Father Carriere. In the meantime, the work at the school will be taken over by the Acting Principal, Rev. P. Chatelain. The Department is approving of this arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nOttawa, July 3, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is informed, by the Very Reverend J. Magman, O. M. I., Provincial of the Oblate Order, of the death of Reverend J. Carrieres, O. M. I., Principal of the Cowessess Indian Residential School. Father Magman states that a successor will be appointed in a few weeks and that, in the meantime, the Assistant Principal, Father P. Chatelain, will carry on the duties. The Department, while regretting the loss occasioned by the death of Father Carrieres, will approve of the arrangements made by the Order to carry on the work until a principal is appointed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Inspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, July 3, 1933.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nIn the absence of Dr. McGill, Deputy Superintendent General, I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, informing the Department of the death of the Reverend J. Carriere, O.M.I., late principal of the Cowessess Indian Residential School. In reply I have to say that the death of Father Carriere is greatly regretted. His devotion for many years to the education of the Indian children and the success in the management of the Cowessess School are appreciated. Sympathy is extended to you and the Order with which you are associated in the death of Father Carriere.\n\nIt is noted that you are arranging for a successor, and, in the meantime, the Department will approve of Reverend Plaside Chatelain, Vice Principal, acting as principal until a successor to Father Carriere is appointed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVery Rev. J. Magnan, O.M.I.,\n340 Provencher Avenue,\nSt. Boniface,\nMan.\nSir:\n\nFor many years it has been the custom for the Indian parents of children attending the Cowessess Indian Residential School to visit the school at any time but the more especially on Sunday and take their children from the school to their homes or camps and eat a meal with them, sometimes staying with them several hours.\n\nWhile this procedure has been fairly satisfactory and has never led to a great deal of trouble I know it is not customary at most residential schools and I do not approve of it. Fr. Carriere however was always loathe to change fearing meeting with the ill will of the parents.\n\nFr. Chatelaine, Acting Principal, spoke to me one day last week stating that he wished to make a rule that the children would not be permitted to visit in their own homes in the future during the regular school term except under special circumstances and asked my opinion of the matter. I informed him that I was quite in accord with the idea and that I was sure the Department would concur. Yesterday being the first Sunday since this decision was made Fr. Chatelaine informed the Indians of his intentions which immediately roused their ire.\n\nToday a number of Indians visited my office to meet Fr. Chatelaine in my presence to go into the matter more fully. I discussed the matter thoroughly with them giving reasons why I considered Fr. Chatelaine quite correct in trying to enforce this rule. Of thirteen parents present in my office 3 agreed with what Fr. Chatelaine had suggested and 10 were contrary.\n\nI do not know whether it is the wish of the Department to enforce a rule of this kind against the wishes of the parents but I would like to see Fr. Chatelaine receive the utmost support and commendation in any effort he may make to improve the discipline of this school and this is only a first step in the right direction. Many times in the past the sisters at the school have informed me that allowing the children to go home for even short periods often gives them a great deal of extra work with vermin, sickness etc. and they were never in accord with Fr. Carriere in the matter.\n\nI would be glad to receive the Department's instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nJ.F.R.Ostrander\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, August 28th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the custom of allowing the pupils of the Cowessess Indian Residential School to visit their parents occasionally.\n\nThe Department regrets that this practice has prevailed at the Cowessess Residential School. It is realized that it must cause considerable inconvenience to the staff and, also, disarrange the classroom work. At the same time, when the Indians insist on it being continued, there may be difficulty in wholly stopping it.\n\nHas the same practice prevailed at the Round Lake Indian Residential School? Please make definite inquiries regarding this and advise the Department. If such practice has prevailed, it might be advisable for you to hold a meeting with the Principals of both schools and consider what is the best action to take in future. The Department feels that the practice should be totally discontinued or, at least, only one day a week, preferably Sunday, should be set aside for parents either to visit their children at the school or for the children to go home for a few hours.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 108-2-1 of the 26th ultimo in connection with the visiting of pupils of the Cowessess Indian Residential School during the school term.\n\nWith regard to your question regarding the children of the Round Lake Indian Residential School I would say that the system followed at this school regarding visiting leaves nothing to be desired as the occasions of children spending part of the day at the homes of their parents during the regular school term are very rare and rightly so.\n\nReverend Fr. Chatelaine informs me that he enforced the rule at his school last Sunday, the 27th, and there was only mild protest from a few Indians, possibly because they knew that I had written the Department about the matter and was awaiting a reply.\n\nI think that if the Department make a definite ruling that the children must not visit their homes during the regular term without special permission, but permitting the parents to visit the school as arranged with the Reverend Principal, to see their children on the school grounds, there will be little further trouble.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 7th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, with reference to allowing the pupils of the Cowessess Indian Residential School to visit their homes.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may inform the Reverend Principal of the Cowessess Residential School that the children must not visit their homes during the regular term without special permission. Parents may visit the school to see their children as arranged by the Reverend Principal.\n\nIt is understood that the same procedure will be followed at the Round Lake Residential School and you should so inform the Principal of that school. You should keep in touch with the Principals of both schools and make certain that the Department's wishes are being carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B.

School, I asked you the authorisation of keeping the children in school on Sundays; therefore not giving them the leave of taking their dinner with their parents; which authorisation was granted to me.\n\nTo-day, after experiencing the new regulation the whole year, I am believing that for the administration of the school, it would be better to let the children go home, not every Sunday, but on the first Sunday of each month.\n\nSo, would you be kind enough to give me this permission.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. Chatelain, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 23, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, suggesting that the children of the Cowessess Indian Residential School be allowed to go home on the first Sunday of each month.\n\nThe question of allowing children from the Cowessess School to go home at certain periods was the cause of considerable trouble in the past. As a result, the Department wrote Mr. Agent Ostrander on September 7th, last. A copy of this letter is enclosed for your information. As it is important that the same regulations should apply to both the Round Lake and the Cowessess Residential Schools, the Department wishes you to discuss the matter fully with Mr. Ostrander. He will then write the Department, making a definite recommendation regarding the procedure which he considers should be adopted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. P. Chatelain, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCowessess Residential School,\nMarieval, via Greyson,\nSask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:-\n\nI have been informed by Revd. Fr. Chatelain, Principal of the Cowessess I. R. School that he has received a letter from the Department informing him that his pupilage grant may be increased to 85 pupils and he wishes to bring the number in his school up to this amount.\n\nIf this is in order I would be pleased to be so informed by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 12, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, regarding an increase in pupilage at the Cowessess Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that Rev. Father Plourde, Winnipeg, acting on behalf of the Provincial of the Oblate Order, under whose auspices the school is conducted, requested that grant be provided for an increase of five pupils. The Department informed him that this matter would be considered, but no decision has yet been arrived at. Our appropriation covering per capita grants has been practically assigned. Father Plourde, no doubt, informed the Principal of the School, as this Department has not communicated with the Principal regarding the matter.\n\nI would suggest that you again draw this matter to the attention of the Department at the beginning of the next school year, as if it is possible to make the increase, it would not be effective before October first, next. When renewing your request, you should state definitely if there is accommodation and sufficient air space in the dormitories for an increase in the pupilage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No.108-2-1 of June 12th last to Mr. Ostrander in connection with the increase of pupilage applied for at the Cowessess I.R. School I beg to advise that the Principal states that they have the accommodation for the increase asked for and as requested in your letter, am again bringing this to your attention for your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 23, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, I beg to say that it has been decided to increase the pupilage at the Cowessess Indian Residential School from 80 to 85. This increase will date from October 1, 1935. Please inform the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Parker,\nActing Secretary.\n\nE.A.W.R.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cowessess Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1941.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Constance Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

(RC 10, Volume 6305, file 651-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Govenasson Indian Res.

$\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Govenans Indian School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30 1941.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cassness Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cowessess Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended December 30th 1941.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cowessess Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Connaught Indian School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Conness Indian School for the Quarter ended Sept. 1942.\n\nPrincipal: ____________________________\n\nDated: Sept. 30, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: ____________________________\n\nDated: Oct. 9, 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cowessess Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cowessess Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added, and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cowessess Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cowessess Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. P. D. Varney\n\nDated October 8, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cowessess Indian Reserve School for the Quarter ended June 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cowessess Indian Reserve School for the Quarter ended June 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 20th 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: July 3rd 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...COWGEESE Indian Reserve School for the Quarter ended...June...19.43.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cowessess Indian Res. School School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: JAN. 6, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Connecong Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cowessess Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Crooked Lake Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended:\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended October 31st 1944.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated October 31st 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated OCT 6 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 19...\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. No cash, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the Marienval, via Grayson, Sask.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL MARIEYAL via GRAYSON, SASK.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MARIEVAL & GRAYSON SASK.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL MARIEVAL via GRAYSON, SASK., School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: October 10, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at OCTOBER 23, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MARIEVAL via GRAYSON, SASK., School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1945.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated January 2nd 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at JAN 1 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1st, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this OCT 2 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MARIEVAL VIA GRAYSON, SASK.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MARIEVAL via GRAYSON, SASK.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly-per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL MARIEVAL via GRAYSON, SASK.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils shown on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MARIEVAL via GRAYSON, SASK., School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 15th 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at OCT. 20th 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. All Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MARLEVAL via GRAYSON, SASK.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the MARIEVAL INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL for the Quarter ended June 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MARIEVALIA GRAYSON, SASK., School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCROOKED LAKE AGENCY\n\nDated at\n\nJUL 5 1949\n\nthis\n\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MARIEVAL via GLAYSON, SASK.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MARIEVAL, VIA GRAYSON, SASK.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the MARIEVAL via GRANDSON, SASK., School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1929.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1st, 1929\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MARLEY AGENCY, GRAYSON, SASK., School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1949.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated January 1st, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at CROOKED LAKE AGENCY, JANUARY 2nd, 1950.\n\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cross Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 30th June 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 28 June 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Norway House this 5th July 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MALIGWAHATTA GRAYSON, SASK., School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 1st, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CROOK RIVER, AUGUST 10th, 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3608\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MARIEVALLEN GRAYSON School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1st, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Breadview, Oct. 4, 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MARIEVAL via GRAYSON, SASK., School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1st, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0242            | Ivy Delorme    | 11  |     | 1    | Cowessess      |                   | Housekeeping           | 1-2-46                    | 92         |                                                                                                                  |\n| 0243            | M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MARIEVAL VIA GRAYSON, SASK., School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1st, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Breadview, Sask., this OCT 4, 1952.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

We surely appreciate the generosity of the Department. The contractor states that at this present time, it would be nearly impossible to make a good wall, in account of such cold weather we are having and he is only guessing to build it up in the spring 1923.

It is desired, if possible, to pay for this building out of this year's appropriation. I would therefore ask you to please advise me the earliest date on which you think this building can be erected, or, if it is impossible to erect the building before the first of April, if all of the materials could be placed on the ground by Mr. Neatman, and the accounts for same paid from this year's vote.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.

The painting would have to be done in fine weather as well as the cement work. No contractor would guarantee the work if undertaken before the 15th of April.\n\nThe material could be placed on the ground before the first of April, however, and Mr. Neatman's representative at Grayson would see to this at once. Kindly advise me by wire as to the decision of the Department, in order that the material may be moved while the roads are yet good for sleighing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.E.

It was necessary to order these specially from Montreal as none could be obtained locally except those made in the U.S.A.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nOn November 10th 1922, an Order-in-Council (No. 34/2365) was passed awarding the contract for the construction of a cold storage building for Cowessess Indian Boarding School to the lowest tenderer, Mr. Frank Westman, for the amount of $1,100.\n\nI find that on April 30th last, cheque No. 570 was issued in favour of Fred W. Terry for the amount of $570.06, being the first payment for the erection of the above mentioned building. Kindly inform me why, when the contract was awarded by Council to Frank Westman, payment is made to Fred W. Terry.\n\nThe certificate in support of this payment was made out in your department by Mr. Orr, your architect. I presume that the amount certified to by him is based on a report sent in by the officer of your department who is charged with the supervision of the work at the school. If such is the case Mr. Orr's certificate for payment should be supported by a copy of such report.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Auditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nJWR/MVT\nJanuary 19th, 1924.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant with reference to the contract for the erection of the cold-storage building in connection with the Cowessess Indian boarding school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this contract was awarded Mr. Frank Westman for the sum of $1,100.00. Between the time of the acceptance of his tender and passing of the necessary Order in Council, our agent informed us that Mr. Westman had left Greyson, Sask., and gone to reside at the coast, and that his business was being conducted by Mr. F. W. Terry, who signed the contract as his agent. Mr. Terry successfully completed the work and payments were made to him.\n\nI trust this explanation will be satisfactory. I may say that Mr. MacKenzie showed the original papers to Mr. Reid yesterday. Payments were made on the certificate of our Architect, based upon reports of the agent; these also were shown to Mr. Reid. I shall ask the Architect, however, to bear in mind the fact that when he makes payments of this kind a copy of the report of our agent or other officer should accompany the progress certificate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWm. Kearns, Esq.,\nAsst. Auditor General,\nOttawa.\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand that a certain amount was included in the estimates in favour of Cowessess Indian Residential School. Having consulted the Reverend Principal, Reverend Father Carri\u00e8re, about his wishes in the matter, I beg to state that the following would be most welcomed at that Institution as they are much needed:\n\n1. Power washing machine\n2. Extractor (26\")\n3. Six Enamelled tubs\n4. 1 hand washing machine\n5. 1 hand wringer\n6. New batteries for the lighting system.\n7. An oven for about 100 loaves.\n8. Three sewing machines.\n\nThe order given is that of importance according to the estimation of the Principal. I would therefore ask you to give your usual kind attention to this matter, in order to enable the School to keep on its work with more efficacy, if possible.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Henry.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, it may have worn out or they may have transferred it to another school.\n\nDo you think it is necessary to buy an Extractor? One was asked for at the File Hills School and I refused to give it to them, but if you think they should have them at both these schools you will let me know and I will be glad to make the recommendation.\n\nI think it would be better for me to have a report from one of our inspectors as to what is really necessary before making a recommendation. It might be some weeks, however, before this could be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

I find that the Washing Machine which they have there is still in use, but to get repairs for it would be an expensive matter. I, therefore, feel like recommending the purchase of one Power Washing Machine, size 30\" x 40\", and four enamel wash tubs instead of six.\n\nI would also recommend the purchase of one sewing machine, and one bread oven. The bread oven is badly needed and the cost would be somewhere between $250 and $300.\n\nIf I receive your authority to make these purchases I will invite competition, except where a special make of article is required.\n\nIn addition to the above the Principal makes a request to be supplied with a set of Exide Batteries, 16 in number, costing $230.00. These are for his lighting plant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW. M.

I am pleased to have your recommendation as to the equipment that should be supplied. I consider it advisable to have an extractor in the laundry at schools of this type and this article will be added. The equipment will be ordered from this office.\n\nIf you consider that an extractor should be added to the laundry equipment at the File Hills Residential School, you may requisition for one.\n\nWith reference to the Cowessess principal's request for Exide batteries, I consider that these should be provided by the management.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

This item was not in the Estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) John E. Pugh\nIndian Agent.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter that I received from our Indian Agent at Crooked Lake which speaks for itself.\n\nIt seems to me that repairs of this kind should be done by the school authorities themselves, but my own impression is that they do not intend from now on to do any minor work around the schools, and the Department have themselves to blame for this situation. I do not think you have made it quite clear to the school authorities what they are expected to do, and requests of this kind are going to come in by the hundred as time goes on.\n\nKindly let me know what you wish done in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 22, 1925.\n\n304-11-A\n\nSIR,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, enclosing copy of a letter from Mr. Agent Pugh, regarding certain repairs required to the front steps of the Cowessess Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers repairs of this kind should be done by the school management without cost to the Department.\n\nPlease inform the agent accordingly in order that he may notify the principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nAct. Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, SASK.\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing a request from the Principal of the Cowessess Indian Residential School to be supplied with a number of fire extinguishers. In making this request, it is noted that the Principal states as follows:\n\n\"I would advise that when we had the fire at this school on the 13th of November, 1925, we used up our number 12 small ones, and this we found was not enough to cope with the fire and had to resort to water, but I am satisfied that the extinguishers are very good.\"\n\nThis is the first intimation the Department received that a fire occurred at this school. I have to request that you will furnish a report stating fully the cause of the fire, the location of same and the damage caused, if any. It is considered that a matter of this nature should have been promptly reported to the Department, giving full particulars. If you reported the fire to Mr. Commissioner Graham, I shall be pleased to have a copy of your letter.\n\nThe Principal states that 12 small fire extinguishers were used up during the fire. Does this mean that the chemical in these extinguishers only was used, and, if so, would it not be satisfactory if a new supply of chemical is furnished? Please state the number, size and type of the extinguishers at present in the school, and whether you could arrange to obtain any chemical refills that may be required. Then we have full information as to the condition and number of the extinguishers at present on hand, consideration will then be given to authorizing the supplying of a further number of new extinguishers.\n\nPlease give the information asked for regarding the fire, and the number and condition of the extinguishers on hand, as early as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter #55996-9 dated Feb 3rd, 1926 in reference to a fire which occurred at the Cowessess Indian Residential School on the 13th November, 1925, and in reply I beg to state I have not officially reported this fire to the Department or the Indian Commissioner, I only reported the fire in my December report.\n\nI would state that I was not notified by the Principal and I received my information of the fire one week after its occurrence from the Commissioner's office in Regina. I saw the Principal at this time and he advised me that he notified his Head Quarters and they were to notify the Department, and I therefore let matters stand at that and only made mention of the fire in my report for December.\n\nIn regard to the fire I would advise that the source of it was brought to light yesterday the 11th Feb., when after receiving the Department's letter, I made arrangements with R.C.M.P. to pick up ex-pupil Jimmy Kesecsepe, 17 years of age, of whom I had had reports of behavior around reserves, and also from information obtained from the school, and after a considerable time the boy was brought into the office here, and the R.C.M.P. Sgt. Richardson took an admission of guilt that he set the fire in the Electric Shop, using gasoline out of a pail and pouring it between the walls, and firing paper. One other boy was with him, Sampson Feltier, age 15 years.\n\nThe location of the fire was in the wall of the Electric Shop, Laundry and Boiler room, the damage consisted of the wall only, to the ceiling, and some belting. No other damage was done.\n\nThe fire was got under control by chemicals and water. All the children were gotten out safely by the fire escape in a few minutes. The whole building was enveloped in smoke, but fortunately did not flame as all doors were kept shut. The Electric Shop, Laundry and boiler room are in a lean to on to the proper building.\n\nI understand that insurance has been paid for the damage caused, and I note that the partition burnt out has been rebuilt in concrete.\n\nIn regard to the extinguishers I would advise that they have 12 small hand Pyrene extinguishers. There have been eight refilled and chemical is being supplied for the other four, but the number is thought to be inadequate, hence the request for a further supply. The condition of those on hand is good.\nIn regard to the boy apprehended for this fire I beg to advise that Sgt. Richardson has this boy in custody and is taking the matter up through his Head quarters in Regina and Indian Commissioner Graham. It is however my recommendation that the boy be sent to a Reformatory as I consider he is a dangerous boy to be at large.\n\nI trust this is the information desired and regret that I was negligent in not reporting the matter properly, but I have no doubt that the Department will understand the position I was in, through not having the co-operation of the Principal in the matter of reporting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nI have before me a copy of Agent Pugh's letter of the 12th instant addressed to the Department, regarding a fire at the Cowesses R.C. Indian Residential School in December last.\n\nI may say I read in the paper that a fire had taken place at this institution, but have never had any report from the Principal of the school, which I think should have been sent here. Whether the building is the property of the Department or the Church it seems to me that a matter of this kind should be brought to the attention of the Department's officers in the field at once.\n\nMy reason for writing is that the Police Department have the boy, Jimmy Kesecapew, apprehended, and on my instructions he is being examined as to his sanity, as it is thought that he might be mentally deficient, and after this examination takes place it will be decided whether he should be sent to an asylum or a home for incorrigible boys. Do you not think that the Principal made a serious mistake in letting this boy leave the school, when he knew the kind of lad he was.\n\nI am not writing to the Principal asking him to report the matter again, but I would request that the Department do so, as we must keep in touch with what is going on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 19, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 41 of the 12th instant, with reference to the fire at the Cowessess Indian Residential School. I note that the Rev. Principal did not officially notify you. I have to inform you that this institution was recently acquired by the Crown, and, in future, anything of interest to the Department should be the subject for an early inspection, if necessary, and a report. I am writing to the Rev. Principal, concerning his failure to direct to you a report in connection with the fire.\n\nI note your recommendation that action be taken concerning Jimmy Kesecapew. Mr. Commissioner Graham reports that he is already apprehended and is being examined with a view to sending him to a suitable institution. I shall be pleased if you will inform me when this boy, who is an ex-pupil of the Cowessess School, was allowed to go home and indicate if the Rev. Principal knew he was incorrigible or dangerous. Is this lad the one who is shown on the quarterly returns as John Kesecapew, No. 70?\n\nYou will receive another communication with reference to the fire extinguishers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Principal of the Cowessess Indian Residential School did not report to you a recent fire. I am writing the Rev. Principal, informing him that such matters should be reported to the Indian agent at once. I wish to inform you that the Department has now just completed the transfer of this institution to the Crown.\n\nI note that you are taking steps to have Jimmy Kesecapew placed in a suitable Institution or Home.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, February 20, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIt has been drawn to my attention that you did not officially report a fire at the Cowessess Indian Residential School during the month of November, last.

District,\nRegina, Sask., 13-2-26.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nR.C.M.Police,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nFORWARDED for your information.\nI have instructed Sergt. Richardson to lay a charge of arson against this Indian, so as to enable him to hold him legally for further investigation.\n\nSupt.,\nA.B. Allard,\nO.C. Southern Sask. District,\nRegina, Sask., 13-2-26.\nOn the 26th January 1926 I was on patrol in company with Mr. J.S. Pugh, Indian Agency, Crooked Lakes Agency, and on talking to Father Carriere, the Principal of the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School at Crooked Lake, learned that a fire had occurred at the school on the morning of the 13th November 1925, under very suspicious circumstances, and that damage to the extent of about $600.00 was done, before it was put under control. It was thought by Father Carriere that Jimmy Kesecapeew, a pupil of the school, had started the fire. This youth who is about 17 years of age, was discharged from the School by Father Carriere, just before Christmas, on account of thieving, breaking out of school, could not be trusted and was setting a very bad example to the other children attending. Mr. Pugh and myself interviewed some of the elder boys at the school, with a view of finding out who started the fire. The only thing we were able to get, was that the boys thought Jimmy had started the fire, and that on several occasions he had broken out of school at night, and stolen certain small articles. We learned that Jimmy was away from the Reserve, visiting his sisters on The Little Bones Reserve at Crescent Lake, South of Yorkton, Sask., so we decided to await his return to the Sakimay Reserve & interview him. On the 14th February we informed Mr. Pugh that this boy had called at his office, and had detained him, so that I could interview him. I drove me to the Agency per private auto, and I obtained the following statement of Jimmy Kesecapeew:\n\n\"I am an ex-pupil of the R.C. School at Crooked Lake, Saskatchewan Indian Reserve, and am seventeen and a half years old. I was discharged from the School about six months ago. I have got up in the middle of the night several occasions, whilst at the school, and was caught by Father Carriere once, coming down the stairs. I stole the leggings belonging to the school, by breaking a lock on the cupboard door. Joe Williams was with me the night when Father Carriere caught us on the stairs.\n\nOn the 24 prior to the summer holidays, I tried to set fire to the school by lighting a roll of toilet paper in the dormitory. The paper burnt out before it had caused fire to the building. One night in November 1925 I went with Samson Pelletier (another pupil) and we went upstairs, when I set fire to the school. We went upstairs, into the dining room, through the kitchen and boiler room. I went up on the roof of the boiler room, which is a lean-to, against the school proper, and got matches. I could not find a place to light them, so got down and went back to the boiler room. Samson was. I got a can of coal oil or gas-oil and sprinkled it on the board partition between the shop and the boiler room. I climbed up on the...\"\nbricks atop of the boiler, and pushed some paper into the corner of the boards, and then set fire to the paper. I waited to see if it had got a good start and after about 15 minutes returned to the dormitory. A little smoke was coming into the dormitory. Jimmy was with me all the time. We were in stocking feet. Gabriel Accosee woke me and then the children were all filled out. We were awake about an hour from the dormitory. The reason I set light to the school was on account of Brother Macdonald struck me on the nose and knocked me over, because I swore at him. This made me sore. Father Carriere also strapped me and it also made me sore. I made up my mind that on account of the whipings, that I would set fire to the School.\"\n\n(Signed) Jimmy Kesecapeew.\n\nOn learning the above, Mr. Pugh, the interpreter, Jimmy & myself proceeded to the R.C. School at Crooked Lake, where I obtained the following statement from Samson Pelletier, who stated as follows:\n\n\"I am a pupil of the Roman Catholic Residential School at Crooked Lake. I am an Indian boy and am 15 years of age. I know Jimmy Kesecapeew, he used to be a pupil at the school. I remember the night of the fire; it was before Christmas. I woke Jimmy up this night on his suggestion, about 2 o'clock. I came downstairs with Jimmy, he was in stocking feet and I was barefooted. We went down to the electric room. I was with him all the time. He had a coil of something in his hand, and then poured some between the rafters & walls and then set light to it with a match. It had started to blaze, and after a few minutes we returned to the dormitory. There was a little smoke in the boys dormitory when we got there. We went to bed. I saw Jimmy wake up the boys. I think he spoke to Gabriel Accosee. I have not spoken to anybody about the fire until today.\"\n\n(Signed) Samson Pelletier.\n\nI then obtained a statement from Father Carriere as follows: - I am the Principal of the Roman Catholic Residential School at Crooked Lake, Sask. About 1.34 p.m. of the 13th November 1916 I was notified by Brother Sanford, that there was a fire at the school. I went to the dormitories, and in the boy's dormitory there was a little smoke. There was no smoke in the girl's dormitory. On my instructions the girls were got out of the building by the fire escape. The boys at this time were out. I then went to the electrical shop where the fire was, where I was saw some of the staff and some of the elder boys, hauling water to put out the fire. All the fire extinguishers were used. Damage was done to partitions, ceilings and some of the machinery etc., to the amount of about $800.00. The insurance was $250.00. The fire was very large but out, and it was a wonder the whole school did not go. I phoned the head office at Winnipeg about the fire. I did not suspect anybody at the time of the fire. Since the fire a guard has been placed around the building at night. The doors as far as I know were all locked on the night of the fire. Jimmy Kesecapeew, an ex-pupil was discharged from the School on account of not being able to trust him. He was a dangerous example to the other pupils. (Signed) J. Carriere, Principal.\"\nI then learned from Father Carrier, a guard who was on night duty, about a week after the fire had heard someone run across the roof of the lean-to, and on looking around outside, saw some person in the distance, but could not get near him. This guard was armed, but he did not shoot at the object. In order to clear up this point to find who would be around at this time of night, I again interviewed Jimmy Kesecapew, and he stated that about a week after the fire he again came down and went outside on the roof of the building, climbed to the roof with some paper saturated with gasoline to start a fire, but did not do so. On account I had no matches. The paper was thrown away. I also learned from Father Carrier that the wood pile which at that time was against the end of the lean-to had been either sprinkled with gasoline or coal oil. I then interviewed Joseph William, another pupil of the school who stated that Jimmy and he had broke out of the school one night, and wandered over the Reserve and returned before the other boys had arose. On another occasion they had gone down to steal leggings from the cupboard. Mr. Pugh informs that Jimmy admits the theft of two sets of harness from Indian farmers, one of which he cut up to make whips with. This boy's mother is a widow, and lives on the Sakimay Reserve, and apparently has no control over him. He wanders from place to place, and gets a meal where he can. Last fall he was brought back by Mr. Pugh & myself from Crescent Lake for running away from the School. It appeared to both myself and Mr. Pugh that this boy is dangerous to be at large, so I detained him and brought him to Broadview, where he is now still in my charge.\n\nAs will be seen by the above this is the third attempt to burn down this School by this boy Jimmy Kesecapew. In the second attempt it was very lucky it was got under control, if it gone very quick, there is no doubt there would have been loss of life. He was also very lucky that the fire did not get into when he was around the building about a week after the fire. All the doors were closed and the only way he could have got out of the building was by the fire escape, and there is no doubt this is the way he returned.\n\nThe other boy Sam Pelletier had nothing whatever to do with the fire, outside of assisting Jimmy. He has a very good reputation in the camp. He thought Jimmy was on one of his escapades, and after he saw what Jimmy had scared he would be implicated, and did not say anything about what he knew. Mr. Pugh gave him a good lecture about this, which I think had a good effect.\n\nI will detain this boy until further notice by telephone, and await instructions.\n\nThe Officer Commanding,\nR.C.Mounted Police,\nSouthern Sask.District.\nREGINA, SASK.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I shall be glad therefore, if the Department will please insert an item of $600.00 in the Estimates to provide for a new building next spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nRagina, Sask., February 18th, 1927\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the two residential schools in the Crooked Lake Agency, which were inspected by Mr. Inspector Hamilton during the latter part of January and the first week in February.\n\nThe report on the Cowessess school is very satisfactory. Everything seems to be in good order. The outbuildings are reported to be poor, with the exception of the barn. This is true. An item of $60.00 is in the Estimates for the purpose of re-flooring the stalls. There is also an item to provide an implement shed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nCOWESSESS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThis school was inspected February 1st, 1927. Rev. Father Carriere was away on our arrival, but returned shortly after the noon hour, when I inspected the class rooms.\n\nThe boys were in one room in charge of Sister St. Pierre. This room was well ventilated and spotlessly clean. The boys were well clothed and clean. The desks, books and other equipment are well kept.\n\nThe girls are in charge of Sister St. Phillippe. This room also was very tidy and clean. The\n\ndesks\ndesks, although about 10 yrs. old, are spotless and scarcely a scratch can be seen on them. The school books are neatly kept and free from any disfiguring marks. The girls were well dressed, tidy and clean. In both these rooms the discipline was excellent. The children read well and were not afraid to speak out. Their spelling and other work examined was good and I believe fair progress is being made. The blinds in the boys' class room are worn out and useless.\n\nThe entire school was exceptionally clean and presented a splendid appearance. The dormitories especially, deserve mention; the girls' beds were beautifully made and the spreads were \"white\", not yellow or grey in appearance as one sees in many schools. The boys' beds were equally as nice, but with colored spreads.\n\nIn all the departments, the work was exceptionally well done and the discipline and order could not be excelled. Every department was in splendid shape and the work well up to the mark, and yet no one appeared rushed or overworked. Undoubtedly, a splendid system is carried out in this school. I would like to mention the work done in the laundry and sewing room. The washings could not be done better, and when ironed they showed that the work had been supervised by one who understood and knew her work. In the sewing room I found suits of clothes made for little boys and it was impossible to tell them from the ready made suits we buy. These, along with numerous dresses made by the girls, were neatly piled in cupboards and covered with white pieces of cotton. I have no doubt the Sister in charge could find any garment in the dark, so carefully were they arranged and stored away.\naway.\n\nThe Rev. Principal claimed the engine used for pumping and running the lighting system was not satisfactory. The water supply tank is small, necessitating continual pumping. The engine is not strong enough to do this and run the lighting system and the other machinery at the school; consequently, either the work is held back, or the water supply runs short, or the batteries become low. In talking with the engineer, he claimed that a 12 H.P. engine would be necessary to carry the load of pumping, running the lighting system and the other machinery of the school. Before making any recommendation in regard to this, I feel that an expert should go over the situation, so that the actual need may be known.\n\nThe outbuildings at the school are very poor, with the exception of the main barn. This is a good building, but the horse stalls need re-flooring. The hen house and piggery now in use are old log buildings, and look about ready to fall down. The machine shed blew down last Fall, and rather than leave the machinery outside, the Rev. Principal erected a temporary covering. However, a machine shed is badly needed and should be large enough to accommodate the threshing machine, as well as the other machinery. In spite of these outbuildings being built of logs and in a very poor condition, they are kept whitewashed and tidy. The yard is clean, and everything showed care and attention.\n\nA dairy herd of about 25 cows is kept at this school, and in addition, some 25 or 30 head of young cattle are being fed. The milk supply at present is low, but cows are expected to freshen at any time.\n\nThe Rev. Father\nThe Rev. Father Carriere is a hard worker, and is very interested in the school and children. I have no hesitation in saying I believe these children receive the very best of care and attention. Recently the children were sick with the 'Flu, but they are again looking quite well and appear happy and contented.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nBroadview Sask.,\n20th April, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that two work horses at the Cowessess Residential School died by accident during the past winter.\n\nThe Principal has made request for a team to replace these, to be made a charge against public funds. I am not aware of this being done in cases of this nature, but would say that another team is badly needed for the commencement of the spring work and I beg to request authority to make the purchase as soon as possible, if in order.\n\nA suitable team will cost about $300.00 in this locality.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 3rd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, relative to the request of the Principal of the Cowessess Indian Residential School to be supplied with a team of horses.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as this would be in the nature of a replacement, the school authorities themselves should provide the funds required to purchase the horses from their per capita grant or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nOttawa, July 5, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am pleased to inform you that there is an appropriation of $600 for the purpose of providing an implement shed at the Cowessess Indian Residential School. Your 304-11 A of November 16th, last, asked that this be noted for estimates. You may proceed with the erection of this outbuilding. The school management should supply as much of the labour as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following short report on the Cowessess Boarding School, inspected July 6th, 1927.\n\nOn the day I visited this school all the children were home on holiday. The Sisters were also away and only the Reverend Father Carrier and his outside helpers were at the school. Although the Sisters were absent, everything was in excellent order and the place very clean and tidy.\n\nThe crop at the school looked very good. One field which was fallowed last year for the purpose of freeing it of twitch grass, had an excellent stand of wheat. Undoubtedly good work had been done on this fallow and although the twitch grass has not been entirely eradicated, its growth has been retarded so as to not interfere with this year's crop.\n\nThe ground about the school was tidy and well kept. The garden was in splendid condition.\n\nIn my last report a request was made for new blinds in one of the class rooms. The blinds are badly needed as the old ones are useless. If these were granted they might be hung during the holiday, so that the class room would be ready when re-opened.\n\nThe Reverend\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Reverend Father complained about the engine, used for pumping and lighting and power purposes, as being far too small. This engine has been in constant use for some years and I believe something will need to be done within the near future. However, I am not prepared to say just what will be needed. I feel this should be carefully gone over by an expert who understands engines thoroughly as well as the requirements of such a plant.\n\nThe horse barn floors need to be renewed as they are entirely worn through in places. The Reverend Father considers a board floor best, yet I would be inclined to recommend the use of cement so that a permanent job might be made.\n\nThe chicken house, pig pen, and granaries are all old log buildings past repair, and new ones are badly needed. This would greatly improve the surroundings.\n\nI am inclined to feel that the Reverend Father Carrier is giving splendid service as Principal, and the boys who leave this school should be among our better farmers; in fact, some of our best young farmers starting this year are graduates of the Cowessess school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a short report of an inspection at the Cowessess Indian Residential School in the Crooked Lake Agency, which was made by Mr. Inspector Hamilton on the 6th instant. You will note that at the time the Inspector made this visit the school was closed for summer holidays and most of the staff were absent.\n\nIt is pleasing to note that the crops are good and the fields are being looked after as well as possible in the matter of keeping them free from weeds, that the premises are well kept and the garden is good.\n\nI do not think the Department should be called upon to buy window blinds for an institution of this kind. I fear that our Principals are under the impression that everything which is required should be supplied by the Department.\n\nWith regard\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWith regard to the engine, I propose visiting the Crooked Lake Agency in the near future and will look into this matter. We may have an engine at some other point that can be transferred here.\n\nI have your authority to build a new implement shed at this school, but no authority to erect a henhouse, pig pen and granaries.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your 304-11 of the 25th ultimo, covering Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the Cowessess Indian Residential School. I am pleased to note that conditions generally reflect credit on the management.\n\nThe school authorities should be responsible for the replacement of window blinds.

I promised Father Carrier's linoleum for the passages of his school. You will remember that neither of us were struck by the cleanliness of this school and there was a shabby look to everything. I hope the management will improve matters with our assistance. Let him have the linoleum, and let him also brighten things up in other directions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the schools in the Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nGOWESSSESS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI inspected this school on January 27th, 1928.\n\nThe different classrooms are under the direction of two sisters, Sister St. Pierre Chrysologue and Sister St. Clement. The latter is a new member of the staff. She is in charge of the girls' classroom, and I believe good progress should be made under her instruction. She has a very pleasing manner and presents the various subjects in an attractive way.\n\nSister St. Pierre Chrysologue is in charge of the boys' classroom and good progress is certainly being made. I took particular notice of six small boys who only entered the school in September and are now able to speak English fairly well and have made splendid progress in writing. The work which these children have accomplished already is certainly a credit to any teacher. The children of both classrooms were exceptionally neat in appearance, and the classrooms were spotless.\n\nThe work which is carried on in the sewing room, laundry and kitchen is all exceptionally well done and apparently with little effort, either on the part of the pupils or the sisters in charge.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe building throughout was clean and tidy; the dormitories were all well aired, and the beds presented a well cared for appearance.\n\nSince my last inspection a new floor of cement has been laid in the horse barn. Excellent work was done in regard to this, and the barn is now in A1 condition, with the exception of it now needing paint badly. A new machine shed was erected last year which has not yet been painted.\n\nA fairly large flock of poultry is kept at this institution, in spite of the fact that the chicken house now in use is an old log building, badly lighted, and in which one is unable to stand erect. A new building is certainly needed for the carrying on of this work. The pig pen is also a log building, very old in structure, and does not add to the appearance of the surrounding lay-out.\n\nWhen I last visited this school, I found one of the best gardens I had seen during the summer. At this inspection, the Rev. Father Carriere, the Principal, informed me that it was rather discouraging to grow a large quantity of vegetables as no provision was made for a proper root cellar in which the vegetables might be kept during the winter months. It seems to me that when such an effort is put forth by those in charge of the school to have a good garden and lots of vegetables for the children, a proper root cellar should be provided so that these vegetables may be stored.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION.\n\nI went carefully into the question of fire protection, and found everything in splendid order with the exception of the fire hose. These are all very old and,\nCOWESSISS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\nFire Protection (Cont'd.)\n\nWhen the water is turned on, considerable pressure is lost as the hose leaks very badly. I think it would be well to replace the hose. To do this, it will require four hose, each 50 ft. long. In addition to this, I would recommend that two extra lengths of 50 ft. be furnished, to be used as extensions. At present there are six large fire extinguishers arranged in various prominent places throughout the building, as well as twenty small Pyrene extinguishers. The fire escapes are all in splendid condition, and at the fire drill carried out, it could readily be seen that the children were well accustomed to the use of the fire escapes.\n\nAt the present time about twelve cows are being milked for the use of the school children, and this number will be increased very shortly as there are a number of cows to freshen within the next month.\n\nThe children are undoubtedly provided with plenty of wholesome food, and at the time of inspection, there was no sickness in the building. Before I left the Agency Dr. Craig vaccinated all the children for Small-pox and inoculated them against Diphtheria. The children all appeared quite happy and looked exceptionally well, and no complaints of any kind were received as regards this school. The management of the school is carried on under the direction of the Rev. Father Carriere, and I believe excellent work is being done.\nRegina, Sask., Feb. 16th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an inspection of the two Boarding schools in the Crooked Lake Agency which was made by Mr. Inspector Hamilton during the latter part of January and the first week in February.\n\nThe first school reported on is the Cowessess Catholic Residential school, which is under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church and the Principalship of the Rev. Father Carriere. With reference to the barn needing paint, I may point out that an amount has been asked for in the Estimates to have this work done and if the amount is authorized the work will be carried on during the coming summer. Regarding the Inspector's remarks concerning a henhouse and pigsty, an amount to provide for these buildings was placed in the Estimates, also for a root house. It seems to me, however, that it would not have taken much of an effort on the part of the Principal and his staff to have a root house erected, as there are a great many Indians living right near the school. A good root house was built at File Hills by the Principal.\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, February 24, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 16th instant, covering Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the schools of the Crooked Lake Agency, I have to inform you that funds will be available for the painting required at the Cowessess Indian Residential School. You might let me have an estimate as to the cost of painting the barn and any other buildings that require this improvement.\n\nI regret that there will be no funds for the erection of a henhouse and a hogpen this year, but a note has been made for the 1929-30 Estimates.\n\nThe Rev. Principal should be responsible for a suitable root-house and you should so inform him. You may provide a small amount of cement and lumber if they are willing to undertake the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

It was pointed out by the Rev. Father that the building as it is was unsuitable for the purpose, because in the first place it was an old log building, attached to the brick building, and another storey could not be added to it to make room, as it would close off the light from the dormitories, and also it would only be a matter of a short time until the existing building would be condemned. I think we decided between us that a new building should be erected. I have gone into this matter now, and I believe that if we could get an appropriation of $3500.00 for this purpose a suitable building 40 x 30, with an upstairs which could be used as a workshop, and the downstairs for the housing of the steam boilers and engine could be built. This building would be situated about thirty feet from the main building, and would be connected by an underground passage to the basement. I really think this should be allowed, and I should be glad if you would have an item inserted in the Estimates to provide for it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to inform you that I am advised by the Principal of the Cowessess Indian Boarding School, that the batteries in his lighting plant are almost completely worn out and beyond repair and he has made a request to be supplied with a new set at the earliest possible date. I can have these batteries replaced with Delco Batteries, which are good ones, at a cost of $240.00 delivered and installed, and I should be glad to have your authority to have this done, as I am told by the Principal that the School is likely to be left in darkness at any time under the existing conditions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 15th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 304-11A R.C. of the 7th instant, relative to the request of the Principal of the Couesness Indian Residential School to be supplied with new batteries for the use of the lighting plant to replace the present ones, which are worn out and beyond repair.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that you may arrange to have the present batteries replaced with Delco batteries, which you state will be delivered and installed at a cost of $240.\n\nAfter the new batteries have been installed to your satisfaction, please forward an account in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI wish to bring the following matter to your attention. When you were here last July you authorized me to have certain painting done at the Cowessess Indian Residential School, and I took steps immediately to have this done, and sent to the School a man by the name of Tappin, a painter, who had done certain work for us in other years, and he brought back an estimate of $1400.00 for doing the work outlined, under contract. This price seemed to me to be unreasonable, and I suggested that he do the work by day labour, which was agreed upon. After the work was completed he brought up a time sheet, duly certified to by Father Carriere as correct, and, on October 2nd., Regina Voucher No. 5451, for $576.00 was issued in favour of Mr. Tappin, and he was paid.\n\nAbout two weeks ago Father Carriere came to my office and informed me that the time sheets which he had signed were incorrect, and that Tappin had overcharged for 215\u00bd hours. Father Carriere pointed out that on some of the days where he had shown full time, viz:- 10\u00bd hrs. he had really only worked three hours, and so on, and Tappin was paid for 1095 hours, whereas he should only have been paid for 579\u00bd hours. Of this 215\u00bd hours, 132\u00bd hours consisted of time which he had put down on his time sheet, which he had actually done no work at all, and for which he was paid by the Department. The remaining 83 hours was time which he had spent in doing special work for Father Carriere, for which the Father paid him, and this time was also included in the time sheet which he submitted here.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n-Father-\nFather Carriere can give no explanation other than that Mr. Tappin made the bills up himself and assured him that they were correct. He did not check them up with the time that he was keeping, as Tappin had given him to understand that he was doing the work under contract.\n\nTappin has deliberately put in false time sheets, and has been overpaid for 215\u00bd hours, at 80\u00a2 an hour, which amounts to $172.60, and I think some action should be taken to have him return the money.\n\nI may say that when Father Carriere came here I sent for Mr. Tappin. He became very indignant and said that the Father did not know what he was talking about, and that he had his signature. It seems to me that even though the Father did make a mistake we should take some steps to have this money refunded, and I should be glad to have your instructions in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, 29th November, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department desires the name of a lawyer at Broadview, Saskatchewan, to take action to recover the sum of $172.60 overpayment made in mistake to a man who was employed to paint at the Cowessess Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Tappin for the collection of the claim set out in my letter of the 20th November last.\n\nIn Mr. Tappin's letter to the Department of Justice, he states that he has done several jobs by contract for this Department, but never taken one by the hour. This, of course, is not correct, as the work for which he overcharged was done by the hour, or what is known as day labour, and the particulars are set out in the voucher paid by the Department. One of the charges against Tappin is that part of the time which he charged against the Department and was paid for was employed in performing some work for the school authorities, for which he was also paid direct by the latter. I am of the opinion that proceedings should be instituted against Tappin for the collection of the claim.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In a conversation with Father Garriere he informs me that he has a receipt, and also the cheque which he issued to Tappin in payment for his services, and that the work done for him was carried on during the period for which he has charged the Department. In addition to this he has charged the Department for time when he was not working at all, so that it seems to me the man should be prosecuted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. L.

School. Grayson being the last town with only one lumber yard where delivery was made arrangements were made by me to have them deliver the material after consultation here.\n\nLetter No. 108-2-5 dated May 7th, 1929.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOctober 24th, 1929.\n\nTo Wm. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nAs promised, I am writing you regarding our deficit on the buildings. I have the following accounts still unpaid:\n\n| Description                  | Amount   |\n|------------------------------|----------|\n| Marshall-Wells Co.           | $569.86  |\n| \"                            | $65.50   |\n| Fairbanks-Morse Co.          | $634.86  |\n| Labor & men September       | $76.98   |\n| Pipes and painting           | $278.75  |\n| \" 2 men October, pipes and painting | $164.40 |\n|                              | $443.15  |\n\n$1154.99\n\nI am enclosing Fairbanks-Morse account for $76.98 and time sheets for labor $443.15, which have not previously been forwarded to you. I shall pay the above accounts from the school funds and beg to request that the amounts thereof be refunded to me, as the work is now fully completed and very satisfactory and I do not think it is right that this amount should be a charge against the school funds.\n\nI am also enclosing order on the Marshall-Wells Co. for pump and pressure tank. These are badly needed and, if possible, I would like to have them very soon.\n\nI would like to draw your attention to the fact that the school is already out of pocket for the following items in connection with the work done:\n\n- 4 teams hauling and digging: 36 days\n- 2 men working: 36 \"\n- 1 man (engineer) working: 4 months\n- Board and lodging: 4 men 2 \"\n- \" 2 men: 4 \"\n\nThis part of the cost of the work was freely given by the school and reduced the cost of the completed work a large amount and I am sure the Department will appreciate this.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. Carriere\nOctober 24th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham;\n\nThe enclosed letter is the best I can do - To explain how we have over spent the amount allowed to us is not easy, because you have all the time sheets, and invoices for all materials, what can I add to this?\n\nThe only explanations that can be given is, as I told you, material was too high price and I told you about the accident building the wall in concrete, so men had to do more than double work - We have tried to save all the money we could, and watching the work very closely -\n\nWe have also over spent money allowed for painting, about $300.00. We did not know we had only $800.00 for painting - I am glad to say that if you would see all what we have done you will not believe that we have spent only the amount you know of; because I had a good contractor to value the whole work and himself had value the same work for over $10,000.00.\n\nI am leaving today, so Mr. Graham do your best in our behalf.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOn the 7th of May last, under Department No. 108-2-5, authority was given to undertake certain work at the Cowessess Indian Residential School, which included providing an engine house and work shop with root storage facilities, painting, and the erection of a hog pen and chicken coop. The expenditure authorized therein was $5,800.00.\n\nThe Reverend Principal, Father Carriere, visited my office and I discussed with him the work to be done and the amounts allowed in each case. I had a long and thorough discussion with him and I felt satisfied when he left that he properly understood the situation. A week or two ago a number of accounts were submitted by him for payment, which clearly indicated that the appropriation allowed was being very greatly exceeded. I wrote him and drew his attention to the matter and told him that work must immediately cease, and requested him to explain why the extra expenditures had been incurred, as he intimated to me that the several appropriations were quite sufficient. I enclose the undermentioned vouchers for payment:\n\n| No.   | Description                  | Amount |\n|-------|-----------------------------|--------|\n| 6394  | Security Lumber Co., Grayson | $707.80|\n| 6395  | G. F. Stephens Co., Regina   | 43.57  |\n| 6396  | Fairbanks-Morse Co., Winnipeg| 76.98  |\n| 6397  | Marshall-Wells Ltd., Winnipeg| 656.25 |\n\nThese vouchers aggregate $1,494.60. In addition, there are some Time Sheets, which the Principal omitted to forward, amounting to $443.15. Prior to the receipt of the above mentioned vouchers, the expenditure had already reached\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n$6,031.33. The total expenditure to date, therefore, is $7,959.08. It will be seen, therefore, that there has been an over-expenditure of $2,127.08.\n\nThe Reverend Principal came to see me, but did not appear to be able to offer a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances, and appeared to be much confused as to the several amounts which had been allowed. I enclose copies of two letters addressed to me by him, dated the 24th October, in which he submits his explanations. The Reverend Principal has not been well for some little time and this may in a measure account for his having lost control.\n\nWhile the expenditure allowed has been greatly exceeded, I am satisfied that the money has been well spent and that there has been no waste. It is clear, however, that, in arriving at his estimates of the cost of the work to be done, the Principal greatly under-estimated what appropriation would be required.\n\nWith his letters of the 24th instant, he enclosed an order addressed to Marshall-Wells Limited, of Winnipeg, requesting them to furnish him with a power pump for the Pneumatic Pressure Tank service, the cost of which I understand will be in the neighbourhood of $110.00. He claims that this is needed at once, but in view of the circumstances I need hardly say that I did not forward this order, as I could not possibly sanction any further expenditure. I do not know whether or not the department wish to authorize it. I should add that notwithstanding the expenditures which have already been incurred, the Principal has not provided for the storage of roots which was to have formed part of the work to be done at the school. I have informed him that the school will certainly have to bear the expense of this if it is provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. W. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, November 15, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11A R.C. of the 29th ultimo, enclosing accounts covering the cost of material supplied for the building of an engine house and workshop, also a hogpen and chicken coop at the Cowessess Indian Residential School. The vouchers which you forwarded will be paid in due course. It is noted that the expenditure incurred by the Principal has exceeded the amount authorized, but that you are satisfied the money has been well expended and that there has been no waste. Time sheets, in duplicate, should be forwarded in due course covering the advances sent for the payment of the labour.\n\nRelative to the supplying of a power pump for the pneumatic pressure tank service, at a cost of approximately $110, the department will approve of the supplying of this equipment and will pay the cost of same upon receipt of the usual voucher, properly certified.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

Unless you can see any reason for desisting, I am prepared to communicate with his solicitors and tell them the facts as known to us, naming the Rev.

J. Carriere O.M.I. for the sum of $59.60 paid for electric fire alarm fixtures installed in the school. No authority was given for this expenditure but as you will note, the account is for fixtures only, all the work of installation being done by the school authorities. There is a complete system of wiring in every part of the school operating from push buttons which ring gongs which are properly distributed through the school. The system is very complete and would be of great assistance in case of fire.\n\nVoucher #4976 in favor of Rev. J. Carriere for the sum of $53.80, paid for oven repairs is also enclosed. The oven purchased from Jean J. Daoust Limited, some years ago was burnt out and it was impossible to bake bread etc until new asbestos lining was put in and repairs made. It was necessary to have the repairs made without delay and Father Carriere paid for the same and is now asking for a refund of the amount paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.B.

The item of $12.50 for brick and posts represents a charge against the latter item. In explanation of the other charges, I may say that the leaking of the roof was pointed out to me by the Agent with the request from the Principal to have it remedied. I pointed out that, if the condition is unsatisfactory, it is due to the mistake in the first instance of the Principal of the School who supervised the erection. However, the Principal has forwarded the accounts and asks that payment may be considered, pointing out that the lean-to has been used for over fifteen years and a charge for renewal would not be unreasonable.

In view of the attitude of Father Carriers, it seems to us very doubtful as to whether it would be advisable to go to trial. However, I should be glad to have your observations with respect to Mr. Graham's letter before finally deciding what course to take.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice,\nOttawa.\nI visited this school on November 6th, and made a general inspection of the buildings and premises.\n\nI found the school in excellent condition, and clean and tidy throughout.\n\nThe Rev. Father Carriere, O.M.I., is in charge as Principal, and is assisted by Rev. Father Devarenne. He has a competent engineer and farmer. The interior of the building is well looked after by a staff of qualified Sisters, two of whom act as teachers. These teachers have had many years experience and hold Model School diplomas. There are 72 pupils in attendance, 44 girls and 38 boys. These children presented a clean and well-nourished appearance. They have had practically no sickness in the school for some time. In addition to their classroom studies, the girls are taught sewing, knitting, and the making of clothing, as well as other domestic work. The girls are taught how to make bread, and I may say that when visiting the homes on the Cowessess Reserve, from which this school largely recruits its pupilage, I found a number of the women, who are ex-pupils of the school, making bread in preference to bannock, which is the customary manner of preparing the flour for food. I think I saw a larger proportion of bread makers amongst the housewives on this reserve than on any I have visited for some time. The boys assist in the garden and on the farm, and in caring for the stock. This school appears to be well managed, and the care given to the children is reflected in their happy appearance. I was present during their meal hours, and noted that they were supplied with ample wholesome, nourishing food. A sufficient number of milk cows are provided to supply ample milk for their requirements during both winter and summer seasons.\n\nI examined the fire equipment, and found it in good condition. In addition to the hose supplied on each floor,\nwhich is connected with the water system, they have fire extinguishers as well located on each floor in an easily accessible position. Fire escape routes are provided with exits from each floor, and regular training in the use of these escapes is given to the pupils. They have become very expert in the use of these escapes.\n\nAn abundant supply of excellent water is obtained from a well in close proximity to the building. Two 1,000 gal. pressure tanks are provided for water storage.\n\nThere have been a number of improvements to the buildings during the past two years. The new building, providing accommodation for the heating and lighting plant, as well as a work shop and shoe shop, is a good building and eminently satisfactory for its purpose.\n\nI might point out that there is only one interior toilet provided for the boys, and that is upstairs in the building. They have three outside closets, which are hard to keep clean and are not sanitary; in fact, I found them in a filthy condition. I would suggest that it would be advisable to provide proper toilets for the boys. There is a suitable room at the end of the boys' playroom which would provide room for the installation of two toilets, as well as a shower bath. In the event of these being installed, a separate drain 150 ft. long to the septic tank would have to be provided, but the laundry water drainage could be attached to the same drain pipe, and this would eliminate the present system of draining the laundry water into a cess pool. It is estimated that this improvement would cost $600.00. The Principal will undertake the work with his own staff. I think that the installation of these toilets is very necessary, and\n\nI would\nI would strongly recommend that it be authorized.\n\nA new hog house was built during the past summer. The plan of this building is one, I believe, which is supplied by the Government of British Columbia. I am of the opinion that this building will not prove satisfactory for our climate here. This building is 16 ft. wide and 72 ft. long; the front stud is 10 ft. and the rear 6 ft., with sloping roof. The walls are not lined on the inside of the studding; therefore, there is no air space. Two wall ventilators are supplied with openings near the floor of the building. I am satisfied that these ventilators will not give the necessary ventilation, and during the severe weather the result of lack of ventilation will mean that the walls will be covered with frost, and the building will be damp. As you know, hogs cannot be satisfactorily kept in a damp building. They are very susceptible to rheumatism, and it is necessary to have a dry, well ventilated building in order to raise hogs successfully. I am of the opinion that it will be necessary to line the walls of this building in order to provide an air space and ceil the roof so that there will be an air space there as well, and provide ventilators close to the ceiling of the building, in order to make this building satisfactory.\n\nTheir stock consist of 12 horses, 50 cattle, of which 17 are milk cows, 9 pigs and about 150 poultry. An ample supply of feed has been secured for the stock this year. This feed is not all grown on the farm and a considerable amount of hay is purchased to meet their requirements. Their garden provided an ample supply of potatoes and vegetables for their requirements.\nrequirements.\n\nI consider that conditions at this school are quite satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

The children are reported to be in good shape, and I would gather from the Inspector's remarks that they are getting a good training.\n\nIf the Department is disposed to build outside toilets at this school, I should be glad to have the proper authority. The cost would be about $150.00. In connection with the pigsty, the suggestion is that it be lined with shiplap, and ceiled with the same material and that two roof ventilators be put in. It is just a matter of the thing not having been completed properly.\nSir,\n\nA.2627\n\nRe: Claim against J.

I have a copy of this on file, but was under the impression that a time sheet, showing the hours put in by each man on the job, had been forwarded. I am now writing to Father Carriers for this.\n\nI beg to return the copy of the voucher herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nand it was the duty of Father Carriere to keep tab on these matters and that he had always done it in the past and was doing it in this connection in an official capacity for the purpose of the Department.\n\nFollowing my interview with Father Carriere and Commissioner Graham, I have endeavoured to get in touch with some of the workmen to ascertain what further information could be had there and especially to see on what basis they were paid by Tapping. The only one I was able to get in touch with is one Albert Welsh but I find that he was paid on the basis of $20.00 a week and not on hour basis and quite likely this applies to the other workmen.\n\nIn the account rendered by Tappin there are many days when he has charged for eleven hours per man, and the workman Mr. Welsh, whom I interviewed, states that at no time during the two weeks he was there, did any man put in eleven hours, but the most, at any time, was 10 hours a day.\n\nI am satisfied that we can establish that Tappin has been overpaid but there is some doubt whether the money could be recovered once a judgment was obtained. Tappin is financially considered to be of no value and I think this is strictly correct. Commissioner Graham and Father Carriere are not overanxious to press the matter in view of the difficulty of recovering, and I think I should present it to you and leave it to your department to advise as to whether you propose to have the matter proceeded with.\n\nI am satisfied that the evidence is available to show that Tappin has been overpaid and if the action is to be continued, I think your suggestion is the correct one, namely to first examine Tappin for discovery and pin him down to his figures.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWRK/EB\n\nIndian Affairs.

Tappin, Regina\nYour A. 2627\n\nIn further reply to your letter of the 10th of December last, I wish to advise that I have delayed further in this matter in an effort to obtain an interview with Father Carriere, the man who claims to have the evidence in connection with the overcharge in this respect.\n\nYesterday I had the opportunity of interviewing Father Carriere together with Commissioner Graham.\n\nYou will recall in this connection that Tappin put in an account claiming for 1,095 hours of painting at 80\u00a2 per hour, whereas according to information received by the Department here, the actual time put in was 879 1/4 hours, making an overcharge for 215 3/4 hours. It is claimed that 132 3/4 hours is represented by actual overtime charge, or in other words time charged and paid for, which was never put on the job and an additional 83 hours representing time expended in doing work for Father Carriere which he paid for and which is included in the same period of time for which the Department has paid as well.\n\nFather Carriere, who was at the school during all the time the painting was being done, kept an entry of the hours worked each day put in by each man on the job, excepting one man who was Father Carriere's brother and is now deceased.\n\nFather Carriere has the book, with the entries made each day as the work was done and I have examined him carefully in every particular as to the making of these entries and I can find no reason to believe that they are otherwise than absolutely correct and made at the time by himself.\n\nCommissioner Graham states that it has been the practice\nSir,\n\nA.2627\n\nRe: Claim against J. Tappin, Regina.\n\nYour reference No. 108-2-5.A.\n\nI have the honour to advise that under date December 10th papers and instructions were forwarded to Mr. W.R. Kinsman, Barrister, Regina to look into the situation and advise the course to be followed as this department had been approached by the Ottawa representatives of the defendant's solicitors with a view to ascertaining whether or not action was to be prosecuted further. The attached letter has just been received from Mr. Kinsman and speaks for itself. I shall be glad if you will return this to us for our records with your instructions in the premises. It may be that you will decide to leave the matter in abeyance for a twelvemonth on the chance of Tappin's circumstances improving to the point where claim and costs might be recoverable.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Encl.\"\n\nAsst. D. M. of J.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-5, part 2)\nOttawa, 18th February, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI beg to enclose a copy of a letter which has just been received from the Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice. You will note his suggestion that in view of J. Tappin's circumstances the matter might be left in abeyance for a twelvemonth. The question in our mind is whether to go on with this now or to abandon it altogether. Mr. Tappin apparently has nothing we could get at the present time and I should like to have your views as to whether he is a man who might reasonably be expected to have any property the Department could reach for in the event of a judgment in our favour.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nWm. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI may inform you that I have received a visit from the Rev. Father Carriere, Principal of the Cowessess Indian Residential School, in the Crooked Lake Agency, who informs me that he had to line the new hog pen, which was erected for him last year, with lumber, and had to provide adequate ventilation to make it fit for the housing of hogs during the winter months.\n\nThe manner in which this building is constructed was commented on by Inspector Murison in his report dated November 23rd, 1930, on Page 6. I also commented on this in my letter forwarding his report, dated the 25th of the same month. It is very evident that this building was not completed, and the Reverend Principal has had the work done, without cost for labour, by the members of his staff, and is asking that the Department pay for the material used, which amounted to $181.35. As the work was apparently very necessary, I would recommend that, if possible, the Reverend Principal be reimbursed for his expenditure for material.\n\nThere is also the question of providing interior water closets for the boys. This also was commented on by the Inspector who found the outside closets in a deplorable condition, and it appears that this is not an uncommon condition to be found at schools where outside closets are being used. Since forwarding the report, it has been ascertained that there is a 4\" drain pipe leading from the room in which the toilets are being installed to the septic tank. This was formerly used to carry off the laundry water. The Principal, acting on his own authority, has procured the necessary piping and fixtures, and the work is now well under way. The engineer at the school, who is a competent mechanic,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nis installing the toilets and shower baths, and there will be no charge for labour. I have not received the bills for the closets and material, but am of the opinion that they will not cost more than about $200.00, if that much. The payment of this is also a matter which I would place before you for consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11A R.C. of the 2nd instant, relative to reimbursing the Principal of the Cowessess Indian Residential School for the expenditure incurred by him in the construction of a hogpen, and also in providing interior water closets and shower baths for the boys. In reply I regret that we have no funds to pay the cost of the above mentioned improvements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK. March 31st, 1931.\n\nInspector Harrison's Report on Schools, Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the two residential schools in the Crooked Lake Agency, which I visited during the month of March.\n\nGOWESSISS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.)\n\nI visited this school on March 23rd, and found 78 pupils in residence out of an enrolment of 82. The pupils looked healthy, clean and well-nourished. There is no doubt but that they receive plenty of wholesome food, which includes meat and milk. The school building was found clean and tidy throughout, and the outside premises neat and tidy.\n\nThe fire fighting equipment and escapes are in good condition. The equipment throughout is kept in good working order by the engineer who is a competent mechanic.\n\nSince my last visit in November, the Principal, Rev. Father Carriere, has had the interior of the piggery lined with lumber, and two ventilators installed, at a cost for material of $151.35. It was very necessary that this work should be done, as explained in my last report, otherwise the building could not be used for housing hogs during cold weather.\n\nWith reference to the question of providing sanitary flushing closets for the boys within the building, as noted in my last report, it was subsequently found.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nGOWESSISS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.) (GONT'D.)\n\nfound that there was a 4\" unused drain pipe leading from the laundry to the septic tank, which can be utilised to carry off the waste from the proposed lavatory, thus eliminating a large percentage of the cost. The Principal, acting under his own authority, has purchased the necessary piping and fixtures for the installation of two toilets and three shower baths. This material is on the ground, and the work of installing the fixtures is well under way. This work is being done by the engineer, who is a competent mechanic, assisted by the members of the staff. The fixtures are being installed in a room 11' x 12' in size, which adjoins the boys' playroom in the basement of the building. The installation of these toilets will meet a long felt want and will make unnecessary the outside toilets which have always been an eye sore, and hard to keep in proper sanitary condition.\n\nThe management of this school has been found uniformly satisfactory for some years. Care appears to be taken to provide a competent staff who understand their duties.\n\nThe boys assist with the work in the garden, on the farm, and with the care of stock, and when any repairs or carpenter work is required, the older boys are on hand to assist. They are enabled to obtain a general knowledge of farm work.\n\nThe girls receive instruction in sewing, mending, knitting, laundry work, housekeeping, milking cows, baking, and cooking, and I find, when visiting the homes of...\nGOWESSSS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.) (CONT'D.)\n\nhomes of ex-pupils, that the girls are carrying the knowledge obtained, when attending school, into their home life. I do not know of any Agency where the baking of bread has replaced the use of the bannock to a greater extent than here, and no doubt this has been brought about through the training received at school.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an inspection made at the two boarding schools in the Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nThe report on the whole shows that matters in connection with these two institutions are most satisfactory.\n\nWith regard to the closets that are being installed at the Cowessess School, you will note that the Principal has undertaken this expenditure without consulting the Department, and he will probably at a later date ask the Department to meet the expenditure. If he does, I must say I cannot approve of this way of doing business. As regards the hog pen, a mistake was made in the first place by the Principal in using the B.C. plan. This was not known to me until the building was completed, and it has been necessary, as you will see, to line this building throughout and install ventilators to make it suitable for this country. I wrote a special letter to the Department on the 2nd. instant dealing with these two matters.\n\nRegarding the Round Lake School, it is pleasing to note that there has been a decided change at this institution. The children are apparently getting a first-class training in the care of stock and general work. I am glad to note this because there was a time when things were not in good shape at this school.\n\nAs regards\u2014\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAs regards the fire escapes, if the Department consider it necessary to move the east escapes the cost would be about $175.00; the question is, is it necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir,\n\nA.2627\nRe: Claim against J.

It is necessary to have one case of one quart tins of this liquid. I beg to request that, either the liquid be purchased by the Department, or authority be given me for the expenditure as this is very necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostender,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, relative to renewing the liquid in the fire extinguishers at the Cowessess Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase of the quantity of chemical required to refill the fire extinguishers on hand at this school. When these refills have been delivered at the school, you should inform the Principal that he should see that they are installed and the extinguishers placed in good condition and are ready for use. You should give the purchase of the refills required your prompt attention.\n\nAfter the purchase of the refills has been made, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of advice from the Indian Agent at Broadview to the effect that sixteen batteries of the lighting plant at the Cowessess Residential School require replacing before winter sets in. The batteries are described as 32 volt, 160 ampere. The Reverend Principal states that he has had Exide, Globelite and Delco batteries and he finds the Delco are the best. I shall be glad to receive authority to renew the batteries at this school.\n\nThe Agent also furnishes a long list of water pipes and connections which are required to put the plumbing at this building in serviceable condition. Following some trouble lately with the water supply in the pipes, it was found upon removing some of them in various parts of the building where there was no pressure that the inside of the pipes removed was completely filled with an accumulation of the mineral matter in the water. This accumulation is so hard that it is impossible to clean the pipes, and it would appear that the only course is to install new pipes in that part of the plumbing through which the water will not flow. I shall be glad to receive an early reply from the Department authorizing both of the above expenditures, as the batteries and pipes should both be installed without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, September 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11A R.C. of the 22nd instant, requesting authority to renew the batteries of the lighting plant at the Cowessess Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase of the new batteries required, obtaining same at the lowest possible cost. It is noted that the present batteries were supplied during the fiscal year 1928-29. Do you consider that proper care was taken of these batteries, or that they were overloaded, either by the current used for lighting purposes or through the use of attachments other than for lighting purposes?\n\nRegarding the water pipes and connections required to place the pump in serviceable condition, you have not stated the cost of supplying same. The Department will approve of your incurring an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $100 in the purchase of the new pipes and connections. You should make the purchase from indicated sources, and when the batteries and pipes have been supplied, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

There is no outlet from this well and unless baled out backs up on the laundry floor. This could be remedied by a drain from the well to the river.\n\nThe girls are taught to milk and during the spring and summer do considerable work in the garden.\n\nThe boiler room is well arranged and all machinery is in splendid condition. The mechanic is a first class man and thoroughly understands his work.\n\nThe barns and outbuildings are in good repair and the yards tidy. At present the milk supply is low, but a number of cows will freshen within the next few weeks. The stock is all well cared for and in fair flesh.\n\nPoultry is kept and a fair success made. The eggs are used for the children and staff.\n\nThe dispensary is one of the neatest and best arranged I have inspected.

Carri\u00e8re O.M.I.\nSir:-\n\nReverend Father Carriere, Principal of the Cowessess Residential School, came in to see me recently and informed me that the laundry floor in the school became in such poor condition, owing to the presence of a cess-pool underneath it that he had to take immediate steps to have it repaired.\n\nIt appears that there was a well or cess-pool under the laundry which was pumped out daily. The Public Health Officer condemned this cess-pool and ordered it to be filled up, as it was liable to contaminate the water supply. I understand that owing to its presence the sewage backed up, smelt bad, and was a menace to the health of the children. The Reverend Father has had the floor repaired, the well filled up, and has installed a drainage system at a cost of $51.00, and has asked me if I will present the matter to the Department with a view to receiving a refund of the amount he has expended. It appears to me that this is a request deserving of favorable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 9, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11A R.C. of the 5th instant, regarding reimbursing the Principal of the Cowessess Indian Residential School for the cost incurred by him in repairing the laundry floor in the school, to the amount of $61.

Fr. Chatelaine, acting principal, whether the inspection and steam boiler license was up to date. He was not familiar with the circumstances and the engineer Pierre Kernton who has been at the school for many years has resigned.\n\nAs a consequence of my enquiry I was permitted by Fr. Chatelaine to go through the school files to see what the present standing of the boiler license and inspection would be as far as possible. I found very little information but found Department letter 108-2-5 dated July 21st, 1931 to which was attached the enclosed account. Apparently Fr. Carriere failed to certify and return this account to the Department as instructed and nothing further was done.\n\nAs the steam boiler in question is in very bad condition and possibly should be condemned entirely I am asking the steam boiler inspector to visit the school and examine the boiler but in doing so there is a possibility that the question of inspecting and licensing this boiler may be raised and as far as I am able to determine at the present time the school have been very negligent in this connection. There may be some information in the hands of the Department of which I am not aware as Fr. Carriere's filing system was not good. I am informed by one of the members of the school staff that the boiler inspector was at the school last year but did not examine the boiler, while Fr. Carrier in conversation at one time informed me that the boiler had been examined and could not be repaired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 14, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, regarding the condition of the boiler at the Cowessess Indian Residential School and enclosing an account in payment of an inspection made July 15, 1931, by the Provincial Boiler Inspector.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department paid an account of $30.00 for the inspection of the H. R. T. Boiler and $5.00 for the locomotive stationery boiler, following a visit of the Provincial Boiler Inspector on June 17, 1931, and an account of $8.00 was again paid for the inspection of these boilers on June 15, 1932. On the certificate of inspection, it was stated that these boilers were found to be in fair condition.\n\nNo report has been received of any inspection made during the present summer. By official letter of July 31, 1931, you were authorized to incur an expenditure of $100 in carrying out urgent repairs, and an account covering this work was forwarded and paid the Melville Machine Works and Garage, Melville, Sask.\n\nIt is noted that you have arranged to have the Steam Boiler Inspector visit the school and examine the boiler. After this has been done, you should forward to the Department the Inspector's report on the condition of the boilers. If any repairs are necessary, you should give an estimate of the cost. I may add that our funds are extremely limited, and no amount has been specially provided for either repairing the present boilers or supplying new equipment. It is hoped, therefore, that it will not be necessary to incur any large expense in placing the boilers in a satisfactory condition for the coming winter's use.\n\nAfter the inspection has been made, please submit a complete report and an estimate of the cost of any repairs required. Consideration will then be given as to what funds can be provided, should any urgent repairs be necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter 102-2-5 of the 14th instant I have to report that the Saskatchewan Government Boiler Inspector inspected the boiler at the Cowessess School yesterday and has reported that the small locomotive stationary boiler referred to in my letter of the 9th instant is \"No Good, very thin, and not worth spending any money on\", it will therefore be necessary to discard it.\n\nAt the present time heating to the main building is supplied by the low pressure boiler referred to in your letter as H.R.T. Boiler and power is supplied by a Lister 12 H.P. Gasoline Engine. The Locomotive Boiler, now to be discarded, served as an auxiliary heating and power plant to replace either the low pressure steam boiler or the Lister Engine, in emergency.\n\nThe Indians of the Sakimay Band have a small portable boiler, similar to the one to be discarded at the school, which they are willing to sell for $200.00, the boiler in question having been paid for by the farming Indians of the Band through their threshing account, but the farming Indians insist that the money derived from the sale of their boiler be paid into their threshing account in the Agency Office. I have had the Boiler Inspector examine this boiler and he reports that it \"is O.K. for 100 lbs of steam\" making it suitable for the school purposes.\n\nIt remains for the Department to decide whether the school must continue with the low pressure steam boiler and Lister Engine, trusting that no emergency will arise within the next year. The emergency heating and power plant is very useful and beneficial and might save the Department great expense if either of the other units failed at a critical moment such as fire or extremely cold weather.\n\nThe total cost of purchasing and installing the Sakimay Thresher Boiler would be approximately $275.00 and if funds can be procured for this purpose I recommend that it be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, August 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the report of the Provincial Boiler Inspector regarding the condition of the small locomotive stationary boiler at the Cowessess Indian Residential School. It is noted that this boiler is practically beyond repair and that it will be necessary to discard it. I have further noted that a small portable boiler, similar to the one referred to, which would be suitable for the purposes of the school, can be obtained from the Indians of the Sakimay Band for the sum of $200 and that it would cost approximately $75 to install same.\n\nOwing to our funds being extremely limited, I regret that the Department will be unable to arrange for the purchase and installation of this boiler. It is considered that the school can carry on with the low pressure steam boiler and Lister engine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have to report that whilst at the Cowessess Indian Residential School on Friday the 13th inst., a fire broke out about noon in the floor of a small granary adjoining the large implement shed. Before the same was discovered the fire had jumped from the granary to the implement shed and both were burning freely before we commenced using the fire extinguishers on the fire.\n\nThe flame was mounting fully ten feet high but with the use of five 2\u00bd gallon Nomite Extinguishers the fire was soon under control and within half an hour was completely extinguished. One end of the Implement Shed was badly burned and the floor of the small granary was considerably damaged.\n\nThe Department will not be asked to pay for any repairs in this connection. There is no doubt that only the prompt use of very efficient extinguishers saved a great loss of property.\n\nOn investigating the cause of the fire there seems to be no doubt that it originated from the burning of grass in the Indian Cemetery which forms part of the school grounds. This grass was burned early in the morning before my arrival at the school and there was no sign of fire when we went to the basement for lunch at 12 O'clock but I am sure that some sparks from the burning grass had blown under the granary (which was on 8\" skids) where it had smouldered in some long grass and eventually been fanned into a flame by the high wind which was then blowing. The Lay Brother who was in charge of the work stated that there was no fire in sight when he went to lunch, nevertheless I feel there is no doubt that some sparks blew under the granary unknown to him.\n\nHaving seen the good work which these extinguishers perform I would suggest that at least one should be placed in each dwelling.\ndwelling\nof this Agency as I am sure that the Agent's residence which\nburned here a year ago could have been saved by proper use of\n2 Fosmite Extinguishers.\n\nI have instructed the Revd. Principal to have his empty\nextinguishers immediately refilled as we emptied practically all\nthe good ones in the school and there was no time to wait for\nDepartmental Authority to have them refilled.\n\nI trust my action will be approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 25, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, reporting a fire which occurred in the granary adjoining the large implement shed at the Cowessess Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted that the fire was brought under control. The loss incurred to the shed and granary is regretted. It is noted, further, that the Department will not be called upon to pay for making the repairs.\n\nYour action in instructing the Principal to have the empty fire extinguishers immediately refilled is approved. The Principal should see that these extinguishers are placed in a satisfactory condition, ready for immediate use, if required. Please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the refills.\n\nI have noted your suggestion, that an extinguisher be placed in each dwelling in your agency. No doubt, this would be of great value in case of fire. However, owing to the cost involved in the supplying and upkeep of the extinguishers, the Department will be unable to consider providing this equipment. If you consider that there is need for a few more extinguishers for use in connection with the Cowessess Indian Residential School, the Department might be prepared to supply same. However, when the extinguishers on hand are refilled and placed in good condition, there should be an ample supply to meet requirements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Principal to locate the trouble and as he guaranteed satisfaction at a cost of only $15.00 to make and install a hood on the chimney the Revd. Principal ordered the same with the intention of paying it out of school funds if the Department was not in a position to make settlement out of their appropriation.\n\nI recommend that this account be paid if there are funds available.

He informs me that at the present time it takes three days to get the children's clothes dried after wash day and it is almost impossible to continue in this way.\n\nThe Reverend Principal has asked me to again refer the matter to the Department in an endeavour to have the Sakimay Steam Boiler purchased for them.\n\nI might say in this connection that in view of the fact that threshing is now completed on the Sakimay Reserve, and there will be no needed expenditure from Sakimay Threshing Account until next summer, if the Department can find it convenient to appropriate sufficient funds for the purpose after the 1st of April 1934 I see no reason why the boiler could not be installed in the school at once and the money paid into Sakimay Threshing Account after it is appropriated, as there is no need for it to be paid to the Sakimay Threshing account immediately,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If so, we would not be prepared to approve of this purchase for school use, as the Department would be unable to arrange for supplying a new boiler for band purposes next year, to replace the present one, if purchased for school use.\n\nIt is noted, from your letter of August 18th, last, that the Band requests $200 for the boiler and that the cost of installation would be approximately $75. While the urgent need for this equipment at the school is noted, I regret that it may not be possible to provide the funds required from our Appropriation for the current fiscal year to purchase and install the boiler, in the event that it would not be required for future use by the Sakimay Band for threshing purposes. If the boiler was purchased from the Band for use of the Cowessess School, please state if it would be necessary to supply the Band with a new one next year.

The Department, therefore, approves of this boiler being obtained from the Band at the price of $200.00; this amount to be placed to the credit of the funds of the Band. It may be possible to provide the cost of this boiler from our Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year but, if not, payment will be made to the Band Funds out of the 1934-35 Appropriation.\n\nIt is considered that, if this boiler is supplied the Cowessess School, the school authorities should be responsible for the cost of installing same which, it is noted, will amount to $75.00, and you should advise the Reverend Principal accordingly. The school authorities may arrange to have the boiler taken to the school and installed as soon as possible. It is hoped that this boiler will adequately serve the purposes for which it is required by the school.\n\nI would request that you prepare and forward a voucher, in triplicate, in favour of the Sakimay Band Trust Fund Account, covering the cost of the boiler and an encumbrance requisition will be obtained here authorizing the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This fund is accumulating with a view to providing any necessary repairs to their threshing outfit as occasion arises and it was in this manner that the boiler now in question was originally purchased.\n\nBefore taking further action and advising the Revd.

It was manufactured by the Brandon Machine Works who are now not in business. I have today had an interview with Mr. George Drayser, Steam boiler Inspector for the Department of Labour, Hallways, etc., Saskatchewan. He informs me that he has examined this boiler thoroughly and it is his opinion that it would be a waste of money to attempt to repair it. It requires eighty 3\" flues, 12 feet long, and in the Inspector's opinion the shell of the boiler is so badly eaten that it would be a waste of money to refuel it. At the present time they are using a high pressure threshing engine boiler, but this boiler has not sufficient capacity to heat the building during cold weather. The engineer has to be constantly on hand in the boiler room while it is being operated.\n\nThe Principal is very anxious to get his heating unit in proper shape at the earliest possible date, as the cold weather may start in at any time now. I have consulted Messrs. Potts and Miller, Plumbers of this City, with regard to the price of a suitable heating boiler and they quote a price of $1,620.00 F.O.B. Broadview for an Inglis boiler made in Toronto, 7700 feet radiator capacity. Added to this would be the cost of transporting the boiler about twenty miles from Broadview - to the school and -\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nto the school and installing it. Messrs. Potts and Miller state that the outside cost they estimate would be about $2,500.00, but it might be done for less.\n\nI have also received a proposition from the Regina Brewing Company who have a Leonard Two Pass Steel boiler which has only been operated for about three months. This boiler has a radiator capacity of about 15,000 feet. I am told that the original cost of the boiler was about $4,500.00. They offer it to us for $1,000.00 on car at Regina. Mr. Draayer, the Boiler Inspector, tells me that the boiler is as good as new and would heat a much larger building than the school in question. Added to their offer would be transportation from Regina to the school and the installation as well, which would be about the same as the cost of installing the low pressure boiler.\n\nI shall be glad to have the Department give this matter consideration and advise me of the action it is proposed will be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\nDear Father Chatelaine,\n\nWas very surprised to receive your letter after having taken the matter up several times at the Office of the Indian Agent.\n\nI was in to see Mr. Morrison yesterday and immediate action was promised. I have recommended a new boiler as the old one is not worth repairing and action will be forthcoming in a day or two.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory and wishing you a merry Xmas and a happy New Year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. Draijer,\nInspector of Steam Boilers,\nRegina\n\nIndian Affairs.

This boiler has a radiator capacity of about 15,000 feet. I am told that the original cost of the boiler was about $4,500.00. They offer it to us for $1,000.00 on car at Regina. Mr. Draayer, the Boiler Inspector, tells me that the boiler is as good as new and would heat a much larger building than the school in question. Added to their offer would be transportation from Regina to the school and the installation as well, which would be about the same as the cost of installing the low pressure boiler.\n\nI shall be glad to have the Department give this matter consideration and advise me of the action it is proposed will be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\nSir:-\n\nThe Principal of the Cowessess Indian Residential School, Crooked Lakes Agency, asks to be supplied with 20 gallons of floor paint to use in the dormitory halls and dining rooms in his school. I may state that the floors in this school are badly in need of repainting.

Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 19, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11A R.C. of the 13th instant, regarding the condition of the low pressure boiler used for heating purposes at the Cowessess Indian Residential School.\n\nRegarding the request of the Principal, that a new boiler be supplied and installed, it is noted from the prices which you obtained that it would require an expenditure of approximately $2,500. In this connection I have to say that the Department has no funds available in the Appropriation for the present fiscal year to provide the expenditure required. This school is church-owned, and the school authorities, themselves, should favourably consider the supplying of the above mentioned equipment.\n\nI have also your letter of the 13th instant, regarding the request of the Principal for a quantity of floor paint for use in the dormitory halls and dining rooms. The Department will approve of the expenditure required in the supplying of 20 gallons of floor paint. You should arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the approved list, and have same forwarded to the school. It is understood that the school authorities will perform the labour, without expense to the Department. Please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the paint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW.

In this connection I have to say that Rev. Father Plourde, who visited the Department recently, misunderstood the requirements at this school. As stated by you, a boiler was purchased from the Sakimay Indians, to be used for heating the water for school purposes. The Rev. Father confused this boiler with the request which has recently been submitted by Mr. Inspector Murison, for the installation of a low pressure boiler, to replace the present worn out boiler for heating purposes. Mr. Murison has been informed that the Department has no funds in its appropriation for the current fiscal year to provide the cost of supplying and installing a boiler of the type required for heating purposes.\n\nThe Principal has requested that the following equipment be supplied, viz.:\n\n- 25 sacks cement,\n- 3600 shingles for pump-house.\n- 500 bricks for chimney,\n- water tank for gas engine.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your recommendation, with an estimate of the cost, when consideration will be given as to whether purchase can be authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

R. School for 25 sacks of cement, 3500 shingles and 500 bricks and water tank for the gasoline engine I have to say that the water tank is the only item urgently needed. It is used for the cooling of the engine when the same has to be run over a long period.\n\nThe tank which was in use was badly rusted and corroded and leaked in many places. Fr. Chatelain found it necessary to have a new one immediately installed. He has not yet submitted the account to me but it was my intention on receipt of the same to forward it to the Department with my recommendation that it be paid. The cost will be about $10.00.\n\nFollowing instructions from the Department to make requests for expenditure only where urgently needed I had not asked for the cement, shingles or bricks as they are all for repairs which I consider can well wait until next spring.\n\nWhen I find expenditure really necessary I then communicate with the Department and I like to feel that when I make a request the Department will understand that the need is urgent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI beg to report that I visited the Cowessess Indian Residential School at Crooked Lakes yesterday afternoon for the purpose of inspecting their heating system which is not working satisfactorily and is not heating the building during the cold weather.\n\nI found that during the recent cold snap the pipes had burst in their store rooms, as well as their hot water heating tank, and it is imperative that repairs be made at once in order that the school building may be properly heated.\n\nAs previously reported, the low pressure boiler which has been in operation for over thirty years was condemned by the boiler inspector and is not in use. They have been endeavoring to heat the building with a high pressure steam threshing boiler, which is installed for the purpose of generating power to run their laundry equipment, etc. The boiler at times has a pressure of 80 pounds of steam and in order to utilize it for heating purposes, it has been found necessary to get a reducing valve between the boiler and the radiation system to allow not more than a maximum of 15 pounds of steam to enter the radiation system. It has been found impossible to operate this boiler with sufficient steam to heat the building, in as much as the condensed steam returning to the boiler from the radiation system is at a much lower pressure than the pressure in the boiler. It is therefore necessary to at once install either a steam pump to force the return into the boiler, or have the return discharged into an open tank and injected from there into the boiler, in order to keep the system operating.\n\nH. W. McGill, Esq., M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nI have today taken the matter up with heating engineers here and they are of the opinion that by installing a trap to prevent the live steam from returning to the open tank and allowing the condensed steam only to return and by providing an additional injector to keep up the water supply in the boiler, the system can be made to function although it will require more or less constant attention.\n\nThe Reverend Principal has obtained a reducing valve at a cost of $25.00. The cost of the trap, injector, necessary pipe, and valves to complete the system including a new hot water tank is estimated at the outside to cost not more than $150.00. If a steam pump had to be installed, it would cost twice that amount to put the system in proper shape to heat the building. This is a Government owned school. As it is imperative that the repairs be made at once in order to render the school habitable, I have asked the Reverend Principal if he will take care of the expense should there be no funds available. The Engineer from the school is coming in this afternoon and we will decide exactly what will be necessary in order to put the boiler in working order. I would be glad to have your authority to issue vouchers covering this expenditure. It is an emergency which was not anticipated until the real cold weather arrived and it was found that the high pressure boiler without the aforementioned attachment could not be utilized to heat the building properly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\nOttawa, January 5, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11A R.C., of the 29th ultimo, regarding the heating system at the Cowessess Indian Residential School. It is noted that this system is not working satisfactorily and is not heating the building during the cold weather. I note, further, that you have taken this matter up with heating engineers and that the present system can be made satisfactory for the present winter by installing a trap to prevent the live steam from returning to the open tank and allowing the condensed steam, only, to return, and also providing an additional injector to keep up the water supply in the boiler. I note, also, that a new hot water tank is required and that the estimated cost of the trap, injector, necessary pipe and valve to complete the system, including a new hot water tank, will not exceed the sum of $160.\n\nAs this is an emergency which could not be anticipated until the cold weather set in, the Department will approve of you issuing a voucher, properly certified, covering the expenditure in the supplying and installing of the above mentioned equipment.\n\nIn official letter to you dated November 19th, last, the Department was in error in stating that this institution is church-owned. It is a government owned school. It is hoped that, when the equipment referred to above is installed, the heating system will be satisfactory during the present winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F.

Consequently, the amount now allowed the night watchman at the Cowessess Indian Residential School will be discontinued from April 30th, 1935.\n\nPayment of the allowance for the night watchman will be resumed from October 1st, 1935, and continued until April 30th, 1936, a period of seven months, during which time $40.00 a month will be allowed. If the Principal so wishes, you may forward a voucher at the end of each month during the period for which the allowance is made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B.

The shell of the boiler is so badly eaten that even if it were repaired it could not be expected to last for any length of time and the expenditure of repairing it would not be justified. As reported to you in my letter referred to, I obtained a quotation from Messrs. Potts and Miller Limited of this city of $1,620.00 F.O.B. Broadview for an Inglis boiler, 7700 feet radiator capacity. The boiler would have to be hauled a distance of about twenty miles from Broadview to the school and there would be the labour in connection with its installation. The outside estimate of the cost would be about $2,500.00, but it might be done for less. During the past winter the building was heated with a high pressure threshing boiler, but this system did not prove at all satisfactory and the school was not properly heated. It would appear advisable and very necessary that a proper heating unit should be installed at this school. I would be glad if the Department could give the matter their favorable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 30, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11A R.C. of the 15th instant, relative to the question of replacing the boiler for heating the main building of the Cowessess Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that this matter is being placed before the Honourable the Superintendent General, with the recommendation that the necessary funds for the purpose be granted and, also, as to whether it will be satisfactory to obtain the boiler from Messrs. Potts & Miller, Limited, Regina. As soon as his direction in the matter is received, you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW.

This boiler was installed 30 years ago. Mr. Inspector Murison, Regina, had a Steam Boiler Inspector for the Department of Labour, Railways, etc., Saskatchewan, examine the boiler, and it is the opinion of the Inspector that it would be a waste of money to attempt to repair it. This boiler gave out last winter, and the building was heated with a high pressure threshing boiler, which was unsatisfactory, as the building was not properly heated.\n\nMr. Inspector Murison obtained, from Messrs.

The outside estimate of the cost would be about $2,500, and it might be done for less.\n\nThis is a government-owned school. No funds have been specially provided in our appropriation for Indian Education to cover the cost of supplying and installing a new boiler. However, we have an item of $8,000 in the Estimates, for unforeseen expenditure. The cost involved in the supplying and installing of a new boiler could be taken from this amount. Mr. Inspector Murison states it is urgent that adequate heating facilities at this school be installed before next winter.\n\nI beg to submit, for your consideration and approval, the granting of authority for the expenditure required and the purchase and installation of the boiler from Messrs.

You should submit the prices you receive from the various firms for the approval of the Department.

Blair Bros., Regina, and Cranes Ltd., Regina, did not quote.\n\nI may say that this matter has been held up owing to the very bad condition of the roads to the Cowesses Residential School.\n\nThe representatives from each of the firms, who have submitted prices, visited the school and made an investigation into the requirements. I may say that Messrs. Potts & Miller and N.B. Roantree were both agreed that a boiler with a net rating of 2800 square feet would have sufficient capacity to properly heat the main building of the school. The principal, however, requested them to\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nProvide a boiler sufficiently large to take care of the heating of the church, which is situated approximately 125 feet from the main building. He stated that they would pay for the extra fuel required, themselves, and of course, pay for the installation to the church. In talking the matter over with Messrs. Potts & Miller's heating engineer, he is of the opinion that this would not be a satisfactory arrangement and that it would be more satisfactory to have separate heating units for each building. This matter was not taken up with me by the principal but he may have taken the question up with the Department direct and I am, therefore, submitting my findings in the matter and my recommendation in view of this is that provision be made for heating the school only.\n\nWith reference to the main school building, it has been found that there is not sufficient radiation provided to properly heat the building and also the steam main leading from the boiler to the radiators is only a 4\" main and a 5\" main would be necessary to give the proper service. It has also been found that there is faulty installation in connection with this main which should be changed to get the most efficient service. These matters are mentioned in the quotations of Messrs. Potts & Miller and N.E. Roantree Co. Ltd.\n\nIn order to heat the School building only a boiler with 2800 sq. ft. capacity is required. If the School and the Church are both to be heated it would require a boiler of 4800 sq. ft. capacity. I am submitting quotations from the different firms on both installations. The firms are quoting on boilers which they handle with the closest net capacity to the boiler specified by me when inviting them to submit prices.\nThe following are the quotations received:\n\nMessrs. Potts & Miller Limited:\nSteel Boiler net rating 2800 sq. ft. $1165.00 -\n\" \" \" 4800 sq. ft. $1375.00\n\nN.B. Roantree Co. Ltd.\nSteel Boiler net capacity 2800 sq. ft. $1117.00 -\n\" \" \" 5050 sq. ft. $1385.00\n\nAcme Plumbing Co.\nNew heating Boiler net Capacity 2920 sq. ft. $940.00 -\n\" \" \" 5200 sq. ft. $1100.00\n\nVaeg Wilson & Co. Ltd.\nSteel Boiler net Capacity 3040 sq. ft. $1240.00.\n\nThey also quote on two smaller boilers which would be inadequate for the service required. Although I mentioned the question of the main and increased radiation required in order to make a proper job, neither of the latter two firms gave a quotation on this work.\n\nAs stated before all the foregoing firms quoting on this boiler sent representatives to the school to look the plant over, but Messrs. Potts and Miller and N.B. Roantree and Co. each made a very full examination of the plant and I feel that their recommendations are well worth considering. It is important that we should have this plant placed in such condition that it will satisfactorily heat the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nJuly 19, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI wish to refer to memorandum dated May 30th, last, regarding the supplying and installing of a low pressure boiler, to heat the main building of the Cowessess Indian Residential School (Cowessess Reserve, No. 73, Crooked Lake Agency - Electoral District of Melville), Sask.\n\nYou instructed that prices be obtained for a boiler, installed, from firms on purchasing list. Mr. Inspector Hurison, Regina, was therefore requested to submit prices from firms on the approved list for the supplying of a boiler of a suitable type and size, including the cost of transportation to the school and the labour in satisfactorily installing the boiler.\n\nMr. Hurison now states that representatives from each of the firms who submitted prices visited the school and made investigation into the requirements. It was found that, in order to heat the building satisfactorily, a boiler with 2800 square feet capacity would be required. It was found, further, that there is not sufficient radiation provided to properly heat the building; that the steam main leading from the boiler to the radiators is only a 4\" main and that a 6\" main would be necessary to give the proper service.

B. Roantree Company Limited for the supplying and installing of a steam boiler net capacity 2800 sq. ft., at the price quoted by them of $1117.00.\n\nFrom your letter it occurs to me that possibly my letter to you of July 15th was not clear in that the $1117.00 provides only for the supplying and installing of the boiler and the 5\" main leading from the boiler. The cost of providing and installing the extra radiation with vents etc. is $382.50.\n\nWhen dictating my letter I asked the stenographer, who was temporarily employed, to attach the quotations submitted by the different firms. I now find these on file. Had these been forwarded you would have understood the quotations. I am enclosing them herewith which set out clearly what the offers were.\n\nI would be glad therefore to have authority to have the extra radiation supplied, as I consider that it is very necessary in order to properly heat the school. In the meantime the Roantree Company have ordered the boiler and the work of preparation is being proceeded with as authorized in your letter of the 30th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

B. Roantree Company, Limited, was for the supplying and installing of the steam boiler and the 5 inch main leading from the boiler, and that there will be a further cost for providing and installing the extra radiation with vents, to the amount of $382.50.\n\nAs the Department is anxious to have the heating system at this school placed in a satisfactory condition, you may arrange with the above named firm to provide and install the extra radiation required, at the price quoted by them, $382.50. It is noted that the work of supplying and installing the boiler is being proceeded with. It is hoped that all work will be completed before the cold weather sets in.\n\nWhen all the work has been finished to the satisfaction of the Principal and yourself, please forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, stating in detail the materials supplied and the work performed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

This matter will be dealt with departmentally, and, when it is intended to supply the equipment, a memorandum will be submitted to you for approval as to authorizing the purchase and the firm from whom the equipment should be obtained. It will be necessary to obtain full information, through the local Indian Agent, as to the type of washer and the power required to operate same.

Grayson, for the sum of $405.72.\n\nOur appropriation will not likely be available to pay the cost of this equipment until June, next, and the Department cannot arrange to place the order before that time. The Principal should not have obtained the quotation, as the request should have reached the Department through your office. You might take up this matter with the Principal and ascertain if the style of washer, as mentioned above, would be satisfactory. You should state, also, the power that will be used in operating the machine. When it is timely to supply the equipment, we will arrange to obtain prices here and place the order.

P.

In fact the largest Washers we have been selling to the Department of Indian Affairs are 36\" x 54\". This machine can be driven nicely by a Single Gear, End Header. We are, therefore, taking the privilege of quoting you on this size. If it is necessary for you to have a 36\" x 72\" machine we will get a price for you from the factory but, as stated above, we believe that a 36\" x 54\" will be ample for your requirements.\n\nWe are attaching hereto quotation covering one large Washer and two small Washers. These prices are special Government prices covering equipment which has been accepted as standard for years by the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa.\n\nWe do hope that we may receive your order, and can assure you that same will have our very prompt attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndic.

Chatelain, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nAcknowledging receipt of your letter of the 1st inst., relative to a washer for the Laundry at the Cowessess Indian Residential School, I beg to advise that I recently submitted the request of the Principal for a washer as they are apparently in great need of a new one. In this connection am enclosing herewith the letter from the Principal together with cuts and quotations he received from the Stanley Brock Ltd. From these it will be noted that the Principal prefers two smaller units, rather than the large one mentioned in your letter. The cost of these is more than the one but apparently the two is more suitable to their requirements than the one large. The total however is within the amount estimated for.\n\nThe machines are driven by a gasoline engine connected by belt to a shaft which also drives their other machines, such as bread mixer &c.\n\nI trust this information will be of service to you in securing for them the most satisfactory machine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben A.W.R.

D. Sutherland,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa\n\nMy dear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nOn June 12 last you wrote to Rev. Father Chatelain, Principal of the Marieval School, to the effect that the sum of $750.00 had been voted for his School. This money was to be used for the payment of the following repairs:\n\n1. Paint for the walls and ceilings of two dormitories.\n2. Varnish for up and downstairs halls also paint for seven staff rooms and pharmacy.\n3. Plaster to be renewed on the three walls only of the boys play room, burlap around the base to a height of 5 feet.\n4. 300 ft V. Joint fir for partition to the parlour.\n5. Chimneys of the school to be cleaned.\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Father Chatelain stating that these improvements have been made and that the total amount spent was $409.01; all the labor in connection with the work was paid for by the Principal. As the sum of $750.00 was voted and as only above amount was spent, there is still to the credit of the Marieval School the sum of $340.99.\n\nThe kitchen range is completely worn; would it not be possible to supply the School with a new range out of the 1936 Vote. A few cupboards should be provided for the classrooms also, and three doors leading to the fire escapes in the dormitories. As far as the cupboards and doors are concerned you may supply materials only as the Principal will pay all labor.\n\nThe Marieval School has received very little these last several years in the way of interior improvements, and I hope that you will comply with the Principal's request in this particular case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-5, part 4)\nOttawa, September 24, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, addressed to Mr. Sutherland, of this Department, regarding repairs, etc., required at the Cowessess Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department has paid accounts for material supplied for repairs, plastering and painting, to the amount of $456.46. Besides, we have supplied two washers, at a cost of $431.96.\n\nIt is noted that a new range, cupboards for the classrooms and three doors leading to the fire escapes are needed. The Department is writing the local Indian Agent, requesting him to furnish particulars as to the size and type of range and the approximate cost of the lumber and other materials required in erecting cupboards and doors. When this information is received, consideration will be given as to whether funds can be provided from our Appropriation for the current fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, September 24, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is informed that the kitchen range in use at the Cowessess Indian Residential School is completely worn out and that a new one is required.\n\nIn this connection I would request that you consult the Principal, ascertain the type of range required and inform the Department. If you can obtain the information, I shall be pleased if you will give the approximate cost of supplying a range. The order will be placed from here, if it is decided to supply the equipment.\n\nA few cupboards are required for the classrooms and three doors, leading to the fire escapes in the dormitories, should be provided. The school authorities would carry out any labour in building the cupboards and doors, if the materials were supplied. You might furnish an estimate of the cost of the lumber and other materials required.\n\nPlease give the above your early attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No.108-2-5 of the 24th, my reply has been delayed owing to an outbreak of prairie fire which has lasted for ten days.\n\nDuring one of my visits to the valley I saw Father Chatelain with regard to the repairs to the fire escape doors and cupboards. These will cost in the neighborhood of $25, and believe there will be sufficient left out of the former authority to do this.\n\nWith regard to the range, this is badly needed and was the subject of special mention when the estimates were forwarded. A range of the kind they require would cost in the neighborhood of $130.00. Gurney John Bull Range, one fire box, two ovens No.1-2-24 BL.\n\nI regret the delay but as explained it was unavoidable until now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nEben A.W.H. McKenzie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 16, 1936.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, you may arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the approved list, of a range for the Cowessess Indian Residential School. It is noted that this can be secured at a cost of $190.00.\n\nYou may expend an amount not exceeding $25.00 in repairs to the fire escape door and cupboard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

In searching for this authority, which I cannot find, I have no recollection of ever having received any further authority for repairs except your letter No.108-2-5 May 21st last for painting and repairs $750.\n\nI believe that the cost of repairing this or renewing would be within the authority above mentioned would it be in order for this work to be carried out at a cost of $175.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben A.T.H.

The cost should not exceed the amount mentioned in your letter. The labour will have to be done by the school staff without expense to the Department.\n\nThe amount provided in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year for the Cowessess Indian Residential School has now been fully expended, and, consequently, the Principal should not apply for any further expenditures at the school during the present fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir,\n\nAcknowledging receipt of your letter No.108-2-5 of the 13th inst. which refers to the floor of the boys playroom at the Cowessess Indian Residential School, I beg to advise having seen the Principal this morning and he states that as the present floor is of rough cement he would much prefer it being covered with asphalt rather than lumber, which would make a permanent job of it, and the cost for material and labour would not be in excess of the amount mentioned, viz., $175. The school will attend to any additional labour required and also attend to the hauling of the material for this purpose.\n\nIn view of the above, may I have authority to proceed with putting in asphalt instead of lumber in this room?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEben A.

The pipe was left bare and while the Principal of the school at that time stated that his engineer could do this work and would do it if the Department would supply the necessary material, the necessary authority was not obtained at that time. For Paste asbestos the estimated cost to cover a 5 in. pipe 70 feet in length was $75.\n\nDuring the recent cold spell the Principal had fruit jars broken from frost and vegetables frozen to the approximate value of $90 due to the fact that a great deal of the heat is lost in coming from the furnace to the main building, a distance of almost 70 feet, through this bare pipe.\n\nThe Principal thinks that the cost of $75, formerly estimated for paste asbestos could be reduced somewhat by the use of asbestos paper covering held tight by brass binding. The school staff could do the work in connection therewith if the Department would furnish the material.\n\nIn the face of your recent letter regarding this school the Principal feels loath to bring this to your attention but also feels that with cold weather, this condition will be aggravated throughout the winter.\n\nCan anything be done to repair this defect in installation of the furnace and pipe?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben A.W.R. McKenzie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, December 15, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the material required to cover the main heating pipe from the furnace at the Cowessess Indian Residential School.\n\nThe cost of this material should be kept as low as possible. It is noted from your letter that the school staff will do the necessary work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nE.A.W.R.

R. School has called my attention to the condition of the toilets in his school.\n\nThe outside toilets are in a disgraceful condition and he has requested that he may be allowed new material for two outside toilets, 4 compartments in each and he will provide the labour for the building of the same.\n\nHe also requests that he may be provided with 3 extra indoor toilets 1 extra in the boys dormitory, 1 extra in the girls dormitory and a replacement in the girls play room.\n\nThese toilets cost approximately $40.00 each.\n\nThe material for the outside toilets will cost approximately $75.00\n\nHe also asks if the $200.00 for paint as estimated for has been allowed, and the 15 dollars for cement.\n\nMay the necessary authorities be given please?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben. A. W. R. McKenzie\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 4th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo regarding the request that you have received from the Principal of the Cowessess Indian Residential School, the Department approves of the following expenditures:\n\n(a) Material costing $75.00 for the erection of outside toilets.\n\n(b) $15.00 for the purchase of cement.\n\n(c) $120.00 for three new indoor toilets.\n\nNo special provision has been made for paint at a cost of $200.00 as mentioned in your letter. Our funds are quite limited and it is not possible to consider allowing any expenditure at the present time for exterior painting. If there is some interior painting which you consider should be done, you might let me know the approximate cost of the paint that would be required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No.103-2-5 of the 4th inst. relative to the painting at the Cowessess Indian Residential School I beg to advise that the following rooms have not been done for some years past and the Principal asks if paint can be supplied for this purpose,-\n\nSewing Room, Parlor, Men's Refractory, Bakery, Milk Room, Infirmarys 4 rooms; Laundry and passage.\n\nHe asks to complete these,-\n\n12 gallons flat paint\n10 gallons ground colour\n6 gallons Light graining colour\n10 gallons Varnish\n2 gallons Light Grey Paint.\n\nI believe to get a good quality of paint and other material, this would cost in the neighborhood of $110. to $125.\n\nThe Principal also informs me that in his estimate for the outside toilets he made a mistake and submitted a list of material which will only complete one, if two can be built by reducing the size for an additional $25. May I have authority for him to proceed with the work.\n\nIn each case the school will furnish the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nThe Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

These are as undernoted:\n\nGenerator for the light plant, 32 Volt, has given out. Principal can make replacement on one he has tried and found satisfactory for difference of $40.00\n\nPressure tanks at school so connected that pressure is being secured from only one tank resulting in having to pump for pressure four to five times daily. These require to be properly connected at top and bottom with proper intake and outlet pipes whereby pressure would come from the three rather than one and pressure could be maintained by one pumping per day. As it is at present there is very little if any pressure during night; changing of pipes, elbows &c. connecting three and also pipe line can be done for material at an estimated cost of $50.00\n\nLime for plaster, lumber and nails to complete a refractory in the basement for Principal and Vice-Principal's use. Material to cost $50.00\n\nIn laundry room, a stove pipe runs from the clothes boiler up through a floor into room above and enters the chimney there. As there is a great heat from this pipe the principal proposes building a chimney starting from bracket in the laundry room, he has almost sufficient bricks for this purpose and estimates that he can complete with additional material costing $12.00\n\nMay I have authority to purchase the material asked for by the Principal, please?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEben A.W.R.

The cost of this equipment is estimated at $25.00. Please ascertain from the Principal exactly what is required and arrange for its purchase and delivery.\n\nYou may also expend an amount of $60.00 in the purchase of paint for interior painting and you may secure ten sacks of cement to be used for repairs in the boys' lavatory.\n\nThe Principal also states that repairs are required to the power house and estimates the cost of the lumber at $150. Please let me know at once if you consider this building should be repaired at the present time and, if so, state if you consider the lumber would cost the amount mentioned by the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

With regard to the force pump and hose asked for this is required to pump out a seepage tank and an order for the same has been placed as instructed.\n\nWith regard to repairs to the power house, I find that this is the ice house which had to be re-built as the old one was in such a condition that all of the meets that were placed therein were spoilt. The Principal went ahead and built a new one which is completed at a cost of about Fifty-five Dollars ($55.00) for lumber and extra material required. I think this will be the total cost of the repairs Estimated in the $150.00, as mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter.

McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir,\n\nFollowing up complaints from the Reverend Principal of the Cowessess Indian Residential School regarding the sewage disposal system, I beg to advise that one of the engineers of the Department of Public Health inspected the system and reports as follows:\n\nApparently defects in the plumbing system have existed for some time and I am informed that the trap on one of the bath-tub wastes, on the second floor, syphons when the water closet alongside is flushed which permits a strong odour to permeate the building. Also the sewage at times backs up into the laundry although the laundry floor is about 18 inches above the rest of the basement. Very strong and obnoxious odours result whenever the sewage backs up.\n\nIt appears to me that the reason for the syphoning of the bathtub trap is due to improper venting or else some blockage has occurred since installation was made. The backing up of the laundry sewer appears to be due to blockage in the drain at some point between the laundry and the septic tank as there is no complaint of other fixtures on this drain giving trouble. It is probable that the blockage is between the laundry room and the first clean out. It is possible that the backing up of the sewage is due to a clogging of the outfall pipe from the septic tank although in this case, all drains would be expected to back up.\n\nThere are three main drains from the building to the septic tank. It is probable that there are no basement connections to the other two drains so that a backing up would not be noticed.\n\nIn order to adjust the difficulty it will be necessary for a plumber to check up on the installation, especially the venting at the units where syphonage takes place and probably rodding the various drains to remove any blockage which may have taken place.\n\nSgd J.G.Schaeffer B.Sc.\nSanitary Engineer.\n\nMay I have authority to have a plumber look over this school and remedy the defects in the sewage system as at present in order to prevent backing up they have to pump out the sludge well about every two weeks.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-5, part 4)\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that the Principal of the Cowessess Indian Residential School asks for the undermentioned repairs if the barn asked for is not granted.\n\nRepairs to present barn $150.\nNumber for new shed built of logs 450.\nPaint for school, power house, garage 200.\nElectric engine with dynamo (lister) 300.\n\nRepairs to the present barn would be mostly planking for floors and stalls and bracing. Roof and stall and floor required for the cattle shed which he proposes to build of logs. His present shed is so old that the roof has caved in and the walls all look about to.\n\nThe outer back part of school is badly in need of paint as likewise the power house and garage. Paint that was formerly put on is completely done. The Principal states they can do the work if the Department supply the paint.\n\nIn connection with lumber, the Rev. Principal asks if he can purchase the lumber from the Paget Mills Arran, Sask., and he will haul it with his own truck. He states that he can buy it at about half of the price. This mill is located on the Swan River and they sell lumber at a greatly reduced price on their location there.\n\nThe present engine for the light plant is almost completely done. This is a 32 volt plant which does not generate sufficient watts for their needs and as a result has to do overtime almost each day.\n\nAll of which submitted for your favourable consideration\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben A.W.R. McKenzie.\nOttawa,\nApril 13, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant regarding the sewage disposal system at the Cowessess Indian Residential School you may secure a plumber to look over the system and remedy any defects provided no heavy expenditure is incurred.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

We only were able to include an item of $360.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Cowessess School. Out of this amount we will have to deduct the payment for the dough mixer.\n\nThe present set up of our Vote makes it extremely difficult to provide funds in any case where no amount has been specifically provided. However, it may be possible to supply the lumber for the repairs to the barn the cost of which you estimate at $150.00. Please let me have full particulars regarding the lumber required for this purpose in order that the matter may be placed before our Purchasing Branch.\n\nIn your letter you estimate the cost of the electric engine at $300.00 while in your estimates you stated that a Lister 5 h.p. engine was required and could be secured for $95.00.

As I advised you in my letter of April 13 it was only found possible to include an item of $360.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Cowessess Indian Residential School. From this amount we will have to pay the account covering the cost of the dough mixer which is approximately $310.00. This leaves a balance of approximately $50.00. As previously mentioned, the present set up of our vote makes it extremely difficult to provide funds in any case where the amount required has not been specifically provided. Under the circumstances it will not be possible to favourably consider, at the present time, the purchase of material for the barn nor a new combination engine and generator at an approximate cost of $300.00.\n\nI understand from your letter that the present generator could be repaired at a cost of $90.00. If new material is required for these repairs you should give me full details in order that the matter may be placed before our Purchasing Agent. If, however, the $90.00 represents the cost of labour you may engage a firm on the approved list and proceed with the necessary work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. A. W. R.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir:-\n\nConcerning my report to you of the 7th of April last, concerning the trouble with the sewage arrangements at Cowessess I.R. School, and your instructions 108-2-5 of April 13th, to get a plumber to examine same. I have had George Holloway - Plumber of Broadview make an inspection and I beg to enclose herewith his report with an estimate of the cost of the repairs to the same.\n\nAs this entails quite a considerable expenditure I have left the matter over to await your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben A.W.R. McKenzie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nMay 27, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant with reference to the repairs required to the sewage system at the Cowessess Indian Residential School.\n\nI would appreciate your stating if Mr. Holloway is on the approved list, also if you consider his quotation reasonable.\n\nThe latter part of his quotation reads: \"If it is necessary to renew the drain from the septic tank to the creek the cost would be 45\u00a2 per lineal foot.\" Please let me know the distance from the tank to the creek. Do you consider this work would also have to be done?\n\nThe present set up of our appropriation makes it necessary for us to have very definite information before finally considering any expenditure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\n\nE. A. W. R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:\n\nReference your letter 108-2-5 of the 11th instant concerning the fire precautions at the Cowessess I. R. School I have to advise that there is the following equipment at this school:\n\nBasement:\n- 2 small fire extinguishers\n- 1 hose\n\n1st floor:\n- 2 large fire extinguishers\n- 2 small do.\n\n2nd floor:\n- 1 hose\n- 2 big extinguishers\n\nBoy's Dormitory:\n- 1 hose\n- 1 large fire extinguisher\n- 1 small do\n\nGirl's Dormitory:\n- 1 hose\n- 1 large fire extinguisher\n- 1 small do\n\nAttic:\n- 1 small extinguisher.\n\nThere is at each end of the school poles installed for sliding down in case of fire but the Reverend Principal seems to think that tubes would be better and far safer.\n\nWith this possible exception I cannot see that providing all the fire extinguishers are kept in a workable condition that much further in the matter could be recommended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben. A. W. R. McKenzie\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the second instant, it is not considered necessary to supply any additional fire extinguishers to the Cowessess Indian Residential School. You should, of course, instruct the Principal to keep the fire extinguishers at present in the school in good condition.\n\nIn the present year's appropriation no provision was made for funds that would be required to change the type of fire escape at the Cowessess School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter 108-2-5 of the 27th ultimo, regarding the sewage system of Cowessess I.R. School, I beg to advise that it is necessary to lower the outlet of the drain 30 feet from the school to the creek and in lowering this drain it is probable, there being a wood drain, that a considerable portion of the material would be useless to put back again. This distance is 220 feet and if necessary to renew, the cost for material and labor would be at the rate of 45\u00a2 per lineal foot for what portion of the drain that would be necessary to renew.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben A.W.R. McKenzie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant with reference to the sewage system at the Cowessess Indian Residential School. As you were informed in official letter of the 13th ultimo the amount specifically provided for this school is practically exhausted. We have, however, a very small amount available for unforeseen expenditures and I judge from your letters that the sewage system at the Cowessess School must receive immediate attention. The quotation of Mr. Holloway, forwarded with your letter of May 19, read as follows:\n\nExavating and lowering drain approximately 220 lin. feet ...............$ 220.00\nInstalling additional water closet ........... 40.00\nBack-venting 3 bathrooms .................. 30.00\nTransportation and hauling .................. 20.00\nRenewing 10 ft. C.I. soil pipe ............. 6.80\nLead, oakum, water pipe and fittings ....... 4.80\n\nTotal ............$ 321.60\n\nAre we to understand that in addition to the above expense there may be a further expense of $99.00? This latter figure is obtained from the information given in your letter of the 20th instant.\n\nI am sorry to trouble you again in this matter but our appropriation is set up in such a manner this year that we have to be absolutely certain of the total amount of any expenditures before authorizing the work to proceed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. A. W. R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCrooked Lake Agency\nBroadview Sask\nJune 28th, 1938\n\nSir:-\n\nReference your letter 108-2-5 of the 25th instant I have to advise that beside the expenses enumerated if when the drain is opened up and it is found that it will want renewing there will be the expense of what part needs renewing and if all needs renewing it will cost $99.00 in addition to the $321.60 quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben. A. W. R. McKenzie\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\nOttawa, July 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo, you may arrange for the repairs to the sewage system at the Cowessess Indian Residential School, at a cost not exceeding $420.60.\n\nThe Department will expect that the Principal and yourself will give personal supervision to this work and keep the cost as low as possible. No unnecessary work should be done and every endeavour made to keep the expenditure below the above mentioned amount. When forwarding vouchers, detailed information should be given regarding the work that was done and the articles that were supplied.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nE.A.W.R.

(RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 201, amounting to $303.44 in favour of William Roberts, 130 Pemberton St., Winnipeg, MB, for a dough mixer.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nof Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. 518\nExtract from letter dated July 6, 1938, received from Dr. J. J. WALL.\n\nIt is with respect to the fire hazard at night in four of our Schools. They are Sandy Bay, Man., Round Lake and Cowessess of Broadview, Sask., and lastly and especially Hobbema, Alta. In any of these institutions, should I sleep there, I always have the flash-light, overcoat, socks and gloves available and prepared for a sudden dive into the winter night. This fear in these four places certainly has not become an obsession but it has started to bother my conscience.\n\nI know how foolish it would be in these hard times to imagine that funds are available for proper reconstruction. But is it not possible to get proper escape apparatus installed. Every second for evacuation time must be conserved. I am not frightened so much of the flames at night but I am fearful of the superheated gases developing and flooding the halls. Only a partial lung-ful of this and a person is out. All the fire fighting equipment possible will not avail such a case. That was my experience years ago at the Royal Victoria in Montreal when we had that terrible movie fire which took so many children. It was not the flames, as I recollect, none were even scorched.\n\nMy belief is that this problem can be solved in preparing proper escapes. Iced poles of iron, narrow snow or ice filled metal stairs on the outside possibly open to a wall of flames from some window it passes will only add to the panic at night. Poor lighting over these meager affairs will not assist.\n\nThe panic in the children when a real fire does break will be stupendous. The stoical Indian in such case is a figment on the part of certain popular authors.\n\nDon't be sore at me, Phil., as I am prepared to lay a two to one bet up to $100 bucks that in case of such an eventuality in any of the four, happening in winter between ten at night and four in the morning, the mortality will exceed...\nthirty per cent.\n\nThe ideal thing would be an inspection of each by an officer, like the Chief of the Montreal brigade, who has had plenty of experience dealing with such institutional hazards. His first consideration would be to figure the route the fire and gases would take so that adequate methods and routes of escape can be instituted. Steel fire doors would undoubtedly be installed on each floor above the first. Steel tower-like escapes as on the Kent Street School at Ottawa would replace at strategic points the old dangerous poles and narrow stairs. Lists of pupils to utilize each escape would be posted at all times and each child's name checked from list as it passes by a responsible guardian. Many of the children otherwise, in the event of a genuine alarm will, if not watched, take refuge in a clothes closet or under its bed.\n\nNight watchman was a step in the right direction but much can happen in the winter when he is punching in the outbuildings and barn and the time he returns to the school.\n\nMuch as I hate to bring your attention to this whole question in these four places, please understand it is not done so with any sense of butting in. It is for these poor kiddies sake, many of whom one becomes attached in his duties. In case also, should any catastrophe arise, we all shall be scourged properly at any investigation especially at the hands of politically conscious lawyers who cynically will give little credit to those who really and truly have the fullest interests of these tots at heart.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, July 21, 1938.\n\nRe: Your No. 18905 - Order No. 2865.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI am in receipt of your account of the 6th ultimo, covering the cost of a dough mixer supplied to the Cowessess Indian Residential School. Your account includes two items for freight, as follows:\n\nToronto to Winnipeg - $23.32\nWinnipeg to Grayson - 10.12\n\nIn connection with the latter item, it will be necessary for you to forward a receipt from the railway company. Regarding the former, a receipt from the railway company should be forwarded, if possible, but, if this dough mixer was included in a larger shipment which you received from Toronto, an explanation should be given why you request freight charges of $23.32. As soon as your reply is received, payment of the account will be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nWilliam Roberts & Sons,\n120 Lombard Street,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nThe Department of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n- Attention Mr. Philip Phelan -\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 21st, File No. 108-2-5, regarding our invoices covering Dough Mixer, would say that we attached to the invoices sent to the Indian Residential School at Marieval the two expense bills referred to.\n\nHowever, we are enclosing herewith duplicate copies of same and trust these will enable you to authorize payment of our account.\n\nThanking you, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWILLIAM ROBERTS & SONS,\n\nper\n\nARD/NT.\nEnc. 2.\n| DATE       | DESCRIPTION                                      | FOLIO | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | BALANCE |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------|--------------|---------|\n| July 15th  | Rep. 5 HP Foster Engine                          |       |               |              |         |\n|            | Piston and Pin & Rings                          |       | 12.00         |              |         |\n|            | Rebuild Block                                    |       | 8.00          |              |         |\n|            | 3 Bushes 3/8 x 1 1/2                            |       | 3.00          |              |         |\n|            | 4 Cap Screws 7/16                               |       | 2.00          |              |         |\n|            | 1 1/2 x 2 Stud                                   |       | 1.00          |              |         |\n|            | 2 3/4 Cap Screws                                |       | 1.00          |              |         |\n|            | 10 Rep Magnets                                   |       | 6.90          |              | 27.65   |\n|            | 70 x 10 Rep Bearings                             |       | 2.60          |              | 27.91   |\n|            |                                                 |       | 12.00         |              | 39.91   |\n\nCertified copy.\n\nP.

Since that time we have authorized a considerable expenditure for repairs to the sewage system. In view of the above it is not possible to favourably consider purchasing at the present time the new desks requested by the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

I am advised by the Bannister Electric Company, that our generator is too small and wont last long. I have in view a generator with warranty which I can get for $85.00.\n\nThe best will be to have a combination engine with generator as requested last spring.\n\nHoping to receive a favourable answer, I remain,\n\nSir; P.

McKenzie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nOctober 4, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letters of the 22nd and 27th ultimo with reference to a request that you have recently received from the Principal of the Cowessess Residential School for a new generator and new desks.\n\nIn official letter of May 13 last you were advised that in preparing our appropriation for the current fiscal year it was found possible to include an item of $360.00 only for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Cowessess School. When the account for the dough mixer was paid there was only a balance of approximately $50.00.\n\nSince that time we have authorized $420.60 for repairs to the sewage system. Recently we received an account of $55.55 for general repairs and a cheque for this will go forward in the near future. You will note from the above that the Department has expended considerably more at this school during the current academic year than was originally intended. Under these circumstances it is not possible to favourably consider purchasing the desks and generator at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nE.A.W.R.

McKenzie,\nIndian Agent\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince two months, we have encountered many difficulties with our Power-Plant. As it were emergency cases, I have requested the services of an expert electrician, Mr. Arthur Kendrick. His visits and his days work amount to \u00a331.70 which I beg the Department to pay. And still, we are in danger of being without light at any moment. The one cylinder Lister engine is nearly gone, after 18 years of service. Rev. Fr. Chatelain had it overhauled last summer, and is still in a bad shape; the 2 pumps-magneto and bearings are wore out. The batteries bought by you 3 years ago are gone also, the plates are warping, and Mr. Kendrick says: they will soon, after the heavy drain they receive every day, be gone also. Consequently, I urge the necessity of a complete new plant of 110 volts diesel Lister which will be able to stand the consumption we need in our institution, caused mostly to the long cable runs.\n\nFurthermore, may I ask another favor of having our outside buildings repainted next spring; it will be at the honor of the Department to see these buildings with a better looking. Especially, the calves shed is a disgrace in the yard. Also the cow barn would require some urgent repair.\n\nWe have fixed already the fowl-house, so much so, that we collect every day 90 eggs, well appreciated by the children.\n\nWe are in the present time, repairing and repainting the inside of the laundry, you will not recognize it. Soon, the furnace room will have its cleaning and whitewashing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. V. de Varennes\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Rev. Principal of Cowessess Indian Residential School, in connection of the condition of his light plant in general.\n\nThe school has had Mr Kendrick do considerable repair work previous to this and the plant is still giving them trouble.\n\nWould it be possible to do anything for them along the lines of 110 volt Lister plant, as otherwise the school is liable to be without lights any minute?\n\nThe other items mentioned in his letter such as painting and paint were included in the estimates last fall.\n\nMay I in the meantime forward a voucher in favor of the Principal for the repairs he states have been done?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben A.W.R. McKenzie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 20, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the lighting plant at the Cowessess Indian residential school. You may forward a voucher covering the cost of the repairs to this plant.\n\nOwing to lack of funds it is not possible at the present time to consider the purchase of a new lighting plant for this school. However, in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40 provision has been made for funds for improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school. If the lighting plant is considered the most necessary item the Department is prepared to consider its purchase after the first of April. In that event you should let me have full particulars regarding the equipment required in order that the purchase may be handled by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nIn the event of the Lister lighting plant being purchased it should be distinctly understood by the Principal that its cost will absorb all the funds provided for the Cowessess residential school in our appropriation for 1939-40 and under these circumstances it will not be possible to consider any other improvements at that school during the next fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.A.W.R.

For one of these the Department issued cheque and I explained the matter to you in my letter of February 23 last.\n\nIt was understood that the school management would pay the other account from their own funds.
