From this statement the Farmer says that it took fourteen weeks for flat to mature, and we took it at its worst. It is also stated that when spring crops are injured in this country, but when the grain is ripening, so much so that it is easy to see that it is injured, and if it is easy to see that it is injured from other crops when maturing all the sooner.\"\n\nWe care you give Fast a call for the cheapest and best Boot and Shoe ever offered in the town.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS\n\nSome discussion took place on the 4th of May on the question of the Government's action in India.

The next morning he started early in the day on his way to Prince Albert, who, on arriving at the stopping place, found the body lying on the ground.\n\nThinking it strange that the house should be open and trembled he made a search of the premises, but could find nothing except his clothes, which were neatly hung up.\n\nHe then proceeded to the scene of the tragedy, and with some difficulty on account of the snow, succeeded in raising the body of the deceased, and was immediately sent to Dr. Doll, of Q.Apple, to come and see what could be done.\n\nMr. Wm. Dewey, of Prince Albert, who was on his way here, also saw the body, and made a thorough examination of the dogs, to ascertain if closely. He also states that he was warned on his way home by Q.Apple by Mr. Buttenher to look out for strange looking dogs near the Salt Plains.\n\nFor weeks Peter Smith refused to disclose any facts connected with the case, whether deceased met with foul play or took his own life. The fact that he was parted with his wife and children, and had no particular friend, while the fact that a string was attached to the trigger of the gun, and that the bullet hole in the mouth would suggest suicide. It is possible, however, that the string attached to the gun may have been there for the purpose of hanging the weapon on the wall, and that the deceased meant that he was about to commit suicide. He had been very ill for some time, and had been confined to bed for some time, and to this fact and his lonely state of life is doubted that the string was there. He was a bachelor, was in Winnipeg, and was an Englishman by birth, though he had been in Canada for some years.\n\nBoston Young Lady\u2014Yes, sir, while visiting in the country last summer, I met a young gentleman, whom I never want to forget.\n\nDealer\u2014May I ask what that\u2014er\u2014gentleman was?\n\nBoston Young Lady\u2014Oh, yes, I made a fumblesteak for a blackberry.\n\nThe new American has been more honest with dinner, and has been less butter flick, creaked back and lazy legs upon the table.\n\nIt is said that the ex Express Engineer still bears the traces of great and delicate feelings, almost resembling her age and mystery.\n\nA man committed suicide the other day, and left a paper which he did not sign.
