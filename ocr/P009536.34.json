The sum of $537,380.74 was expended for construction and maintenance of District Highways and Local Roads, being an increase of $131,555.53 over last year.\n\nAn extensive programme was carried out by the Main Highways Construction Branch, including 99.81 miles of bituminous surface treatment and 224 miles of seal coating existing bituminous road surfaces. Further progress was made in eliminating railway grade level crossings on main highways under agreement with the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada.\n\nThe work of the Bridge Branch included erection of steel and timber bridges and culverts on main highways. All steel bridges were fabricated within the Province. Forty steel bridges and 250 timber bridges were constructed and 236 bridges were repaired, making a total of 526 bridges dealt with during the year.\n\nThe report of the Director of Surveys shows a slight decrease in the number of surveys carried forward to the ensuing year and a small reduction in plans submitted by Municipal Districts.\n\nBUILDINGS\n\nAll public buildings and institutions were repaired and maintained in order to keep them up to standard requirements.\n\nA substantial construction programme was carried out, which included remodelling and renovation of the Kelly-Ramsey Building to convert the building for Government use. This building is now known as the Provincial Building, Edmonton.\n\nDetails of maintenance, alterations and additions, and construction of buildings are contained in the report of the Superintendent of Buildings.\n\nMECHANICAL BRANCH\n\nThe Boilers, Factories and Electrical Protection Acts as well as operation of the Provincially owned Power Plants are under the jurisdiction of the above Branch, and these activities are covered by the report of the Mechanical Superintendent.\nHIGHWAY TRAFFIC BOARD\n\nThe Public Service Vehicles Act, 1936, is administered by the above Board. Increase in mileage covered by Public Service Vehicles over the mileage of the previous fiscal year is reported.\n\nPROVINCIAL GAOLS\n\nReports on these institutions show an average daily population for the year of approximately 455 prisoners, compared with 443 the previous year. The average net cost per prisoner for the period is lower than last year.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nG. H. N.

W. Macpherson, Commissioner of Highways and Bridges)\n\nDuring the year 11 crews were employed on bridge work, one of these being used on painting steel bridges.\n\nSome ferry construction and maintenance was undertaken, and several bridges were built in connection with new Main Highway construction.\n\nUnder assistance from the Dominion Government, 3,167 lineal feet of protection wall was built along the Oldman River at Lethbridge.\n\nAll steel spans were fabricated within the Province, the following being a list of the same:\n\nCONSTRUCTION:\n\n| Size          | Stream                  | Location       |\n|---------------|-------------------------|----------------|\n| 1-100 foot span | Pipestone Creek         | N.W. 32-25-4   |\n| 1-100 foot span | Kneehills Creek         | N.W. 32-25-4   |\n| 1-100 foot span | Medicine River           | E. 11-41-4     |\n| 1-80 foot span  | Paddle River             | S. 2-59-5      |\n| 1-100 foot span | Lobstick River           | S.E. 1-59-11   |\n| 1-80 foot span  | Sturgeon Creek           | N.W. 4-48-5    |\n| 1-100 foot span | Sturgeon River           | S.E. 10-55-24  |\n| 1-175 foot span | Jumpingpound Creek       | N. 4-26-4      |\n| 1-35 foot additional span | Mill River | E. 21-2-16     |\n| 1-80 foot span  | Beaverlodge River        | N.W. 1-59-6    |\n| 1-80 foot span  | Beaverlodge River        | N. 9-72-10     |\n| 1-60 foot span  | Paddle River             | N.W. 17-59-2   |\n\nNEW SUB-STRUCTURES:\n\n| Size          | Stream                  | Location       |\n|---------------|-------------------------|----------------|\n| 1-60 foot span | Little Bow River        | N.W. 17-16-26  |\n| 1-60 foot span | Little Bow River        | 26/27-14-25    |\n| 1-80 foot span | Dogpound Creek          | N. 34-30-3     |\n| 1-80 foot span | Dogpound Creek          | N. 34-30-3     |\n| 1-90 foot span | Jumpingpound Creek      | S.E. 13-25-5   |\n| 1-80 foot span | Fish Creek              | W. 6-23-1     |\n| 1-80 foot span | Medicine River           | 21/28-39-3     |\n| 1-60 foot span | Sturgeon River           | 8/9-55-22      |\n| 1-80 foot span | Sturgeon River           | 10/11-55-24    |\n| 1-60 foot span | Sturgeon River           | N.E. 36-54-27  |\n| 1-80 foot span | Sturgeon River           | S. 29-54-26    |\n| 1-60 foot span | Sturgeon River           | S.R. 34-25-4   |\n| 1-60 foot span | North Fork Creek        | W. 38-25-4     |\n| 1-100 foot span | Willow Creek            | S.E. 32-13-28  |\n| 1-80 foot span | Willow Creek             | S.E. 5-14-29   |\n| 1-60 foot span | Threehills Creek        | N.W. 1-59-6    |\n| 1-60 foot span | Threehills Creek        | N.E. 22-31-24  |\n| 1-60 foot span | Threehills Creek        | S. 3-32-24     |\n| 1-80 foot span | Kneehills Creek         | 29/30-29-24    |\n| 1-60 foot span | Lonepine Creek          | 25/26-29-24    |\n| 1-80 foot span | Lonepine Creek          | N.W. 22-30-26  |\n| 2-125 foot, 1-100 foot spans | St. Mary's River | W. \u00bd-1-25-4   |\n| 1-125 foot span | Beaver River             | S.W. 20-63-12  |\n| 1-80 foot span | Bowman River             | N.W. 1-45-1    |\n| 1-125 foot span | Battle River             | S.E. 35-45-1   |\n| 1-100 foot span | Battle River             | N.W. 17-44-8   |\n| 2-135 foot, 1-60 foot spans | Pembina River | N. 4-60-1     |\n| 1-60 foot span | Paddle River             | W. 6-57-7     |\n\nSUMMARY OF WORK ON BRIDGES, 1939-40:\n\nSteel Bridges as shown above ................................................................. 40\nTimber Bridges Constructed ............................................................................. 250\n*Bridges Maintained ....................................................................................... 236\n\nTotal Bridges dealt with .................................................................................. 526\n\n*46 of the maintained bridges were painted.\nMAIN HIGHWAYS BRANCH\n\n(N. W. Macpherson, Commissioner of Highways and Bridges)\n\nAn extensive programme of construction was carried out by this Branch during the season of 1939, 819.53 miles of highway construction of all types being undertaken. Included in this was 99.81 miles of bituminous surface treatment, 2.99 miles of asphaltic plant mix, and 223.95 miles of seal coating existing bituminous road surfaces. Further progress was made in eliminating railway grade level crossings for main highway traffic under agreement with the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada. One crossing was eliminated on the Crow'snest Highway near Macleod by relocation of the highway and one crossing on the Jasper Highway near Gainford by the installation of a subway. In addition, two grade level crossings were protected by advance warning signal devices. Following is a statement of the work performed during the year ending March 31, 1940:\n\n### GRADING\n\n| Location                                      | Miles | Type   | Work Done by       |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|--------|--------------------|\n| Medicine Hat-Sask.

P. C. BELYEA, Director of Surveys)\n\nThe work of the Surveys Branch for the fiscal year ending March 31st, 1940, amounts to approximately that of last year.\n\nThere were four field parties surveying highways from the first week of May until the month of November.\n\nThe number of road plans submitted for examination by Municipal Districts was slightly reduced, and there was also a small reduction in the number of surveys carried over to the present year.\n\nThe following is a summary of the work of this Branch during the past year:\n\n- Surveys required and brought forward from 1938 (after revising schedule) ..... 413\n- Surveys asked for during 1939 .................................................. 187\n- Surveys made during 1939 ...................................................... 178\n- Surveys carried over to 1940 .................................................... 422\n- Plans submitted and examined on behalf of Municipal Districts .................. 91\n- Titles issued to cover surveys by Municipal Districts ............................. 103\n- Plans approved and filed at Land Titles Office .................................. 203\n- Certificates of Title received for roadways ....................................... 193\n- Certificates of Title received for lands given for public purposes under Departmental Regulations as to subdivisions ........................................... 14\n- Certificates of Title to public lands .................................................. 21\n- Transfers issued covering lands no longer required .................................. 190\n- Number of plans of subdivisions approved ......................................... 55\n- Plans approved by the Department of Water Resources ............................ 34\n- Plans of Power and Transmission Lines ........................................... 16\n- Vouchers issued for compensation .................................................. 510\n- Leases of road allowances in force .................................................. 219\n- Leases of road allowances applied for ............................................... 31\nBUILDINGS BRANCH\n(W. D. STACEY, Superintendent of Buildings)\n\nThe work of this Branch was carried out along similar lines to previous years. Considerable alterations, capital and maintenance work were carried out as follows:\n\nUniversity Hospital, Edmonton South.\n\nAn addition to the obstetrical unit was constructed of interlocking clay tile for exterior walls, with frame partitions and floor joists. The size is 74'\u00d742', and the general design of exterior harmonizes with the existing unit. Accommodation for the nursery, labor rooms, private case room and public case service room, doctors' room and students cloak room is provided. Complete air-conditioning is carried out by an automatic system located in the basement. Up-to-date medical and surgical equipment has been installed.\n\nProvincial Building, Edmonton.\n\nThe building, formerly owned by the James Ramsey Estate, and occupied by the T. Eaton Co., was purchased and complete renovation was made in order to convert the building into suitable offices. An inside fire escape was built and main stairway placed in the front portion of the building. The cost of this renovation was $55,293.28.\n\nParliament Buildings.\n\nThis Department was in charge of the decorations of Provincial Government Buildings for the reception of the King and Queen on their Royal Visit.\n\nTwo arches were erected at the entrance to the grounds of the Parliament Buildings on 109th Street, and in the rotunda of the building an open fountain was built, which was decorated with flowers and bunting.\n\nMental Institute, Oliver.\n\nA new storm sewer was installed at this institution to take care of the surface water. Due to increased accommodation, it was necessary to enlarge the septic tank, which was constructed of solid concrete chambers, and up-to-date equipment of pumps, etc., were purchased.\n\nProvincial Training School, Red Deer.\n\nAn Infirmary Building was erected at Red Deer to take care of incurable patients. This building is of hollow tile construction, concrete floors, fabricated steel joists, asbestos shingled roof. It is 118' long, and is roughly \"L\" shaped and extends back a distance of 64'. Provision was made to enable building of a similar wing, when required. It will accommodate from 60 to 70 patients, and has matron and assistant matron's quarters, treatment rooms, laboratory, etc. The first floor only was furnished.\n\nProperty known as \"The Old Gaetz Farm\" was purchased, and the buildings thereon consisted of a large farm house of 12 rooms,\nwhich was renovated and remodelled into a farm dormitory for the boys who can do farm work.\n\n**Agricultural Schools, Vermilion and Olds.**\n\nUp-to-date farrowing hog pens and several other small buildings were erected at both of these Agricultural Schools.\n\n**Treasury Branches.**\n\nSuitable buildings were located and fitted up for use as Treasury Branches at the following places: Lethbridge, Cardston, Blairmore, Raymond, Lacombe, Three Hills, Ryley, Wetaskiwin, Ponoka, Edson, Vermilion, Wainwright, Hanna, Olds, Standard, Vulcan, Grimshaw, Westlock, Vegreville, Berwyn and Edmonton South.\n\nThe \u201cOld Merchants Bank Building\u201d at Calgary was purchased and completely remodelled. The main floor is occupied by the Treasury Branch and the second floor is occupied by various provincial offices. The cost of renovating this building was $5,107.38.\n\n**St. Paul.**\n\nA building at St. Paul was purchased at a cost of $2,850.00. A portion of this building is occupied by the Liquor Vendor Store, and the balance of the building will be renovated for other Government offices.\n\n**Carpenter Shop, Edmonton.**\n\nThis shop has been occupied manufacturing equipment and furniture, i.e., counters, desks, tables, bookcases and filing cabinets for the various public buildings, offices and institutions.\n\n**General.**\n\nRepairs and alterations to Government buildings and institutions, which also includes buildings occupied by the R.C.M.P. and owned by this Government, have been carried out under the supervision of our foreman as directed.\n\nThe expenditure for appropriations controlled by this Branch during the year 1939-40 was as follows:\n\n### CAPITAL EXPENDITURE\n\n| Apprn.

The maintenance and operation of the power plants and utility service of the eight largest institutions.\n2. The administration of The Steam Boilers Act.\n3. The administration of The Factories Act.\n4. The administration of The Tradesmen\u2019s Qualification Act as it applies to Welders.\n5. The administration of The Electrical Protection Act.\n\nThe administration of The Electrical Protection Act was transferred to this Department on October 31, 1939.\n\nPower Plants and Institution Maintenance.\n\nA study of the power plant statistics for the year shows a material increase in the demands of the various institutions. There was an increase in the consumption of coal amounting to 2,449 tons; an increase in gas consumption of 9,829,000 cubic feet; an increase in the electricity supplied of 425,244 kilowatt hours; and an increase in the water consumption of 14,698,000 gallons. At the same time, there was an increase in expenditure of $6,367.61. This, however, is offset by the expenditure of $7,500.00 for the replacement of an old boiler at the Provincial Training School, Red Deer.\n\nThe chief engineers of the various plants continue to express concern about the increased demands made upon their plants, as a great deal of the equipment is either inadequate, obsolete or inefficient.\n\nThe work of remodelling the heating systems at Ponoka was continued during the summer; $4,093.00 was expended on this item.\n\nThe installation of a 100 H.P. Vickers-Keeler water tube boiler at Red Deer and the commencement of the construction of a new sewage disposal plant at Oliver were steps in the right direction.\n## PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT POWER PLANT STATISTICS\n\nFor Year ended March 31st, 1940\n\n(Vernon, Pearson, Mechanical Superintendent)\n\n| No. | Name | FUEL | WATER | ELECTRICITY | MECHANICAL REFRIGERATION |\n|-----|------|------|--------|-------------|--------------------------|\n|     |      | Coal (Tons) | Gas (Cubic Feet) | Pumped from Sources (Imperial Gallons) | Purchased Generated | Purchased | (Tons) |\n| 1.  | Parliament Building and Administration Building | 4,858 | 3,265,000 | 23,437,883 | $1,250,600 | 110,760 | $26,629,13 |\n| 2.  | Banff Springs Hotel and Normal School, Calgary | 4,410 | 4,591,070 | 4,768,600 | 69,096 | 5,390 | 11,467,21 |\n| 3.  | Ponoka Montana Coal | 2,579 | 11,180,000 | 1,765,650 | 263,930 | 1,065,777 | 17,656,52 |\n| 4.  | Fort Saskatchewan Coal | 2,231 | 7,119,510 | 6,974,600 | 106,577 | 13,061,30 |\n| 5.  | Lethbridge Coal | 5,521 | 35,290,960 | 28,200,437 | 926,900 | 41,628,106 |\n| 6.  | Cochrane Alberta Sulphurium | 1,867 | 11,129,400 | 865,980 | 18,800 | 1,100 | 26,777,25 |\n| 7.  | Cochrane Alberta Sulphurium | 1,867 | 11,129,400 | 865,980 | 18,800 | 1,100 | 26,777,25 |\n| 8.  | Provincial Training School, Red Deer | 22,080 | 48,646,000 | 115,263,590 | 74,673,980 | 4,422,887 | 198,6596 |\n| TOTALS | | | | | | | |\n\nTotal Coal used: 32,080 Tons\nTotal Gas used: 48,646,000 Cubic Feet\nTotal Water used: 189,837,670 Imperial Gallons\nTotal Electricity used: 4,633,340 Kilowatt Hours\nTotal Refrigeration: 6,980 Tons\nTHE STEAM BOILERS ACT\n\nSeveral accidents have occurred to pressure vessels and equipment coming within our jurisdiction, but fortunately no person has been injured as a result of these accidents.\n\nTwo large new refineries located in Calgary have been placed in operation during the year. These refineries are operated by the British American Oil Company and the Imperial Oil Company. New units have been added to the refinery operated by the Gas & Oil Products, Limited, at Hartell. The Abasand Oil Plant at Fort McMurray is now in operation, and the Industrial Minerals' salt plant at Waterways has been reconditioned. The work included the installation of a 320-H.P. Vickers-Keeler water tube boiler. The Cadomin Coal Company at Cadomin installed an all-welded 8\" steam line, 1,100 feet in length; this connects the main power house with the 1,000-H.P. shaft hoist. Steam for the hoist was formerly supplied by four 150-H.P. boilers adjacent to the hoist.\n\nTwo 320-H.P. B. & W. water tube boilers and an 800 K.W. turbo-generator have been added to the Mountain Park Collieries plant.\n\nSupervision of repairs and the several new installations has taken up a great deal of the time of our staff during the year. Inspector Hawkins again reports that it is physically impossible with the present staff in the Calgary district to inspect properly all power boilers and other high-pressure equipment yearly, and air tanks and heating boilers every two years.\n\nFive persons were prosecuted under Section 23 and two under Section 7 of the Act; a conviction was obtained in each case. As a result of these prosecutions both owners and operators have shown a desire to co-operate more readily with the requirements of the Act.\n\nThe following is a summary of the work accomplished during the year, along with a comparative summary of work and revenue for the years 1938-39 and 1939-40:\n\n| Type of Boiler or Pressure Vessel Inspected | 1938-39 | 1939-40 |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Horizontal Return Tubular                  | 399     | 398     |\n| Horizontal Furnace                          | 61      | 52      |\n| Water tube                                  | 142     | 170     |\n| Locomotive Type                             | 834     | 930     |\n| Vertical                                    | 151     | 257     |\n| Air Receivers                               | 1,493   | 1,449   |\n| Ammonia Receivers (Rfg.

A number of new oil wells were drilled to completion during the year, and one large oil refinery made extensive additions to its plant.\n\nAn increase of approximately 1,500 employees was noted in industries inspected this year over the year ending March 31st, 1939.\n\nAccident Prevention.\n\nFor many years past there has been a marked improvement in the attitude of employers and employees alike towards the factory inspectors and their endeavours to eliminate hazards found in the ordinary factory and workshop.\n\nEmployers this year have again increased their requests for advice as to the best manner of eliminating hazards when machinery is being erected or moved to new locations. Inspectors have been called in for the purpose of meeting with Safety Committees in plants, and such meetings invariably prove beneficial to the employees of such plants.\n\nSpecial attention has been given this year by one of our inspectors to the drilling of oil wells, and it is gratifying to note that during the year, while there has been an increase in the number of wells drilled, there has been a decrease in the number of accidents sustained by workmen in this class of employment.\n\nDuring the year there were 1,964 recommendations made relative to safety, and with the exception of recommendations made during the month of March, this Branch has been advised that the recommendations have been carried out.\n\nHealth.\n\nThe installation of ventilating systems in the workshops of garages has been the most contentious matter dealt with during the past year. It has been found that after the installation of modern ventilating systems in some garages that it becomes a problem to have workmen keep such systems in operation while they are carrying on the ordinary course of their employment. Recently one\nsystem was found to be closed down while an automobile engine was running in the garage and being allowed to exhaust into the open shop. Inspectors are ever watchful in their inspections around garages, and often warn employees of the hazard that exists from carbon monoxide gas found in such places.\n\nRecommendations continue to be made relative to good housekeeping practice as well as to the providing of adequate toilet and wash-room facilities for the use of employees in factories and shops. In all, 112 health recommendations have been made during the past year, and this branch has been advised that these recommendations have been completed.\n\nChild Labour.\n\nAgain we are pleased to report that during the year no children were found to be employed in any place of business to which the provisions of The Factory Act apply, nor were any requests made or permits requested for the employment of children in any capacity.\n\nInspections.\n\nCalgary inspectors made periodic visits to Lethbridge and Medicine Hat. Six visits were made to Lethbridge and four to Medicine Hat. The Calgary inspectors looked after the Turner Valley inspections as well as other points in the southern part of the Province.\n\nAn interchange of inspection reports has been maintained with the Workmen's Compensation Board. Copies of 5,555 factory inspections and 825 elevator inspections have been forwarded to the Board. At the same time we have received copies of reports dealing with matters of interest to this Department, covering 554 places visited by inspectors of the Workmen's Compensation Board.\n\nTable No. 1, which follows, sets forth the number and classification of inspections made, together with the number of employees, male and female, and recommendations made in each classification.\n\nThe heading \"Safety\" denotes recommendations made relative to the guarding of machinery, handrails on stairways, runways, platforms, openings in floors, condition of ladders and scaffolding and free access to fire escapes.\n\nThe heading \"Health\" denotes recommendations made relative to sanitation, ventilation, lighting and housekeeping.\n\n| TABLE No. 1 |\n|-------------|\n| SUMMARY OF INSPECTIONS MADE |\n|-------------|\n| | No. of Inspections | No. of Places Inspected | No. of Employees | No. of Female Employees | Total Persons Employed | Safety Recommendations Made | Health Recommendations Made |\n| Factories | 2,781 | 2,774 | 14,389 | 2,138 | 16,527 | 1,759 | 79 |\n| Shops | 2,691 | 2,688 | 8,355 | 4,464 | 12,816 | 195 | 33 |\n| Office Buildings | 93 | 98 | 222 | 45 | 267 | 10 | |\n| Totals | 5,565 | 5,555 | 22,963 | 6,647 | 29,610 | 1,964 | 112 |\n\nPassenger and Freight Elevators.\n\nThe installation of interlocks on passenger and freight elevators in accordance with Provincial Elevator Regulations has now been\npractically completed. In the City of Medicine Hat there were two elevators that were being operated without interlocking gates at March 31st, 1940. The material necessary to bring these elevators up to Provincial Elevator Regulations was on the premises, and workmen were expected within the next few days to proceed with the installation of this equipment.\n\nThe installation of proper landing gates and interlocks on passenger and freight elevators was commenced during the year 1937; this work is almost complete. The Department has received, almost without exception, whole-hearted co-operation from the owners of buildings in bringing their elevators up to the standard of safety required by the Provincial regulations.\n\nThere were 14 new elevators installed during the year as follows: 3 escalators, 3 passenger elevators, 7 power freight elevators, 1 power dumb-waiter elevator.\n\nThere were 825 inspections of elevators made, and of this number 164 were special or requested inspections. During the year 5 elevators were condemned for future use as elevators, and 6 were found to have been dismantled or scrapped. During the course of their inspections, inspectors found 70 elevators that were not being operated when the plants in which they were located were visited.\n\nTable No. 2, which follows, contains information relative to the number of elevator inspections made, classification of such elevators inspected, and the number of recommendations made in each class.\n\n| Class of Elevator Inspected | No. Insp. | No. Rec. |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| Escalator                   | 7         | 4        |\n| Passenger                   | 188       | 207      |\n| Power Freights              | 345       | 624      |\n| Manually Operated Freights  | 56        | 118      |\n| Employee's Belt Lift or Humphries | 20     | 28       |\n| Power Dumb-waiter           | 25        | 20       |\n| Not Being Operated          | 70        | 3        |\n| Condemned                   | 5         | 1        |\n| Dismantled or Scrapped      | 6         |          |\n| Reinspection: Passenger     | 13        |          |\n| Manual                      | 777       | 9        |\n| Humphrey                    | 11        | 1        |\n| Dumb-waiter                 | 2         |          |\n\nTOTAL 825 1,015\n\nNumber of Special or Requested Inspections, 107.\n\nTHE TRADESMEN'S QUALIFICATION ACT\n\nWelders.\n\nThe early part of the year was utilized in drafting regulations and the necessary forms for administration purposes. A large amount of time was also spent in drawing up examination papers required for the different classifications of welders. Papers for journeymen, provisional and special welders engaged in gas or electric processes or both were necessary. A total of 30 sets was considered the minimum to cope with the volume of candidates expected. A considerable amount of equipment and materials were selected and purchased for the purpose of conducting practical tests, and arrangements were made at various points in the Province for facilities and space in which to hold examinations and conduct practical tests.\nExaminations commenced in the month of July in Edmonton and continued at various points to the end of the year. A summary of the places visited and the number of candidates examined, and the number of practical tests supervised are as follows:\n\nEdmonton 1\u2014July 7, 1939, to September 1, 1939; 89 candidates and 117 practical tests.\n\nCalgary 1\u2014September 9, 1939, to November 25, 1939; 126 candidates and 166 practical tests.\n\nEdmonton 2\u2014November 29, 1939, to January 4, 1940; 69 candidates and 75 practical tests.\n\nCalgary 2\u2014January 13, 1940, to February 3, 1940; 34 candidates and 34 practical tests.\n\nDrumheller 1\u2014February 14, 1940, to March 12, 1940; 55 candidates and 72 practical tests.\n\nCalgary 3\u2014March 21, 1940, to March 31, 1940; 17 candidates and 23 practical tests.\n\nA total of 390 candidates were examined. This involved the marking of 487 papers and the examination of the results of a large number of practical tests. This does not include the supervision and examination of a number of candidates as pressure vessel welders under The Steam Boilers Act.\n\nOut of the above total of welders examined under The Tradesmen\u2019s Qualification Act, there were 53 failures. These were as follows: 17 Journeymen, 34 Special, 1 Provisional.\n\nThe largest percentage of failures in the Specials were by candidates who wrote for a General Plant Maintenance Certificate and failed, but were recommended for a certificate restricting them to welding in the particular plant in which they were employed. Eighteen applicants were not allowed to undertake examination due to insufficient practical experience.\n\nWhile there has been slackness in some quarters in complying with the regulations, welders and their employers have on the whole given the Department every assistance and co-operation in enforcing the new regulations.\n\nIt is, however, evident that some changes are required in the Act. Employers should be made liable for employing non-certificated welders and more severe penalties should be imposed on non-certificated men engaged in welding. It appears desirable that provisions should also be incorporated into the Act to require the registration with the Department of the sale and exchange of new and second-hand welding equipment. This would give the Department information that would permit a more thorough check on places where welding is being conducted. In many cases it would be instrumental in conveying to the purchaser the necessity of having a proper certificate to operate such equipment and acquaint him with the regulations now in effect.\n\nThe trade of welding is recognized as a most important one, both as regards the dangers to the operators and those dependent on the quality of the work performed. The failure of welded structures or of welded equipment may result in serious life and property losses, and for these reasons it is the intention of the Department to ask for more stringent regulation of this industry.\nHIGHWAY TRAFFIC BOARD\n\n(A. CHARD, Chairman; W. T. AIKEN, Secretary)\n\nDuring the year 1939-40 the Board held 16 meetings, including public hearings for bus franchises and conferences with truck and bus operators.
