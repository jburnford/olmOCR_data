P. R., i. e., Prince Albert. We compared the distances between Regina and Prince Albert and Qu'Appelle and Prince Albert, and found the cost of carrying mail by other routes.\n\nWe showed that the difference in distance was only four miles at most, and that the cost would be greater from Regina than from Qu'Appelle. Would there not then be a change proposed at present? It seems very clear, except that the people of Regina are desirous of bringing grist to their own mill. The circumstances are not so powerful in this regard as they are in the trans-missouri route. There are settlements along the present route for at least one hundred miles that would require an independent mail service of its proper character-are affected thereby far past the point that post office beyond. The leader is now in its fourth year and I defy any one to find a single sensation conjuring up more mail business for any one along any of the branches of which have been brought in, particularly with the telegraph route. They could not have more vuolence. They would naturally infer from your article that you are assaill ague, latterly, as to duplicate service over this route.\n\nI express some doubt whether Mr. Davis expressed the opinions advanced in his letter, as he wrote previously to the date of publication of our paper. If he wrote to it in order to get something for his service, or the great importance of the matter, for which he got nothing. Mr. Davis expressed himself very clearly when he asked for the magazine.\n\nThe Leader states that the Levisa Service is the mail boxes being handled by the people of Qu'Appelle that can have no complaints about handling the mails. Everything was done promptly and in proper order; the accommodation hoped for is sufficient for both ends without any reference at all doing the same thing being dealt with. The Prince Albert business men are exposed to many charges, and like their Council members who are badly handled.\n\nPrince Albert March 25th.\n\n\"Somebody\" said saying that \"services\" given by farmers and towns should be better attended for these purposes.\n\nPrince Albert March 26th.\n\nI have seen reports of this\n\n---\n\nOttawa, March 18.\u2014Yesterday Mr. Blake objected to proceeding thus. He objected to proceed with the Land sale motion on the grounds that the motion showed the Secretary of the Government with approval on the Ministry of Governmental affairs moving discussing matters with the French members? \n\nI believe that the fact that a newspaper school doing free Government printing might meet needs as the government itself does not exist. Also, this it is intended to think it, as for nothing straightforward or honest can be expected from it. From this account, though this has been heard of no major amount of new bills, they have been resisted by such opportunity of illustrating their real value, that it is believed that the Canadian Company will be unable to overcome. At each meeting, it has been heard, that it is intended to increase. It is also stated that the company's claims have been increased to meet the situation. It is believed that the Canadian Company will be unable to overcome such opportunity of illustrating their real value, that it is believed that the Canadian Company will be unable to overcome such opportunity of illustrating their real value, that it is believed that the Canadian Company will be unable to overcome such opportunity of illustrating their real value, that it is believed that the Canadian Company will be unable to overcome such opportunity of illustrating their real value, that it is believed that the Canadian Company will be unable to overcome such opportunity of illustrating their real value, that it is believed that the Canadian Company will be unable to overcome\nOUR TERMS.\n\nWe have placed our yearly subscription at the low rate of One Dollar, with the object of encouraging advance payment.

A very pleasant evening was spent in music, address, joking, etc., preceded by the guardianship of Mr. Geo. Huston, steward of the apportionment and recording steward of the circuit.\n\nCONSUMPTION CURED.\n\nAn old physician, retired from practice, having been placed in his hands by a friend, made several experiments on powders. A vegetable remedy for the speedy and certain cure of Consumption was found. A leaf was used to make a decoction, which cured many cases. It may be used as a substitute for the French or English cure, with advantage. The use of the leaves has already been tried, but the results have been good. It is recommended with advantage at this juncture.\n\nSATTLEFORD.\n\nMr. Easie, formerly Indian Agent at Fort Macleod, went to the agency at Biggar, Manitoba.

They always prefer to go together.\n\nTOUCHWOOD.\n\nTO THE EDITOR:\n\nSir)\u2014In a paragraph which appeared this morning in the paper you expressed yourself freely on the improvement in Touchwood. We thought this was a very unnecessary step for you to take, as you are right in calling on the day school at our signal on Moderator's recommendation is canonical and the establishment of a Sunday school pleasing to all who are interested in the education and proper upbringing of the children. We think also that you are mistaken in your statement that this gentleman and other so-called clubbers make such a noise as to disturb others by holding occasional services for them. As far as we know there is only one missionary in the church of England who has done this for the last three or four years, and that is Rev. J. F. Wright, as Lay Reader by the Bishop of Episcopal Church, who lives in Touchwood. It is either at the Past or in the Plain, performing the duty you attribute to another. During all the summer months no attempt is made by the teacher to ensure an effective service; she would be happy to take my directions and attend Sunday; but under present circumstances the question is impracticable.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nyours etc,\n\nTOUCHWOOD.\n\nMissionary at Touchwood Hills Round Plain. March 12th 1886.\n\nMoffat.\n\nON Tuesday evening the Sabbath, a large number of the youthful young folks responded to an invitation from Mrs. Moffat, and as they came rather late there was considerable lapse of time before they could be heard in the chapel when they came in the daytime. Mrs. Moffat desired that they should be counted and the result being so splendid for Niapissings, Sandilands and Alland Heads districts. Dinnings was kept late, and the whistles and calls for the evening meal presently appeared to enjoy themselves immensely. Refreshment was served at six o'clock and the dinner in which they enjoyed themselves immensely. Afterwards they gathered around the fireplaces rendering \"Blue Bells of Scottland\" and that was considered an evening not to be forgotten.\n\nBROADVIEW.\n\nWEDNESDAY evening.\n\nThe first entertainment and evening church meeting were held in the church on Wednesday evening, when there was a good attendance. Mr. W. Millar, headmaster of the public school, conducted the exercises. The midnight hour should be followed up by the monthly examination of students in every district. It was felt, however, that the latter plan required somewhat more attention than what would be required of the former.\n\nMarriage Licenses.\n\nJ MIMMAC\n\nISSUES OF MARRIAGE LICENSES, RAPID CITY\n\nIf you want a Sewing Machine, Organ or Piano, consult\n\nJames Weidman, Agent.\n\nBroadview\n\nKATEFWA.\n\nNatal.\u2014It is reported to us that a few weeks ago a dance was given in connection with the reader, and that many ladies attended the dance.
