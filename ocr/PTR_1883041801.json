The officers connected with the administration of the Dominion Lands Act in the Province of North West and such duties as may be assigned them by the Governor General.\n\nThe Act provides that the Minister of the Interior may arrange to sell them on such terms as he may think fit, and that the exemption may at the same time as his lease is granted, be made subject to the provisions of the Act, and that the Minister may make such regulations as may be necessary for the purpose.\n\nIt is stated that the Marquis of Lorne, upon his return from Canada, will be placed in charge of the Department.\n\nLetters patent have been granted to the Saskatchewan, Gold Mining and Railway Company.\n\nThe last issue of the Canada Gazette contains an application for letters patent for the Appellee Land and Colonization Company.\n\nIn the House of Commons a private bill has been introduced to incorporate the Wood Mountain and Prince Albert Railway.\n\nIt is reported to Ottawa that Mr. Foster, late Chief Secretary for Ireland, is to be the Marquis of Lorne's successor as Governor-General of Canada.\n\nAll the Magazines have included in their columns the news of the selection of Regina as the capital of Assiniboin, and nearly everybody knows that the Marquis of Lorne made such selection. If some strange coincidence the site selected was in close proximity to the town of Regina, and it was a point put up by the Lieutenant-Governor of the North West Territories, and that he has made the selection.\n\nIt is known that Mr. Foster, late Chief Secretary for Ireland, is to be the Marquis of Lorne's successor as Governor-General of Canada.\n\nA good many temporary police are employed in the town, but they do not stop drunkenness, and that people who oppose prohibition, here as elsewhere, are looked upon with suspicion by the police.\n\nAccording to a report from the Department of Agriculture, the total consumption of flour for the first two months of this year was \u00a31,000, and for the corresponding two months of last year, \u00a37,677.\n\nA great many temporary police are employed in the town, but they do not stop drunkenness, and that people who oppose prohibition, here as elsewhere, are looked upon with suspicion by the police.\n\nA full line of Bleached and Grey Cottons, Capes, Blanket Shavings, Lemon Table Cloth, Russia Crab Towelling.\n\nHandkerchiefs\n\nA Choice Assortment of Ladies' and Gent's Silk and Linen Handkerchiefs.\n\nTurkey Red Handkerchiefs.\n\nQuilts\n\nWhite and Colored Quilts in all sizes.\n\nBlankets\n\nWe offer special value in Hudson Bay White Blankets - 2\u00bd, 3\u00bd, 4\u00bd and 5\u00bd.\n\nSmallwares\n\nLinen and Cotton Spoons, Silk Twist, Silk Spools, Buttons, Needles, Pins, etc., etc., etc.\n\nSTEWART AND WOOTTON,\n\nGENERAL MERCHANTS.\n\nFRESH BUTTER\n\nAT Ashdown's\n\nWHOLESALE CLOTHING.\n\nJames O'Brien & Co.,\n\nPrincess Street, Winnipeg.\n\nBUFFALO HALL\n\nOUR STOCK CONSISTS IN PART OF\n\nTEN CASES OF STAPLE & FANCY DRY GOODS\n\nWhich we are now offering at special prices.\n\nFlannels\n\nPlain Grey, Twilled Grey, Navy Blue Twilled, Scarlet Sarsnet, Navy Blue Sarsnet, Corduroy Checkered, Grey Canton\n\nDress Goods\n\nBlack and Colored Cashmeres, Colored Lusters, All Wool French Belges, Rich Brocades, Black Gros Grain Silk, Black and Colored Satins in all shades, Black and Colored Velveteens.\n\nPrints\n\nA full and complete assortment in this line, including Ashton's Celebrated Prints.\n\nYarns\n\nScotch yarns, Canada and Homespun, 1s. 6d.\n\nCottons\n\nHandkerchiefs\n\nQuilts\n\nBlankets\n\nSmallwares\n\nLinens and Cotton Spoons, Silk Twist, Silk Spools, Buttons, Needles, Pins, etc., etc., etc.\n\nFRESH BUTTER\n\nAT Ashdown's\n\nWHOLESALE CLOTHING.\n\nJames O'Brien & Co.,\n\nPrincess Street, Winnipeg.\nITEMS OF INTEREST.\n\nThe Imperial Government has refused to accept the offer of the Prince of Wales to visit Canada.
