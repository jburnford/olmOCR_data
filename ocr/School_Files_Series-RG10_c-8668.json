Upon investigation it was found that the drums were badly burned and caused the smoking.\n\nLast year this same furnace was patched up as a temporary job, but before satisfactory results can be obtained, new drums must be put in.\n\nI have interviewed Mr. A. G. Soeder, local plumber and tinsmith as to the cost and his estimate is attached hereto.\n\nMay I have your permission and authority to proceed with arrangements for the repair of the same as soon as possible, as if it is to be done, it must be done before school starts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 13th instant, in which you seek departmental authority to proceed with certain repairs to the furnace at the Cote Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that these repairs, if undertaken, will cost approximately $120. The officials here doubt very much the wisdom of proceeding with repair work to this amount. This matter has been discussed with the Departmental Purchasing Agent and he states that a new stove can be purchased for approximately the same amount. I am anxious, therefore, that you should send forward at once the fullest possible particulars regarding the dimensions of the furnace, the make of the furnace now in operation and any other particulars you may deem necessary. If you do this, consideration will be given to the advisability of purchasing a new furnace for the Cote School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. J. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nKamsack, Sask.,\nAugust 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of Aug. 19th regarding repairs to the furnace of Cote Indian School.\n\nThe estimate I submitted included an item for labour amounting to $51.00.\n\nThe furnace is an Economy No. 23 made by The Pease Foundry Co. of Toronto.\n\nThe fire box is 21\" X 21\" X 62\u00bd inches\nHeight of furnace 50\u00bd inches\n\nThis furnace is all bricked in and the whole front would have to be removed to install a new furnace, with the exception of the drums and damper, the furnace is in good shape.\n\nMr. A. Soeder, the local plumber, advises that a new furnace, the same as this one would cost approximately $215.00, New brick and labour to install would cost $72.00 in addition.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would recommend that the present furnace be repaired as per my estimate forwarded August 13th.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. R. A.

However, I should like you to secure from Mr. Cotter of Kamsack an estimate on the work. There is nothing on file here to suggest that Mr. A. G. Soeder has been authorized at any time to undertake government contracts. Your immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to request the authority to expend an amount in the neighborhood of $155.00 for purchasing provisions for Cote Indian Day School, necessary for supplying the Indian children with noon lunch. This is the usual amount spent every year. This year our bill might even exceed that owing to increased prices on many articles.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nKamsack, Sask.,  \nAug. 31, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter 117-2-5 of Aug. 26th, instructing me to secure from Mr. Cotter an estimate of cost of repairing the Cote Indian Day School furnace.\n\nI have today interviewed Mr. Cotter in this matter and he states that he prefers not to submit any tenders for this job. He is a plumber and not a tinsmith by trade and believes there is more tinsmithing in this repair job than he would like to undertake.\n\nIn view of this I would recommend that a tender submitted by Mr. Soeder be accepted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 6, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo you may arrange with Mr. A. G. Soeder to make the necessary repairs to the furnace at the Cote Indian Day School. It is noted that the expenditure involved will be $118.75.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 6, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo requesting authority to expend $165.00 for purchasing provisions for the Cote Indian Day School.\n\nThe amount provided in previous years at the Cote School was much larger than that allowed at other Indian day schools throughout Canada. This was due to the fact that we were aware that some children were being kept all week and as a result strong representations were made for us to provide at least part of the cost of their food.\n\nIn view of the fact that the practice of keeping children will be discontinued in future it is felt that $75.00 is all that the Department can allow for midday lunch purposes at the Cote School during the academic year 1940-41.\n\nIt should only be necessary to supply a midday lunch during the winter months and in view of the number of children in attendance it is considered that the amount mentioned above is reasonable and in line with what is allowed at other Indian day schools where a midday lunch is served.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J.

L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent,\nPelly Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Bryant:\n\nI note with much concern the recent decision of\nthe Department to reduce the hot noon meal appropriation\nfor Cote Day School from $165 to $75.\n\nWhile I realize the necessity for economy in\norder to further our war effort, yet I consider that the\nreduction is much too drastic in view of present crop\nconditions on the reserve, which as you know are the poorest\nin many years. The potato crop in the school garden is only\nabout 1/3 of normal and of poor quality while other\nvegetables are correspondingly poor, and it will be necessary\nto purchase a considerable quantity of potatoes to provide\nsufficient for the children and for seed next spring.\n\nThe attendance is expected to be considerably\nabove last year which will necessitate a greater quantity of\nfood and I do not feel justified in decreasing the amount per\nchild as they are always ravenously hungry for the noon meal,\nindicating that this is the only substantial meal they receive\nduring the day.\n\nWith the appropriation cut to $75 it means that\nthe meat and soup portion of the meal will have to be almost\neliminated, as the meat bill alone last year amounted to\napproximately $70. The fact that the former practice of\nkeeping a number of boarding pupils during the week has been\ndiscontinued does not decrease the meat requirement as no\nmeat or soup was served to these pupils for breakfast or\nsupper.\n\nI also note that the Department speak of having\nthe noon meal served during the cold weather only. Now this\nwould mean much less work for the staff but I would strongly\nadvise against this plan as I feel that many children would\nsuffer from malnutrition if they were denied the hot midday\nmeal and were forced to subsist on bannock and tea. The\nfact that the cost of living has risen during the past year\nalso makes it increasingly difficult to carry on with a\nreduced allowance.\n\nI should be very glad, Mr. Bryant, if you would bring these facts to the knowledge of the Department.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd.) L.L. Dobbin,\nTeacher.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer you to your letter File #117-2-5 of September 6th regarding a reduction in the amount to be expended in the purchase of provisions for Cote Indian Day School for the coming year.\n\nI might say that one or two Indian families are not taking very kindly to the idea of discontinuing keeping their children at the school from Monday until Friday, and if the noon meal is discontinued except in cold weather it would add to the difficulties.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Dobbins's letter for your perusal, which I think explains the situation clearly and accurately. There is no doubt the noon meal is much appreciated and very helpful to the children. Meat prices are also higher this year which also applies to many lines of groceries. Under the circumstances I would respectfully recommend that the matter be reconsidered and that at least $100.00 be allowed for midday lunch purposes at the Cote School for the academic year 1940-41.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

The expenditure required by this requisition is strictly unavoidable and the public interest will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED\n\nGENERAL SUPERINTENDENT OF INDIAN AGENCIES\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6282, file 604-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI wish to inform you that while at the Pelly Agency, Kamsack, I visited the above institution.\n\nUpon checking over the register I found that there were 28 children on the roll, of which 19 were present at the time of my visit. The average attendance is around 20.\n\nBuilding and Grounds\n\nI noticed that everything around the School and premises was in good order and the building and fences were in good state of repair. I consider that the teacher, Mr. L.L. Dobbin, is an exceptionally able man. He takes a great interest in gardening and the pupils maintain a garden in the Summer that is a credit to anybody. I noticed in going through the basement of the School that he had potatoes and all kinds of vegetables they had raised last Summer. I also discovered that sewing was being taught to the girls by Mrs. Dobbin.\n\nChildren\n\nI spoke to the children in their classrooms and although they all live at home, this being a Day School, they appeared to be healthy and well clad.\n\nProblems\n\nHere are a few of the problems Mr. Dobbin brought to my attention.\n\n(1) Milk - As you are aware, this School is situated only a few hundred yards from the Agency and in the past they have been obtaining milk from the Agency as several cows were kept there but under the new regulations we are disposing of some of the cows, therefore as Agent Bryant, who was with me, stated, they cannot expect to get all the milk they require. There is no stable at the School and I advised Mr. Dobbin that I could ask for a cow but I did not know whether the Department would supply this or not. Also, if one were supplied I advised him that he could keep it at the Agency barn as there would be lots of room there but he would have to look after the animal himself.\n\nTransportation - There is also.......\n(2) Transportation - There is also the transportation problem in Winter. The School is situated 6 miles from town and having no stable they do not keep a horse. They therefore have to depend on transportation from the Agency or by hiring an Indian. I made it quite clear to Mr. Dobbin that we could not guarantee to let him have a horse or a team from the Agency to go into town when he wanted to but we would co-operate with him wherever possible because you can readily understand that under the new regulations only two teams are kept at the Agency, one for the Farming Instructor and one for the Agent. Of course this problem only presents itself during the Winter when there is a lot of snow. At the present time they are able to get back and forth with a car as there is practically no snow there. I just thought I would let you know that this was brought up during my visit because it was evidently Mr. Dobbin's idea that the Agent would have to furnish him with transportation.\n\n(3) Water\n\n- The water is also a great problem here. This has to be hauled from St. Philips, a distance of 6 miles and this has been carried by the Labourer at the Agency. Now we are dispensing with the services of the Labourer and therefore arrangements will have to be made to haul the water. We are keeping the two tanks the water was hauled in and the School Branch will be charged for their portion of the expense of engaging someone to haul the water. I would, however, recommend that a 50 bbl. water tank be put in the basement of the school so that they can save more rain water and I am herewith attaching a Requisition for this. If this is allowed I can arrange for the installation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christenson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6282, file 604-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJanuary 23, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to your recent visit to the Cote Bay School.\n\nIt is not the practice of the Department to supply milk to teachers of Indian day schools and consequently it is unnecessary to make any arrangements for Mr. Dobbin. He will have to make his own arrangements regarding his supply of milk.\n\nWhat has been said above applies to transportation of the teacher from the school to the town. In this case also Mr. Dobbin will have to make his own arrangements.\n\nWe do not appear to have any recent correspondence on our file regarding the water situation. Is it necessary to transport drinking water only or water for all purposes? What monthly expenditure would be required to transport the water required?\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nSaskatoon & Victoria,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 117-2-1 of the 21st instant in connection with the Cote Improved Indian Day School and I note that it is not the practice of the Department to supply milk to the teacher of an Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I wish to say that the milk in question was not for the School teacher, it was for the children who are attending the School, and when Mr. Dobbin was speaking about a cow he did not have himself in mind at all.\n\nI also note what you have to say about the transportation of the teacher from the School to the town, that is, he will have to make his own arrangements. I just want to inform you here that people in Western Canada do not treat their neighbors in the manner you suggest, that is that the teacher will have to do without milk and if he wants to go to town he will just have to make the best arrangements possible. This School was built 27 years ago and is situated right beside the Agency. Ever since it was built the people at the Agency have tried to co-operate in every way and help the School along. You, I know, do not realize how lonely it is to be stranded on an Indian Reserve 6 miles from the nearest white neighbor. Naturally the Agency Staff, which consists of three white families, can make it so much more pleasant for the teacher and his wife when everyone is agreeable. Therefore every Agent who has been there has supplied the School with all the milk they required for the children that could be spared, even if it is not a very great amount. The same thing applies in connection with the teacher from the School getting into town once in a while. When I was there we had no cars but we always made it possible some way or another for the two women who were there at that time to get into Kamsack when they could not get an Indian to take them in. Also the people at the Agency have always brought their mail out to them in addition to what groceries and other supplies they needed from town.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nI have read over..........................\nI have just read over my letter to you and wish to say further that I was not asking for a horse for the teacher, I was just telling you about the conversation that took place between myself and the teacher.\n\nRegarding the water used at the School, every drop has been hauled by the Labourer at the Agency with the exception of rain water, and that is why I asked for an extra tank in order to be able to preserve more rain water than at the present time. The School has a large roof surface and if we had another barrel they could probably save enough water in the Summer to have sufficient water for scrubbing, etc., and it would only be necessary to haul the drinking water. This has to be hauled a distance of 6 miles and when we make arrangements in the Spring with some Indian to haul water for the School and the Agency we will advise you what the cost will be to the School. Remember, for 27 years you have been getting off without paying anything. In the meantime I want you to give consideration to the tank that was requested.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nMC/ed General Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nCopy sent to Mr. Christianson\n\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1948.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your recent visit to the Department you may arrange for the purchase and installation of a fifty-barrel water tank in the teacher's residence at the Cote Indian Day School.\n\nI understand that a small wooden platform will be required on which to place the tank. This work is also approved. In carrying out this improvement it is expected that you will keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\n| Date   | Description                                      | Amount |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| June   | 26/41 Paris green                                | .40    |\n| Sep    | 27/41 3 yds binding                              | .75    |\n| Oct    | 18/41 lock; 70\u00a2; socket 35\u00a2                       | 1.05   |\n| Nov    | 22/41 Repairs to lock                            | .35    |\n| Dec    | 13/41 10 ft. drop cord, 30\u00a2; socket 50\u00a2          | .90    |\n|        | Valves leather, 12\u00a2; leather 15\u00a2                 | .27    |\n| Jan    | 7/42 Sand paper                                  | .15    |\n|        | 25/42 Drop cord, 10\u00a2; tacks, 10\u00a2; glass 35\u00a2      | .63    |\n\nTotal: $4.40\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO**\nPoveshell Hardware Limited,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\n**ADDRESS**\n\n**Polly Agency**\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Feb 1 | To sundry fixtures supplied for Goto Day School, as per attached statement. | 4.40 |\n\n**TRIPLICATE FOR FILE**\n\n*Voucher in duplicate detached for Accountant to pay.*\n\n**TOTAL**\n\n4.40\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n---\n\nFORM No. I.A. 566\n\nR. 384\n\nVoucher No.\n\n**CLERK IN CHARGE**\n\nFebruary 16, 1942\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will note that a great deal of this amount is for hauling water and putting up ice, etc. Under the item of $120.00 for hauling water for the Agency and school, one third of this, namely $40.00, should be charged to the school. There is also an amount of $25.00 included for fencing at the school.\n\nThe amount of water that will have to be hauled for the Agency cistern depends on the amount of rainfall during the Summer and from all indications it looks as if we are going to have plenty of rain this year. During the time I spent at Pelly last week it rained practically all the time.\n\nThe water situation here is no worse than when I went out to this same Agency twenty-eight years ago. At that time I got permission to put down a well just below the barn. We struck water at 37' but went down another 13', making the well 50' deep in all. This was a board well, 24\", cribbed with planks, and the pump we used in it was an old wooden type; therefore the cost was not very extensive. However, this is what has happened. At the 37' level, when putting down the well, we struck a layer of gravel and sand, and it was from this sand and gravel that the water came. The sand and gravel continually filtering down in the well finally filled it up and closed off the water supply, and I do not suppose that a well has been put down since. The water was not fit for human consumption but was alright for cattle and horses.\n\nIn view of the above I presume that the water is still there only it has not been tapped since. However, this is only a guess on my part. I would think that it would pay us to put down another 50' well and I see no reason why we should not.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOnt.,\n\nstrike water. While I was\nstrike water. While I was at the Agency I located the approximate place where I put down the well 28 years ago. At that time we did not have cisterns in the houses, and in fact the present Agency house was built by me while I was there. We hauled water for washing purposes from the creek west of the Agency, which is a distance of about half a mile but during the dry years this creek was dry. However, there is water in it once more at the present time. To obtain water for drinking and domestic use we put up ice during the winter and each family kept a barrel tank in the kitchen. By keeping this tank filled with ice it melted fast enough to supply our needs. The same method was followed at the school. They have sufficient tanks in the basement to store rain water for all domestic use and ice would only have to be hauled for human consumption. If this plan were followed an ice house would have to be erected for the school next winter and probably the same thing would have to be done at the Agency as at present they keep their ice in a shed. This is hardly the proper place to store ice.\n\nMr. Bryant has promised to get me a price on putting down a well at the Agency as I am sure there are some machines still at work in the vicinity of Ramsack, and I shall get in touch with you when I hear from him.\n\nSome items in Mr. Bryant's statement of expenditure for casual labour come under freight. Another item comes under roads, and the matter of cleaning chimneys would come under repairs to buildings. Putting on storm windows would also come under repairs to buildings. There is also the question of whether the employees should plough their own gardens, or are we responsible for this?\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd M. Christianson,\n\nM.

As it happens there are times when the office facilities are not available due to us being closed here, and I think it is quite necessary that this facility be made available for them.\n\nThere is one strand of wire already connecting the school and the agent's house, but another strand must be put on in order to be able to call the central. The total cost of connecting the school and the wire will cost approximately $12.00\n\nKindly advise if I may proceed with having this work done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 11, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Cote Day School telephone\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, in which you intimate that a request has reached you from the teachers of the above-noted school for the installation of a telephone in the teachers' residence.\n\nThe records here indicate that we have not, at any time, paid for the installation of telephones in teachers' residences and only in one or two exceptional cases have we paid for the installation of electricity. In view of the policy that has been followed, I hesitate to make an exception in this case. We are, however, as you know, experiencing the utmost difficulty in securing the teachers necessary to operate our schools. I am disposed to think, therefore, in view of the comparatively small amount of money involved, that you might assist the teachers to install this particular telephone. It should be definitely understood, however, that the Department is not committing itself to such expenditures at other schools from which requisitions for such installations may be received in the future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Since, the prices of the food products have gone up considerably. Meat, the Indian staple diet, has more than doubled in price, while all other products have gone up from 30% to 80%. The amounts allotted for noon day meals would hardly be adequate, and it would be very much appreciated if the Department would grant an extra allowance to compensate for the rise. It has been suggested that Key be allowed $75.00 and Cote, $150.00.\n\nKindly advise me as to the amounts made available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 24, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, it has been decided to allow an amount of $110.00 at the Cote Day School and an amount of $60.00 at the Key Day School for purchase of supplies for midday meal purposes during the current academic year. I am not certain if school gardens were cultivated at the schools during the past summer but, if not, they should be next year. It is very important that vegetables should be available to be used for midday meal purposes. Their use will not only save money but is very advisable for dietary reasons.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.L.

Welfare & Training, Ottawa.\n\nRe Cote pay school\n\nIt has been very difficult to heat the School room during very cold weather and I have had Mr Barrie of Pelly check up and he recommends some repairs that he estimates will cost $39.25 for labour and material. His letter is attached.\n\nThere are also some minor repairs necessary at the school such as doors, windows, steps into the school and railings on the landings, door locks, and electric light switches, also three outhouses should be repaired. I would estimate that the total cost will be approximately $30.00. I have already had the light switches and wiring put in order.\n\nI wrote to Mr Christianson about the furnace and other repairs and he advised that the matter be taken up direct with the department.\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nEX'D A\n\nOttawa, September 22, 1943.\n\nMr. J. L.

It is noted that these repairs will cost approximately $69.00.\n\nI must express regret that the need for these repairs has not been brought to the attention of the Department until this comparatively late date. It is of the utmost importance that repairs at our Indian day schools should be undertaken and completed during the regular vacation period. You are authorized, therefore, to take steps necessary to have these repairs undertaken and completed at the earliest possible date.\n\nI am returning herewith the quotation received by you from J.

Welfare & Training, Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Cote Day School\n\nConsiderable repair work of a minor nature, such as windows, screens, screen doors, steps, toilets, etc. should be undertaken this month before school opens. The interior of the school room has not been done over for several years, and the woodwork should be varnished. Some of the floors upstairs also require a filler coat and a coat of paint or varnish.\n\nI would estimate that with Indian labour the cost for labour and material would be approximately $150.00. Much more could be done but this will put the building in fair shape for this year.\n\nSome repair work should be done on the furnace and pipes but there is no tinsmith available in the district and it would appear that this work will have to be deferred until a later date. The material will include glass, lumber, screen wire, paint and varnish, and could be purchased locally as required.\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 9, 1944.\n\nMr. J.L.

I would recommend that the Department increase the allotment to about $150.00 for Cote and $75.00 for Key.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 17, 1945.\n\nMr. J. L. Bryant, Indian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the amounts available for midday meals at the Cote and Key Indian Day Schools.\n\nFor the academic year 1945-46 the Department is prepared to allow the same amounts as last year, namely, $110.00 at the Cote School and $60.00 at the Key School.\n\nWe are not discontinuing the making of allowances for midday meals, but it is reasonable to expect that in view of the payment of family allowances the children will have better food and should bring to the school more food than formerly for their midday lunch. Under these circumstances, the Department is not inclined to grant the increase that you suggest.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: George Whitehawk,\n\nAddress: Indian Agent,\n\nKamsack, Sask.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | To putting the Cote Day School yard | 3.00   |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Bryant,\nPelly Agency,\nKAMSACK, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Bryant:\n\nI quite understand that there is a shortage of food all over the earth and we must all do our share in saving, but nevertheless I would like to make a request that the food allowance from the Department for this school be increased by $30/- or at least raised to its former level of $125/-\n\nThe improvements the British made in India only served to increase its population and they are still poor. In the same way the Family Allowance has served to increase our numbers in school attendance, so that we have twice the number we had last year. 200 days with an average of at least 22 will mean 4466 meals.\n\nIt was decided, was it not, not to do away with this noon meal in Indian Day Schools, and judging by my own experience of a rural school and a long walk morning and evening, I think that was wise. These children are looking much healthier and much more full of vigor than if they spent the day on a piece of bannock. They have a very simple meal here at noon. In fact we do not begin to use all the coupons on the permits for sugar, butter and meat allowed us by the Wartime Prices and Trade board. But even in this well-regulated Canada prices are high.\n\nWe find our finances strained to meet this exigency for they will continue to get the same amount of food. We should be very grateful indeed if our request were favourably considered.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher.\nKamsack, Saskatchewan,\nMarch 22, 1946.\n\nPhilip Phelan Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA.\n\nI am attaching herewith a letter received from Miss Robertson, Cote Day School Teacher, wherein she requests an increase of the noon day meal allowance of $30.00 if possible, but that at least $125.00 be allowed for the academic year 1945-1946.\n\nThere is no doubt there has been considerable increase in school attendance, and that much more food is now required for the noon day meal than in previous years.\n\nIt has never been the custom at Cote Day school for the children to bring lunches, and personally I think it is much the most satisfactory arrangement, as long as the allowance is sufficient to cover the cost. Now all the children get a good hot wholesome meal regardless of home conditions, and the teacher has no bother in looking after lunch boxes.\n\nI trust that you will favourably consider this slight increase for this year, then if necessary some other arrangement can be worked out for the next term.\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 27, 1946.\n\nMr. J. L. Bryant, Indian Agent,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, the Department will allow an additional amount of $30.00 for midday meal purposes at the Cote School for the current academic year. It should be distinctly understood that in granting this increased amount it is not to form a precedent for future years.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nLIGHT AND POWER DEPARTMENT\n\nKamsack, Sask.

It was only when the clerk checked accounts with him that it was discovered that the account has never been paid. It amounted to $48.58, but Miss Robertson, the teacher gave a personal cheque in the amount of $32.59 reducing it to $15.99. She did this realizing that the account encumbered for that purpose may have been closed out and hoping that she could help to have this account settled.\n\nI do not know if we should expect the teachers to provide supplies for the school out of their own pocket and I am sure she would appreciate it very much if she were reimbursed.\n\nJ.

The building was erected in 1915 and appears to be structurally sound and in good condition. At the time of the inspection, new plumbing and a water supply system was being installed.\n\nThe building is equipped with a gravity warm air heating system which does not function satisfactorily. The furnace is a wood burning type and while it may have been considered large enough for the original requirements, as far as heat output is concerned the piping distribution system evidences questionable design. This is borne out by the fact that all attempts to improve the distribution of heat have proved to be unsuccessful; and the teaching staff reported that they have experienced continual discomfort due to low temperatures within the building.\n\nThe character of the building, its shape and size, all tend to make it an extremely difficult proposition to heat by a gravity warm air system. The furnace shows definite signs of wear and tear and no purpose would be served by attempting repairs.\n\nIt is our recommendation that the present heating system be removed and replaced with a forced warm air system. When instructions are received to proceed with the design, and when the drawings and specifications have been executed, it will be possible to provide a fairly close estimate of the cost. In the meantime, it is felt that an amount of $1500.00 to $2000.00 should be sufficient to carry out this project.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 5, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Cote Day School, Pelly Indian Agency,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have received your memorandum of May 3rd in connection with the visit of your heating engineer to the above school.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would arrange to have drawings and specifications prepared for the type of heating equipment that your engineer considers necessary. Incidentally, it is hoped that the equipment will not be as expensive as estimated in the last paragraph of the memorandum from Chief Engineer Mills.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPP/MGD\n| Item          | Quantity | Price |\n|--------------|----------|-------|\n| Bread        | 6        | 68    |\n| Apples       | 3        | 32    |\n| Bread        | 2        | 24    |\n| Salt         | 5        | 15    |\n| Powdered Milk| 50       | 15.00 |\n| Wheat Flats  | 7        | 49    |\n| Figs         | 2        | 25    |\n| Baking Powder| 2        | 69    |\n| Cocoa        | 1        | 44    |\n| Custard Powder| 3      | 30    |\n| Salt         | 10       | 30    |\n| Sugar        | 10       | 105   |\n| Wheat Flats  | 7        | 49    |\n| Split Peas   | 6        | 90    |\n| Chilis       | 2        | 25    |\n| Macaroni     | 5        | 60    |\n| Onions       | 6        | 25    |\n| Bread        | 6        | 68    |\n\n| Item          | Quantity | Price |\n|--------------|----------|-------|\n| Sugar        | 10       | 105   |\n| C Syrup      | 10       | 160   |\n| Macaroni     | 6        | 60    |\n| Pot Barley   | 6        | 60    |\n| Onions       | 80       | 395   |\n| Carrots      | 5        | 50    |\n| Red Apples   | 3        | 140   |\n| Shortening   | 7        | 105   |\n| Wheat Flats  | 1        | 49    |\n| Tomato Puree | 1        | 95    |\n| Salt         | 2        | 20    |\n| Carrots      | 2        | 25    |\n| Carrots      | 2        | 25    |\n\nTotal: $13.39\n| Terms | Description     | Quantity |\n|-------|-----------------|----------|\n| 5\u00a2    | Macaroni        |          |\n| 7\u00a2    | Wheat Flakes    |          |\n| 10\u00a2   | Cocoa           |          |\n| 5\u00a2    | Salt            |          |\n| 3\u00a2    | Soup Mix        |          |\n| 6\u00a2    | Ration Book     |          |\n| 1\u00a2    | Cattup          |          |\n| 6\u00a2    | Sugar           |          |\n| 10\u00a2   | Pinhas          |          |\n| 6\u00a2    | Ev Apples       |          |\n| 10\u00a2   | Macaroni        |          |\n\n| Terms | Description     | Quantity |\n|-------|-----------------|----------|\n| 1\u00a2    | Molasses        |          |\n| 10\u00a2   | Macaroni        |          |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bryant, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Kamsack, Sask.\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th instant regarding the Cote School.\n\nFollowing his return to Ottawa, Mr. Hargreaves prepared a specification regarding the heating system that he considers is necessary for this school and this information is now before the Purchasing Branch in order to arrange the necessary purchase.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that before the furnace is installed, you consider a basement floor should be installed at a cost of $150.00 and you may arrange to have this work done.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nMr. Hargreaves of the engineering staff inspected the heating system at this school and advised a new furnace and also that the ceiling and outside walls of the class room be insulated. Mr. Hargreaves has no doubt made a report to you in this regard. He did not give me an estimate of the cost. Before a new furnace is installed the cement basement floor should be repaired at a cost of approximately $150.00.\n\nThis is a well constructed building generally in good repair, but the heating system has never been satisfactory. In very cold weather it is almost impossible to heat the class room. In fact it is quite common to see the children working in their overcoats in order to keep warm.\n\nI would strongly recommend that the new furnace and insulation be attended to before fall.\n\nJ. L.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nRegina, July 9th, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nMrs. Menzies, of Regina, who is active in the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada, informs me that her Church is supplying a new car for the use of their Missionaries at the Cote Reserve in their work amongst the Indians.\n\nApparently Mrs. Menzies has information to the effect that a car purchased in this manner is not subject to sales tax and education tax. Please advise me whether or not this is a fact, as I have heard nothing in connection therewith.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA - Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary -\n\nDuring my visit to Saskatchewan I arrived at the Cote Reserve during 'Treaty' week. It was a great experience to see 104 wigwams housing the Indians - a most colourful sight and everyone seemed to be enjoying the experience.\n\nAs you know, we have an excellent teacher and Matron in the Cote School but our Matron is handicapped in her visiting because of transportation and our Society has placed in its estimate sufficient money to purchase a car. In a letter from the teacher, Miss Winnifred Johnson, it is her understanding that Government employees have priority in the purchase of cars and she also believes there is a tax reduction as well.\n\nWe are now in a position to purchase this car and we would appreciate your assistance if a reduction and priority can be arranged. The type of car which we would desire would be a small one and high enough in build to ride the ruts over the Indian trails.\n\nWe should appreciate hearing from you in this regard.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMrs. C. Maxwell Loveys\nHome Mission Executive Secretary.\nAugust 5th, 1948.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nYour letter dated July 9th, File #1325-310-11, has been referred to the undersigned for attention but in reply I would advise you that this office is not in a position to request any special consideration with regard to the purchase of cars by Missionaries or School Teachers.\n\nIn fact the purchase price of cars purchased by the Department for official use includes sales tax.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nSuperintendent of Welfare.\nAugust 6, 1948.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant, Supt. Indian Agency, Kamsack, Sask.,\n\nWith reference to our letter of July 28th regarding the obtaining of prices for supplying a furnace for the Cote School, we would appreciate it if you could let us know as soon as possible if you have obtained any quotations. Mr. Hargreaves of the Lands and Development Services Branch intends to leave Ottawa at the end of next week for a trip to Western Canada and before leaving he would like any information available regarding the securing of the furnace.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nPP/EM.\nEXD.\n\nAIR MAIL.\n\nAugust 6, 1948.\n\nDear Mrs. Loveys:\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 9th regarding the purchase of a car for the matron at the Cote School, I regret that we are not in a position to request any special consideration in the purchasing of cars. As a matter of fact, we pay sales tax on cars that we purchase for the use of Departmental officials.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. C. Maxwell Loveys,\nExecutive Secretary,\nWomen's Missionary Society\nof the United Church of Canada,\n412-413 Wesley Buildings,\nToronto 2B, Ontario.\n\nPP/HH.\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\nAugust 9th, 1948.\n\nBernard F. Neary Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of July 28th, and August 6th, 1948, regarding the obtaining of prices for supplying a new heating system for Cote Bay School.\n\nI went to Yerxton on August 2nd, and interviewed all three plumbing and tinsmith firms, W. H. Carter, Fred Steel and E. G. Lang & Co. of that city, but all had more work contracted for than they could complete this year unless they are able to obtain more skilled help. E. G. Lang & Co. have had an add in several papers for over three months for a tinsmith and have not had one applicant. I also called on Taylor & Co. in Roblin, they have three tinsmiths employed and also have more work arranged for than they can handle this season.\n\nM. Finnie of Kamsack, is sending in his tender today. There has been a few days delay as he had to wait to get prices on the furnace and material from his wholesaler in Winnipeg.\n\nIt is possible that there may be some firm in Dauphin, Manitoba, that would submit a tender, but this appears very doubtful as there is so much building going on in all districts. However, I expect to be at Timberton this week and will go on to Dauphin, and find out what the prospects are. Mr. Finnie is a good workman, is a local man and his tender should not be higher than an outside firm, if it were possible to get someone to submit a tender.\n\nI have advised Mr. Finnie that I expect other firms to submit tenders for the work.\n\nJ.

Finnie who is carrying out heating revisions at the above.\n\nMr. Finnie reports that with the exception of a few registers which have not yet been delivered to the job, the work is complete and that the system has been in operation for about three weeks. He requests that a payment of at least one half the contract price be forwarded to him.\n\nIt is felt that this request is in order, and it is therefore recommended that the Indian Affairs Branch should forward a cheque to him for the amount asked for.\n\nD.M. Mackay, Esq.,\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nT.S. Mills.\nChief Engineer.\n14th January, 1949.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to official letter of 3rd September, 1948, regarding acceptance of tender of A.M. Finnie to install a heating system in the Cote Residential School, we are now advised by the Lands and Development Services Branch that with the exception of a few registers which have not yet been delivered, the work is complete and the system has been in operation for about 3 weeks, and it is recommended that a payment of at least half of the contract price be made.\n\nAs you are aware, the total of the contract was $2,493.00, and you should forward a Voucher for half that amount and immediate payment will be made. We would like a report from you if the system is satisfactorily working.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\nJanuary 11, 1949.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nLord Elgin Hotel.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttached is Voucher No.51 covering material and labour rewiring electrical circuit in connection with the installation of the new furnace at Cote Day School.\n\nWhen this furnace was installed the 1/2 horse power motor driving the blower was connected as instructed to the 110 Volt circuit, by so doing causing the line voltage to drop to such an extent that motor would only run in low gear, resulting in overheating and there was danger in it being burned out if left on the present hook up. Due to the continuous running of this motor in low gear the remaining lights in the school became very poor.\n\nTo overcome this a third wire had to be strung from the Transformer at the Agency to the school a distance of about 1/3 of a mile and changing Transformer connections from 110 Volt to 225 Volt by omitting grounding. Under this hook up blower motor is now working satisfactory. A further lead was taken of the 225 Volt line at the school using ground hook up, and by so doing, bringing voltage down to 110 to operate the water pump for the water system. A third lead in the same manner was installed for the remaining lights in the building.\n\nIn many cases heavier wire and conductors had to be used also electrical meter had to be exchanged and new switch and fuse boxes installed.\n\nThe school has been quite comfortable since the installation of the new furnace.\n\nI trust that the necessary rewiring and extra labour and material will meet with your approval, and I would recommend that the above voucher be paid.\n\nJ.

Bryant,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have your letter of the 11th instant enclosing Voucher 51 covering the cost of material and labour for rewiring electrical circuit in connection with the installation of the new furnace at Cote Day School.\n\nIn the first place, we are surprised that you allowed this expenditure to be incurred without first consulting the Department.\n\nIn the second place, the plans and specifications on which Mr. Finnie tendered showed that a \u00bd-HP motor to drive the blower should have been installed. If the plans and specifications had been properly followed, there would have been no necessity for incurring the expenditure covered by your Voucher 51.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the Department is not prepared to pay Voucher 51 as the additional work was undoubtedly done in error by the contractor.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n| Item          | Quantity | Price |\n|--------------|----------|-------|\n| Glass        | 1        | 25    |\n| 10x38 nails  | 2        | 600   |\n| Nails        |          | 50    |\n| Fasteners    | 2        | 70    |\n| Hangers      |          | 60    |\n| Screws       |          | 60    |\n| Tacks        |          | 15    |\n| Bolts        |          | 20    |\n| Striping     |          | 55    |\n\nTotal: $12.55\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nHeating System Cote Day School.\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 14th, regarding the installation of the new heating system by Mr. A.H. Finnie of Kamsack, I wish to report that the system is working very satisfactorily. There is no difficulty now in heating all parts of the building with the exception of the pantry. It is possibly advisable to have this room cool but the west wall is an outside wall, and the water pipes to the bath room pass through the pantry and in very cold weather these pipes freeze sufficiently to stop the flow of water. A small register in the wall from the kitchen would overcome this.\n\nMr. Finnie has not yet been able to secure all the necessary registers. He is in Winnipeg this week and will make every effort to locate what is required to complete the work.\n\nVoucher No 83 for $1293.00 is attached herewith as suggested in your letter.\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\nSupt.

Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Cote Day School.\nYour file 644-5 (E-11)\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of January 20, 1949, replying to my letter of January 11, in connection with the rewiring the electrical circuit at Cote Day School.\n\nIt is regretted that authority for the expenditure was not obtained before the work was done, but the alteration in the wiring appeared urgent and necessary and it was not thought at the time that it was as big a job as it turned out to be.\n\nIn our letter of January 11, a typographical error was made wherein we stated that a 1\u00bd horse power motor was installed to drive the furnace blower. The motor that has been installed by Mr. Finnie is a half horse motor as called for in the plans and specifications.\n\nI understand that Mr. Hargreaves of the Engineering Branch of the Department will inspect the installation of the heating system as soon as completed by Mr. Finnie, and it would be appreciated if he could be asked to make a special report on the necessity of changing the electric wiring in order to have the required power available to run the electric pump, furnace blower and properly light the building at the same time.\n\nEven before the new furnace was installed the 110 Volt circuit was not giving satisfaction. There was a very marked improvement after the new wiring was installed.\n\nIt is hoped that the payment of the Hill Electric account may be given further consideration after you have received Mr. Hargreaves report.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent,\nPelly Agency.\nAIR MAIL\n\n3rd February, 1949.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to the rewiring of the electrical circuit at the Cote Day School. The contents of your letter have been noted, and we will endeavour to arrange payment. Please return the Voucher No. 51.\n\nBernard F.

Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nThe new heating plants at the Cote Day School and the St. Philip's Residential School, in the Pelly Agency, have both been installed and are giving excellent service.\n\nApparently neither of the accounts has been paid in full, and cannot be, until the work has been inspected by Mr. Hargreaves. If it is not possible for Mr. Hargreaves to visit these two schools to inspect the work at an early date perhaps it could be arranged through the Department of Public Works to have Mr. John Ramage, their engineer at Saskatoon, inspect them. I am sure Mr. Ramage would be quite willing to do it if so instructed, and it is desirable to complete payment as soon as possible.\n\nJ.P.B.

Ordinarily for a job of this relatively small size and type, it would not be considered necessary to send an officer from Ottawa to make a final inspection.\n\nIf the Indian Affairs Branch are satisfied with Mr. Ostrander's statement, partially quoted in the preceding paragraph, we see no reason why they should not make final payment to Finnie, the Contractor. No funds were transferred to this Division covering this work.\n\nIn accepting the work they should call on the Contractor to provide a written guarantee that the system will heat the building evenly from 20 degrees below zero outside temperature to 70 degrees inside.\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from Mr. Finnie to which was attached a drawing showing several changes which he made to the layout prepared by this Division. Mr. Finnie has taken more liberties with the design than would have been permitted if he had requested authority before carrying out the changes. It is for this reason that it is felt necessary to advise the Indian Affairs Branch to ask for his written guarantee.\n\nAgain, it is felt unnecessary to have Mr. Ostrander request Mr. Ramage to inspect this work. Mr. Ramage is a Public Works official stationed in Saskatoon, and it is felt that it would be unfair to ask him to inspect work over which he has had no previous connection or control.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nMAR 29/49\n\nR.A.

Other registers have been put in for use, in the meantime.\n\nMr. Finnie recommends a slight change in the size of a hot air stack leading to one of the bedrooms which could be done for the same price, but he did not wish to make any change in the plan without Mr. Hargreaves approval.\n\nA Voucher is attached for a further payment of $1,044.00 on the contract. This leaves a balance of $249.00 still due Mr. Finnie when the equipment and material etc. have been inspected and approved by a qualified official of the Dept.\n\nI would recommend this additional payment of $1,044.00 now.\n\nJ.

This year we used Kalicute cement specially prepared for use in alkaline soils. This cement costs $2.45 a sack and 40 sacks were used as a thin coat was also put on over the part that was done last year.\n\nThe school building is being painted at the present time and there were a number of places such as doors, window frames steps, railings etc., that needed minor repairs, and also three toilets that required three windows, a new door and new covers at the back where the refuse box is removed for cleaning purposes and I took the liberty of having these repairs done while I had a carpenter building a coal bin and more especially in order to get the work done ahead of the painter.\n\nIt is regretted that the expenditure exceeds the estimate but I think I can assure you that the cost of fuel for the school for this fiscal year will be approximately $300.00 less than provided for in our 1949-50 estimates.\n\nJ.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Cote Day School.\n\nHot noon day lunches at Cote Day School have not been provided for, for this academic year, but hot cocoa has been served since the weather became cold. There are 70 pupils on the roll with 65 in attendance this month. The majority of the children bring very good lunches but the lunches are often frozen when they arrive at the school and as the school rooms are pretty well packed to capacity the children have no suitable place to put their lunch pails. Lunches in the cloak rooms very occasionally disappear and at noon the child finds most of his lunch gone, and some of the lunches are still frozen at noon.\n\nThe school staff put in quite a large garden this year and have ample supplies of potatoes, onions, turnips, carrots etc. to provide a good hot meal, but meat is required for soup and stews and something for desert and a hot drink, milk cocoa etc.\n\nUnder the circumstances could at least $100.00 be provided for this purpose in order that good hot lunches could be provided during the balance of the winter. Miss Mac Donald the School Matron and the teachers are willing and anxious to provide these. They feel that a great number of the children that drive or walk 3 miles or more to school really need a good hot lunch at noon.\n\nCote Band Council would be willing to vote some of their Band Funds for this purpose but as we have a few children from Keesekoose Reserve attending this school there would possibly be complaints from some of the Cote Band members if the cost of the lunch was paid from Cote Band Funds. Children from two families that live at the extreme south end of Keesekoose Reserve and live within a mile and a half of Cote School are the children referred to.\n\nPersonally I am very much in favour of a hot noon day lunch for all the children during the winter months. The attendance is better as occasionally children are kept home when supplies are short and a suitable lunch cannot be prepared for them. The children do not like to bring out their lunch pails if their lunches are not up to the standard of the other children. Many of the children have a very light breakfast very early in the morning, and require a substantial noon day meal every school day for best results.\n\nAny assistance that could be provided for this purpose would be much appreciated.\n\nJ.

Bryant,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nRe: Cote Indian Day School\n\nWe have your letter of the 21st instant with reference to serving a midday meal at the above school.\n\nIn recent years the Department has only provided funds for serving a hot drink and vitaminized biscuits, and it has been generally understood that the meal at noon should only be served between November 1st and March 31st of the following year. With the payment of Family Allowances, it is reasonable to suppose that the Indians are in a better position to supply a lunch for their children. Our experience in other agencies proves that this is a fact.\n\nSeveral years ago we provided funds for a midday meal, but it was found that in many cases the serving of this meal seriously interfered with the conduct of the school, as too much time was spent in preparing the meal and cleaning up afterwards.\n\nIf the Cote Band are prepared to provide funds to augment the present midday meal, the usual resolution should be passed and forwarded to the Trust Division for their decision. In a few places funds are raised from other sources, but the Department is not prepared to increase the amount that we are allowing at the present time.\n\nBernard F.

I have had the houses scrubbed twice a week, & themselves kept clean & tidy, for without that medicine will be useless. I suppose the Dr comes sometimes. I send him once myself, & that is the only time I have seen him. So I give the medicine to the best of my ability, & with good results, as I suppose you have been.\n\nI wish to say a few words for myself, the Indians will never keep themselves or houses clean without personal supervision & as the extra work involves a great deal of time after school hours, I have made application for $10 ten dollars per month so one as ever been bound to show them how to clean their houses, so they were very dirty & consequently disease & sickness is constantly among them, another cause of sickness is want. I was rounded up a final inspection yesterday, before I send this & in only two houses had they a little flour, but were terribly up the bones of dead animals which died from tuberculosis, this should be discontinued, they told me it was all they had to eat.\n\nThe Sanitarian has read out any report to the Indians, & they want me to say that they will carry out any instructions, they also wish me to ask for...\nA little more for their children's dinner, the little ones are not strong, they often come to school without any breakfast, then I give them one of the slices of bread allowed, & the other for dinner. If I had something to make soup for them sometimes & a little tea I could help them very much, the death rate among children is increasing.\n\nYr obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Chief X Neenquah\n\nActing Councillor X Crow Buffalo\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am of opinion that the above is sufficient to bring about a fairly satisfactory state of affairs and the Indians themselves have not complained.\n\nI have no doubt Miss Smythe is a lady of refinement who cannot easily associate with unclean surroundings, but from the Inspector's report I should say the circumstances of these Indians would be considered favourable by any person well acquainted with Indian life.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 7th May, 1901.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th ultimo asking the Department to allow you $10.00 a month in addition to your salary as remuneration for instruction the Indian women how to clean and take care of their houses; and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it has no funds available for this purpose, and that the supervision of the Indians dwellings properly constitutes part of the Agent's duties.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner, who was written to on the subject of the destitution to which you refer reports that from information received by him that the circumstances of these Indians would be considered favorable by any person well acquainted with Indian life.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have no particular time set apart for this work but when I notice that the pupils are becoming tired and restless in the class room I take them out to the garden and the change of work is a relaxation for them.\n\nThe products of the garden are stored in my cellar in the fall and during the cold weather I give them vegetable soup for their dinner in addition to their allowance of biscuits. In this way they receive some actual benefit from their work.\n\nThere is considerable rivalry amongst the children as to who will have the best garden and I consider that the effect is beneficial.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOTTAWA\nWith reference to the methods used to obtain a good average attendance I may say that I try to make the school as attractive as possible for the children and believe that they anxious to attend.\n\nWhen any of the parents persistently keep their children away from the school I notify the Indian Agent who has always given me his active support.\n\nDuring the summer months when at times the Indians are encamped at a distance from the school one of the larger boys usually brings the rest of the pupils with a team of horses and a wagon.\n\nThe parents take a great deal of interest in my work and visit the school frequently. I also visit the children at their homes more especially if there is any sickness among them and in this way become acquainted with the younger ones who when they reach school age are no trouble.\n\nThe Day Star band are all pagan Indians and follow the Indian mode of living. They object to having the boys hair cut and dress them in blanket coats and leggings. I have respected their wishes in this respect and have not interfered with their mode of dressing, and have thus avoided what would have been a detriment to the attendance.\n\nI receive enough print from the Agent each year to provide the girls with overall aprons which they leave at the school and only wear while there. This enables them to present a clean and tidy appearance.\n\nI trust that the foregoing report will be found satisfactory and will be glad to submit any further information if required.\n\nI beg to thank the Department for their kindly recognition of my work and for the increase to my salary.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Morrison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter received from His Lordship, the Bishop of Qu'Appelle, on the subject of a teacher for Day Star's reserve, Touchwood Agency. There is no doubt in my mind that a teacher should be appointed at once and that the salary should be at least $60.00 per month. I would strongly advise that nothing but a certificated Teacher be engaged, and a married man or woman preferred.\n\nI have informed His Lordship that I would communicate with him after receiving your reply.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJuly 29th, 1917\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspr. of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\n\nMy dear Mr. Graham,\n\nI understand that Mrs. Smythe, the teacher of the Day Star school is resigning her position on September 30th of this year, and that it will be necessary to make another appointment. I feel very strongly that it is important that we should have another teacher on this reserve, but I understand the salary given at present by the Department is only $400.00 per annum. In the event of my being able to obtain the services of a teacher with a Second or Third Class certificate might we look to the Department for an adequate salary? For such a teacher we should require at least $60.00 per month or $720.00 per annum. In your opinion would it be wise to endeavor to obtain a married teacher for this reserve. The dwelling is a comfortable frame cottage, and I should think that a married teacher even with a small family could be very comfortable there. In your opinion would this be advantageous to the Indians on the reserve. We are doing all we can for the Indians and I hope the Department will assist us in this way. Thanking you very much for your kind interest in the past.\n\nI am, Yours sincerely,\n\nM. M. Qu'Appelle.\nOttawa, August 14, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Day Star School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that while it is the desire of the Department to obtain the services of an efficient teacher at the same time local conditions must be taken into consideration. There are only seventeen children of school age on this reserve and the enrolment at the present time is ten with an average attendance of eight. It seems to the Department that this is too small a school to justify the payment of a salary of $720.00 per annum. For a competent teacher, however, the Department will allow a salary of $500.00 per annum which is an increase of $100.00 over the salary paid the present teacher.\n\nYou will be good enough to communicate with His Lordship the Bishop of Qu'Appelle with a view to securing the services of a teacher at this salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Morrison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRutawa, Sask.\nDay Star School,\nPimicchy, Sask.\nJan. 31st 1916\n\nTo the Sup't Gen. of Indian Affairs:\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nI have been asked by Mr. Maclean - Indian Agent to furnish particulars regarding my proposal to take three or four Indian boys into residence here.\n\nIn the first place my reasons are:\n\n1) That there are boys in Poor Man's Reserve, living from 6 to 10 miles away who are unable to attend school here, the distance being too great for them to make the journey daily, & no other accommodation being available.\n\n2) That, by having boys under continual surveillance much more can be accomplished in training them in habits of cleanliness and usefulness than can be done when under control only during the few hours the School is open.\n\n3) That the influence of a few boys so trained would assist considerably in furthering the\nWork of education and training amongst the day scholars, and create in them, by association, especially at meal hours (there being at present no accommodation outside the school for the mid-day meal) a desire to acquire habits of cleanliness and neatness.\n\nMy wishes are the outcome of a strong desire to secure progress amongst both children and adults, so I am sincerely interested in any work amongst these people, & whilst, nominally, a teacher of the day school, I feel deeply that there is more demanded of me, in their interests, than can be accomplished during the short school hours; and that their future welfare and progress depend much on the influence exercised beyond the school walls.\n\nAccommodation\n\nThere is at present a 5-roomed house, a rough plan of which I append. One room 9'6\" x 11'6\" & 9'6\" in height could be spared for bedroom, and a portion of the living room set apart as a dining room; in this case, however, no accommodation...\ncooks be found for the Day Scholars at the \nfarm, this being an important item in my \nplans for their improvement.\n\nI therefore respectfully suggest that an \naddition - about 20' x 10' be allowed for \nlavatory or dining room, thus providing ample \naccommodation & abolishing the necessity of \nwashing & eating in the School Room.\n\nChairs are also necessary, as there are none \nattached to the School.\n\nGrant\n\nI have carefully considered this matter & \nbelieve that I could, with the assistance given \nby Promoters of the Woman's Auxiliary of the Church \nin the matter of clothing, accomplish all that \nmy plans would entail, with a grant of $80 a \nyear for each child; but I would further \nsuggest that, as the Day Scholars would \nparticipate in the Monday meal with the boarders, \nin place of the present inadequate allowance of \npounds of rice, a small allowance be made \ntowards their maintenance.\n\nI submit this report knowing that all which\nTo the advancement of the Indian people receives the whose heartfelt support of your department & that it will receive your careful & kind consideration.\n\nI have the hearty support of the Indians against here in my work & plans.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nW.T.W. Schurpe.\nOttawa, February 25, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter written at your request from Mr. Scharpe, teacher of the Day Star Indian Day School, giving his reasons for asking permission to take three or four boys from the Poormans Reserve into residence in his home.\n\nIf you will refer to official letter of the 18th ultimo you will see that it was you who was asked to report on this application and not Mr. Scharpe.\n\nThe Department is writing to Mr. Scharpe and informing him that, while it appreciates the interest he takes in the welfare of his pupils who live too far distant from the school to attend regularly, there are no funds available for the maintenance of any children in this school other than day pupils. If his request were complied with it would be virtually establishing a semi-boarding school, which the Department is not prepared to do. As long as the war continues the strictest economy will have to be exercised in regard to school expenditure and it is all the Department can do to keep the existing schools in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. B. Sharpe, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nDay Star Day School,\nPannichy, Sask.\nREPORT\non the Work and General Condition of\nDay Star's Indian School\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\n1. INSTRUCTION\n\nThe progress during the two and a half years I have been in charge of this School has been steady; the children are more retentive and their powers of observation are considerably increased, resulting in a keener and deeper interest in their work. I would not suggest that any abnormal advance in knowledge has been made, but consider the above acquisitions, to which I have given considerable (and I trust not undue) attention, to be a foundation upon which good results may be built.\n\nEach standard is well up to the schedule prescribed by the Department, in Reading, Writing, Spelling, Arithmetic and Scripture, which statement I emphasize in view of the report of Inspector Graham on his last visit to the school in March 1916, and which appeared in the last \"Blue Book\" which fell into my hands. I refer to his remark, \"There is room for improvement\", and of which no one is more conscious than I; but this statement appears to suggest that the work is below the average, and however this may compare with other schools I maintain that it is far in advance of that two years ago.\n\nOn this subject I would ask you to bear in mind two facts in considering my report; First,-that all the Standards were advanced since the Inspector's previous visit, the boys then in Standard I being now in Standard III; Secondly,-the excessive shyness of the Indian child in presence of a stranger, making it almost impossible to obtain a satisfactory idea of their progress by a surprise examination. This failing I have spent much time in trying to overcome, and am succeeding well by encouraging the children to visit the house and take notice of, and enquire about, objects which excite their interest: Much useful instruction is given in this way.\n\nIn Military Drill and Calisthenics they are very proficient, and enjoy the exercises. In music slow progress is being made, singing being, apparently quite new to them, and in this their nervousness is most noticeable, it being quite difficult to exhibit their capabilities before strangers.\nGARDEN.\n\nAlthough part of the course of instruction this subject is one to which I desire to call your special attention.\n\nDue to the difficulty in getting the ground fenced it was impossible for me, during the first two seasons, to do more than superintend the cultivation of a few vegetables in a small piece of ground protected only by ordinary chicken wire. This was very unsatisfactory, and gave no scope for instruction in the proper care of a garden, so I have this year, with the assistance of the Agent, a barbed wire enclosure sufficient to allow each child in Standards II & III a plot under his own care, in addition to which all of them assist in the care and cultivation of the remainder of the garden.\n\nI am particularly pleased to report the results under this heading as I have just returned from a short holiday and, although the children are camping some distance from the school during the vacation, I found the whole garden free from weeds, the paths clean and straight and everything in perfect order. I think that this result will support me in my remarks under suggestions, below.\n\nATTENDANCE\n\nThe average is fairly good, the low average during last winter being accounted for by sickness. When once the start is made the children like to come but there are still two or three on the reserve who have reached school age but are kept at home by the undue apprehensiveness of the parents concerning their health. These cases I feel, as also the following, might be efficiently dealt with under suggestion 7. I refer here to the only boy which I have any trouble with as regards attendance. This boy (No.40) absents himself for days at a time, hiding from his parents and often leaving the reservation. As I understand that there is at present no means of compelling attendance I submit my idea for meeting these cases for your consideration.\n\nI am still endeavouring to arrange for some children from Poor Man's reserve to attend the school, and trust that you will be able to give me some assistance under suggestion 8/\n\nHEALTH\n\nNo serious cases of sickness have occurred amongst the children during my residence here but in January and November of last year (1916) an epidemic of Grippe necessitated the closing of the school for nine days in all.\nOwing to developments in two cases at this time I felt it expedient to drive to town for medical assistance, and much delay was caused through the requirements of the Department that I should first obtain the consent of the Agent. I mention this only to emphasize my request under suggestion 2.\n\nThere was a case of Eczema of the face which I shall mention in order to call attention to the need of some means of isolation in extreme cases.\n\nThis boy, another from this reserve, suffering from a painfully visible form of scrofula, were mixing freely with the crowd on race day at Punnichy, causing annoyance to those they approached and much comment on their being allowed to expose themselves in public, and although I was approached on the subject I had to confess that I knew of no authority by which I could act.\n\nThe children are clean, tidy, contented and happy at school, but better accommodation is badly needed for washing, and the reception of outdoor garments, towels and washing utensils.\n\nMEALS.\n\nUnder this heading I would refer you to my report under the new regulation of provisions used during the month of June and your letter in reply dated July 18th No. 11706/1.\n\nMy remarks on this report were called forth in the belief that there must be some misunderstanding in view of the Agent's letter which accompanied the blank forms, stating that the mid-day meal must not exceed seven cents per day per pupil; This taking the form of a censure, I referred to my books and discovered that during two years and seven months 4058 meals had been served on supplies from the Agency, during the same period, of 134\u00bd lb. Rice, 21\u00bd lb. Tea, and 975 lb. Biscuits, costing the Department, at the highest estimation less than 3\u00bd per meal. In addition to this allowance, with the help of members of the Church the children receive Sugar, Syrup or preserves daily and meat twice a week. It was always my intention, as suggested in your letter above, to continue these meals, but at the same time they are a considerable drain on my income and if the Department can increase the allowance to the value of 7\u00bd per head as your Agent intimates it would be exceedingly helpful.\n\nOwing to the lack of accommodation in the school room, and the impossibility of inculcating Christian habits and cleanliness whilst eating their dinners from the desks, I have allotted a space in the house where the children now dine, the elder girls preparing the meal and doing all the neces-\nall the necessary washing and cleaning up. My table accommodation, however, is very inadequate for the number of diners and I should much appreciate an allowance of sufficient lumber to make a table of sufficient strength and size for this purpose.\n\nBUILDINGS\n\nThe School building is in a fair state of repair with the exception of the steps and platform, which are quite worn out; It was suggested, however by Mr. Graham when here last year that this should be left alone until your decision re porch or vestibule, the erection of which he promised to recommend. A coat of paint put on last summer has improved the appearance of the School both inside and out. Great inconvenience has been caused by the absence of any form of screen for the summer months, I have, however now wired two of the windows, and hope by next summer that the Department will be able to assist us by the addition of a screen door.\n\nThe House needs a little attention in order to save what may prove a heavy expense later on. The painting of the outside, which was postponed last year at the time the School was done, on account of the expense cannot be much longer delayed without injury to the building, but the foundation near the cellar opening needs immediate attention where the drippings from the eaves have soaked through; Twice during my tenancy the cellar walls have caved in through this soakage, and the rafters are becoming so rotten that the floor above will not be safe unless something is done to preserve it. A slight expense would save further trouble, and the eave troughs, when placed in position, will prevent further trouble in this direction.\n\nThe old building, formerly the house and school, now abandoned, is being gradually demolished, what little lumber of any use being used up in improvements on the school room and house now in use, but I have up to the present been compelled to use part as stable; I am expecting to have a new stable erected before the Fall and the Agent has advised me that he is submitting this matter for your consideration as regards the expense, as it is necessary that he should have accommodation for his team when visiting here in the winter and the old school is now too dilapidated for further use.\n\nAlthough much of my work on behalf of the Diocese is done beyond the\nbeyond the school limits I might appear to be trespassing upon the prerogative of the Agent in making any mention of conditions as they appear to me amongst the adult population, but as regards that part of the work for which I am responsible I am pleased to say that a growing interest is shown in the Sunday services and in religious matters generally. I am also commencing an evening class for the younger men who are at last realizing that the age of 15 is not necessarily synonymous with compulsory cessation of study as seems to have been the prevalent idea.\n\nI make the following SUGGESTIONS in the belief that if carried out they will tend to greater efficiency for reasons given in my report under the various headings:\n\n(1) GARDEN; That a supply of necessary Garden tools for the use of the children be authorised by the Department.\n\n(2) HEALTH; That the Teacher be authorised to summon Medical Aid.\n\n(3) \" That a small supply of Medical Appliances suitable for First Aid should be kept at the School, the Agency being 13 miles away.\n\n(4) MEALS; That if the same rations as allowed to Farm Instructors were allowed to the Teacher the present strain of providing a sufficient midday meal would be relieved.\n\n(5) \" That the Agent might with advantage consult the Teacher as to requirements when making his annual estimate of the amount of provisions needed for the school.\n\n(6) ATTENDANCE; That on account of the average of attendance being reduced by absenteeism during seeding and harvesting, the Teacher have authority to close the School at such times and reduce the Mid-summer holidays in proportion.\n\n(7) \" That one of the Indian men be appointed Truant Officer. There are two or three intelligent reliable men on the Reserve by whom this appointment would be appreciated and to whom it would give additional interest in the work of the school through the sense of responsibility entailed and would I think effectively meet both cases referred to in my report.\n\n(8) \" That assistance in rations or otherwise be given to those willing to board children from Poor Man's Reserve wishing to attend this school.\nIn conclusion I would ask you to give your consideration to my request for Lumber mentioned in my report on Meals and also for two Gates for the School Fence, both of which I will submit through the Agent in due course.\n\nI also desire to mention the TELEPHONE which will be completed shortly within about two miles of the School. It is not necessary for me to urge what an inestimable boon this would be in such an isolated spot, especially in cases of sickness. I have mentioned the matter to the Agent who states that he is at present unaware of your intentions concerning its installation, and seems to fear urging it on account of expense, but I am convinced that much of this would be saved by the voluntary help which the men on the Reserve would render in view of the benefits to be derived.\n\nThe following would be helpful and much appreciated:\n\n- A copy of the Act concerning Indian Schools\n- A copy of the Blue Book, when issued\n- Any publication on Wild Flowers, Birds & Weeds\n- Any information possible regarding the Treaty with the Indians on this Reserve.\n\nAll of which I submit with all confidence that your Department will understand that I have only the welfare of the Indians at heart in anything that I have reported or suggested, and with sincere thanks for the ready assistance which I have hitherto received from you.\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher\n\nCopies of:\n- Annual Report for year ending Mar 31/16\n- Indian Act\n- Regulation relating to the Education of Indian Children\n- Indian Day School Regulation\n- Pamphlet on Weeds & Weed seed sent Mr Schaper Oct. 17/17\nSir:\n\nIt will be remembered that in my Annual Report on the work of the above Reserve I stated that I wished to make a more lengthy report than the space allowed on the official form permitted. I now beg to present a fair and concise account of the progress, as I see it, during my two and a half years' work here, confident that the same will receive your usual ready and favourable attention.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher & Missionary\n**REPORT of Provisions used at Day Star's Day School**\n\non Day Star Reserve, for Month ended September 30, 1917\n\n| Aggregate Attendance | Meals Served |\n|----------------------|--------------|\n| ---                  | ---          |\n\n| On hand 1st of July | Received during Month | Used during Month | On hand at end of Month | REMARKS |\n|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------|\n|                     |                       |                   |                         |         |\n| FLOUR               |                       |                   |                         |         |\n| BACON               |                       |                   |                         |         |\n| BEEF                |                       |                   |                         |         |\n| TEA                 | 2\u00bd lb.                | 2 lb.             | 2\u00bd lb.                  | 2 lb.   |\n| RICE                | 4\u00bd lb.                | 6\u00bd lb.            | 6\u00bd lb.                  | 4\u00bd lb.  |\n| SOAP                | 18 lb.                | 5 lb.             | 13 lb.                  |         |\n| SUGAR               |                       |                   |                         |         |\n| SALT                |                       |                   |                         |         |\n| POTATOES            |                       |                   |                         |         |\n| BISCUITS            | 110 lb.               | 72\u00bd lb.           | 37\u00bd lb.                 |         |\n| BEANS               |                       |                   |                         |         |\n| OATMEAL             |                       |                   |                         |         |\n| PEAS                |                       |                   |                         |         |\n\n# This should read \"Nil\".

H. Scharpe.\n\n(1) Garden.\nA supply of Rakes, Hoes and Watering-cans were given to the school in 1910. The broken implements could be replaced as required in the regular way.\n\n(2) Health.\nAs the pupils are only at the school during a portion of each day, the Parents have to a large extent the oversight of their health; In the past I have found them ready and anxious to summon Medical Aid when required. The Agency is situated on the regularly used road between this Reserve and the Village where the Medical Officer resides and it would entail no delay or hardship to have any case which in the opinion of the Teacher required medical attention reported to the Agent.\n\n(3) \"I can furnish the Teacher with a small supply of First Aid Medicines upon his application for same from the Agency stock on hand.\n\n(4) Meals.\nEstimates for food for the children have in the past been made up from the average\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nattendance and based on the regulations as I have understood them regarding Day-Schools.\n\n\"a regular issue of biscuits, tea, rice and soap.\"\n\nNo doubt the provision of a mid-day meal helps the regularity of the attendance and if it is to be adopted as a regular thing it would only be reasonable that the Teacher should not have to provide the extra food at his own expense.\n\nThe garden has supplied a sufficient amount of potatoes and vegetables for the requirements of the school and I would suggest that an allowance of beef be supplied during the winter months for the purpose of making vegetable soup and an allowance of sugar for their tea.\n\nThe appointment of a Truant Officer might be beneficial; but so far there have been very few instances of children deliberately playing truant on this reserve.\n\nI am not favourably disposed towards encouraging the attendance of children, not members of the Day Star Band, to this school, in view of the fact, that we have two Boarding Schools in this Agency which can take care of them and there is no question but that the Boarding Schools have the facilities for giving a more practical training than it is possible for them to acquire at the Day-School.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 28, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn further reference to the suggestions which accompanied your letter of the 15th of August last, in connection with the work at the Day Stars Day School I beg to say that you should make a requisition for the garden tools necessary and forward it to the Department through Mr. Agent Marison.\n\nIn connection with the health of the pupils I beg to say that you should report any case which you consider requires medical attention to the Agent. The Agency is situated on the regularly used road between the reserve and the village where the medical officer lives and it would entail no delay or hardship to do this. If you will apply to Mr. Marison for a small supply of First Aid Medicines he will be able to furnish you with what you require from the stock on hand at the Agency.\n\nYou should also forward requisitions for the supplies you require for the mid-day meal to the Department through the Agent's office.\n\nIn regard to the appointment of a truant officer you should consult the Agent in regard to this matter and, if a truant officer is considered necessary, he can appoint some Indian to do this work.\n\nIn reference to your suggestion that assistance in rations, or otherwise, be given to those willing to board children.\n\nRev. W. H. B. Scharpe,\nTeacher,\nDay Stars Indian Day School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nchildren from Poor Man's Reserve wishing to attend your school.\n\nI beg to say that the Department is not disposed to encourage the attendance of children at this school who are not members of the Day Star Band, as there are two boarding schools in the Agency which can take care of them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, November 28, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant reporting on the suggestions made to the Department by the Rev. W. H. B. Scharpe, teacher of the Day Stars Day School, in connection with his work there.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Scharpe has been informed that he should forward requisitions for the garden tools required and also for the supplies for the mid-day meal to the Department through your office; that he should report the case of any pupil that requires medical attention to you; that, if he applies to you, you will furnish him with a small supply of First Aid Medicines from the stock on hand at the Agency; that he should consult you in regard to the appointment of a truant officer and, if one is considered necessary, you can appoint some Indian to do this work, and also that the Department is not disposed to encourage the attendance of pupils at his school who are not members of the Day Star Band, as there are two boarding schools in the Agency which can take care of them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Stores, Winnipeg.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the DAY STAR'S Indian School, dated Sept. 15/22.\n\nMr. Turner is an earnest worker and has the interests of his pupils at heart. Through lack of training very much of the work is misdirected. There is too much work involving mere parrot-like repetition of exercises; practically no attempt to awaken the self activity of the pupils. As a result very few can express themselves in English that can be understood. They are trained to follow and repeat what the teacher says without the essential mental effort to make the instruction truly educational.\n\nThe pupils are not showing the desired progress. This is, in my opinion, chiefly due to two causes, namely,\n\n(1) The teacher has no training for primary work.\n\n(2) The pupils are not in the physical condition essential to successful mental application.\n\nThe general trend of the teaching and instruction is not the type needed. The natural interests and conditions under which the pupils live are not sufficiently taken into account. The work has no connection with their real life and, as a result, becomes dry, pedantic and dead.\n\nMr. Turner has the missionary spirit and the right attitude but he should be induced to train for the work of teaching, otherwise it becomes a work of groping in the dark for results.\n\nB. Hjalmarson,\nInsp.\nOttawa, Nov. 7, 1922.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Provincial Public School Inspector, Mr. B. Hjalmarson, informs the Department that you would be well advised to take some training in pedagogical methods, with a view to brightening the instruction offered, coordinating classroom activities with the daily interests of the Indian pupils at the Day Stars Indian Day School. The Inspector makes a very favourable report regarding your attitude towards, and your interest in the work, and feels that such an earnest worker should receive some special training in the matter of instructing day school pupils.\n\nThe Department wishes to kindly draw this helpful report of Mr. Hjalmarson to your attention, and, if it is impossible for you to attend a short session of a normal school during the summer months, you might do well to initiate a correspondence with the Department of Education in Regina, with a view to getting circulars and other literature dealing with teaching methods. I am ordering for you, through the Stationery Office, the publication known as \"The Canadian Teacher\".\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. G. Turner,\nTeacher,\nDay Stars Indian School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nSir:\n\nReverend George Turner, teacher at the Day Star Reserve requests leave of absence from December 4 to the 22, for the purpose of attending college preparatory to Ordination. Mr. Turner was absent at college in December 1921, having kept the school open during the holiday period in the Summer of that year, in order that he might attend college during the month referred to.\n\nI shall be glad to know if the Department will agree to granting the absence asked for. If his request is granted will you please inform me whether the Department is desirous of it being with or without pay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Nov. 28, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the granting of leave of absence to Rev. George Turner, Teacher of the Day Stars Indian Day School, for the purpose of attending college preparatory to ordination.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of leave of absence being granted to Mr. Turner from December 4th until the school re-opens after the Christmas holidays. Full salary will be allowed him for the December quarter, but on the distinct understanding that he will make up the time lost by teaching either on Saturdays or during the holiday period next summer. You will be good enough to inform Mr. Turner accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your No. 121-2-1, of the 23rd ultimo, regarding the granting of leave of absence to the Rev. George Turner, Teacher of the Day Star Indian School, for the purpose of attending college preparatory to ordination.\n\nI note that the Department will approve of leave of absence being granted to Mr. Turner from December 4th until the school re-opens after the Christmas holidays, and that full salary will be allowed him for the December quarter, but on the distinct understanding that he will make up the time lost by teaching either on Saturdays or during the holiday period next summer. I have instructed Mr. Hardinge, the Acting Indian Agent, to advise Mr. Turner accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. GRAHAM\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. J. B. Hardinge, Indian Agent at Punichy, drawing attention to the lack of ability of the Rev. George Turner, Teacher in charge of the day school on the Day Star reserve, to instruct the pupils. He states that the children are making no progress in even the elementary subjects, but are going back. There is no complaint against Mr. Turner's energy or conduct towards the children. It is his lack of ability to impart knowledge that is retarding progress at the school. The report of Mr. B. Hjalmarson, Provincial School Inspector, in September last, which I forwarded to the Department on 24th October, makes the same complaint in regard to Mr. Turner. He is earnest and has the interests of his pupils at heart, but cannot impart instruction. I think it is desirable that a change should be made, and the services of Mr. Turner dispensed with. I think we should endeavour to procure a woman teacher whose husband could be employed as Farming Instructor. There is no Farming Instructor on the Day Star reserve at the present time, and I think one should be engaged. If the Department will give me the necessary authority I will endeavour to locate a married couple of the type desired.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Feb. 22, 1923.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI regret to inform you that several reports have been received by this office, concerning the teaching ability of the Rev. George Turner, the present Missionary Teacher at the Day Stars Indian Day School, Punnichy, Sask. The Public School Inspector and the Indian Agent have both intimated that, although Mr. Turner is an earnest worker and has the interests of his pupils at heart, his efforts are misdirected, because of lack of training for the important work of teaching. May I quote from the Public School Inspector's report: \"Mr. Turner has the missionary spirit and the right attitude, but he should be induced to train for the work of teaching, otherwise it becomes a work of groping in the dark for results.\"\n\nI would be pleased to learn what are the possibilities of effecting a transfer of this gentleman to some other field of activity, and filling his position at the Day Stars Indian School with a missionary teacher who is better qualified to conduct classroom work. I am of the opinion that this might be a better solution to the difficulty than offering Mr. Turner an opportunity to take a teacher's course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Archdeacon Knowles,\nDiocese of Qu'Appelle,\nSynod Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, Feb. 22, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 212/11 of the 12th instant, with reference to the misdirected and unsatisfactory work of the Rev. George Turner, as teacher of the Day Stars Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department agrees with you that it might be desirable to arrange for the services of another worker for this reserve. However, your suggestion that a married man and his wife be appointed farming instructor and school teacher, respectively, cannot be considered. In the first place, the Rev. George Turner was nominated by the Diocesan Authorities of the Church of England, and it is to them that we will have to make overtures regarding the position of missionary teacher. Further, it will not be possible to appoint a farming instructor for the Day Star Reserve, as there is no position provided for in the establishment of the Department.\n\nI have to inform you that a communication is being addressed to the Church Authorities, urging the advisability of transferring the Rev. Mr. Turner to some other work and appointing a missionary teacher who is better qualified to conduct classroom activities. You will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your No. 121-2-1 of the 22nd inst., in reference to dispensing with the services as teacher at the Star Indian Day School of the Rev. George Turner, and note that you have addressed a communication to the Church authorities urging the advisability of his transfer, and the appointment of a missionary teacher who is better qualified.\n\nIn regard to my suggestion that a married man and his wife be appointed farming instructor and school teacher respectively on that reserve, I note you state that it will not be possible to appoint a farming instructor for that point as there is no position provided for in the establishment of the Department. I am aware that there is no provision in the establishment, but made the suggestion by way of a recommendation, and shall be glad to be advised if I am to understand that if no provision is made for any proposed appointment there is no method of providing for an addition to or change in the present establishment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nW. M. GRAHAM\nIndian Commissioner.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received a communication from The Venerable Archdeacon Knowles which has caused me some little surprise. In the letter I am told that the School Inspector and the Indian Agent recommend me to take up other work more suitable than teaching in an Indian School.\n\nMay I refer you to your letter No.121-2-1 November 7-1922, in that letter there is no such statement. The report of the School Inspector, Mr. B. Hjalmarson, is fair, considering that Day Star School was the first Indian School he had inspected, & according to his own statement, that he had come to learn, & from the fact that his inspection took place immediately after the long vacation, I maintain that the Indian Agent J.B. Harding, is not competent to report on Day Star School, as the following statistics of his visits to the Reserve & school during the Fiscal Year 1922-1923 will show:\n\nMay 22-1922, the Indian Agent saw the pupils at their desk work.\n\nJune 25-1922 he visited the school with His Lordship Bishop Harding, no desk work was done that morning.\n\nJuly 18-1922 he visited the Reserve, the school was closed for the summer vacation.\n\nAugust 22-1922 he visited the Reserve, School was closed for summer vacation.\n\nSeptember 19-1922, he visited the school & saw the Pupils at desk work.\n\nDecember 7-1922 he visited the school with Inspector Christianson, school was closed, with the Commissioners permission.\nto allow Mr Turner to proceed to Regina\nDecember 23-1922, he visited the Reserve. And school, the school\nwas closed for the Xmas holidays.\n\nTotal number of visits paid by J.B.Hardinge, Indian Agent to Day\nStar Reserve, Seven, during the Fiscal Year.\n\nWhile in Regina, the Deputy Minister of education, kindly allowed\nme an observation course, Dr.MC.Kecknie, has given me guidance on\nschool method, & prescribed a course of private study, which I am\nfollowing.\n\nI am convinced that it is a case of personal animus,\nof Indian Agent Hardinge, subsequent to my solemnizing the marriage\nof his brother-in-law to a half-breed. He has publicly made\nstatements, that he would have me removed, & as a Clergyman,\na Civil servant, and a returned soldier, I request an enquiry into\nthe whole matter. I am not pleading to be kept on, but in justice\nto my church & myself I cannot allow this matter to go by default.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nGeorge Turner\n\nJ.D.MeLean Esq,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 16, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo. In reply I beg to inform you that His Lordship the Bishop of Qu'Appelle, who visited the Department, has directed us to advise you that, upon his return to Regina, he will take up the matter dealt with in your communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nGeorge Turner, Esq.,\nTeacher, Day Stars Indian School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nApril 16, 1923.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Qu'Appelle, who visited the Department today, on his return from England, stated that he would inquire into the case of George Turner, the Teacher of the Day Stars School, and that he would arrange for Mr. Turner's transfer to a mission field and endeavour to engage the services of a qualified teacher for the next school year. In the meantime, he requested that Mr. Turner remain where he is for the balance of the school year, until June 30th, next. He requested, further, that Mr. Turner's letter simply be acknowledged and that he be informed that the Bishop would deal with the situation. He regretted that Mr. Turner made the reference he did to the Indian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to tender my resignation, as Teacher, of Day Star Indian Day School, in the Touchwood Agency, same to take effect on May 31-1923. As the resignation takes place so closely upon the long vacation, may I respectfully enquire whether some remuneration is not due to me, for the vacation period. All the school days will have been put in by that time.\n\nIs it possible for the Department in view of three and a half years service, to let me have my salary and the bonus by the 31st of May, as my removal is necessitating heavy expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeorge Turner\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 9, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, tendering your resignation as teacher of the Day Star Indian Day School, to take effect on May 31st, next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your resignation is accepted and Mr. Agent Hardinge is being informed accordingly, also Archdeacon Knowles, Regina.\n\nPayment of salary will be made you in full for the quarter ending June 30th, next. You began duties at this school in November, 1919, and as the school year ends on the 30th of June, the salary for that year was adjusted in full at that time. You have received the total yearly salary for each year you taught since that date, and the cheque which will be forwarded you before the end of the present month will make payment in full of all amounts due until June 30, 1923.\n\nYou should prepare and hand to the local agent a return, using the form for that purpose, showing the attendance and days taught taught by you to the end of the present month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. George Turner,\nTeacher,\nDay Star Indian Day School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nOttawa, May 9, 1923.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Rev. George Turner, Teacher of the Day Star Indian Day School, has forwarded his resignation to take effect at the end of the present month. We are writing him, accepting the same from that date.\n\nAs it will hardly be possible to obtain the services of a teacher for the month of June, it is considered that the school may remain closed until after the summer holidays. I shall be pleased if the Church authorities will nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of this school when it re-opens on or about September first. The name, qualifications and experience of the person secured should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. I should be pleased if you would bear this matter in mind and endeavour to secure a suitable teacher in time to take up duties after the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon Knowles,\nDiocese of Qu'Appelle,\nByned Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, May 9, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Rev.

We have accepted the same and he has been requested to prepare and hand you his return showing the attendance and days taught by him to the end of the present month. If correct, you will be good enough to certify and forward the return to the Department.\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Qu'Appelle will, no doubt, arrange for a qualified teacher to take up the work at this school when it re-opens after the summer holidays on or about September first, next. It is considered that the school may remain closed for the month of June, as it would be difficult to obtain a teacher for that period.

Jolly for the position of teacher at the Day Star Indian Day School. Mrs. Jolly holds a second class professional certificate for Saskatchewan, and will be paid at the rate of $800 for the ten teaching months, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. B.

He expresses the hope that the Department will provide rations for the mid-day meal for the Indian children, and I would recommend that this provision be made. He also asks that the Department will contribute a share towards the purchase of fire wood, and I would suggest that a grant of $50.00 be allowed.\n\nCertain repairs are required to the teacher's house on the Reserve, but before I make a recommendation in regard to this, I propose to send an Inspector to examine the property.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

As stated in my letter of the 12th instant, it was His Lordship the Bishop of Qu'Appelle who expressed the hope that the Department would provide rations for this meal and I recommended that provision be made. Doubtless the Department's reference to the Indian Agent was inadvertent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe day I was at this school I found it closed, and the teacher absent, although it was a Monday. On making inquiries I found that the teacher was at some church social off the reserve. She had, however, written to the Agent asking him for permission to be away that day but he had not received her letter. She also indicated in this letter to the Agent that it was her intention to resign her position. I left word with her husband that his wife should come in to see me the following Saturday, as I wished to learn the nature of her complaint. She came in and it developed that some of the children had come to the school at the beginning of the term with nits in their hair. She had cleaned them up and took the children home and told the mothers what to do and she informed me that the Indian women spoke rudely to her, which she was not going to stand for. I might say that I spoke to some of the Indian women about this, and they admitted having answered Mrs. Jolly back, but stated that they did so because she had spoken rudely to them, and I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Jolly had undertaken to remonstrate with these women, but had only succeeded in antagonizing them. I advised Mrs. Jolly that I thought if she handled the Indian women properly not many of them would be rude.\nrude to her, as, in my opinion, the fault lies with Mrs. Jolly. I further advised her that if she wished to send in her resignation I had no doubt it would be accepted. Mrs. Jolly is a fair teacher, but she has been spoken to on several occasions about being personally untidy and having her own house very dirty. I wish to point out that if the Day Star School is to be continued here, a new building should be put up next year and the teacher's house repaired. I instructed the Agent to provide for this in the Estimates.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to attach hereto a report of an inspection on the various schools in the Touchwood Agency, which was made by Mr. Inspector Christiansen.\n\nThe first school reported on is Fishing Lake, situated on the Fishing Lake Reserve. This school is under the auspices of the Anglican Church and is taught by Mr. Laws. The report of the Inspector shows that good work is being done here. He also comments on the buildings, which are very fine and are kept in good shape.\n\nThe report on the Muscowequan Boarding School is very encouraging and shows that the Principal has the work well in hand. There is a good farm here and the work in connection with it is well done.\n\nNo report was made on the Gordon School on account of the serious illness of the Principal.\n\nI am sorry that the report does not speak very favourably of the Day School on the Day Star Reserve. We have been more or less unfortunate with this school ever since I can remember. It seems difficult to get the right kind of teacher at this point, and I doubt very much whether the Department are getting value for the money expended here. It seems to me that with a very few dollars extra these children could be sent to a boarding school and the results would be infinitely better.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 15, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-9 of the 8th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on the schools in the Touchwood agency. The Inspector's comments have been noted with interest.\n\nI regret to learn that the work of Mrs. Jolly, teacher of the Day Star Indian Day School, is not very satisfactory. I should be grateful if you would discuss this matter with His Lordship the Bishop of Qu'Appelle at your convenience and make a recommendation if you consider remedial action is necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDay Star's Indian Reserve,\nPunnichy,\nSask.\n\nMarch 19th, 1926\n\nDear Mr. Hjalmarson,\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the note received from the Indian Agent re John Kapayeequa (commonly known as John Kapay).\n\nI will write you a statement of the whole affair.\n\nOn December 15th, George Kapay came to school about 9:30 am and asked if he might take away his boy, John, to dig skunk in the mountain. As this man had two other sons at home, I did not deem this a sufficiently reasonable excuse to permit him to leave school without the consent and knowledge of the Indian Agent. George thereupon expressed his opinion of the teacher in forcible and obscene English. I ordered him to leave the building, and\nreported the matter to the Indian Agent who informed me that nothing could be done with this man for this offence.\n\nWhen the January term opened John was troublesome. He started to undermine the morale of the school. Gradually the children seemed to lose all power to speak English! I watched them very carefully. This culminated on Feb. 25th.\n\nFor winter use, I had allowed the boys to make a stack of wood about six feet east of the school building. During the noon lunch hour the boys knocked most of this wood down. About 12:45 a boy knocked at the door and asked if it were school time. Mr. Jolley answered the door and then gave the following message, \"Mr. Jolley says that the boys are to stack the wood they have knocked down. It is to be stacked near the fence.\"\nDonald Machinini delivered the message. John Kapay was standing on the school steps. No boy moved to obey my order. I waited until 1 pm. I then went to the yard, sounded the \"Fall In\" and told the boys to obey my order. In the meantime I started school work with the girls. In about five minutes I heard a boy crying. It was Donald Machinini. He was being beaten (with a stick) by another boy. I went outside and demanded, \"Why do you beat Donald?\" The boy replied, \"He is lazy. John told me to beat him.\" John laughed and passed an insolent remark in Cree. I watched him for several minutes and, as he showed no signs of behaving properly, I told him to go home and wait until the Agent transferred him to another school. I called the boys in school and questioned them concerning their disobedience. Basil said: \"I did not hear Donald.\"\nI was in the toilet.\"\nFred said: \"John told us not to stack wood.\"\nRobert said: \"I was playing with the little ones. I didn't hear.\"\nJack said: \"Nobody was going to stack, so I didn't.\"\nSam said: \"John told the boys not to stack wood.\"\nDonald said: \"John said, don't do anything. Mr. Jolley tells you. He won't thrash you, so it doesn't matter.\"\n\nI then questioned Fred, Sam, Jack and Donald as to why they obeyed John. They told me that they were scared of John.\n\nI then asked why they were scared of John. He is of medium height and fat, but of no great physical strength and they have rarely been knocked out by him when boxing. Sam said, \"We are not scared of John so much. We are scared of his father.\" Now sir, John's father is the medicine.\nman and purveyor of evil spirits for this reserve.\n\nTo find that this illiterate dealer in evil spirits was undermining the morale of my Scouts was more than I could tolerate. So, on Saturday, Feb. 27th, I broke up a visit to Mr. and Mrs. Matley to visit the Agent. I arrived about 11 a.m., but he was not in his office. I went to the house, and gave him a full account of the incidents which led to my sending John home. I begged him to arrange John as speedily as possible. He said that he (the Agent) would come to the reserve as soon as he could.\n\nHowever, I took a very severe cold. On Sunday I went to church at Kutsawa and then to dinner with Mr. E.J. Howes. I was overcome while there and we were forced to remain overnight. We came home on Monday morning.\nand I was in bed until Saturday morning. The following Monday I opened school and found that several children had measles. I sent a telephone message to the doctor.\n\nOn Tuesday March 9th the doctor visited re measles and the agent re John Kapaay. To my amazement I heard that nothing had been done concerning the removal of this boy. John was at home supposedly sick. The agent told me that he would go to see the family and would have John back in school. Most emphatically I said, \"No, sir, he has done so much mischief already, that I would rather leave the school than have John return.\"\n\nOn March 15th John Kapaay presented himself. I asked, \"Why are you here?\"\u2014 \"I've come to school.\" \"Go home until Mr. Moore comes for you.\" John went home. The same evening the boys...\nbrother James came to the house and said that Mr. Moore had told John to come to school. I ignored this, for I had (before Christmas) asked Mr. Moore to refrain from sending oral messages by Indians, for I had received several messages purporting to come from Mr. Moore which were untruths. Then, this morning, I received this letter of which I am enclosing a copy. I have sent the boy home, for I am convinced that if he returns I may as well give up all hope of teaching anything, either secular or religious, to the children on this reserve.\n\nAs I told the Agent, I would rather retire now, with a seventeen years' teaching reputation unsullied, than wait until John had done his worst and then retire under a cloud.\n\nI am sorry to have to\ntrouble you, but we have had such unfortunate experiences of Indian Department officials that I feel that this attitude on the part of the Agent should not be dismissed lightly.\n\nSince John was sent home, the boys have returned to their Scout spirit and are looking round for things to do for Mr. Jolley and myself.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL. M. Jolley.\nCopy\nTouchwood Agency, Punnichy, Sask.\nMarch 18th, 1926.\n\nDear Mrs. Jolley,\n\nI was surprised to hear from George Kapay today that you had sent his boy John away from school on Monday last, after I had instructed George to send his boy to school again.\n\nThe last time I was at the school I told you that I would go over and see the Kapay family and would have John attend school again as soon as he was well enough, and that if I thought circumstances warranted it I would later on have him sent away to a Residential School.\n\nGeorge Kapay has been warned to keep away from the school so that you will not be bothered by having him around.\n\nJohn must attend, so please\ngovern yourself accordingly.\nI am telling George that the boy will go to school again tomorrow.\n\nYours truly,\nS.S. Moore\nIndian Agent.\nThe Hon. Charles Stuart,\nMinister of Interior,\nMinister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHon. and Dear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the statement which I have forwarded to B. Hjalmarson, Esq., Inspector of Public Schools, Wynyard, Sask.; and a copy of the Indian Agent's letter.\n\nThe work on this reserve has suffered during the past year from interference by officials. Dating from May 1925, Mr. Jolley and I have heard much adverse criticism of the conduct of the work on this reserve.\n\nOn May 5th, we were visited by a woman known as Miss Brandt who introduced herself as a nurse employed by the Indian Department.\nShe made herself most unpleasant to school children, Mr. Jolley and myself. Although she acknowledged that she had never before visited the reserves in this Agency, yet she displayed a remarkable knowledge of the conduct of this school and Agency during the residence of my predecessors.\n\nOne wonders from whom this nurse obtained her information. When the children returned to school after the summer vacation they were very dirty. I allowed them three weeks to recover from the effects of their holiday, but my daily lesson of \"hygiene\" seemed of no avail. I visited the parents, asking them to clean up their children. Several women were rather rude. They told me that my predecessor did not bother about their children's heads, so why should I?\n\nAgain one wonders whom was the person who prompted such a remark.\nI outlined the case to the Indian Inspector. He informed me that I was exceeding my duty to talk to these women concerning these children\u2014\"That is the Agent's job. He has more pull than you have with the Indians\"\u2014This official concluded by ordering the Agent to \"Go to David Stoir, take the nurse with you, and tell them Indians to keep their darn kids clean or they will be sent to boarding school.\" I was really so disgusted that my husband had much difficulty in restraining me from sending you a report at the time the incident occurred.\n\nDuring the school term from April until June 30th, 1925, Mr. Jolley or I drove on four occasions five miles to send telephone messages to the school. Two of these messages reached the closing of the school for one day. None of these messages were delivered.\nby the clerk to the Agent. Is this business-like conduct of an office? Concerning the visit of the nurse, I asked my husband to write our Bishop\u2014As far as we are concerned I believe that this matter has been settled.\n\nWith regard to the remarks of the Indian Inspector re dirty children, I conversed with the Inspector of Public Schools on this subject, and he was very surprised at the attitude of the Indian Inspector, for as Mr. Palmer (J.P.S.) remarked \"Without the daily cooperation of the teachers, very little could be done by nurses or any other officials.\"\n\nFurther, on September 8th, the Indian Agent suggested that we assist him by allowing the five senior boys to excavate the cellar. He impressed on us that the Indian Department had apportioned $15.00 (fifteen dollars) for this work. He approved the plan that $10.00 (ten dollars) should be paid for lumber for supports and shelves and $5.00 (five dollars) for labor. Mr. Jolley\nand I spoke to the boys concerning this work. We offered them three meals each day that they worked; the work to be done in school hours; and $1.50 (one dollar) each in cash at completion. We also told them that the work would probably take four or five days. They talked it over, and agreed to the terms. The work took four days, during which time Mr. Jolley supervised, allowing frequent rest periods. When finished I wrote asking Agent for money to pay the boys. No payment was forthcoming and this bred discontent.\n\nEdwin Kinequon voiced this discontent to the Indian Inspector during the week ending September 26th. Without consulting us the Indian Inspector told Edwin Kinequon that the boys should receive $2.00 (two dollars) payment. This seemed to me a scandalous proceeding for\u2014apart from the fact that these boys had three ample meals each day that they worked\u2014this Inspector was encouraging these boys to break a contract entered into by them willingly, having full knowledge of the duration and\nnature of the work. How can one be expected to inculcate qualities of obedience, respect, and a spirit of fair play into the minds and life of these boys in face of such opposition from an official of the Indian Department?\n\nThe Indian Department insists upon teachers in Day Schools being qualified and surely the teachers are entitled to respect and consideration on the part of these local and provincial officials.\n\nDuring our time of residence on this reserve, Mr. Jolley and I have tried by all means in our power to raise the physical, mental and moral standard of the Indians on this reserve.\n\nThe boys were making really good progress as Scouts. Unfortunately, the events aforementioned have seriously interfered with the Scout work, thereby causing us much disappointment.\n\nMight I respectfully submit the following: That teachers in Indian Day Schools be responsible only\nto three persons at most. The white schools of the province are very successfully managed by a board of three trustees; sometimes only one official trustee.\n\nI have repeatedly asked for urgent repairs and redecoration of house and school. So far nothing has been done with regard to the school building and very little to the house. These buildings are a disgrace\u2014especially so to a Government department. Yet the report of the school teacher and Inspector of Public Schools is not sufficient.\n\nThe teacher must report to the Indian Agent. The Indian Agent must report to the Indian Inspector. The Indian Inspector reports to the Indian Commissioner. The Indian Commissioner reports to the Minister of Indian Affairs.\n\nBy the time the report reaches the Minister, nothing, apparently, is required.\n\nI fully realize that no blame should be attached to the Minister. Therefore, Hon. Sir, I bring\nthese facts to your notice. The condition of these buildings is adversely commented upon by visitors. Most of the visitors have no local prejudice. Mr. Cowper of the Topographical Survey Department will bear witness to the abovementioned facts re the condition of the buildings.\n\nI trust, Hon. Sir, that you will give the subjects mentioned in my letter your careful consideration with a view to making the lot of the teachers in Indian Day Schools rather more pleasant and congenial, and with a view to preventing so much overlapping and officialdom in the administration of Indian Day Schools.\n\nThis is not the complaint of a child, but of one who has seventeen years professional experience to her credit, and who has never before known so many officials to be necessary in the educating of fifteen children.\n\nI remain, Hon. Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nL. M. Jolley (Mrs. J. Jolley)\n| Month | Temp | Altitude |\n|-------|------|----------|\n| Sept 23 | 15\u00b0 | 11.6 |\n| Oct    | 15\u00b0 | 9.7 |\n| Nov    | 15\u00b0 | 11.1 |\n| Dec    | 13\u00b0 | 10.8 |\n| Jan    | 14\u00b0 | 13     |\n| Feb    | 14\u00b0 | 13.7   |\n| Mar    | 14\u00b0 | 13.5'  |\n| Apr    | 14\u00b0 | 11.2   |\n| May    | 15\u00b0 | 14.8   |\n| June   | 15\u00b0 | 14.47  |\n\nP.S.

He has also helped the Science Master in preparing for his lectures, and in the English literature of the other forms with quite satisfactory results.

Sewing lessons are also given.\n\nA large garden is planted, and the vegetables are used in the preparation of the noon-day meal. The children do most of the gardening under the supervision of Mr. Watts.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to report that Rev. H.G.L. Watts, the teacher at Day Star Day School has informed me he has to go to hospital for an X-ray examination and that it is probable he may be kept in the hospital for some time if he has to have an operation.\n\nWill you kindly advise me if these day school teachers are allowed a sick leave with pay, I am not familiar with this subject as in all my years with the Department I have never had a teacher sick long enough to take any notice of it.\n\nMr. Watts is a first class teacher and I would appreciate favorable consideration for him, if he requires a long leave.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 20, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your No. 11 of the 15th instant, in which you advise that Rev. H. G. L. Watts, teacher of the Day Star's Indian Day School, is unwell and will be confined to the hospital for some time.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Watts, the Department will allow him one month's leave with pay.\n\nPlease state what arrangements have been made to conduct the school during Mr. Watts' absence. Is it possible to obtain a substitute teacher or do you recommend that the school remain closed. You might let me have your views on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nDear Sir;\n\nIn answer to your letter #121-2-1 of the 20th inst regards the teacher at Day Star Day School being away in hospital I beg to say that for the present I beg to recommend that the school be left closed. If it appears later on that the school would be closed for an extensive period I will report it to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose the quarterly return from the teacher of the day school on Day Star Reserve for September quarter 1933.\n\nYour letter #121-2-1 of the 20th September last stated that this teacher could have leave for one month in case he was sick. You will note from his written remarks on the above return that he is in hospital. He thinks he will be back to work on November 1st next but I understand from other sources that he may never leave the hospital till they carry him out in a coffin as he is a very sick man.\n\nUnder the circumstances I think it would be advisable for the Department to request the Bishop to be ready to have a new teacher take over at this point on November 1st. Mrs Watts came back here and packed up all her furniture last week so she thinks she will be moving away.\n\nI understand that Mr Watts got $50.00 per annum salary less 10%, and Mrs Watts got $50.00 per annum for issuing rations and drugs, and $5.00 per month during school term for her work as janitor in the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 11, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the teacher of the Day Star Indian Day School. While it appears from your letter that it is very unlikely that Rev. Mr. Watts will be able to resume duties as teacher at this school, I would appreciate your making enquiry and advising the Department as soon as you have more information. Before making arrangements for a new teacher, we want to be absolutely certain that Mr. Watts will not be able to again take charge of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI am advised by Agent Waddy that he has reported to the Department the condition of the Reverend H. G. L. Watts, Teacher at the Day Star Day School. It has become necessary that Mr. Watts should be absent for at least one month in order to undergo an operation.\n\nThe Reverend Archdeacon Knowles has conferred with me regarding Mr. Watts' condition and also as to the advisability of providing a substitute teacher during his absence. The Archdeacon, Mr. Waddy, and myself are of the opinion that it is not necessary to have a substitute until it is ascertained that Mr. Watts may not be able to take up his duties again. There is no place for a substitute teacher to live and I am told that Mrs. Watts strongly objects to have anyone occupying her home during her absence. I trust the Department will approve of keeping the school closed temporarily until we know the outcome of Mr. Watts' operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir;-\n\nIn further reference to your letter #121-2-1 of September 20th last regarding leave of absence for Rev H.G.L. Watts, the teacher of the day school on the Day Star Indian Reserve, I beg to report that I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Watts stating that prospects of his returning to work at the end of October are negative, and he asks me to apply to the Department to extend his leave of absence until November 30th next.\n\nHis leave to October 31st with pay is granted in your letter, and I beg to recommend that he be allowed leave until November 30th next, the question of pay for November to be decided by regulations made by the Department.\n\nIn order that the Department may know where this gentleman is located I beg to say his address is \"The General Hospital, Toronto, Ont.\"\n\nIt will be seen from the many reports I sent in on the work of Mr. Watts that he was one of the best day school teachers to come to my notice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 17, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the condition of the Rev. H. G. L. Watts, teacher of the Day Star Indian Day School. The Department has also received a communication from Mr. Agent Waddy, stating that the prospects for his returning to work at the end of October are negative. He requests an extension of Mr. Watts' leave of absence until the end of November, next.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that it will not be necessary to provide a substitute teacher during his absence. This school may be closed, temporarily, until we know the outcome of Mr. Watts' operation. I would request that you inform Mr. Agent Waddy accordingly.\n\nI may add it is hoped that Mr. Watts will be able to resume duties on or about the first of December, next, and I shall be pleased to have a further report from you regarding his condition, stating if he will be able to resume duties before the end of the current year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir;-\n\nIn reference to your letter #121-2-1 of the 11th inst asking if I am definitely certain that Rev. Mr Watts will not resume his duties as teacher of the day school at Day Star Reserve, I beg to say that taking his letters and information given me by his wife I was absolutely certain until yesterday that he would not resume his duties; however, yesterday he got off the train here saying that the doctors had given him another lease of life that he had not been operated on but that he was not well but would resume his duties on November first next if he is strong enough. I will let the Department know what develops, if Mr. Watts gets well enough to teach again I will be very pleased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 23, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, informing the Department that Rev. Mr. Watts would probably resume duties as teacher of the Day Star Indian Day School on the first proxime. In this connection I have to say that a communication was received from Mr. Inspector Murison, who had received a letter from Mr. Watts, stating that the prospects for his returning to work at the end of the present month were negative, and he requested an extension of his leave of absence until the first of December, next. Mr. Murison was informed that the school might be closed temporarily until the end of November, if Mr. Watts was not able to resume duties before that time. However, if his health now permits him to return to work, he should re-open the school as soon as possible.\n\nIt is noted that you will inform the Department regarding developments, stating if Mr. Watts' health permits him to teach again and the date he begins duties. In any event, it will not be necessary to provide a substitute teacher before the first of December, at which time you should be in a position to state definitely whether Mr. Watts is able to continue the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nDear Sir;-\n\nIn reference to your letter #121-2-1 of October 23rd last and others of same file regards Rev. Mr. Watts the teacher on the Day Star Day School, I beg to say that I was at this school on the 6th inst and found the school in operation, Mr. Watts had resumed his duties on the 1st of November.\n\nIt is impossible to say how long his health will allow him to work, he is very frail, but he tells me he might as well be working as not, and that he will keep going as long as possible. I will keep in touch with him constantly and assist him where necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Hardy,\n\nI would be obliged if the Dept. were allow me to resign as teacher to date from Sept. 30, 1934. I have already advised Bishop Harding. My health is very bad.\n\nThanking yourself and the Department for all past favors.\n\nYour Watts will give up ration and drug issue at same time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. L. Watts\n\nDay Star.\nSep 10, 1934\nDear Sir;-\n\nI have the honor to enclose resignation of Rev H.G.L.Watts as teacher of the Day School at Day Star Reserve from Sept 30th next.\n\nMr. Watts is in very bad health.\n\nIf the Bishop does not get a new teacher Mr. Watts might continue for a short time after the date noted above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 18, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, in which you state that you have received the resignation of Rev. H. G. L. Watts as teacher of the Day Star Indian Day School. It is noted that his resignation is to take effect as soon as a successor can be secured.\n\nPlease let the Department know, as soon as possible, the name, age and qualifications of the teacher whom His Lordship the Bishop of Qu'Appelle recommends to succeed Mr. Watts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

H.G.L.Watts the teacher of the day school at Day Star Reserve, I beg to say that Mr. Watts has informed me he may have to teach till October 20th next, it appears that he comes under some church pension scheme and cannot obtain his superannuation unless he continues as missionary on the reserve till this date, so he will continue to teach till this time if the Department has no objection.\n\nI beg to recommend that this be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 26, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nIt is noted from your letter of the 19th instant that the Rev.

INSPECTOR HAMILTON, DATED APRIL 19TH, 1929, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE DAY STAR INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nA noon-day meal is supplied for the children and this is prepared by Mrs. Watts and served in the basement of the school. However, this is very unsatisfactory as the basement is only 10 x 12, and the furnace takes up most of the room. An addition built to the kitchen of the teacher's residence would make a much more suitable dining room for the children and would make the work easier for Mrs. Watts. This room would not need to be more than 10 x 12 and would not entail any great expense. There is no fence surrounding the school grounds and it is very discouraging to try to grow a garden when it is impossible to keep the stock away. These grounds and the garden should be fenced, which would also greatly add to the appearance of the place.\n\nTrouble was experienced this spring by the water getting into the basement of the school. I found that the only window in the basement is partly below the ground level and consequently the water runs in around the window. This could be remedied by digging down and placing a cement wall about a foot away from the window allowing this wall to come up above the level of the ground. It will require possibly a couple of bags of cement.\n\nThere is no barn at this school, consequently, Mr. Watts is unable to keep a horse or cow and is obliged to depend on the Indians when he wishes to leave the reserve. This is very unsatisfactory and a small barn 12 x 14 would meet the requirements.\nSir\u2014\n\nI have received a letter from the Reverend H.G.L. Watts, teacher at the Bay Star day school, asking if the Department would secure, free of charge, from the Ontario Government Picture Bureau some films which he can utilize to give picture shows on the reserve from time to time. He informs me that the films cost from .25\u00a2 to .50\u00a2 a reel, depending on its nature. He has been having these picture shows for some time, having purchased a moving picture outfit at a cost of $225.00 and he thinks that an occasional gathering of Indians on the reserve will help to break them away from their \"old pow wows\". The style of films that he suggests are varied and he says they should cover sport, travel, hunting, manners and customs, industry, forestry, and agriculture, and thinks that these will have an educational value. He states that the cost to him of having one of these picture shows is about $10.00 to $12.00 an evening.\n\nWill the Department advise me whether it would consider Mr. Watts' proposal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, enclosing Inspector Hamilton's report on his inspection of the Bay Star Indian Day School, I have to say that the Department will approve of your incurring an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $40 in having a fence erected around the school grounds, in order that the teacher can conduct a garden. You may also incur an expenditure of approximately $50 in putting up a small log barn for the teacher and in making the repairs suggested by the Inspector to the window in the basement of the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 312-11 of the 24th ultimo, relative to the request of the teacher of the Day Star Indian Day School to be furnished with moving picture films and that the Department arrange for rental of same.\n\nIn a similar case at the File Hills Indian Residential School, the Department has allowed a grant of $75.00 per year for the renting of films but would not be prepared to provide this amount in the case of the Day Star School. We will allow an amount not exceeding $25.00 to cover the cost of the rental of films that would be suitable for the purpose for which the teacher requires them. Mr. Watts may make his own arrangements for obtaining the films and the Department will pay the cost of their rental upon receipt of a properly certified voucher, in duplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This was the amount I suggested in my letter of the 23rd ultimo when forwarding Inspector A. G. Hamilton's report on the schools in the Touchwood Agency. The Inspector is now at the Agency attending to several matters, and informs me that this is hardly sufficient for the purpose, and forwards an itemized statement showing that the cost will be $85.00.\n\nI shall be glad if you can arrange for authority to expend this latter amount, and also an additional $10.00 in making the needed alterations to the window in the basement of the school building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

This is the source of the water supply for the School and Teacher's Residence. He states that until last year they got about 14 pails of water from the well before it was dry, then it took some hours to fill again. Last Fall it got down to 10 pails, this Spring to 6 pails, and now they get 1\u00bd pails and then have to wait all day before they can get any more.\n\nHe states the well is 60 feet deep, and it looks as though it has drained all the water out of the local area. It is his opinion that a new well, some distance away, at a similar depth, might get water, although there is no assurance that it would. He states the cost would be approximately $125.00, and asks if he may have authority to proceed with the work.\n\nIf funds are available, I would recommend that Mr. Waddy's request be acceded to.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

This machine is very old and is completely worn out, and cannot be used any more. We are in very bad need of a new one to take its place. This is particularly needed this year as we now have eleven girls among our enrollment.\n\nAs you are aware Mrs Torpey teaches the girls, among other things, to make clothes for themselves &c. This includes both hand and machine sewing, and also the proper care of a sewing machine. The girls are very apt pupils in this subject, and as you know, have turned out some really good work. The dresses worn by the girls when they went to Touchwood last June to see the King and Queen, were all made by the girls themselves. You will agree, I think that this is something which is of real value to the girls after they have left school. I should be glad therefore if you would forward this request for a new sewing machine to the Department.\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\nF. E. Torpey\n\nTOUCHWOOD AGENCY\nNOV 18 1939\nPunnichy, Sask.\nPunnichy, Sask.\nNov 16 1939.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nI have the honor to enclose request from the teacher at the Day Star Day School for a new sewing machine for use of girl pupils.\n\nWhat he says about need of the machine is admitted, but knowing how funds are these times I hesitate in asking that it be supplied. No mention of need of machine was made so it could be placed in the estimates at any time.\n\nIf you have no surplus funds there is no special reason why the girls should not sew by hand for a while, it will take up more time, but time really means little on a reserve. However, if funds are sufficient the machine would be used if it is supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nNovember 22, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant I regret that owing to lack of funds it is not possible to purchase, at the present time, a sewing machine for use at the Day Star school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I think if we put on rubberoid paper it will be suitable.

He states that the well was dug two years ago and wasn't quite satisfactory at the beginning, with only 3 ft. of water.\n\nA new well is necessary and Mr. Waddy estimates that it would cost around $150.00 to dig one and provide cribbing. I have written to Mr. Waddy since then asking him to make a further investigation to see if this well could not be lowered a little and water obtained at least for the present time.\n\nHe advised me today that to deepen this well would be impracticable as there is a rock formation at the bottom which could only be moved by blasting and the size of the hole is not large enough for a man to work in.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nOttawa,\nNovember 30, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere is an Indian day school on the Day Star Indian Reserve in the Province of Saskatchewan. This is located in Township 30, Range 16, west of the Second Meridian. Two years ago a well was dug to a depth of 60 feet but it is now practically dry and a request has been received for authority to dig a new well. Have you any information indicating if there is any likelihood of securing a plentiful supply of water in the neighbourhood mentioned? If so, please let me know to what depth you consider a well should be dug.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.T.D. Wiskenden,\nWater Supply & Boring Section,\nMines & Geology Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nVictoria Memorial Museum,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. R.E. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare\nand Training, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWith reference to your inquiry concerning the probability of getting a good supply of water near the Indian day school on the Day Star Reserve in Saskatchewan, I may say that the chances of getting a good supply are only fair, anywhere in that area.\n\nThe water occurs in irregularly distributed porous zones in the glacial drift in that area. The glacial drift may be as much as 250 feet thick in places. To try another well in the immediate vicinity would probably only yield the same results as the present well. It might be better to deepen the present well by drilling. The chances are fair that water may be reached within 200 feet. No good supplies of water are obtained in the bedrock formations below the glacial drift in this area and drilling should not be carried deeper than the top of the bedrock. The bedrock is a tough grey shale without pebbles or stones.\n\nIf there is any doubt about the identification of the material we will be glad to identify any samples sent to us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.T.D. Wickenden\nOfficer in Charge,\nGround Water and Borings Section,\nGEOLOGICAL SURVEY.\nOttawa,\nNovember 29, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant regarding the well at the Day Star School I attach, for your information, a copy of a letter which has just been received from the Geological Survey. In your letter you stated that it would be impracticable to drill the present well deeper and from the attached report it is evident that there is no likelihood of obtaining water if another well were drilled. Under these circumstances, and due to the fact that funds are limited, no further action can be taken in regard to this matter at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

CHRISTIANSON,\nGeneral Supt. of Indian Agencies, REGINA, Sask.,\ndated July 24, 1941.\n\nBoth the teacher's residence and the school are in good state of repair, and the same applies to the grounds. However, the water situation is a real problem here. I believe a 60 ft. well was put down about five years ago and this has gone practically dry. The only way water can be obtained from the well is by drawing it with a small pail as there isn't sufficient water left to use the pump. In my opinion, whether Mr. Torpey comes back or not, someone will be there and a new well should be put down. No doubt they will find water at about the same depth, 60 ft., and this would cost $1.50 per ft. or about $125.00.\nMr J.W.Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nFunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe following articles are required for use of this school for the coming year:\n\n1. Pail for wells.\n2. Corn brooms.\n3. Scotch brooms.\n4. Scouring brushes.\n5. Tea towels.\n6. Bars, Lifebuoy Soap.\n7. Bars Laundry Soap.\n8. Panes Glass 18 x 18.\n9. Panes Glass 6 x 10.\n10. Stove Kettle (3 qts.) Enamel.\n\nThere is a large piece of plaster in the ceiling of the school which has fallen down and needs replacing.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF.E. Torrey\nDear Sir:\n\nI would be obliged if the Department would authorise purchase of list of material enclosed for the Day Star Day School to cost about $12.50.\n\nThe teacher also asks that the plaster be repaired on the school ceiling, I could get an Indian carpenter to do this job, cost would be about $3.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nP.S. I have copy of list here.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 15, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant you may purchase the following articles for use at the Day Star Day School:\n\n- 1 Pail for well\n- 5 Corn brooms\n- 2 Combs\n- 2 Scrub brushes\n- 6 Tea towels\n- 12 Bars Lifebuoy soap\n- 6 Bars laundry soap\n- 1 Pane glass 12 x 16\n- 2 Panes glass 8 x 10\n- 1 New kettle, 9 qts., enamel\n\nYou may also expend an amount of $3.00 in repairing the plaster.\n\nThe 18 tooth brushes will be sent from the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nDay Star Indian School,\nFennicky, Sask.\nSept/6/41.\n\nMr J.W.Maddy,\nIndian Agent,\nFennicky, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: School Dinners 1941/2.\n\nI shall require supplies to the amount of Sixty Dollars for the school lunches for the coming school year.\n\nI would point out that as there is no issue of Biscuits Bread has to be supplied to take their place. I would also draw attention to the fact that the prices which I have to pay for supplies locally is considerably higher than what paid by the Department when purchasing supplies in large quantities.\n\nThere will be fourteen or fifteen children to provide for this year.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.E. Torrey\nDear Sir;-\n\nI would be obliged if you will advise me what is allowed for school luncheons at the following day schools in this fiscal year.\n\nDay Star\nFishing Lake.\n\nMr. Torpey of Day Star says he requires more than was allowed last year as the biscuits and not supplied now and the price of other goods has gone up, he asks for $60.00, about $10.00 a month for the cold months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 22, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant it is not possible for the Department to increase the amount provided for midday meal purposes. Consequently an amount of $40.00 will be allowed for serving a midday lunch at the Day Star Indian Day School during the academic year 1941-45. This amount should be sufficient to supply a midday lunch for the winter months only.\n\nWhat has been said above regarding Day Star applies also to the Fishing Lake School at which an amount of $40.00 will also be allowed for the purchase of midday meal supplies during the academic year 1941-45.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

In the meantime it will be necessary to dig a well for this School.\n\nMr. Waddy informs me that Mr. McRobbie, a well driller, has just moved his outfit on the Poorman Reserve to dig a well there. [Mr. McRobbie] has made the same offer to Mr. Waddy to dig a well on the Day Star Reserve at the price of $225.00 plus cribbing estimated to cost $50.00. In this case the understanding is similar to that in connection with the Poorman Reserve, that is, if no water is found Mr. McRobbie will not be paid.\n\nOn the other hand Mr. McRobbie will dig a well for $1.50 per ft. plus cribbing. This might be the cheaper deal because from past experience it is found that water is obtained on the Day Star Reserve at a depth of between 60 and 80 ft. The last well drilled there was 70 ft. in depth, at which point a rock was struck and the machine could not go down any further. It might be advisable to take this matter up with the Engineering Branch as there is some assurance of getting water at this depth and the rate per ft. will be the best way of drilling it as it would cost us around $100.00 more or less, plus cribbing.\n\nAs stated above, since Mr. McRobbie has just started on Poorman Reserve he will be prepared to move on to Day Star immediately after and I would therefore request that this matter be dealt with immediately and I be advised by Air Mail of the Department's decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

However, if you do not consider this action advisable you may arrange with Mr. McRobbie to dig a new well. In the event of digging a new well you may decide whether it should be dug by contract or by the method suggested in the third paragraph of your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. M.

A reply should be received some time this month and we will likely be in a position to know by the end of November if we are going to secure a teacher. If it is necessary to keep the building heated during the month of November, in order to avoid freezing the water in the tank in the basement, you may incur the necessary expenditure mentioned in your letter. However, if we do not secure a teacher by the end of November I believe that the tank should be drained, as it appears undesirable to continue the expenditure for wood the whole winter simply to keep the water in the tank from freezing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R.S.

This is for the well at the Day Star Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Davis informs me that the pump there is old and broken down and it is very hard to pump water from a well that is 65' deep. He actually wanted a double action pump so as to make the pumping easier but upon enquiring here we find that double action pumps are not on the market. Besides they are of the opinion that the double action pump is harder to handle in a deep well. It was therefore suggested that a $25\" cylinder with a 1\u00bd\" pipe be furnished. The price is $24.95 for the cylinder and pump head as quoted by McPherson and Thom who are agents for the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company.\n\nWith reference to the pipes Mr. Davis was unable to give us the size of the present ones that are being used. However, he said it does not matter what size the pipes required are as he will attend to that. Therefore he has not asked for pipes for the cylinder but I would think that he will require piping as well and the prices quoted were for galvanized pipes at $.24 per ft. As for the rods he can use those at present in use.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nNovember 22, 1944.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Scarth & Victoria, Regina,\nSask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, you may purchase the new pump and cylinder for the Day Star School. It is noted that the cost of this will be $24.95. Purchase of the quantity of pipes required is also authorized.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nI attach account amounting to $75.00 covering the cost of supplies purchased for mid-day meal purposes at the Day Star Indian Day School.
