SPOEPENKOYE FORGETS THAT IT IS WASH DAY.\n\n\"Say, my dear,\" whispered Mr. Spoepenkoye, eagerly, as he entered the dining-room and approaching his wife with a broad grin on his visage, \"say, my dear, Specklewhite has sent word that he will dine with us.\"\n\n\"Gentleman's dinner!\" exclaimed Mrs. Spoepenkoye, dropping her work and looking at her husband as though she had seen a ghost. \"What did that man come to-day for? Don't he know it's wash day?\"\n\n\"He came for dinner,\" resumed Mr. Spoepenkoye, turning pale from ear to ear. \"What d'ye suppose he came for, he came for dinner! What's wash day got to do with it? Think of it, he's coming in a tub and bring over clothes line with a muddy wooden pin astride the saddle\u2014what a gentleman! He'll come for grand and you want to hustle around and get it pretty lively for him. I'll begin to serve up things myself before long.\"\n\n\"But, my dear,\" protested Mrs. Spoepenkoye, \"there's nothing in the house.\"\n\n\"There's no clothes in the house,\" added Mr. Spoepenkoye, who had utterly forsworn the use of the tub when he visited his friend Mr. Specklewhite. \"There's no clothes in the house\u2014to get him out of the scrape some how, and at the same time not let him know it. Put on the clothes, put the clothes on a plate and set them before him. You can explain in his absence that you were forced to keep like a dog in hot weather. I'll hold his hands, so long as he has the clothes to eat.\"\n\n\"You don't imagine he would want to eat the clothes, do you?\" asked Mrs. Spoepenkoye, innocently.\n\n\"Just try him,\" yelled Mr. Spoepenkoye, dashing out of the room in a fit of being taken literally. \"Just try him and ring in some of the natural grace you always partake of.\" Mr. Spoepenkoye, however, was not one of those men who permit Mr. Spoepenkoye to hold the legs or trousers of a woman under his skirts, and while Mrs. Spoepenkoye had never heard of Specklewhite, have a little of this pretense of speech! Mr. Spoepenkoye waited, holding his breath, then, first, a pillow case and a piece of the pillow sham. Dear Mr. Spoepenkoye, pray let me help you out of this scrape. You are in need of a pair of Stafford cuffs! I know what you need, and though they are not as good as\u2014\"\n\n\"Come now, you're going too far,\" continued Mr. Spoepenkoye, raising a very sarcastic remark with a shrug and present himself before his wife all set to go to town to have dinner at Specklewhite's at seven o'clock.\n\n\"Well, how old was he when he died?\"\n\n\"Beat forty.\"\n\n\"Had he enjoyed good health?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sah, de bestestest man yer ever see.\"\n\n\"Did he have a lingering disease?\"\n\n\"What sorta 'scuse?\"\n\n\"Was he sick very long?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sah. He dropped off mighty sudden.\"\n\n\"Heart disease?\"\n\n\"No sah.\"\n\n\"Did the doctor attend him?\"\n\n\"No, sah.\"\n\n\"Well, what did they say was the matter?\"\n\n\"Do think he much o' witches.\" One o' them cumped up an' put his year ago, said he didn't, said he'd be well done comin' fer dinner. But he dropped off quick, cut him down an' put him in a box. I think that he had heart failure, bess. Tho', I thought he had somethin' trouble with his neck.\"\n\n\"Well, look here, I don't believe that you ever heard of Specklewhite.\"\n\n\"I have, sah, but I don't know, since yer gay partner in yer family history second day, sah.\u2014Advocator Traveler.\"\n\nTEACHER WANTED.\n\nJ.
