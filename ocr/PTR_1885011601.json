In the fresh order of things which necessarily surround him in the new country in which he is induced to throw himself, especially in its causes as well as to bring about utterly unsatisfactory state of things. Of course it is natural enough that in countries which have become over-populated, there is where the political capital has been brought larger than can be supported by the natural productive powers of the land combined, these members of society who have managed to obtain titles of unmixed satisfaction on the case, should recognize the law of humanity requiring them to make some provision for the actual existence of their weaker brethren, till the easiest provisions for securing their existence are made away. It is not always a question whether they should or should not, recognizing the humanitarian requirement to make some provision for the actual existence of their weaker brethren, till the easiest provisions for securing their existence are made away. It is therefore incumbent upon all those who have obtained titles to their lands by means of unscrupulous means to make every effort to advertise their want of a useful population to occupy their vacant lands. That this may be a wise policy for the old countries may be allowed, but while the modern world is so easy to divine, the mentality of men or even the humanity of the proceed, seeing more than doubtful. In a general way there seems little reason to dispute the logical conclusion that some time will come when the lands of Britain, covered by the wishes and strangled by a large portion of the civilized world, will be sought after by those, so it is not unnatural to see whether those who have accomplished the strange feats of existence under the maltreated colonial condition of an aged civilization are the suitable subjects to select to overcome the vastly greater natural difficulties of a new country. It may be said that nature, just as when left to herself, will in time regulate matters so it cannot now be stated what will the regulate the emigration from one country to another, but unfortunately in this respect artificial civilization is interposed over nature's own assignment of duties, and means of lowering the eternal and energetic who require a bigger field wherein to exercise their energies to enormous, holds out false hopes and promises, and having done the former, produces a result which crumbles down like a broken fort in a land, where they believe their paths may be sewn with glory. Now, however much the people who adopt this policy may put off the experiment, they must do it just as much must the new country suffer. Of course we cannot pretend to deal with individual instances in detail, for undoubtedly there are cases in which the attempt was made both for the largest energies and produce the most splendid results of a most stirring nature, but these are few and far between. What we mean to say is that on the whole the police force necessary to maintain a new country, is decidedly that number was assigned to us the subject of the experiment. To illustrate in a most general way what constitutes our contention, it will be sufficient to produce a statement that if a new district be created, and that sits without any difficulties whatever, it will be found that immediately the new settlers will have nothing but competition for their services, while the market is ruined by the mere fact that the merchants are ruined by over competition, and the end is universal failure. We want settlers here, as much as elsewhere, but unless they are prepared at least to take up the work of nature, such as obtaining timber, clearing land, etc., the market is ruined by the mere fact that the merchants are ruined by over competition, and the end is universal failure. We want settlers here, as much as elsewhere, but unless they are prepared even to go out and root up trees to make firewood, the market is ruined by the mere fact that the merchants are ruined by over competition, and the end is universal failure. We want settlers here, as much as elsewhere, but unless they are prepared even to go out and root up trees to make firewood, the market is ruined by the merchants being ruined by over competition, and the end is universal failure.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 26th last week, Sir A. Macdonald introduced in his historic speech before Parliament, that the Premier's plan does not disclose any indication of the intention of the government regarding the Canadian Pacific Railway, which is the most disappointing feature of the scheme. He is opposed in England and seems destined to coincide with the Imperial Government's views concerning the North-West interests. It may be noted that the Canadian Pacific Railway bill is likely to become an accomplished fact during the next two weeks.\nOn Tuesday last the old country team played off for the medal won by them from the Canada team last year. The medal was presented by Mr. J. G. Macdonald, brother of Mr. H. Macdonald, of N.W.T., by whom the game was arranged. The members of the Club promised it immediately after the conclusion of the game. The weather was very fine and the game was played in the open air. Mr. Macdonald has been very fortunate this season as he won the second medal, which was the second highest prize by teams shipped by him.\n\nThe teams were:\n\nT. J. Agnew, J. W. Macdonald,\nW. H. Mitchell, W. N. Macdonald,\nT. S. Macdonald, A. Macdonald,\nMacdonald, son, J. J. Macdonald, etc.\n\nA very interesting race was played on the track on Saturday last between two riders chosen by Messrs. J. Simler and Mr. J. Macdonald, who were the proprietors of the horses. The riders were:\n\nR. Middleton, B. H. Montgomery,\nB. Gibson, A. Macdonald,\nG. T. Smith, J. J. Macdonald.\n\nJust arrived at Clark's Drug Store, Grey Street, a splendid selection of Imperial Dyers, including Methylene, R. B. Dyes, and a full assortment of Diamond Dyes.\n\nA bunch of keys on a ring, with A. E. Harris's name on it, addressed, was lost near the corner of Main and Second streets on the evening of the 19th inst., and will be returned by leaving them at the Town office.\n\nPOLICE NEWS.\n\nSept. 20th. Inspector Morris has been transferred from Battleford to Carlton.\n\nSergeant Proctor stationed at Carlton and Corp. O'Brien at Moose Jaw.\n\nCorp. C. Leonard has been promoted to the rank of Sergeant.\n\nSupt. Carter and Gagnon paid a visit to the detachment here.\n\nSept. 20th. Inspector Morris inspected the men of the detachment on full dress parade and left a complaint against a man named Hartfield.\n\nCHIEF COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nAn important meeting of the Board of Trade, including, Lord of Energy, Lewis Appelgate, Mr. Macdonald, and constable, was held at the office yesterday afternoon.\n\nThere was a discussion last month in the House of Lords about a subject of the last importance to England and her colonies, viz., the question of the appointment of our coal mining stations abroad. Of course in time of war neutral coaling stations are closed to belligerents, and as our warships can only carry a few days' supply, it becomes necessary to maintain coaling stations in neutral countries to keep our merchant vessels in a fairly good position should they be unable to hold their own stations at which to take in coal.\n\nThe recent appointment of Capt. Dunn as superintendent of the Regina District is said to be causing dissatisfaction amongst the other officers of the force. The appointment has been made over the heads of many officers who have been serving in the service, and the new superintendent is stated to be so blindly ignorant of Indian negotiations that a junior has to assist him when anything important turns up.\n\nThis has been the result of lack of satisfactory appointments in the Mounted Police. What was there in either his record or his standing, even justified the appointment of Inspector Morris, late of Calgary, who has been found to be a gaining belief that a man's record has been having little of late to do with his promotion. Men like Inspector Steel, of long service and acknowledged merit, are the ones who promote, and not men whose only \"record\" are of their lack and not of their deserts\u2014Calgary Herald.\n\nEMMANUEL COLLEGE\n\nPRINCIPAL:\nThe Rev.
