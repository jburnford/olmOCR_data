Sykes Gamble, C.I.E., M.A., F.R.S., late of the Indian Forest Department.\n\nFour volumes of this work, in 21 Parts, have already appeared, the first three containing the Thalamiflor\u00e6, Disciflor\u00e6 and Calyciflor\u00e6, by Sir George King, K.C.I.E., LL.D., F.R.S.; the fourth containing Gamopetal\u00e6 by Sir George King and Mr. J. S. Gamble. The first two volumes were entirely Sir George King\u2019s own work; in the third volume the large Family of Leguminos\u00e6 was done by Lt.-Col. D. Prain, at that time Curator of the Herbarium, Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta, the genus Sonerila in Melastomace\u00e6 by Dr. O. Stapf of Kew, and the rest by Sir G. King. In the fourth volume, Lt.-Col. Prain also did Convolvulace\u00e6, Solanace\u00e6, Scrophulariace\u00e6, Labiatae and a few other Families; the Acanthace\u00e6 were done by the late Mr. C. B. Clarke, F.R.S.; and the Gesnerace\u00e6 were compiled from Mr. H. N. Ridley\u2019s work on that Family in the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. The other Families were done by either Sir G. King or Mr. Gamble.\n\nThe section of the \u2018Materials\u2019 dealing with the Monocotyledons appeared in 1907-8. It was a separate publication entitled \u201cMaterials for a Flora of the Malay Peninsula\u2014Monocotyledons, by H. N. Ridley, M.A., F.R.S., etc., Director of Botanic Gardens, Singapore, S.S. (Methodist Publishing House, Singapore),\u201d and really forms the concluding portion of this work.\n\nThis number is the first of Vol. V, which is intended to contain the Monochlamyde\u00e6 and the Gymnosperms; and, owing to the sad occurrence of the death of Sir George King which took place almost\non the very day that Part 21\u2014the last one of Vol. IV\u2014appeared, Mr. Gamble is alone responsible for it. He has been promised help by various Botanists, and especially by Major A. T. Gage, I.M.S., the present Superintendent of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta; and hopes that with this kind assistance the whole work may soon be fully completed.\n\nThe present contribution contains the account of the Families No. 93 Nyctaginaceae, No. 94 Amaranthaceae, No. 95 Polygonaceae, No. 97 Aristolochiaceae, No. 99 Chloranthaceae, No. 102 Lauraceae and No. 103 Hernandiaceae, all the work of Mr. Gamble except No. 95 Polygonaceae which has been contributed by Major Gage. The seven Families dealt with contain 33 genera and 189 species, of which 1 genus and 78 species were new. The new species have been published in the Kew Bulletin.\n\nIn accordance with the Rules adopted by the Vienna Conference, the measurements in this volume will be given in the metric system; and it is hoped that this change will not prove an inconvenience.\n\nFamily XCIII.\u2014NYCTAGINACEAE.\n\nHerbs, shrubs or trees.

Perfect stamens 9, those of the 1st row introrse, opposite the outer 3 lobes of the perianth; those of the 2nd row introrse, opposite the 3 inner lobes; within and alternate with the stamens 6 stipitate glands; slightly within these again the 3 extrorse stamens of the 3rd row opposite the stamens of the 1st row; again, slightly within these, 3 stipitate cordate staminodes opposite the stamens of the 2nd row. Ovary sessile at the bottom of the perianth-tube in which it is enclosed; style shortly exserted; stigma obtuse or capitate. Fruit wholly enclosed in the perianth-tube which is accrescent, drupaceous, hardened or fleshy, smooth or ribbed, the mouth occluded, the limb deciduous or more or less persistent; pericarp membranous or thinly crustaceous, more or less free from the perianth-tube. Seed with a membranous testa often not separable from the pericarp; cotyledons thick, fleshy; radicle minute.\u2014Distrib. Species about 40, tropical and subtropical, in both hemispheres.\n\nI have followed Bentham (Fl. Austral. V. 294) and Koorders and Valeton (Bijdr. X. 211) in describing the glands as free and alternate with the stamens of the 1st and 2nd row instead of being attached to those of the 3rd. If a fully open flower is examined it will be seen that the glands are inserted between the stamens of the 2nd and 3rd rows. If such a flower is flattened out carefully and the staminodes and 3rd row stamens removed (they often come away together in a ring), the 6 outer stamens and the 6 glands alternate with\nthem will be easily apparent. The glands are slightly in front of the 6 outer stamens and slightly behind the 3 inner and the staminodes.\n\nLeaves 3-ribbed (Sect. 1.

Ridley's 5849 has the perianth-tube longer than it is in the other specimens, but this is probably due to the flowers being on the verge of the fruiting stage.\n\n11. **Cryptocarya areolata**, Gamble in Kew Bull. 144 (1910).

Tropical and subtropical Asia, in India, Burma, the Malayan Peninsula and Archipelago eastwards to Japan, south to the Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand; scarce in Africa and America: species from 150 to 200.\n\nIn preparing the following key, I have reluctantly been obliged to abandon the idea of arranging the species under the old subgenera having found the task almost impossible. However, in avoiding characters taken from the flowers and relying chiefly upon those of the leaves, inflorescence and fruit, I think I may have made it more easy to follow in the field, where a worker can only very rarely have at his command specimens of both \u2642 and \u2640 plants as well as of the fruit. It may not be out of place to sound a note of warning as to the fruit; the enlarged perianth forming the cupule varies greatly as it develops gradually to maturity; and mature specimens are quite necessary for proper identification. The flowers in this genus are very variable but in a single umbellule there are usually one or two flowers with the normal number of parts, the rest frequently varying considerably from them, the central flower often having more than the normal number.\n\nI need say little on the reasons for the adoption of Litsea, Lamk., as the generic name; for the subject was fully gone into first by Jussieu in the Annales d\u2019Hist.

I have been in doubt whether I should not follow Merrill and call it L. tersa, Merrill, in Philipp. Journ. of Sc.

Litsea tomentosa, Blume Bijdr. 566 (1825). A tree reaching 15\u201420 m. in height and a diameter of bole of 45 to 60 cm.; branchlets stout, rough, puberulous, uppermost and innovations tawny-pubescent; buds oblong. Leaves membranous when young, chartaceous when older, obovate or oblong-obovate, abruptly short-acuminate at apex, cuneate at base; upper surface shining, puberulous when young, afterwards glabrous except on the midrib and main nerves, lower surface minutely grey-tawny-pubescent; 12\u201420 cm. long, 4\u201410 cm. broad; midrib stout, broad, pubescent; main\nnerves 12\u201415 pairs, straight at first afterwards curved near the margin; transverse nervules prominent in old leaves, reticulation minutely netted; petiole 2\u20143 cm. long, stout, tawny-pubescent.\n\nFlowers in umbellules, in dense axillary or lateral bracteate clusters on a very short stout common peduncle about 5 mm. long; bracts oblong, densely grey-pubescent without; umbellule-peduncles thick, grey-pubescent, 5 mm. long; involucral bracts 4, orbicular, concave, grey-pubescent without, glabrous within, about 4 mm. in diam.; flowers in umbellule 5, on short pedicels 2 mm. long; perianth-lobes small, incomplete, ovate-acute or sublinear, sometimes missing.\n\nStamens of \u2642 flowers \"20\u201424 slightly longer than the perianth lobes, with villous filaments; glands about 8\u201412, obconic, stipitate, hidden in the villous hairs of the tube; rudimentary ovary small glabrous; stigma 0.\" Staminodes of \u2640 flowers many (up to 30) densely imbedded in stiff tawny hairs; those of outer rows spathulate on slender villous filaments, those of inner rows with a pair of stalked clavate glands inserted at the bases of the filaments.

Java.\n\nThe leaves of Curtis specimens are thicker and stouter than those of Kunstler, but they are older; and the inflorescence (\u2640 in both) is the same. This is apparently the oldest use of the specific name tomentosa: the S. Indian L. tomentosa, Wall. Cat. 2550 will have to be called L. apetala. The descriptions of the stamens (\u2642) and fruit are taken from Koorders and Valeton. The Javan specimen in Herb. Kew (\u2640) has the leaves rather broader and more obovate than is the case with the Peninsular ones; but in other respects it agrees, and I see no reason to doubt the identification.\n\n3. Litsea Johorensis, Gamble in Kew Bull. 315 (1910). A small evergreen tree with smooth white bark; branchlets grey, rather slender, the uppermost densely red-brown-tomentose as are the lanceolate buds, the petioles and undersurface of the leaves and the inflorescence.

Flowers in umbellules on slender tomentose peduncles 15 mm. long (\u2642) several together on hard woody tubercles with rugosely scarred cylindric branches up to 18 mm. long on the tree-trunk; the umbellules when open reaching 15 mm. in diam. (\u2642), or 10 mm. (\u2640); involucral bracts 4\u20145, orbicular, concave, tomentose without, glabrous within; flowers in each umbellule 6\u20147, subsessile; perianth-lobes 6, oblong or spatulate, obtuse, sparsely villous, 5\u20147 mm. long, much gland-dotted. Stamens of \u2642 flowers variable in number, normally 9, but often 10, those of the outer rows up to 9 mm. long with large 3 mm. long oblong anthers and slender slightly villous filaments, sometimes with 1 or 2 small glands at the base, those of the inner row shorter and with a pair of reniform and usually emarginate shortly stipitate glands at the base itself; anther-cells very large, elliptic-oblong, the upper introrse, the lower lateral; rudimentary ovary ovoid; style thick; stigma spreading, bifid. Staminodes of \u2640 flowers variable in number, normally 9 but often up to 12, those of the outer rows linear subulate, slender, slightly villous, 3 mm. long, sometimes with glands at their bases; those of the inner rows triangular-acuminate with 2 large basal glands, 1 mm. long.

Fruit (immature) ovoid, truncate at apex, apiculate, half-enclosed in the hemispheric rough persistent perianth-tube 6 mm. long and 10 mm. in diam. at the mouth which is entire or lobed and bears remains of the perianth-lobes and staminodes; enlarged pedicel very stout, short; pericarp smooth.\n\nJohore: at Tanyong Bunga, Ridley 6458!, near Castlewood, Ridley 9163!, at the Mount Austen, Ridley 11995!, at Seduah, Ridley 13479!\n\nThis species comes rather near to L. cauliflora, Stapf in Trans. Linn. Soc. 2nd Ser. IV. 219 collected by Haviland on Mt. Kinabalu in Borneo at 5000 ft.,\nbut the venation of the leaves is different and the umbellules are much larger. The specimens of the \u2640 flowers and young fruit were found separate with Ridley's No. 6458 which is otherwise \u2642; they must have been collected on a different tree.\n\n4. **Litsea trunciflora**, Gamble in Kew Bull. 316 (1910). A handsome evergreen tree reaching 18 m. in height and 30\u201440 cm. in diam. of stem; bark of stem greyish-brown, smooth; branchlets rather stout, pale brown, the uppermost and lanceolate buds and the petioles of the leaves dark brown rusty-tomentose. **Leaves** chartaceous, alternate; obovate or oblanceolate, rounded or emarginate at apex, long-cuneate-attenuate at base; upper surface shining, glabrous except the villous midrib, areolate-reticulate, lower blue-green when fresh, pale grey-brown when dry, softly rusty-tomentose especially on the nerves; margin recurved; 28\u201456 cm. long, 11\u201422 cm. broad; midrib very stout, impressed above, much raised beneath; main nerves 16\u201422 pairs, impressed above, prominent beneath, often branched and with secondary nerves between, starting usually at from 70\u00b0\u201480\u00b0 or sometimes at right angles to the midrib, at first straight but curving near the margin to meet in irregular loops; transverse nervules distant, irregular, often branched, prominent, enclosing the areolate reticulation which is best seen on the upper surface; petiole very stout, flattened above, 1\u00b75\u20142\u00b75 cm. long. **Flowers** in umbellules on rather slender pubescent peduncles 10\u201415 mm. long (\u2642) 7\u20148 mm.

The old specimens of the Calcutta Herbarium were fortunately carefully arranged some years ago by Sir George King according to varieties. According to this arrangement, the most general form, that apparently described as such in the Fl. Br. Ind., is the var. ochracea, Blume, which is described above and that most easily separable is var. fusco-tomentosa, Meissn., which is maintained in the Fl. Br. Ind. and often has stamens with only 2 cells. Were it not for Sir George King's careful work, I should have preferred to follow Koorders and Valeton and treat the whole species as one with forms gradually passing from one to the other, but I think var. fusco-tomentosa above-mentioned and var. angusta, Meissn., also admitted in the Fl. Br. Ind., are clear enough. I have further added var. attenuata, the form with large leaves long acuminate at apex and attenuate at base; but of this I have more doubt, for the specimens graduate into the general form on the one hand and into angusta on the other.\n\nVar. fusco-tomentosa, Meissn. l.c. Leaves, branchlets and innovations densely villous with long golden-tawny hairs; the leaves variable, usually ovate or ovate-oblong but sometimes even oblanceolate or obovate, usually cuspidate-acuminate at apex, rounded at base but occasionally acute, the length often up to 20 cm., the breadth to nearly 10 cm.; main nerves up to 20 pairs, the lowest pairs close together; branchlets often zigzag. Flowers as in type, but stamens often only 2-celled, apparently by loss of the partitions between the upper and lower cells. Hook. f. Fl. Br. Ind.

Brandis has shown that it also fails in *Lindera*.\n\n**Var. angusta**, Meissn. l.c.; Hook. f. in Fl. Br.

Java (Zollinger 317!, Junghuhn 760!, 761!; De Vriese, Lobb, Kurz); Borneo (Ridley 12429!).\nRidley writes that this plant is not really wild in Singapore, but was probably introduced from Java and planted by Javanese. Even in Java it is apparently only cultivated. Blume calls it a large tree, but I prefer to follow the latest authors, Koorders and Valeton, who describe it as small. The fruit is said to give a useful wax. The locality 'Nilghiri Hills' has been omitted, for the reasons given in the Fl. Br. Ind. Koorders and Valeton call it hermaphrodite and certainly flowers of Junghuhn 760, otherwise \u2642 seem to have fertile ovules. The only fruiting specimen I have seen is that of Goodenough in the Singapore Herbarium; it has not the thick cupule of Greshoff's picture which may perhaps be badly drawn.

Sykes Gamble, C.I.E., M.A., F.R.S., late of the Indian Forest Department.\n\nThis Part, continuing the Monochlamyde\u00e6, deals with the Families Nos. 100 Myristicace\u00e6, 101 Monimiace\u00e6, 105 Thymel\u00e6ace\u00e6 (including 105 bis Gonystylace\u00e6 which should properly have come in Thalamiflor\u00e6 near Tiliace\u00e6), 106 El\u00e6agnace\u00e6 and 108 Santalace\u00e6 (including the genus Champereia which should properly have come in Opiliace\u00e6), all the work of Mr. Gamble. In the descriptions of Myristicace\u00e6 he has closely followed the recent Monograph of the whole Family by Dr. Warburg of Berlin (Nova Acta Acad. Leop.-Carol. Bot. LXVIII); and in Monimiace\u00e6 he has followed that of Miss Janet Perkins in Engler\u2019s \u2018Pflanzenreich\u2019 so that there are no new genera or species. In Thymel\u00e6ace\u00e6 there is one new species and in Santalace\u00e6 there are four, making five in all. The Latin descriptions of these species have been published in the Kew Bulletin.\n\nAltogether, in the 6 Families described there are 16 genera and 73 species of which, as above mentioned, 5 species are new.\n\nThe next part, No. 24, will contain, with other Families, the description of the Family Piperace\u00e6 (No. 98) by Monsieur Casimir de Candolle of Geneva, who has described a large number of new species.\n\nFamily C.\u2014MYRISTICACE\u00c6.\n\nEvergreen trees, often stellately-tomentose, sometimes with branching hairs.

According to Perkins and Gilg 15 species, in the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago.\n\nThe latest work on this genus is that by Miss Janet Perkins in Engler's Bot. Jahrb. xxv. (1898) and in Engler's Pflanzenreich Heft 4 (1901) and Nachtrage Heft 49 (1911). In describing the species of the genus Kibara she refers to three of the four species described from the Malay Archipelago by Blume in his Mus. Bot. Lugd.-Bat. Vol. II, pp. 88, 89, different Malay Peninsula specimens which in the Flora Indica and Flora of British India had been placed under K. coriacea, Endlicher, as they had previously been placed by Miquel in the Fl. Ind. Bat. Thus: Griffith's No. 4365 from Malacca is referred to K. cuspidata, Blume, as is Maingay's No. 1307; while Curtis' 2255 from Penang is attributed to K. chartacea, Blume. K. coriacea is considered as only a Javanese species, with its variety serrulata first raised to specific rank and then in the Nachtrag reduced to varietal. Miss Perkins lays much stress on the texture of the leaves and I have found it very difficult to follow her in\nthis. The series of specimens belonging to the Calcutta Herbarium at my disposal seemed to me as regards leaves to be very difficult to separate, and I found it difficult to obtain characters from the flowers and fruit. After much consideration it appeared to me that the best characters were to be got from the inflorescence, and I consequently have thought it best to try and follow Miss Perkins as far as possible and to arrange the material accordingly. I cannot say that I am fully satisfied with the result, but I do not see my way to anything better and I should greatly hesitate to make new species of any of the material without better reasons than I can give at present. I have consequently divided the material among the four species K. chartacea, K. cuspidata, K. coriacea and K. serrulata, the best-marked of which is probably the last. It is quite possible that the next monographer will reduce at any rate the first three to one species.\n\n| Inflorescence | Length | Species |\n|---------------|--------|---------|\n| 2\u20143 cm. long  |        | 1.

But I have tried in vain to arrange it in varieties and must come to the same conclusion as Ridley did. In his 'Notes on the Flora of Singapore' in the Journal of the Straits Br. R. As. Soc. he has pointed out that 'the fruit in Herbarium specimens often splits before it is ripe.' He clearly considers that the Peninsular material, of which the Singapore Herbarium has a great series of specimens, all belongs to one species, and I have thought it right to follow him and describe it accordingly. The type is Maingay's 1441, the leaves of which are more reddish-brown and slightly more pubescent beneath than most of the other material, but I can find no other difference.\n\n**Family CVI.

The type specimen is poor indeed, consisting now of only slender branchlets and a few leaves in poor condition, the branchlets, which bear the appearance of having had suckers, are smoother and the leaves are rather thinner and more nearly orbicular than in Wray's specimen, but the agreement seems sufficiently close to make it undesirable at present to consider Wray's plant as a new species.\n\n5. **Henslowia Lobbiana**, A.

Sykes Gamble, C.I.E., M.A., F.R.S., late of the Indian Forest Department.\n\nThis Part contains the Families Nos. 96 Nepenthace\u00e6, 98 Piperace\u00e6, 104 Proteace\u00e6 and 107 Loranthace\u00e6. The account of the Family of the Nepenthace\u00e6 has most kindly been contributed by Prof. J. M. Macfarlane, Director of the Botanic Garden at the University of Philadelphia, U. S. America, author of the Monograph of the Family in Engler's Pflanzenreich. The account of the large Family of the Piperace\u00e6 is due to the kindness of Monsieur C. de Candolle of Geneva. The other two Families are my own work.\n\nThe new species in the Piperace\u00e6, 54 in number, were published as Part No I in Vol. VI of the Records of the Botanical Survey of India. Three new species in Proteace\u00e6, by Lieut.-Col. Sir D. Prain, C.M.G., C.I.E., F.R.S., Director of the Royal Gardens, Kew, and two by myself have been published in the Kew Bulletin, as well as 6 new species in Loranthace\u00e6. The total number of new species is thus 65.\n\nFamily XCVI. NEPENTHACE\u00c6.\n\nBy J. M. Macfarlane.\n\nSuffrutescent or frutescent, climbing, rarely erect or prostrate plants.

De Candolle.\n\nHerbs or shrubs or small trees, growing on the soil or epiphytic, parenchyma with aromatic or resiniferous cells. Stem and branches containing either (in Peperomia) a system of distinct fibrovascular bundles with limited centrifugal growth, disposed in more or less concentric rows and anastomozing together in the nodes; or (in Piper) two fibrovascular systems, one of which is composed of peripheric bundles with unlimited centrifugal growth, the other of intramedullar bundles with limited centrifugal growth; the bundles of both systems anastomozing together in the nodes. Leaves simple, entire, exstipulate in Peperomia, stipulate in Piper. Inflorescence spiciform. Flowers very small, 1\u20142-sexual. Perianth 0. Stamens 1\u201410, hypogynous or connate with the ovary at its extreme base, rarely higher. Ovary 1-celled, a single terminal orthotropous ovule.\nFruit (a berry) indehiscent. Seed adherent to the endocarp; embryosac persistent at the apex of a copious perisperm, including the dicotyledonous embryo and a scanty endosperm; radicle superior.\n\nStigma globular or rarely bilobed, very small; fruit minute, 0\u00b75\u20142 mm. long.

King after writing his paper on the species of Loranthus indigenous in Perak. They are thus characterized and separated:\n\nLeaves sessile.. .. .. .. 1. Baratranthus Lobbii.\n\nLeaves petiolate, broad, often unequal-sided, their surfaces similar, their lateral nerves visible even on the upper surface .. .. .. 2. Baratranthus Kingii (King\u2019s Collector 2643, 6294).\n\nLeaves petiolate, their surfaces similar, their lateral nerves not visible .. .. .. 3. Baratranthus Scortechinii (Scortechini\u2014no number).\n\nLeaves petiolate, their surfaces dissimilar the lower being reddish yellow .. .. .. 4. Baratranthus bicolor (King\u2019s Collector 4486, 11024).\n\nThe question of absence of petiole in L. Lobbii is not borne out by the specimens quoted by Hooker in the Fl. Br. Ind., for both Maingay\u2019s and Curtis\u2019 specimens show short petioles. The other characters quoted do not seem to be constant so I prefer to leave the material as sorted by Sir George King and not to attempt a subdivision which I do not myself believe to be warranted.\n\n8.

Burma.\n\nThe Malay L. obiectus, Wall., seems to me to be distinct from the Indian L. Scurrula so I have thought it best to retain Wallich's name instead of describing the material under L. Scurrula var. obiecta as is done in the Fl. Br. Ind. It comes very near L. Schultesii, Blume of Java. I have carefully examined the original specimens of L. Scurrula, Linn. Sp. Pl. Ed. II. 472 now in the possession of the Linnean Society, and consider that the Malay specimens now under consideration do not agree with it. The leaves have a different shape, the flowers are rather larger and the fruit is less truncate while all the parts are more conspicuously tomentose.\n\n9. Loranthus ferrugineus, Roxb. Fl. Ind. ed.

FAGACE\u00c6.\n\nTrees or rarely shrubs. Leaves simple, alternate, penninerved, entire toothed or lobed; stipules free, caducous. Flowers minute, usually monoecious, occasionally dioecious, sometimes hermaphrodite; males in erect or pendulous catkins or spikes or rarely\ncymosely capitate; females in spikes or capitate or solitary; bracts sometimes involucrate. Perianth: \u2642 usually 6- occasionally 4\u20147-lobed, membranous, the lobes free or connate; \u2640 usually as in \u2642 but smaller, free or adnate to the ovary, usually with an involucre and many imbricate scales. Stamens usually 6 or 12, sometimes fewer, occasionally more, adnate to the base of the perianth, filaments slender, anthers dehiscing longitudinally. Ovary in \u2642 flowers reduced to a rudimentary pistillode or 0; in \u2640 more or less completely 3\u20146-celled, the cells 2-ovuled; ovules pendulous anatropous; styles as many as the cells; stigmas terminal, often minute. Fruit a nut, sometimes 1\u20144 nuts, included within or surrounded by often greatly enlarged involucrate bracts forming a cupule; pericarp coriaceous or woody. Seed pendulous, usually solitary; testa membranous; albumen 0; cotyledons thick, fleshy, plano-convex or sinuate, sometimes indented in star-like fashion, sometimes ruminate; radicle superior.\u2014Distr.: Genera 5, chiefly of north temperate regions or of hilly districts in the tropics.\n\nNut (acorn) 1 only; cupules cup-shaped or saucer-shaped or completely enclosing the acorn.\n\nMale spikes pendulous; stamens usually 6; stigmas broad, covering the inner surface of the summit of the recurved styles or capitate on them; cupule (in Malay Peninsular species) lamellate, surrounding the lower part of the acorn only; leaves usually serrate or lobed .. 1. Quercus.\n\nMale spikes erect; stamens usually 12; stigmas consisting of a pore, terminal on the slightly curved style; cupule of imbricate scales or lamellate or entirely enclosing the acorn, sometimes smooth, occasionally spiny; leaves usually entire, rarely serrate .. 2. Pasania.\n\nNuts 1 or up to 4; cupules enclosing the nuts, often splitting irregularly, usually armed with spines or clusters of spines or sometimes tubercular only; stigmas as in Pasania; leaves entire or serrate .. 3. Castanopsis.\n\nIt will be seen that I have preferred, with a slight modification, to adopt the genera proposed by Prantl in Engler's 'Nat\u00fcrlichen Pflanzenfamilien' and to subdivide the old genus Quercus under which the Malay Peninsular Oaks were described by Sir G. King in his Monograph and by Sir J. D. Hooker in the Flora of British India into the two very well marked genera Quercus and Pasania, rather than to follow the more detailed subdivision preferred by Oersted in 1866 or by Schottky in 1912. The genus Castanopsis, at any rate so far as the species with one nut in the cupule is concerned, comes very near to Pasania, especially to those species which have prickly cupules.\n1. Quercus, L.\n\nTrees or shrubs, deciduous or evergreen. Leaves toothed or lobed, rarely entire. Flowers monoecious: \u2642 solitary or 1\u20143 together, in pendulous catkins; \u2640 solitary in erect few-flowered spikes. Perianth: \u2642 cup-shaped, thin, with usually 6 sometimes 3\u20145 lobes supported by small bracteoles; \u2640 as in \u2642, but smaller, free or adnate to the ovary, surrounded by an involucre of many imbricate or annular scales. Stamens usually 6, sometimes fewer; filaments slender; anthers rather large. Ovary: in \u2642 flowers 0 or reduced to a villous pistillode; in \u2640 flowers 3-celled, the cells 2-ovulate; styles usually 3, short, recurved; stigmas broad, lining the inner faces of the styles. Acorn ovoid globose or turbinate, seated on or partly enclosed in a cup-shaped or saucer-shaped cupule, the involucral scales hardened into teeth or tubercles or annular lamellae; pericarp crustaceous or coriaceous; surmounted by an umbo consisting of the persistent styles. Seed 1; testa membranous; cotyledons fleshy, plano-convex.\u2014Distrib. Temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, a few only extending down into the mountains of Malaya, about 200 species (Prantl).\n\nAccording to Prantl in Engler and Prantl's 'Naturlichen Pflanzenfamilien' the genus is divisible into 3 Sections, all the species of the Malay Peninsula and Islands belonging to the Section Cyclobalanopsis in which the involucral bracts forming the cupule are united to form concentric lamellae with entire crenate or denticulate margins, and the leaves are dentate or serrate.\n\nLeaves with silvery scales on the lower surface, serratures near the apex obscure and shallow; acorn-cupules obconic at base, then hemispheric, with 8\u201410 minutely denticulate lamellae, 2 cm. deep .. 1.

Spikes: \u2642 in dense short catkins, 1\u20142 cm. long, clustered in upper leaf-axils, densely villous; \u2640 under 3 cm. long, very stout in fruit. Flowers: \u2642 perianth 6-lobed, the lobes very small and thin, densely villous; stamens 6, anthers large, reniform, the connective penicillate; \u2640 unknown.

Perak: camp on Ulu Batang Padang, 1500 m. alt., Wray 1532!\n\nThis may prove to be a new species when better material becomes available, but in leaves and also in the acorns, except the two conspicuously thickened belts, it agrees well with Teysmann's specimens of Q. Merkusii, Endl., from Bangka Island. I quite agree with Koorders and Valeton that Q. turbinata, Bl., is distinct from Q. lineata, Bl. The description of the \u2642 inflorescence and flower is taken from Curtis 903 which seems to, but does not certainly, belong to the same plant as Wray's fruiting specimen. The leaves, however, agree quite well and the species belongs clearly to this genus.\n\n2. Pasania, Oerst.\n\nTrees usually evergreen. Leaves usually entire, rarely serrate.

Java, Sumatra.**\n\nThis species has usually been placed in Sect. *Lithocarpus* as believed to have the acorn completely attached to the cupule, but as after cutting through a good, quite ripe specimen I find this not to be the case, I have followed Oersted in transferring it to Sect. *Cyclobalanus*. King considers the Peninsular material to belong to Blume\u2019s var. *convexa*, but I cannot agree in this. Scortechini\u2019s specimens agree well with both Blumes\u2019 and Oudemans\u2019 figures, and the rest of the material differs only in having the fruit (much more mature) very broad and obconic instead of cylindrical. The thickness and hardness of the pericarp is most remarkable.\n\n26. **Pasania lampadaria**, Gamble in Kew Bull. 177 (1914).

Selangor: 15th mile, Pahang track, Ridley 8588!.\n\nWray 1142! from Lower Camp, Gunong Batu Putih, resembles this very closely in its branchlets and leaves, the only noticeable difference being that there are more main nerves. The fruits, however, of which there are only very young specimens, are in clusters of 1\u20143, more usually one or two abortive, but all connected and having cupules with irregular wavy hardened lamellae, while in P. Maingayii the fruits seem to be always solitary.\n\nWray 1097! also from Lower Camp, Gunong Batu Putih, consists of branchlets with \u2640 flowers in terminal panicles of spikes and a few very young conspicuously lamellate fruits. It may perhaps, as suggested by Sir G. King, belong to P. Javensis, (Bl.) Prantl with which it agrees fairly well in leaves.\n\n35. Pasania Beccariana, Prantl. in Engl. & Prantl. Naturl. Pflanzenfam.

They may belong to a new species, but ripe fruit would be necessary before a description can be written. Von Seemen has identified Maingay's specimens with C. Hullettii, but I cannot agree in this.\n\n10. Castanopsis Ridleyi, Gamble in Kew Bull. 180 (1914).

Malay States Museum, vol. iv, page 63 (1909), Ridley mentions the finding of Castanopsis argentea, A. DC. His specimen is in the Kew Herbarium, in young fruit only, and seems to me to come nearer to C. Hystrix A. DC., but, to properly identify species of Castanopsis ripe fruit is indispensable.\n\nFamily CXVI. SALICACE\u00c6.\n\nDeciduous trees or shrubs. Leaves alternate, petiolate, stipules free.

Its closure has been held up for a number of years on account of the fact that the materials in type did not, as they stood, bring the work to an appropriate end.\n\nStrictly speaking, the present issue under the title \"Materials\" involves a misnomer, for not long after these materials went to the press the Flora of the Malay Peninsula, itself, by Ridley, appeared, comprising the substance of the materials already published in this Journal and extending to what had not been included here.\n\nManuscript on the Euphorbiaceae, extending to several hundred pages more than are given here, was also awaiting publication when the Flora appeared. Publication of this cannot now be justified; but the addition of an index to all the materials, including the species of the present six genera of the Euphorbiaceae, will appropriately close the work and the series.\n\nThe elaborate precision of Col. Gage's key to the genera of Euphorbiaceae here given will be apparent. This alone would justify the issue of what is already in type, and with the index allows of a closure which is overdue.\n\nUPENDRANATH BRAHMACHARI,\nActg. General Secretary,\nRoyal Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n\nCALCUTTA:\n1, Park Street,\nAugust, 1936.\nMaterials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula, No. 26.\u2014By\nA. T. GAGE.\n\nThis part contains the first instalment of Family No. 117, Euphorbiaceae, being an account of the species belonging to six genera, out of the total of 64 genera found to occur in the Malayan Peninsula.\n\nFamily CXVII. EUPHORBIACEAE.\n\nHerbs, shrubs or trees, seldom climbers, often with a mild juice. Leaves usually alternate and simple, if compound nerves pinnately so; sometimes reduced to scales; glabrous or +\u2014simple or stellately hairy or lepidote; stipules usually present and usually small, caducous or persistent, rarely connate as a bud sheath lamina and petiole junction sometimes glandular. Flowers 1-sexual monoecious or dioecious, usually small, often minute. Inflorescence usually mixed; sometimes, as in Euphorbia, of turbinate involucre resembling a gamosepalous perianth within which 1-stamened \u2642 florets surround a solitary \u2640 flower reduced to a stipitate pistil but usually axillary or racemose and centripetal, with the ultimate divisions cymose and centrifugal or, from reduction of the ultimate cymules to a single flower, centripetal throughout; sometimes spiriformly racemose or paniculate or sometimes of terminal dichotomous cymes or reduced to simple clusters or solitary flowers; bract subtending the cymes or flowers usually small and scalelike, sometimes enlarged and sometimes connate and involucre form; bracteoles often 2 within a bract or indefinite. Perianth seldom 0, when present often differing in the sexes; sometimes single and calycine with valvate or imbricate segments or with sepals in 2 series imbricate and similar or rarely with outer and inner series dissimilar, sometimes double, with petals small and scalelike or rarely with petals larger than the sepals and contorted imbricate. Male flowers without a disk or with an intrastaminal disk or extrastaminal disk or with glands or lobes alternating with stamens of outer series. Stamens various; solitary or fewer than or as many as the separate or indefinite and sometimes very numerous; filaments free to variously united; anthers variously affixed, usually 2-celled, rarely 3\u20134-locellate; the loculi usually parallel or didymous with longi-\ntudinal dehiscence, sometimes variously divaricate, sometimes + \u2014 cruciformly arranged, rarely confluent at the apex and rarely with porous or transverse dehiscence. *Pistillode* present or 0. *Female flowers* without a disk or the disk present and hypogynous and annular or pulvinate or lining the lower part of calyx; staminodes seldom present. *Ovary* usually sessile, 1-many-locular but often 3-locular, the loculi 1\u20132-ovuled; the ovules pendulous from the inner angle, with ventral raphe, anatropous, often with the funicle expanded into a cellular or scalelike or hoodlike mass; styles present or stigmas sessile; styles as many as the carpels, free or + \u2014 united and entire or + \u2014 divided, erect or spreading or recurved, subulate or variously thickened or dilated, with stigmatic surface on inner face; sessile stigmas + \u2014 lobed or disciform. *Fruit* usually a capsule of as many cocci as ovarian loculi, usually 3, the cocci breaking away into 2 valves from a persistent centre axis; sometimes a drupe with 1\u20133 cells, seldom of 2\u20133 pyrenes. *Seeds* as many as the ovules or fewer, attached at or from above the middle to near the apex of the cell, with or without an arillus or caruncle at the apex; albumen usually abundant and fleshy; embryo usually straight, enclosed in the albumen and with large complanate cotyledons, rarely minute with narrow semiterete cotyledons; rarely albumen 0 or very scanty and cotyledons fleshy.\n\n**DISTRIB.** Genera about 200 with about 4,000 species mostly confined to the tropics.\n\nSince No. 25 of these \"Materials\" was published in 1915, the great increase in cost of paper and printing has made condensation\u2014consistent with clearness,\u2014of statement a virtue of necessity. Accordingly the original MSS. of that account of the *Euphorbiaceae*\u2014a great part of which was written before the war\u2014has been entirely rewritten and reduced. The reduction may be far from apparent, as owing to so many of the species\u2014all of which are unisexual to begin with\u2014having dioecious flowers and different inflorescences in the two sexes only a relative, not an absolute shortening of specific descriptions has been possible. The generic definitions have been restricted to descriptions of the characters common only to the Malayan Peninsula species under each genus, but these characters\u2014including the vegetative ones\u2014have been described in considerable detail to avoid repetition of them in successive specific descriptions.\n\nThe citations of authors have been ruthlessly pruned, only those being given that I think are likely to be of practical use to students of Malayan Euphorbiaceae.\n\nThe most important works are:\n\nE. BOISSIER. *Euphorbia* in D.C. Prodr. XV, ii, 7\u2013187 (published 1862).\nJ. Muller. Euphorbiaceae in D.C. Prodr. XV, ii, 189-1273, (published 1862-66).\n\nJ. D. Hooker. Euphorbiaceae in Fl. Brit. Ind. V, 239-477, (published 1887).\n\nJ. J. Smith. Euphorbiaceae in Koorders and Valeton Boomsorten of Java, Bijd. No. 12, 9-637, (published in 1910).\n\nTo economise space in referring to those four works, only the author's name and page number are given, the name of the work and the year of publication being understood. As these four works should be at the disposal of any systematic student of Malayan Euphorbiaceae, no citations\u2014apart from the more important synonyms\u2014appearing in any of them and accepted by me as correct, are repeated in this account. Only such of the more important synonyms as I have verified or have reason to believe are correct are given. Citations of works other than the four mentioned above are given in full.\n\nThe most important collections from the Malayan Peninsula have been made by Curtis, Kunstler, Ridley, Scortechini and Wray. On the specimen tickets Kunstler's own name seldom appears, his identity being hidden usually as \"Dr. King's Collector.\" To save space in the quotation of sheets, the letters C., KC., R., S. and W. are used to denote respectively Curtis, Kunstler or King's Collector, Ridley, Scortechini and Wray. The surnames of other collectors are given in full. The numbers quoted for sheets collected by Griffith and Maingay are the numbers under which those sheets were distributed from Kew Herbarium.\n\nIn the descriptions the colours mentioned are the colours in the dried state unless otherwise mentioned. Under \"leaves\" the word \"nerves\" without any qualifying adjective means lateral nerves; the numbers of nerves mentioned in any description of leaves are the numbers counted on one side of the midrib on the lower surface of the leaf. The word \"nervules\" without any qualifying adjective means the secondary nerves connecting the primary lateral ones. \"Reticulation\" means the network formed by the ultimate veinlets filling the internervular spaces. The signs \"+\u2014\" signify \"more or less.\"\n\nThe seeds of very many species, especially of those with 1-seeded capillary loculi, have a +\u2014 convex dorsal and 2 ventro-lateral surfaces, the latter varying from almost plane to convex in various degrees and separated by a mesial longitudinal ridge which may be of various degrees of acuteness or obtuseness. Such seeds have a general resemblance to a headless beetle, except of course that in beetles there is usually no distinct mesial ventral ridge. The term \"scarabaeoid\" is used to indicate briefly the form of such seeds in the generic and specific descriptions.\n\n**Synopsis of tribes, subtribes and genera.**\n\nThe separation by exclusive characters of the various tribes and subtribes to which Euphorbiaceae have been divided by different botanists is by no means easy, as a study of the tribal and subtribal characters given in Genera Plantarum, in the Flora of British India and in the Pflanzenfamilien proves. The divisions here adopted follow in the main Pax's arrangement in the Pflanzenfamilien (Teil, III Abb. 5) with diagnostic and other modifica-\nEndospermum placed by Pax under Gelonieae is, on account of its valvate calyx and 4-locellate anthers, transferred to Acalypheae. So Erismanthus also placed by Pax under Gelonieae, although it is petaliferous, is transferred to Cluytiae.\n\nA. Cells of Ovary 2-ovuled.\u2014Phyllanthoideae.\n\na. Embryo large . .

Tribe XI, EUPHORBIEAE.\n64. EUPHORBIA.\n\nExcluded genus.\u2014LOPHOPYXIS.\n\nKEY TO THE GENERA.\n\nFor the case of a family like Euphorbiaceae the ideal would be to have\nthree keys, one founded on male material, another on female material in flower\nand the third on material in fruit. Unfortunately the material so far available\nis not enough to allow of this ideal being attained. The present key is therefore\nof the nature of a makeshift and not a satisfactory one. Still it is hoped that\nin conjunction with the generic synopsis it may be of some use. Trigonopleura,\nBotryophora and Kunstlera are absent from the female section of the dioecious\ndivision, as the female plants of those genera are as yet unknown.\n\nA. Flowers Monoecious.\n\na.

On one of the\nsheets have also been fixed indiscriminately a fragment and separate leaves of\nWallich's No. 7888 \"Chlytia from Burma,\" which is B. burmanica Hook. f.\nThe nervation Hooker mentions under his description of B. ovata is unfortun-\nately the nervation of B. burmanica. The real B. ovata in Kew Herbarium has\nonly 8\u201412 nerves. The specimen referred to by Hooker as B. ovata Dcne., pro-\nduced by Kurz from the Buitenzorg Garden is merely a specimen so named by\nKurz. It is certainly not B. ovata Dcne., but I should say B. minutiflora Hook\nf. I cannot distinguish B. Curtisi Hook. f. from B. ovata Dcne. The material of\nB. Curtisi consists only of a single sheet in flower only, collected by Curtis at\nTulloh Bahang, and could seem to be merely a male specimen of B. ovata Dcne.,\nRidley's No. 8326, collected by Curtis at Langkawi has been referred by\nWilliams (Bull. Herb. Boiss. 1905, 31) to B. Kurzii Hook. f. It appears to me\nto be exactly like the cotype sheets of B. ovata Dcne., in Kew Herbarium. B.\nKurzii Hook. f., seems to me in any case merely a form of B. ovata Dcne., but\nthe material of it is very scanty. Gehrmann refers B. Curtisi Hook. f. to\nB.

Ind.), King's Collector. In Kew Herbarium the sheets collected by Scortechini Nos. 1822 and 1823 are named by Hooker \"B. cinnamomea,\" while the Kinta sheet, K.C. 7101 is named by him \"B. ? cinnamomea.\" Scortechini's sheets agree with each other and with Haviland's No. 800 from Borneo. They differ altogether from the Kinta sheet, K.C. 7101, which on the other hand agrees with Haviland's Nos. 937 and 1858 from Borneo. Hooker's description of B. cinnamomea is based on the mixture of sheets, but as his description of B. cinnamomea as \"a thorny shrubby creeper 10\u201415 feet long\" is taken from the Kinta specimen ticket, the Kinta specimens are taken as the type, all the more so as the Scortechini sheets Nos. 1822 and 1823 named \"B. cinnamomea\" by Hooker in the Kew Herbarium and Haviland's No. 800\u2014the latter in fruit\u2014are a species of Cleistanthus, being C. perakensis Jabl. B. cinnamomea may be merely, as Gehrmann considers it, a variety of B. Griffithii Hook. f. The two species are certainly very closely allied, both being scandent shrubs.\n6. **Bridelia Griffithii**, Hook. f., 272.

Lower Burma, Malayan Archipelago.\n\nType sheet is C. 527.\n\nI am unable to detect any specific or even variatal difference between B. penangiana and B. minutiflora. Hooker refers to B. minutiflora as a very remarkable species on account of the solitary style. An examination of the type sheets has failed to yield a single flower with a solitary style. All the type flowers examined had styles of the ordinary character, united for a variable distance from the base and each bifid above. Hooker's description appears therefore to have been based on one or several abnormal flowers, or possibly confused with that of B. cinnamomea, which has a single style, and which itself as far as Hooker's names in Kew Herbarium are concerned, is a mixture of a Bri-\ndelia and a Cleistanthus. See note under B. cinnamomea. Gehrmann unites B. penangiana with B. Griffithii, a course that I am not disposed to follow. B. Griffithii has considerably larger flowers than B. penangiana and is a scandent shrub, whereas B. penangiana is a tree reaching to a height of 16 m.\n\nCleistanthus, Hook. f.\n\nShrubs or trees, with terete or subterete branchlets rarely angled and with alternate, bifarious, caducously or persistently stipulate, shortly-petioled leaves.

Flowers monoecious, with a +\u2014turbinate or obconic torus, small, in axillary bracteolate clusters, often strung along small-leaved twigs. \u2642 flowers with calyx divided halfway or rather more than halfway down into 4\u20145 sepals valvate in bud or slightly imbricate at the apex; petals 5, minute, +\u2014spathulate or ovate or obovate or cuneate, with entire or subcrenulate margin; stamens 5, inserted on a usually short column surrounding the subconically ovoid entire or shortly trifid pistillode; anthers erect in bud, introrse, dehiscing longitudinally, dorsi-fixed, versatile; disk lining the lower part of calyx, entire or +\u2014dentate. \u2640 flowers with calyx and corolla as in the \u2642 and persistent in fruit; ovary 3-locular; styles 3, free or +\u2014connate, shortly bifid rarely simple; disk lining the lower part of calyx and giving off an inner crenulate, dentate, or +\u2014lobed annulus, which surrounds the ovary and +\u2014conceals it; staminodes 5, extremely minute, scalelike, in a circle at base of inner surface of disk. Fruit a dry 3-locular 3-sulcate capsule, sessile on or +\u2014stipitate from the persistent perianth, dehiscing into 3 bi-valved rounded cocci, leaving a central columella with pentagonal base; cocci each with a mesial sutural line; endocarp horny, separable from the thin pericarp.

Decaisne in 1834 published the description of a species from Timor under the name \"Andrachne fruticosa L.\" assuming incorrectly that it was the plant of Linnaeus. As the plant of Linnaeus was not an Andrachne while Decaisne's plant was, J. Muller in DC Prodr. XV, II, 235 (1886) retained Decaisne's name and applied it to Decaisne's plant. The Malayan Peninsula specimens agree with Decaisne's plant. Hooker f. in Ic. Plant. xviii, t. 1704 does not agree with M\u00fcller, who placed Cumming's Philippine specimens under A. australis. Hooker considers part if not all of A australis Mull. Arg. as A. fruticosa Dcne. Hooker also rejects, which I think good reason, Bentham's name of A. Decaisnei in the Flora of Australia.\n\n5.

About 400 species, throughout the tropics and subtropics.\n\nEven with Glochidion separated off, Phyllanthus still remains a somewhat mixed genus, and a re-elevation of some of its sections to generic rank would probably be an advantage. The scope of this account of the Malayan Peninsula species does not justify me in intrenching on the work of the monographer, and so here the genus as treated in the Flora of British India has as regards its sections been left undisturbed.\n\nHooker's statement (Fl. Brit. Ind. V, 286) that the $\\sigma$ flowers in the Emblica section have no disc requires qualification, as his own species $P.$ pectinatus has\ndistinct glands in the $\\sigma$ flowers. Ridley (Trans. Linn. Soc. 2nd Ser. III, Bot. 345) records *P. maderaspatensis* L. from the sea shore at Kwala Pahang. I have however seen no specimen of that species in the herbaria of Kew, Singapore, Penang, and Calcutta from the Malayan Peninsula. *P. Emblica* L. is stated in the Flora of British India to be distributed as far south as Malacca, but I have seen no specimens in the herbaria mentioned above. *P. acutus* Wall. Cat. 7931, Herb. Finlayson (Fl. Brit. Ind. V, 301), does not appear to occur in the Malayan Peninsula. Finlayson's collections were made in Siam and Cochin-China and were taken to Calcutta by Wallich when the latter returned from his visit to Penang in 1823.\nINDEX\n\nTo Volume LXXV.\n\nA\n\nAcalypheae, 474.\nAcanthaceae, 1.\nAchyranthes, 16.\nAchyranthes aspera, Linn, 16.\nAchyranthes atropurpurea, 14.\nAchyranthes ? cornosa, 14.\nAchyranthes lappacea, 14.\nAchyranthes nodiflora, 8.\nAchyranthes prostrata, 12.\nAchyranthes triandra, 17.\nAcrocidiliidae, 67.\nActephila, 472, 474, 477, 479, 480, 482, 518.\nActephila excelsa, 516, 520.\nActephila javanica, 516, 521.\nActephila ovalis, 516.\nActinodaphne, 112.\nActinodaphne Blumei, 137.\nActinodaphne cuspidata, 113, 122.\nActinodaphne glomerata, 113, 116.\nActinodaphne Hullettii, 113, 120.\nActinodaphne johorensis, 113, 117.\nActinodaphne Maingayi, 112, 114.\nActinodaphne Maingayi, var. elliptica, 115.\nActinodaphne malaccensis, 113, 118.\nActinodaphne montana, 113, 117.\nActinodaphne oleifolia, 113, 121.\nActinodaphne pragilis, 113, 123.\nActinodaphne pruinosa, 113, 119.\nActinodaphne pruinosa, var.
