W. THOMAS, BAPTIST MISSION PRESS.\n\nPUBLISHED BY THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY, 57 PARK STREET.\n\n1881.\nPREFATORY NOTICE.\n\nThe author of this Dictionary was formerly a Clerk in the office of the Board of Revenue, N. W. P. at a time when the Secretary was Henry Myers Elliot, afterwards well known as Sir H. M. Elliot, K. C. B. It is probable that, in preparing his extracts from the Mohamadan Histories of India, Elliot availed himself of the aid of Mr. Beale, of whose scholarship Prof. Dowson makes justly deserved mention in the eighth volume of his valuable edition of the work.* Mr. Beale died at a very advanced age in the summer of 1875, having before his death expressed a wish that I would see his MS. through the press, and reduce the transliteration into conformity with the system then recently adopted by the Government of India, and founded (as I need hardly observe) upon the system of Sir W. Jones.\n\nAccordingly, on the 5th October of that year I laid the MS. before Sir John Strachey, the then Lieut.-Governor, in the name of the Archaeological Society of Agra, of which he was a Vice-Patron, in a letter from which the following is an extract:\u2014\n\n\"This is no ordinary book. I have used it as a work of reference, for years; and have lately had an opportunity of showing it to the eminent scholar Mr. E. B. Eastwick, C. B. who, I am authorised to say, concurs with me in thinking that the Dictionary will be of unique value to oriental students.\"\n\nSir J. Strachey took up the subject with that enlightened energy which always actuated him in dealing with the past history of the country over whose administration he then presided. The MS. and copyright were acquired at the expense of Government; and it was ultimately resolved\u2014in view of the importance of the work and my own official occupations\u2014that the editing should be entrusted to the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n\nThe Society confided the labour of seeing the Dictionary though the press to their Philological Secretary, Principal Blochmann, of whose qualifications it would be presumptuous to say more than that they have an eccumenical reputation. That distinguished man (of whom it has been observed by Count v. Noer that he united the enthusiasm of an artist to the most patient accuracy of research) undertook the task with his characteristic earnestness and ability. But unhappily for oriental scholarship Mr. Blochmann's lamented death occurred before he had completed the preparation of more than a few sheets; and the duty ultimately reverted to the local Archaeological Society of Agra.\n\nBeing soon after transferred from Agra, and being besides prevented by my public duties from giving to the Dictionary the full attention which its importance required, I have availed to a great degree of the aid of my colleagues, Mr. S\u00e1yad Mahmood, Prof. A. Thomson, and L\u00e1la Bah\u00e1l Rai. I have also (in the latter sheets particularly) had valuable help from Dr. Hoernle, Philological Secretary of the Society. To these gentlemen, and to the Superintendent of the Baptist Mission Press the work is indebted for its handsome and practical appearance and character.\n\nThe substance is almost entirely Mr. Beale's; and I cannot close this notice more fitly than by giving the following extracts from the preface originally drafted by himself:\u2014\n\n\"In preparing a work of this nature, intended to be used as a work of reference on matters connected with Oriental History, it is proper to state that the greatest care has been taken to ensure accuracy in the narrative, as also in the dates of births, deaths, and other events recorded...Various MSS. have been collated whenever discrepancy was observed...To remove all doubt, chronograms indicating the dates with a certainty not to be found by any other method and written when the events were fresh in the minds of men, have been inserted, when available.\"\n\n* The History of India, by its own Historians. Tr\u00fcbner & Co. 1877.\n\u2020 Kaiser Akbar. Leyden, 1880.\nI may here add that it has been judged expedient to omit these chronograms, for the most part, in printing the book. In the chapter of Mr. Dowson\u2019s book already cited, will be found an account of this species of memoria technica. But it is chiefly interesting as machinery for producing a certain result; and when the result has been produced is not of much more use than the scaffolding of a building when the building is complete.\n\n\u201cThe materials collected in this Biography are only from those works which were within the reach of the author, and therefore it is to be considered as a nucleus to which those who have access to other sources may add new materials.\n\n\u201cIt may also be proper to add, that the difficulties and embarrassment which a writer of such a work is liable to meet with is so great, (I quote here the words of a learned gentleman) \u2018that though of a minor order, comprehends in itself such a number of annoyances that the writer of it, even if he had none other to make head against, might feel tempted to abandon his pen in despair in considering it.\u2019\n\n\u201cIn the East\u2019 says he, \u2018there are but a few proper names of individuals. Abdullah, Ali, Hasan, Husain, Muhammad, for example, are common to thousands. To remedy the inconvenience that might be supposed to result from this tendency to homogenousness, the Orientals annex to the family-name of the chronicled person, 1, a Kunia, or surname taken from the name of his eldest son, as Abu Muhammad (father of Muhammad); Ab\u00fa'l Hasan (father of Hasan); 2, the name of his father and often the name of his grandfather; 3, a name taken from his place of residence; 4, a name taken from his birthplace; 5, an honorary title, chiefly appended to the name of K\u00e1z\u00eds, Sheiks and Im\u00e1ms, Monks and Doctors, as Bah\u00e1udd\u00edn (Splendour of Religion), Jal\u00e1ludd\u00edn (Glory of Religion), T\u00e1judd\u00edn (Crown of Religion); and in the order of this nomenclature, the last name is put first. Thus to designate aright the famous physician Abdul Lat\u00edf, we must call him Muwaffikudd\u00edn Ab\u00fa Muhammad Abdul Lat\u00edf bin Yusaf Mousali Baghd\u00e1d\u00ed, viz., The Protector of Religion, father of Muhammad, Abdul Lat\u00edf, son of Joseph, living at Mousal, born at Baghd\u00e1d. Yet this is by no means an exaggerated specimen; several other surnames of the same kind are frequently added. The perpetual recurrence of such a multiplicity of names and titles must tend in many ways to confuse a literary historian; and the more naturally when he finds the same individual chronicled in one page under his honorary title only, as Jal\u00e1ludd\u00edn, in another under his family-name, as Abdur Rahm\u00e1n, in the third under his father\u2019s name as Ibn Arabsh\u00e1h, somewhere else under the name of his sons, as Ab\u00fa'l Abb\u00e1s, and perhaps again, and where one would least look for it, under the name of his native province, Sh\u00e1hr\u00edst\u00e1n. D\u2019Herbelot has recorded no fewer than fourteen Persian writers, all of whom pass, under the common cognomen of Karam\u00e1n\u00ed, from their province Karam\u00e1n. Here is perspicuity! But this is not all. The transcribers of the MSS. have frequently confounded the title Ab\u00fa and Ibn, or else for abbreviation sake, have omitted them altogether and written down Abdullah, or Abdur Rahm\u00e1n, him who was in fact the father or the son of Abdullah or Abdur Rahm\u00e1n. Then there are a great many authors whom public celebrity has been accustomed to distinguish so exclusively by one only of their adjective titles, that even the native biographers find it impossible to trace either their family-names or their surnames. Lastly, many hundreds of books bear the same name, and the names of most books are conceived after such a many-worded and no-meaninged fashion, that de Saey, Schlegel, Casiri and von Hammer, to mention but a few investigators out of many, have been foiled in the attempt to establish their signification.\u2019\n\n\u201cTo prevent such confusion and difficulties, the author has taken care to insert each individual under his different appellations, viz., under his family-name, his surname, poetical name, under his title or under the name of the place of his birth, referring at the same time, if he is not to be found under one name, to look under the one referred to.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion the author begs to add that most part of the materials collected in this volume were procured by the assistance of his son the late lamented Mr. J. W. Beale, 2nd Master of the Bareily College who was murdered by the insurgents on the 3rd June 1857 at that station, and since he is now no more, the author is obliged to drop his pen; but earnestly hopes that this work which is nearly the first of its kind in India, and the want of which has already been much felt, may prove useful to the Student, the Scholar, the Historian, and the general reader.\u201d\n\nThis notice may well terminate with a repetition of this hope: and with an appeal to scholars of larger leisure and opportunities for an indulgent treatment of a work produced by\na man who had never been in Europe nor enjoyed the use of a complete Library. Mr. Beale had drawn up a list of more than thirty books in various languages which had furnished him with materials. In addition the editors have from time to time referred to the translation of the Ain Akbari and its invaluable notes by Mr. Blochmann, of which the 1st Volume (never, alas, continued) was published in Calcutta some years ago.\n\nOne word more as to the inexhaustible subject of transliteration. The English as is well known have three methods; the Haphazard (which indeed is no method at all), the Gilchristian, and the popularised Jonesian introduced by the Government of India under the inspiration of Mr. W. W. Hunter. None of these is quite satisfactory. The French adopt a system of their own, and so do the Germans. Mr. Beale had followed an orthography, compounded of the two first-named elements, which has been to some extent modified in printing these pages. For the convenience of Continental European scholars the names have also been printed in the Persian character; and it is hoped that no practical difficulty will be experienced by those who may have occasion to use the Dictionary.\n\nH.

He was born on the 17th Zil-Ka'da 1074 and appears to have died early.\n\nA'azz-uddin, (\u0627\u0628\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646) son of Mu'izz-udd\u00edn Jah\u00e1nd\u00e1r Sh\u00e1h, emperor of D\u00edl\u00edh.

(Kham-s-S\u00e1n\u00ed 663 A.H.), and was crowned on Friday the 13th of the following (3rd Ram\u00e1z\u00e1n). He was a prince who added to the deliberations of sagacity and wisdom those of moderation, clemency, and justice. His ambassadors were introduced in 1274 to the ecclesiastical Synod at Lyons. He proved to be a formidable neighbour to the Christians who settled at Jerusalem. The intrigues of his court embittered the latter years of his reign; and his days were believed by many to have been shortened by poison given to him by his minister Khw\u00e1j\u00e1 Shams-udd\u00edn Muhammad, which occasioned his death on Wednesday the 1st of April 1282 A.D., (20th Zil-hijja 680 A.H.) after a reign of 17 years and some months. He had married the daughter of Michael Paleologus, emperor of Constantinople, who had been betrothed to his father, but arrived at Marigha in Tabr\u00edz, the seat of his government, after the death of that prince. Ab\u00e1-k\u00e1\u00e1n was succeeded by his brother Nekod\u00e1r, who embraced Muhammadanism, and took the title of Ahmad Kh\u00e1n.\n\n'Abbas, \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633, the son of 'Abdul-Mutalib, and uncle of the prophet Muhammed. He at first opposed the ambitious views of his nephew, but when defeated in the battle of Badr, he was reconciled to him, warmly embraced his religion, and thanked heaven for the prosperity and the grace which he enjoyed as a Musulm\u00e1n. He served the cause of Muhammed at the battle of Hunain by recalling his dismayed troops to the charge, and inciting them boldly to rally round their prophet, who was near expiring under the scimitars of the Saka\u00edt\u00e9s. He died on the 21st February, 653 A.D., (17th Raj\u00e1b, 32 A.H.); and 100 lunar years after, Ab\u00fal-'Abb\u00e1s, surnamed As-Saff\u00e1h, one of his descendants, laid the foundation of the Abb\u00e1s\u00ed or Abb\u00e1sid\u00e9 family of the Caliphs in Baghd\u00e1d, which continued for 524 lunar years. The tomb of 'Abb\u00e1s is in Madina.\n\n'Abbas\u00e1, \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633\u0629, a sister of H\u00e1d\u00edn-ur-Rash\u00edd, the Khalifa of Baghd\u00e1d, who bestowed her hand on Ja'far Barm\u00e1k\u00ed, his minister, on condition that she abstained from the marriage rights. The promise was forgotten, and the husband's life was sacrificed by the tyrant, and 'Abb\u00e1s\u00e1 was reduced to poverty. This circumstance took place in 803 A.D. (187 A.H.). There are still extant some Arabic verses which beautifully celebrate her love and her misfortunes. See Ja'far ul-Barm\u00e1k\u00ed.\n\nAbba\n\n'Abbas 'Ali, \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0639\u0644\u064a, a physician, and one of the Persian magi, who followed the doctrines of Zoroaster. He wrote A.D. 980, a book called 'Royal Work', at the request of the son of the reigning Khalifa of Baghd\u00e1d, to whom it was dedicated. It was translated into Latin by Stephen of Antioch in 1127 A.D.\n\n'Abbas 'Ali (Mirz\u00e1), whose poetical name is Bet\u00e1b, is the son of Naw\u00e1b Say\u00e1dat 'Ali Kh\u00e1n, son of Ghul\u00e1m Muhammed Kh\u00e1n, the son of Faiz-ullah Kh\u00e1n, Naw\u00e1b of R\u00e1mp\u00far.\n\n'Abbas bin.'Ali Shirwani, \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641\u0627\u0646\u064a, author of a history, containing the narrative of Sher Sh\u00e1h the Afgh\u00e1n, who drove Humay\u00fan from Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, A.D. 1539, and mounted the throne of D\u00edl\u00edh. This work was dedicated to the emperor Akbar, and is called Tuhfa-i-Alkarsh\u00e1hi. The first part of this work was translated into Urdu by Mazhar 'Ali Kh\u00e1n in the time of Lord Cornwallis and is entitled 'T\u00e1rikh-i-Sher Sh\u00e1h'.\n\nVide Dowson, Elliot's History of India, IV, 301.\n\n'Abbas Mirz\u00e1, \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u064a\u0631\u0632\u0627, a Persian prince, son of Fath 'Ali Sh\u00e1h, was born in 1783. He died in 1833. His death was a great loss to his country, although he could not prevent the encroachments of Russia. His eldest son, Muhammed Mirz\u00e1, mounted the throne in 1834, on the death of Fath 'Ali, under the united protection of England and Russia.\n\n'Abbas Mirz\u00e1, \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u064a\u0631\u0632\u0627, whose title was Naw\u00e1b Iktid\u00e1r-uddaula, was the author of a Ma\u1e63nav\u00ed in Urdu verse, containing a history of Christ. He was living in Lakhm\u00e1u in 1849 A.D., and was then about eighty years of age.\n\n'Abbas (Shah) I, \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0634\u0627\u0647, surnamed the Great, and seventh king of Persia of the Saf\u00e1vi family, was born on Monday the 29th of January 1571 A.D. (1st Ram\u00e1z\u00e1n, 978 A.H.). He was proclaimed king of Persia, in his sixteenth year, by the chiefs of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and took possession of the throne during the lifetime of his father, Sultan Sikand\u00e1r Sh\u00e1h, surnamed Muhammed Khud\u00e1banda, A.D. 1588, (996 A.H.). He was the first who made Isf\u00e1h\u00e1n the capital of Persia. He was brave and active, and enlarged the boundaries of his dominions. He took conjointly with the English forces, in 1622 A.D., the island of Ormus, which had been in the possession of the Portuguese for 122 years. He reigned 44 lunar years, was contemporary with Akbar and Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, and died on Thursday, the 8th of January, 1629 A.D. (24th Jum\u00e1d\u00e1 I, 1039 A.H.).\n\nHis grandson succeeded him and took the title of Sh\u00e1h Saf\u00ed.\n\nHe was a bigoted Shi'a. In later histories he is generally called \u0645\u0627\u0636\u06cc mad\u017e\u00ed; vide \u00c1\u00edn Translation, I, 445, 453.\n\n'Abbas (Shah) II, \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a, great-grandson of Sh\u00e1h 'Abb\u00e1s I, succeeded his father Sh\u00e1h Saf\u00ed to the throne of Persia in the month of May, 1642 A.D. (Safar 1052, A.H.), when he was scarcely ten years old. Kandah\u00e1r, which was lost by his father, was recovered by this prince be-\nAbda\n\nfore he was sixteen years of age. Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n made many efforts to recover this city, but with no success. He reigned 25 lunar years, and was cut off by the *tus venerea* in his 34th year, on the 26th August 1666 A.D. (9th Rabi-ul-Awwal, 1077 A.H.) He was succeeded by his son Sufi Mirz\u00e1, who took the title of Sh\u00e1h Sulaim\u00e1n. According to Chardin, he died on the 25th September which corresponds with the 9th Rabi-us-S\u00e1m\u00ed. *Vide* Orme's Historical Fragments of the Mogul Empire, p. 196.\n\nAbdal, (\u0627\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644) son of 'Al\u00ed R\u00e1d\u00ed, ruler of Little Tibet during the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n.

He died in the year 933 A.D., 321 A.H.

This work was translated and continued by Abu-Muhammad of Tabriz in Persian. Tabari was the founder of the seventh Sunni sect, which did not long survive the death of its author. He was born at Amul in Tabaristan in 838 A.H., 224 A.D., and died at Baghdad in 922 A.D., 310 A.H. He is also the author of a commentary to the Qur'an.\n\nAbu-Ja'far Muhammad bin-'Ali bin-Babwaihi al-Kumi, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0628\u0648\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u0627\u0642\u0633\u064a, surnamed As-Sadiq, one of the earliest of the many writers of commentaries on the Qur'an among the Shi'as. He lived in the fourth century of the Hijra, and was a contemporary of Rukn-ud-daula Dailami. He was one of the greatest of the collectors of the Shi'a traditions, and the most celebrated of all the Imamiya lawyers of Kuman-Persia. This writer composed a large and a small Tafsir. There is considerable uncertainty as to the exact time when he lived. Shaikh Tusi says, in his list that Abu-Ja'far died at Rai, A.H. 331 A.H., A.D. 942, but this appears to be erroneous. Shaikh Najashi who died A.H. 454, states that Abu-Ja'far visited Baghdad, whilst yet in the prime of life, in A.H. 355, A.D. 965, which might well have been the case, since Abu-Hassan 'Ali bin-Babwaihi, the father of Abu-Ja'far, did not die until A.H. 329, A.D. 940. In addition to this, Nur-ud-Din relates, on the authority of the Shaikh ad-Duryast* that Abu-Ja'far lived in the time of Rukn-ud-daula Dailami, and had repeated interviews with that prince, who, as is well-known, reigned from A.H. 338 to A.H. 366, A.D. 949\u2014976. He is also the author of the \"Man la yahzarhu al-Fakih,\" which is the fourth of the four authentic books on Shi'a tradition, called Kutub Arba'. He is said to have written in all 172 works, and to have been especially skilled in Ijtihad.\n\nAbu-Ja'far Muhammad bin-Hasan al-Tusi, (Shaikh) who was one of the chief Mujtahids of the Imamiya or Shi'a sect, is the author of the work entitled \"Fihristu-Kutub-ish-Shifa Asma'il-Musannifim.\" It is a bibliographical dictionary of Shi'a works, together with the names of the authors. The greater part of this author's works were publicly burnt in Baghdad in the tumult that arose between the Sunnis and Shi'as in 1056 A.D., 448-460 A.H. Abu-Ja'far died in 1067 A.D. He is also the author of a very extensive commentary on the Qur'an, in twenty volumes, which is generally called the \"Tafsir ul-'Ustad,\" though it was entitled by its author the \"Majma'-ul-Bayan li-'ulum-il-Qur'an.\" Among the Four Books on Shi'a Hadis, called Kutub Arba', the two first in order were composed by him entitled \"Tahzib-ul-Ahkam,\" and Istibsar. His chief works are the Masbist and the Khilafat, which are held in great estimation, as are also the Nihaya and the Man la yahzarhu al-Fakih, by the same author. The Rislatul-Jafariya is likewise a legal treatise by at-Tusi, which is frequently quoted.\n\nAbu-Jahl, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u062c\u0647\u0644, the uncle of 'Umar ibn-ul-Khattab. He was one of the most inveterate enemies of Muhammad and his religion. Though his son 'Ukrima became a convert to the tenets of Muhammad, yet his father was for ever shut out from paradise; and so violent is the resentment of the Musalmans against this first enemy of their prophet, that they call the c\u0153locanth, in contempt, the name of Abu-Jahl. Abu-Jahl was slain in the battle of Badr, which he fought against Muhammad, together with Al-As his brother, in the 70th year of his age, in the month of March 624 A.D., Ramazan 2, A.H.\n\nAbu-Lahab, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0644\u062d\u0627\u0628, the uncle of Muhammad, also called 'Abdul-'Uzza, was the son of 'Abdul-Muttalib and one of the bitterest enemies of Muhammad and his doctrines. He died of grief within a week after the defeat of Abu-Sufyan in the battle of Badr, which took place about the beginning of the year 624 A.D., 2 A.H. He was a man of wealth, of proud spirit and irritable temper. His son 'Utba was engaged, or according to some, married to, Muhammad's third daughter Rukayya, but when Muhammad appeared as a prophet, the contract was dissolved, and Rukayya married her lover Usman. Abu-Lahab was also allied to the rival line of Kurash, having married Umm-Jamil, sister of Abu-Sufyan.\n\nAbul-'Abbas, \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0645\u064a \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633, surnamed Al-Saffah, which see.\n\nAbul-'Abbas bin-Muhammad, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f, author of the Arabic work \"Ma'rifat-us-Shahaba,\" and other books.

Al-Darkutmi, the Sunni traditionist, is reported to have said that Ibn-'Ukda knew 300,000 traditions of the Ahl-i-Bait and the Banu-Hashim. He died in A.D. 944, 333 A.H.\n\nAbul-'Abbas Fazl, \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0636\u0644, minister to Mahmud of Ghazni.\n\nAbul-'Aina, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646, a Musalm\u00e2n lawyer celebrated for his wit. When Musa, son of the caliph Abdul-Malik, put to death one of Abul-'Aina's friends, and afterwards spread a report that he had escaped, Abul-'Aina said in the words of the Lawgiver of the Hebrews, \"Moses smote him and he died.\" The sentence was reported to the prince, and Abul-'Aina was summoned to appear. Instead of dreading the threats of the tyrant, he boldly replied in the words of the following verse in Exodus, \"Wilt thou kill me to-day as thou killedst the other man yesterday?\" The ingenuity of the expression disarmed the anger of Musa, who loaded him with presents.\n\nAbu-Lais Nasir Samarkandi, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0644\u0627\u0633 \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0633\u0645\u0631\u0642\u0646\u062f\u0649, author of the work on jurisprudence in Arabic called \"Fiqh Abu-Lais,\" and the \"Ghunayat-ul-Mubtadi.\"\n\nAbul-'Ala, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0621, entitled Malik-ush-Shu'ara, or royal poet, of Ganja, flourished in the time of Mam\u00e9chihir, ruler of Shirwan.

Though he lost his sight in the 3rd year of his age by the small-pox, his poetry is animated and his descriptions are beautiful and striking. He died on Friday the 9th of May 1057 A.D., Ist Rab'i I, 449 A.H. He was the panegyrist of Al-kayim Billah, the caliph of Baghdad, and has left a Diwan in Arabic.

The principal of Abul-Fida's other works is his abridgment of Universal History down to his time, called \"Tarikh Mukhtasir.\" He is very exact, and his style is elegant, on which account his works are very much esteemed.\n\nAbul-Faiz, \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0636\u0644, Vide Faizi.\n\nAbul-Faiz Muhammad bin-Husain bin-Ahmad, \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0636\u0644 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f, surnamed Al-Katib or the Writer, is better known by the name of bin-Ahmad.

It consists of an imaginary disputation between a Shi'a slave-girl and a learned Sunni lawyer, on the merits of their respective doctrines, in which, as a matter of course, the girl utterly discomfits her opponent. The argument is very ingeniously managed, and the treatise, taken altogether, furnishes a good and concise exposition of the tenets of the Shi'as, and the texts on which their belief is founded. This work was translated from Arabic into Persian by Ibrahim Astambadi in 1551 A.D.\n\nAbul-Ghazi Bahadur, \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0632\u064a \u0628\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0631, Kh\u00e1n of the Tartars, was descended from the great Chingiz Kh\u00e1n.

He wrote a valuable genealogical history of the Tartars, the only Tartar history known in Europe, but did not live to finish it. He died A.D. 1663, 1074 A.H., and on his death-bed charged his successor to complete his history, which he performed in two years after his father's death.

He was contemporary with Jalal-uddin Rumi and his son Walad, and died about the year 1270 A.D. He is not, however, according to Baron von Hammer, strictly considered to be a Turkish poet by his countrymen; but the mystic tone which he adopted from Persian literature, and which he undoubtedly the first to impress upon the national mind, gives him an unquestionable right to the place assigned him. The names of his works, such as the \"Seal of Perfection,\" and the \"Key of Mysteries,\" indicate the peculiarity of his taste and genius; but amidst all the confusion of style and thought, some passages of great beauty and even simplicity are found in his works.

The ungrateful refugee, however, had not been many months in office, before he aspired to the kingdom of Kabul, and in March 1564 A.D., Sha'ban, 971 A.H., basely assassinated Mirza Muhammad Hakim's mother, his own mother-in-law, who was a woman of uncommon abilities, and might with truth be said to have ruled that kingdom. He then pretended to act as regent to the young prince, who was still in his minority, with a view to get rid of him as soon as he could conciliate the people. In the meantime Mirza Sulaiman, of Balakhsh, attacked him and slew him in battle on the 13th May, 1564 A.D., 1st Shawwal, 971 A.H., and took possession of that country, which he held for two years.

Amr then went up and said, \"You have heard how Abu-Musa has on his part deposed 'Ali; as for my part I depose him too, and I give the khilafat to Mu'awiya, and invest him with it after the same manner as I put this ring upon my finger;\" and this I do with so much the more justice, because he is 'Ugma's heir and avenger and the worthiest of all men to succeed him.\"\n\nAbu-Muslim, a great general, to whom the Abbasides entirely owed their elevation to the khilafat, for which he is commonly called Sahib-ul-Dawat, or author of the vocation of the Abbasides.

This revolution occasioned the death of above 600,000 men; and when Abu-Jafar Al-Mansur, the second Khalifa of the race of 'Abbas, was opposed on his accession by his uncle 'Abdullah, son of 'Ali, 'Abu-Muslim was despatched against him. This general having harassed him for five months together, at last brought him to a general action, and having entirely defeated him, forced him to fly to Basra. Notwithstanding all his services, however, Abu-Muslim was soon after, on Thursday the 13th February, 755 A.D., 24th Sha'b\u00e2n 137 A.H., ungratefully and barbarously murdered by Al-Mansur, and his body was thrown into the Tigris.

He was astronomer, geometerian, historian, scholar, and logician. Besides metaphysics and dialectics, he studied and appears to have drawn his chief lustre from attainments in the magical art. Of this, the following instance is related. One day Sultan Mahmud ordered him to deposit with a third person a statement of the precise manner in which the monarch would quit the hall where he then was sitting. The paper being lodged, the king, instead of going out by one of the numerous doors, caused a breach to be made in the wall, by which he effected his exit;\u2014but how was\nAbu-Sa'id, the son of 'Abdullah, an Arabian poet who flourished in the court of Sul\u00e1h-ad-d\u00edn, and was his prime minister.

In his time Rash\u00edd-ud-d\u00edn, the author of the Jami'-ut-Tav\u00e1r\u00edkh, was put to death. This monarch may be termed the last of the dynasty of Hul\u00e1k\u00fa Kh\u00e1n who enjoyed any power. The few princes of that sovereign's family who were raised to the throne after Ab\u00fa-Sa'id were mere pageants, whom the nobles of the court elevated or cast down as it suited the purposes of their ambition. Abu-Sa'id reigned 19 lunar years, and died of fever on the 30th November 1335 A.D., 13th Rab\u00ed' II, 736 A.H.

After his death, his eldest son B\u00e1hr\u00fam B\u00e1hr\u00fam, son of Abu-Gh\u00e1z\u00ed, a descendant of Amir Timur, made himself master of the empire.

He was an able and ambitious man, of great wealth and influence, and one of the most persevering and powerful opponents of Muhammad. He was the father of Mu'\u0101wiya, the first khalifa of the house of Umayya, and one of the heads of the tribe of Kurish, to which Muhammad also belonged. When Muhammad took up arms for the propagation of his faith, Abu-Sufyan was made generalissimo of his enemies against him; and after the battle of Badr, he stood very fair for the headship of that tribe. But he was at last convinced (as it seems, by a signal victory gained by Muhammad over his enemies), of the truth of the prophet's pretensions, and was converted in the 8th year of the Hijra, A.D. 629.\n\nAbu-Sulaiman Daud, \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0648\u062f, bin-Abul-Fazl bin-Muhammad Fakhr Bin\u0101k\u012b, so called from having been born at Bin\u0101kit, or Fin\u0101kit, a town in Transoxiana, afterwards called Shihurushia.

In this situation he continued for two years; and after the death of his patron, and the appointment of Haidar Beg Kh\u0101n to his office, he was superseded, and repaired to Lakhnau, and was allowed by the Naw\u0101b 60,000 Rs. per annum for his support. After the expiration of one year, Colonel Alexander Hanny, having been appointed Collector of Gorakh-pur, requested the Naw\u0101b to take him with him as an assistant, in which situation he continued for three years. He was afterwards employed by Mr. Middleton, the Resident of Lakhnau, in reducing the rebel r\u0101j\u0101 Balbhadar Singh, whom, during two years, he frequently defeated and pursued. At length being surprised in his camp, the r\u0101j\u0101 in endeavouring to make his escape, was killed.

The great Tartar conqueror Amir Timur (Tamerlane) being on his march through Anatoli, halted for a while at Amasia, where Ahmadi lived; and the poet took the opportunity of presenting him with an ode. This led to further intimacies, Timur being a patron of literary men; and one day when both were in the bath, the monarch amused himself by putting crochety questions to Ahmadi, and laughing at his answers. \"Suppose now,\" said he, pointing to the surrounding attendants, \"you were required to value these beautiful boys, how much would you say each was worth?\" Ahmadi answered with becoming gravity, estimating one at a camel-load of silver, another at six bushels of pearls, a third at forty gold wedges, and so made the sum fit to the ring. \"Very fair,\" said Timur, \"and not tell me. What do you value me at?\" \"Four and twenty aspers,\" replied the poet, \"no more and no less.\" \"What!\" cried Timur, laughingly, \"why the shirt I have on is worth that?\" \"Do you really think so?\" asked Ahmadi, with the greatest apparent simplicity\u2014\"at that rate you must be worth nothing, for I included the shirt in the valuation!\" Much to his credit, Timur, instead of being angry, applauded and rewarded the wit and boldness of the poet. Ahmadi was a contemporary of Shaikh, and is the author of the \"Kulliyat-i-Khwaja Ahmad Ja'fari.\" He also composed a heroic poem on the actions of Tamerlane, and a Sikandar-nama in the Turkish language.

He is said to have been baptized in his youth by the name of Nicholas, but policy, or conviction, led him to abandon the doctrine of Christ for that of Muhammad, when he assumed the name of Ahmad Kh\u00e2n. In the first year of his reign, Majd-ul-Mulk Yazdi, a nobleman of his court, being accused of sorcery, lost his life.

H., when he received intelligence of the assassination of his father, and immediately returned and assumed the titles of the deceased, and was generally known by those of Ahmad Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk Bahri, to which the people of the Dakh\u00edn added the title of Sh\u00e1h. As he had distinguished himself repeatedly as a general in the field, though the Sult\u00e1n wished to remove him from power, none of his nobility would accept the task of reducing him. He, however, on the 3rd May 1490, 3rd Raj\u00e1b 895 A. H., gained a victory over the army of the Sult\u00e1n, and from that time he sat without opponent on the masnad of royalty, and by the advice of Y\u00fasuf 'Adil Sh\u00e1h, who had already become independent, having discontinued to read the khutba in the name of the king, put in his own and spread a white umbrella over his head. He laid the foundation of the city of Ahmadnagar in A. D. 1495, 900 A. H., which was completed in two years, and became the first of the Niz\u00e1m-Sh\u00e1hi kings of Ahmadnagar. He died in A.

He died on Tuesday, 29th November, 1634, the last Tuesday in the month of Safar, 1034 A. H., and was buried at Sarhindi. He was called \"Mujaddid-i-Alf-i-S\u00e1n\u00ed\", or the Renewer of the second Millennium\", because he adopted the general belief that every thousand years a man was born who has a thorough knowledge of the Isl\u00e1m, and whose vocation it is to revive and strengthen it.

H. His mother's name was Udham B\u00e1\u00ed. He was born in the fort of Dihl\u00ed on Tuesday, 14th December 1725, 17th Rab\u00ed' II, 1138 A.

The author of the Muntakhab-ul-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh states, that his grandfather placed him on the throne during his lifetime, in the year 813 H. or 1416 A. D., and that he survived that measure five months and sixteen days. In the same year, he laid the foundation of a new city on the banks of the S\u00e1barmat\u00ed, which he called after his own name, Ahmad-\u00e1b\u00e1d, and which afterwards became the capital of the kings of Gujr\u00e1t. The date of the laying of the foundation of this city is contained in the words \"F\u00e1-khair\", i.e. all well. He died after a reign of nearly 33 years, on the 4th July 1443 A. D., 4th Rab\u00ed' I, 847 H., and was succeeded by his son Muhammad Sh\u00e1h.\nAhmad Shah II, king of Gujrat. After the death of Mahmud Shah III, there being no relation on whom the succession might devolve, I'timad Khan, the prime minister, resolved rather than see the kingdom in absolute anarchy, to elevate a youth, whom he asserted to be the son of prince Ahmad Khan, formerly governor of Ahmadabad, and declared him the legal successor to the crown of Gujrat. He was forthwith placed on the throne on the 18th February 1554 A.D., 15th Rab' I, 961 A.H. He reigned 7 years and some months, and was found murdered one morning at the foot of the palace wall. This event took place on Monday the 21st April 1561 A.D., 5th Sha'ban, 968 A.H. He was succeeded by Muzaffar Shah III.\n\n[Vide Ain Translation, I, 335.]\n\nAhmad Shah Abdali, commonly called Shah Durrani, was the son of a chief of the Afgh\u00e1n tribe of Abdal, in the vicinity of the city of Hirdat. He was taken prisoner in his infancy by Nadir Shah, who gave him the post of a mace-bearer, and by degrees promoted him to a considerable command in the army. The morning after the assassination of Nadir Shah, which took place in the night of the 12th May, 1747, O.S., he made an attack, supported by a corps of Uzbeks, upon the Persian troops, but was repulsed. He then left the army, and proceeding by rapid marches to Kandahar, not only obtained possession of that city, but took a large convoy of treasure which was coming from Kabul and Sindh to the Persian camp. By the aid of these means, he laid the foundation of a kingdom, which soon attained a strength that rendered it formidable to the surrounding nations. He not only subdued Kandahar and Kabul, but took Peshawar and Lahore; and emboldened by this success, and the weakness of the empire, he resolved the conquest of the capital of Hindustan. In the beginning of the year 1748, 1161 A.H., he began his march from Lahore. Muhammad Shah, the emperor of Delhi, being at this time too indisposed to take the field, despatched his only son, prince Ahmad, against the enemy, under the command of the wazir Kamar-uddin Khan, Sajdar-Jang, governor of Audh, and several other chiefs, with a great army. For some days several skirmishes took place between the two armies near Sarhind. At length, on Friday 11th March, 1748, 22nd Rab' I, 1161 A.H., Kamar-uddin Khan, the wazir, being killed as he was at his devotion in his tent by a cannon ball, a panic prevailed in the Mughul army; the battle, however, continued till a magazine of rockets taking fire in the enemy's camp, numbers of the troops were wounded by the explosion; and Shah Abdali, either disheartened by the loss, or satisfied by the plunder gained at Sarhind, thought it proper to retreat towards Kabul, which he did unmolested. In the year 1757 A.D., 1170 A.H., he again advanced as far as Delhi and Agra; and after having plundered and massacred the inhabitants of Mathura, he returned to Kandahar. About the year 1758 A.D., 1172 A.H., the Maratha power had spread itself in almost all provinces of Hindustan, when Najib-ul-daula, the Rohda Shujat-e-dena Nawab of Audh, and not only the Musalmans but Hindus also, joined in petition to Ahmad Shah Abdali, that he would march and assume the throne of Delhi in which he promised to support him. The Abdali enraged at the seizure of Lahore by the Marathas, rejoiced at the invitation, and advanced without delay across the Indus, and driving the Marathas before him, he did not stop till they reached the vicinity of Delhi. He engaged the Marathas in several battles, and attained the highest renown among Muhammedans by the memorable defeat that he gave the hostile army on the plains of Panipat. This famous action was fought in January, 1761. After this victory, Durrani Shah returned to his own country, but before his departure, he acknowledged Shah Alam, then in Bengal, as emperor of Hindustan, and commanded Shujat-ul-daula and other chiefs to submit to his authority. He died after a reign of 26 years in 1772 A.D., 1182 A.H., aged 50 years, and was succeeded by his son Timur Shah. His tomb, covered with a gilt cupola, stands near the king's palace, and is held sacred as an asylum.\n\nAhmad Shah Wali Bahmani I, (Sultan), was the second son of Sultan Daud Shah of the Bahmani race. He ascended the throne of the Dakhin on the 15th September, 1422 A.D., 5th Shawwal 825 A.H., ten days before the demise of his brother Sultan Firuz Shah, who had resigned the crown in his favor. He is the founder of the city and fort of Ahmadabad Bidar, the foundation of which he laid in the year 1432 A.D., 836 A.H. It is said that the Sultan, on his return from a war at Bidar, took to the amusement of hunting; and coming to a most beautiful spot, finely watered, resolved to build upon it a city, to be called after his name, Ahmadabad. A citadel of great extent and strength was erected on the very site of Bidar, the ancient capital of princes, who, according to the Hindu books, 5000 years back, possessed the whole extent of Mirnat, Karnatik, and Talingana. Raj\u00e1 Bhim Sen was one of the most celebrated of this house, and the history of the loves of his daughter and Raj\u00e1 Nal, king of Malwa, are famous through all Hindustan. Their story was translated from the Sanskrit by Sheikh Fazi, under the title of \"Nal Daman\", into Persian verses, at the command of the emperor Akbar Shah. Ahmad Shah reigned 12 lunar years and 10 months, and died on the 15th of February 1435 A.D., 18th Rajab, 838 A.H. He was buried at Ahmadabad Bidar, and was succeeded by his son Sultan 'Ala-uddin II.\n\nAhmad Shah Bahmani, II, (Sultan). On the death of his father Sultan Mahmud Shah II, in October 1518 A.D., Shawwal 924 A.H., Amir Barid, his prime-minister, dreading that the surrounding powers would attack him should he assume open independence, placed prince Ahmad, son of the late king, upon the throne at Ahmadabad Bidar, leaving him the palace, with the use of the royal jewels and a daily allowance of money for his support. The sum not being equal to his expenses, the king broke up the crown, which was valued at 400,000 buns, or \u00a3160,000, and privately sold the jewels. He died two years after his accession to the throne, in the year 1521 A.D., 927 A.H. After his death Amir Barid raised Sultan 'Ala-uddin III, one of the princes, on the throne. Two years after, he was imprisoned, and another son of Mahmud Shah, named Waliullah Shah, was placed in his room. Three years after his accession, the minister conceiving a passion for his wife, he caused him to be poisoned, and espoused the queen. He then placed Kalimullah, the son of Ahmad Shah II, on the throne. This prince enjoyed nothing but the name of sovereign, and was never allowed to leave the palace. He was afterwards treated with great rigour by Amir Barid, whereupon he made his escape first to his uncle Ismail 'Adil Shah to Bijapur, and thence to Burhan Nizam Shah of Ahmadnagar, where he resided till his death. With him ended the dynasty of the Bahmani kings of the Dakhin. In fact before this event, the Dakhin was divided into five kingdoms\u2014'Adil-Shahi or kings of Bijapur; Kutb-Shahi, or kings of Golconda; Imad-Shahi, or kings of Barar; Nizam-Shahi or kings of Ahmadnagar; and Barid-Shahi, kings of Ahmadabad Bidar.\n\nAhmad Shah of Bengal, succeeded his father Jalal-uddin to the throne of Bengal in 834 H. or 1430 A.D., reigned about 16 years, and died about the year 1446 A.D., 850 A.H. He was succeeded by Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah I, a descendant of Shams-uddin Ilyas Shah.\n\nAhmad Shah, or Ahmad-ullah Shah, commonly called \"The Maulawi\", a prominent character\nin the neighbourhood of Shahjah\u00e1npur and Muhammad\u00ed during the mutiny of 1857. He is said to have been the inspired Fakir who travelled through the upper provinces, a few years ago, on a miraculous mission. He made a pretty long stay at Agra, astonishing the natives and puzzling the authorities. It seems probable that he was even then busy in sowing the seeds of rebellion. He held great power within the city of Lakhnau, in March, 1858, when the Commander-in-chief entered that city and commanded a stronghold in the very heart of the city. He was slain at Pusa, on the 15th June 1858, sixteen miles north-east of Shahjah\u00e1npur, and the raja of that place sent the head and trunk to Mr. Gilbert Money, the Commissioner.\n\nAhmad Shihab-uddin Talish, \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0634\u06cc\u062e\u0627\u0628\u200c\u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u062a\u0627\u0644\u0634, vide Shih\u00e1b-udd\u00edn Ahmad T\u00e1l\u00edsh.\n\nAhmad Suhaili, \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0633\u0647\u06cc\u0644\u06cc (Am\u00edr), seal-bearer to Sultan Husain Mirz\u00e1 of H\u00edr\u00e1t, to whom several of the poets of his time dedicated their works.

He was made an eunuch in his childhood by 'Ad\u00edl Sh\u00e1h, the nephew and immediate successor of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h. After the death of 'Ad\u00edl Sh\u00e1h, he obtained his release, and joined his father, who was afterwards slain by Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n Z\u00e1nd, king of Persia. \u00c1gh\u00e1 or Ak\u00e1 Muhammad was obliged to surrender himself to him, and was a prisoner in the city of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z. He had, for some time, been very strictly guarded, and was never allowed to go beyond the walls of the town, but afterwards he was permitted to go a-hunting. During the last illness of Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n assumed a dangerous liberty, and he contrived to leave that city on the usual pretext of hunting. When intelligence was brought to him that the founder of the Z\u00e1nd dynasty was no more, accompanied by a few attendants, he commenced his flight, and favored by the confusion of the moment, he reached his province of M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n in safety, and proclaimed himself one of the competitors for the crown of Persia. Soon after the\ndeath of 'Al\u00ed Mur\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, ruler of Persia, in 1755 A.D., he made himself master of Isfah\u00e1n without a battle, but had for several years to contend with Lutf 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, the last prince of the Zand family, before he became sole master of Persia. Lutf 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n was put to death by him in A.D. 1795, 14th Mulharram, 1212 A.H. Ak\u00e1 Muhammad Kh\u00e1n was murdered on the 10th July, 1797, by two of his attendants, whom he had sentenced to death, in the 63rd year of his age. He had been a ruler of a great part of Persia for upwards of 20 years, but had only for a short period enjoyed the undisputed sovereignty of that country. He was succeeded by his nephew Fath 'Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h, who died in 1824, 1250 A.H. After him, his grandson Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, the son of 'Abb\u00e1s Mirz\u00e1, mounted the throne and died in 1847, when his son N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, the present king of Persia, succeeded him.\n\nAka Razi, \u0627\u06a9\u0631 \u0631\u0627\u0632\u06cc, a poet of Persia, who came to India, and after his return home, died in 1615 A.D., 1024 A.H.\n\nAka Rihi, of Nish\u00e1p\u00far, an author.\n\nAkbarabadi Mahall, \u0627\u06a9\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0645\u062d\u0644, A'azz-un-Nis\u00e1 Begum, was the name of one of the wives of the emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n.

He is mentioned in the Khul\u00e1s\u00e1t-ul-Ash\u00e1r to have been the son of a washerman. He went to India, and turned fakir, but as he was an infidel, his ascetic exercises cannot have been of much use to his soul. He left a diw\u00e1n of about 8000 verses, and a masnav\u00ed, called \"Zarra wa Khurshed\".

When his father Dost Muhammad Kh\u00e1n came into possession of Kabul after the retreat of the English in 1842, he was appointed heir-apparent in preference to Muhammad Afzal Kh\u00e1n, his eldest son by his second wife. He died in 1848, when his full brother Ghul\u00e1m Haider Kh\u00e1n was nominated heir-apparent, after whose death, in 1858, Sher 'Al\u00ed his brother, the present Amir, was nominated.\n\nAkbar, (Prince) the youngest son of the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr, was born on the 10th September, 1657, O.S., 11th Zil-hijjah, 1067 A.H., raised the standard of rebellion against his father, and joined the Maratha chief Sambhuj\u00ed in June 1681. He afterwards quitted his court, and repaired to Persia, where he died in 1706, 1118 A.H., a few months before his father, and was buried at Mashhad in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n. 'Alamg\u00edr, at one time, intended to make Akbar his successor, and this preference arose from Akbar being the son of a Muhammadan mother, the daughter of Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n; whereas his brothers Sult\u00e1ns Mu'azzam and Azam were born of Rajp\u00fat princesses.\n\nAkbar Shah, \u0627\u06a9\u0628\u0631 \u0634\u0627\u06c1, the Great, emperor of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, surnamed Abul-Fath Jal\u00e1l-udd\u00edn Muhammad, was the eldest son of the emperor Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, and was born in Amarkot in the province of Sindh on Sunday the 15th October, 1542 A.D., 6th Rajab, 949 A.H., at a time when his father, after being defeated by Sher Shah, had taken refuge with R\u00e1na Pr\u00e1shad. At the time of his father's death, Akbar was at K\u00e1f\u00ed\u00e1n\u00ed, where he had been deputed by his father with a considerable force to expel the ex-king S\u00edk\u00e1ndar Sh\u00e1h S\u00far from the Siw\u00e1lik mountains. When information reached the prince of this mournful event, Bair\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, and other officers who were present, raised him to the throne on Friday, 14th February, 1556, A.D., 2nd Rab\u00ed II, 963 A.H., Akbar being then only 13 years and 9 months old. He enlarged his dominions by the conquest of Guj\u00fat\u00ed, Bengal, Kashmir, and Sind. Besides the forts of At\u00e1k, \u00c1zr\u00e1, and All\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, many military works were erected by him. He also built and fortified the town of Faizp\u00far Sikri, which was his principal residence, and which, though now deserted, is one of the most splendid remains of former grandeur of India. He died after a prosperous reign of 51 lunar years and 9 months on Wednesday, the 16th October, 1605, Old Style, 13th Jum\u00e1d\u00e1 II, 1014 A.H., aged 64 lunar years and 11 months. The words \"Faut-i-Akbar Sh\u00e1h,\" (the death of Akbar Sh\u00e1h) are the chronogram of his death. He was buried in the village of Sikandra in the environs of Agra, where a splendid mausoleum was built over his remains by his son Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, which is still in a high state of preservation. He received after his death the title of \"Arsh-'Ash\u00e1y\u00e1n\u00ed,\" and was succeeded by his son Sult\u00e1n Sal\u00edm, who assumed the title of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. His mother's name was Ham\u00edda B\u00e1n\u00fa, commonly called Maryam-Mak\u00e1n\u00ed. The history of this potentate has been written, with great elegance and precision by his waz\u00edr Abul-Fazl, in a work, entitled the \"Akbar-n\u00e1m\u00e1.\" In order to keep his turbulent Umar\u00e1s, Turks, and Afgh\u00e1ns, in check, Hind\u00fa chiefs were encouraged by Akbar, and entrusted with the highest powers, both military and civil, as was the case with R\u00e1ja M\u00e1ldeo of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, Bh\u00e1g\u00e1n D\u00e1s of Amber, M\u00e1n Singh, his son, and R\u00e1ja Todar Mal. He also connected himself and his sons with them by marriage. Both Akbar and his successor, Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, had amongst their wives several of Hind\u00fa origin. Towards the middle of his reign, Akbar became dissatisfied with the Muhammadan religion, and invited to his court teachers of the Christian, Hind\u00fa, and Parsi religions, and took an interest in their discussions. He adopted, however, neither, but attempted to found a new system of belief, called \"Din-i-Illahi,\" which acknowledged one God, and the king as his vicegerent.\n\nAkbar Shah II, \u0627\u06a9\u0628\u0631 \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u062f\u0648\u0645, king of Dihl\u00ed, whose title in full is Abul-N\u00e1sr Mu'\u00edn-ud-d\u00edn Muhammad Akbar Sh\u00e1h, was the son of the nominal emperor Sh\u00e1h 'Alam; was born on Wednesday, 23rd April, 1760, New Style, 7th Ram\u00e1zan, 1173 H., and succeeded his father at the age of 48, on the 19th of November, 1806 A.D., 7th Ram\u00e1zan, 1221 H., as titular king of Dihl\u00ed. On his accession he made some weak attempts to increase his influence and power. These were properly resisted, but at the same time the pledge given by Lord Wellesley, to increase the allowance of the imperial family when the revenue of the country improved, was redeemed by an act of politic liberality. An augmentation of ten thousand rupees per mensum was appropriated for the support of his eldest son, whom he had declared heir-apparent. He sat on the throne of his ancestors nearly 32 lunar years; died on Friday, 28th September, 1837, 25th Jum\u00e1d\u00e1 II, 1255 A.H., aged about 80 lunar years, and was buried at Dihl\u00ed, close to the tomb of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h.

Accordingly, he deprived him of the furniture of the imperial palace at Khurasan, and in open violation of his father's will, who had bestowed on al-Mamun the perpetual government of Khurasan and of all the troops in that province, he ordered these forces to march directly to Baghdad.

After the death of Shuja'uddin, and the accession of his son Sarfaraz Khan to the government of Bengal, Allahwirdi contrived to murder the latter in 1740 A.D., 1153 A.H., and usurped the government. He reigned sixteen years over the three provinces of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, and died on Saturday, the 16th April, 1756, N.S., 9th Rajab, 1169 A.H., aged 80 years. He was buried in Murshidabad near the tomb of his mother in the garden of Khush-Bagh, and was succeeded by his grand-nephew and grandson Mirza Mahmud, better known by his assumed name of Siraj-ud-daula.

In the time of the emperor Muhammad Shah, when Rajah Akbar Singh, the son of Rajah Ajit Singh Marwar, was appointed governor of Gujrat in the room of Nawab Sarbaland Khan, the latter made some opposition to his successor; a battle ensued, and Shaikh Ilaah Yar, who was then with the nawab, was killed in the action.

Al-Fazl having ingratiated himself with the khalifa by his ready compliance with his orders was chosen prime-minister, and governed with absolute sway; al-Amin abandoning himself entirely to drunkenness; Al-Fazl was a very able minister; but fearing al-Mam\u00edn's resentment, if ever he should ascend the throne, he gave al-Amin such advice as proved in the end the ruin of them both. He advised him to deprive al-Mam\u00edn of the right of succession that had been given him by his father, and transfer it to his own son Musa, though then but an infant. Agreeable to this pernicious advice, the khalifa sent for his brother al-Kasim from Mesopotamia, and recalled al-Mam\u00edn from Khuras\u00e1n, pretending he had occasion for him as an assistant in his councils. By this ill-treatment al-Mam\u00edn was so much provoked, that he resolved to come to an open rupture with his brother. A war soon after broke out between them. T\u00e1hir ibn-Husain, the general of al-Mam\u00edn, laid siege to Baghdad, took it, and having seized al-Amin, cut off his head, and exposed it to public view in the streets of Baghdad. Afterwards he sent it to al-Mam\u00edn in Khuras\u00e1n, together with the ring or seal of the khilafat, the sceptre and the imperial robe. At the sight of these, al-Mam\u00edn fell down on his knees, and returned thanks to God for his success, making the courier who brought the insignia a present of a million of dirhams. The death of al-Amin took place on the 6th October, 813 A.D., 6th Safar, 198 A.H.

He was the third son of the emperor Shah Jah\u00e1n, born on Sunday, 10th October, 1619 O.S., 11th Zil-k\u00e1'da, 1028 H. His mother's name was Arjmand B\u00e1n\u00fa, surnamed Mumt\u00e1z Mahal. In his youth, he put on the appearance of religious sanctity, but in June, 1658, Ramz\u00e1n, 1068 H., during his father's illness, he in conjunction with his brother Mur\u00e1d Baksh, seized Agra, and made his father prisoner. Mur\u00e1d was soon after imprisoned by 'Alamgir, who marched to Delhi, where he caused himself to be proclaimed emperor on the 21st July of the same year, 1st Zil-k\u00e1'da, 1068 H., but was not crowned till the first anniversary of his accession, a circumstance which has introduced some confusion in the chronology of his reign. Soon after, he put Mur\u00e1d Baksh and his eldest brother the heir-apparent D\u00e1r\u00e1 Shikoh to death. He greatly enlarged his dominions, and became so formidable, that all Eastern princes acknowledged to him. He was an able prince, but a bigoted Sunn\u00e1, and attempted to force the Hindus to adopt that faith, destroying their temples, and levying the capitation tax (jizya) from every Hind\u00fa. The feudatory chiefs of Rajp\u00fatana successfully resisted the impost. He died after a reign of 50 lunar years at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d in the Dakh\u00edn, on Friday, the 21st of February, 1707 O.S., 28th Zil-k\u00e1'da, 1118 H., aged 90 lunar years and 17 days, and was interred in the court of the mausoleum of Shaikh Zain-uddin, in Khuld\u00e1b\u00e1d, 8 kos from the city of Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d.

His elder brother Kurshuddin, prince of Ghor, was publicly executed by his brother-in-law Bahr\u00e2m Shah of Ghazni in 1119 A.D., 513 A.H.

When the news of his brother's death reached 'Ala-uddin, he burnt with rage and being determined to take revenge, invaded Ghazni with a great army. He defeated Bahr\u00e2m Shah, who fled to Lakh, took possession of Ghazni in 1152 A.D., 574 A.H., and gave up the city to flames, slaughter, and devastation for several days, on which account he is known by the epithet of \"Jahangir\", or the burner of the world. He carried his animosity so far as to destroy every monument of the Ghaznivite emperors with the exception of those of Sultan Mahmud, Masud, and Taimur; but he defaced all the inscriptions, even of their times, from every public edifice.

He was a native of Dakhin, and in the service of a Brahmanical astrologer named Kangoh, or Kangoh, enjoying high favor with the prince Muhammad Tughlaq, afterwards king of Dakhin. This Brahman assured Hasan that he perceived from his horoscope that he would rise to great distinction, and be eminently favored of the Almighty; and made him promise that if he ever should attain regal power, he would use the name of Kangoh and employ him as his minister of finance, a request with which Hasan readily complied. The governor of Daulatabad and others having revolted took possession of the place, and selected Hasan (who had then the title of Zafar Khan and a jagir in the Dakhin) to be their king. On Friday, the 3rd August, 1347 A.D., 24th Rabi' II, 748 A.H., they crowned him and raised him on the throne, with the title of 'Ala-uddin Hasan Kangoh Bahmani at Kulbarga, which place became the royal residence and capital of the first Muhammadan king of the Dakhin and was named Ahsanabad. Towards the end of the reign of Muhammad Tughlaq of Delhi, he subdued every part of the Dakhin previously subject to the chieftains of Dakhin.

He was born 23 years before the Hijr\u00e1t, i.e., in the year 599 A.D., at the very temple of Ka'ba. His mother's name was F\u00e1tima, daughter of Asad, the son of H\u00e1s\u00edm. After the death of Muhammad, he was opposed in his attempts to succeed the prophet by 'Usm\u00e1n and 'Umar, and retired into Arabia where his mild and enlarged interpretation of the Qur'\u00e1n increased the number of his proselytes. After the death of 'Usm\u00e1n, the 3rd khalifa, he was acknowledged khalifa by the Egyptians and Arabians in July, 655 A.D., but in less than 5 years after, he was compelled to resign that title, and Mu'\u00e1wiya was proclaimed khalifa at Damascus. 'Ali was subsequently wounded by 'Abdur-Rahm\u00e1n ibn-Muljim in a mosque at K\u00fafa, whilst engaged in his evening prayers, on Friday, the 22nd January, 661, A.D., 17th Ramaz\u00e1n, 40 A.H., and died four days after. 'Ali after the decease of his beloved F\u00e1tima, the daughter of the prophet, claimed the privilege of polygamy, and had 18 sons and 18 daughters. The most renowned of them are the two sons of F\u00e1tima, viz., Hasan and Husain, as also Muhammad Hanif, by another wife. Among the many surnames or honorable titles bestowed upon 'Ali, are the following\u2014Wasi', which signifies \"legatee and heir;\" Murtaq\u00e1, \"beloved by God;\" Asad-ullah-ul-Gh\u00e1lib, \"the victorious lion of God;\" H\u00e1idar, a \"lion;\" Sh\u00e1h Mard\u00e1n, \"king of men;\" Sher Khw\u00e1d\u00e1, \"the lion of God.\" His memory is still held in the highest veneration by the Muhammadians, who say that he was the first that embraced their religion. They say moreover, that Muhammad, talking of him, said, \"Ali is for me and I am for him; he stands to me in the same rank as Aaron did to Moses. I am the town in which all knowledge is shut up, and he is the gate of it.\" However, these great eulogies did not hinder his name, and that of all his family, from being cursed, and their persons from being excommunicated through all the mosques of the empire of the khalifas of the house of Umayya, from Mu'\u00e1wiya down to the time of 'Umar ibn-'Abdul-'Az\u00edz, who suppressed the solemn malediction. There were besides several khalifas of the house of 'Abd\u00eds, who expressed a great aversion to 'Ali and all his posterity; such as Mut'aqid and Mutawakkil. On the other hand, the F\u00e1timite khalifas of Egypt caused his name to be added to that of Muhammad in the call to prayer (f\u00e1zan) which is chaunted from the turrets of the mosques. He is the first of the twelve Im\u00e1ms, eleven of whom were his descendants. Their names are as follows:\n\n1. 'Ali, the son of Ab\u00fa-T\u00e1lib,\n2. Im\u00e1m Husain, eldest son of 'Ali,\n3.

Under pretence of making his submissions to the Sultan, he begged an interview with the Bij\u00e1pur\u00ed general, Afz\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, whom he treacherously stabbed in an embrace. Rustam Kh\u00e1n was afterwards sent against him, and defeated. 'Ali 'Adil Sh\u00e1h died in\nthe year 1672 A.D., 1083 A.H. after a turbulent reign of 11 or 12 years.

In his 13th year he was carried away by some robbers as he was hunting, and sold to Ibrahim, lieutenant of the Janissaries, at Grand Cairo, who treated him with kindness. 'Ali distinguished himself against the Arabs, but when his patron was basely assassinated in 1558, by Ibrahim the Circassian, he avenged his death, and slew the murderer with his own hand. This violent measure exposed him to enemies, and his flight to Jerusalem, and to Ptolemais of Acre with difficulty saved him from the resentment of the Ottoman Porte, that had demanded his head. Time, however, paved the way to his elevation. Those who had espoused the cause of the Circassian were sacrificed to the public safety; and 'Ali recalled by the public voice, governed the country with benevolence and equity. In a battle fought against a rebellious Mamlik to whom he had entrusted part of his army, 'Ali saw some of his troops desert, and unwilling to survive a defeat, he defended himself with the fury of a lion, till he was cut down by a sabre and carried to the conqueror's tent, where eight days after he expired of his wounds, April 21st, 1773, in his 45th year, and left behind him a character unrivalled for excellence, for courage, and magnanimity.\n\n'Ali Bae, \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u06cc, the titles by which he was known in the Muhammadan countries, were, al-Amr, al-Hakim, al-Fakih, al-Shari', al-Hajji 'Ali Bae ibn Usman Bae al-Abbas, Khadim Baitullah al-Haram, i.e. the prince, the learned, doctor of the law, of the blood of Muhammad, pilgrim, 'Ali Bae, son of Usman Bae, of the race of the Abbasides, servant of the house of God. He was master of the Arabic language, and had carefully studied the mathematical and natural branches of science and knowledge. It was in 1802 that he visited England. In June 1803 he sailed from Spain to Morocco, and travelled through Tripoli, Cyprus, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, and Turkey, and wrote a history of his travels, which was translated into English and published in London in the year 1816, entitled \"The Travels of Ali Bae.\" In his visit to the isle of Cyprus he surveyed some curious remains of antiquity that have been usually overlooked. Having been admitted in his character of a Muhammadan prince to sweep the interior of the Ka'ba at Mecca, the most sacred office that a Musalm\u00e1n can perform, and to visit it repeatedly, he has given, from personal inspection a more minute and exact account of the temple of Mecca than other travellers could lay before the public. His notice of the venerated mountain beyond Mecca, the last and principal object of the pilgrimage to that city, and his description of the interior of the Temple of Jerusalem, which no Christian is permitted to enter, is said to contain much new information.\n\n'Ali Bahadur, \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0628\u0631, Nawab of Banda, eldest son of Shamsher Bahadur I, and grandson of the Marhatta chief Baji Rao Peshwa I. He received the investiture of Bundelkhand from Nana Farnawis, the Purna minister, about the year 1790 A.D. and accompanied by his brother Ghani Bahadur, and supported by a powerful army, invaded Bundelkhand, but was opposed by Nana Arjun, (the guardian of Bakht Singh a descendant of Raj\u00e1 Natwari) who falling in the contest, and Raj\u00e1 Bakht Singh being taken prisoner, Ali Bahadur acquired the whole of that part of the raja of Banda which belonged to Bakht Singh and all the raja of Panna. He reigned about 11 or 12 years, and at the time of his death, which happened in 1801 or 1802 A.D., his eldest son Shamsher Bahadur II was absent at Panna; his youngest son Zulfikar Ali was proclaimed (in violation of the title of his eldest brother) as his successor by his uncle Ghani Bahadur and his Div\u00e1n Himmat Bahadur Goshain. Ghani Bahadur, however, was soon after expelled by Shamsher Bahadur who took possession of the raja.\n\n'Ali Bahadur Khan, \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0646, the last Nawab of Banda and son of Zulfikar Ali Khan Bahadur. He is the author of a diwan and a masnavi called \"Mehrullah.\" He was removed for alleged complicity in the rebellion of 1857.\n\n'Ali Barid I, \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u062f, succeeded his father Amir Barid to the throne of Ahmadabad Bidar in the Dakhlan in the year 1542 A.D. and was the first of this family who assumed royalty. He died after a reign of more than 20 years in 1562 A.D., 970 A.H. and was succeeded by his son Ibrahim Barid.\n\n'Ali Barid II, succeeded his father Kasim Barid II in the government of Ahmadabad Bidar in 1572 A.D. and was deposed in 1609 by his relative Amir Barid II, who succeeded him, and was the last of this dynasty.\n\n'Ali Beg, \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u06af, a Pole, born of Christian parents. When young he was made prisoner by the Tartars and sold to the Turks, who educated him in the Muhammadan faith. He rose in the Turkish court, and was appointed interpreter to the Grand Signior, and translated the Bible and the English Catechism into the Turkish language. His great work is on the liturgy of the Turks, their pilgrimages to Mecca, and other religious ceremonies, translated into Latin by Dr. Smith. He died 1675 A.D.\n\n'Ali Beg, (Mirza), \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u06af, a native of Balakhsh\u00e1n who held a high rank in the service of the emperor Akbar; and was honored with the office of 4,000 in the reign of Jahangir. He accompanied the emperor one day to visit the shrine of the celebrated saint, Shaikh Maimuddin Chishti at Ajmer, and happening to see the tomb of Shahbaz Khan Kambo, he embraced it, and crying out with a loud voice, that, \"he, when living, was one of his oldest and best friends\" gave up the ghost.

He died in 957 A.D., 346 A.H.\n'Ali Boya or Ali ibn Boya, \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0646 \u0628\u06cc\u0627, entitled Im\u00e1d-ad-daula, the first of a race of kings of Fars and Tr\u00e1k. The flatterers of this family, which is called Dilm\u00e1ni or D\u00edlaima (from the name of their native village, D\u00edlaima) and R\u00f3ya or Buyites (from that of one of their ancestors named R\u00f3ya), trace their descent to the ancient kings of Persia, but the first of this race that history mentions was a fisherman of D\u00edlam whose name was R\u00f3ya. His eldest son, 'Ali Boya, was employed by a governor of his native country named Muravij, and was in the command of the chief part of his army, with which he encountered and defeated Y\u00e1k\u00fat, the governor of Isfah\u00e1n, and by the immense plunder that he obtained from that victory, he became at once a leader of reputation and of power. He pursued Y\u00e1k\u00fat into Fars, defeated him again, and took possession of the whole of that province as well as those of Kirm\u00e1n, Kh\u00faz\u00edst\u00e1n and Tr\u00e1k in 933 A.D., 321 A.H. This chief was afterwards tempted, by the weak and distracted state of the Khil\u00edf\u00e1t or Caliphate, to a still higher enterprise: accompanied by his two brothers, Hasan and Ahmad, he marched to Bagh\u00e1d\u00e1d. The Khil\u00edf al-R\u00e1z\u00ed Bill\u00e1h fled, but was soon induced to return; and his first act was to heap honors on those who had taken possession of his capital. 'Ali Boya, on agreeing to pay annually 600,000 dinars of gold, was appointed viceroy of Fars and Tr\u00e1k, with the rank of Amir-ul-Umr\u00e1, and the title of Im\u00e1d-ad-daula. His younger brother Ahmad, received the title of Maizz-ad-daula, and was nominated wazir to the khal\u00edf. Hasan, who was his second brother, received the title of Rukn-ad-daula, and acted, during the life of 'Ali Boya, under that chief. 'Ali Boya fixed his residence at Shir\u00e1z, and died on Sunday the 11th November, 949 A.D., 16th Jam\u00e1d I, 338 H., much regretted by his soldiers and subjects.

He was received with great honour, was created Am\u00edr-ul-Umr\u00e1, and was at different times, made governor of Kashmir and K\u00e1b\u00fal, and employed in various wars and other duties. He excited universal admiration at the court by the skill and judgment of his public works, of which the canal which bears his name at D\u00edl\u00ed still affords a proof, and the taste and elegance he displayed on all occasions of show and festivity. He died on his way to Kashmir, where he was going for change of air, on the 16th of April, 1657 A.D., O.S., 12th K\u00e1faj, 1067 A.H., and was buried at Lahor in the mausoleum of his mother.

His mother's name was Umm Sayy\u00edd; he was born in the year 764 or 769 A.D., 147 A.H. and died on Friday the 12th of August 818 A.D., 9th Safar, 203 H. His wife's name was Umm Hab\u00edl the daughter of the Kh\u00e1l\u00edf al-M\u00e1'm\u00edn. His sepulchre is at T\u00fa\u00eds in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n. That town is now commonly called Mash-had, that is, the place of martyrdom of the Im\u00e1m. To the enclosure wherein his tomb is raised, the Persians give the name of \"Kawzat Rizw\u00e1\", or the garden of R\u00e1z\u00e1, and esteem it the most sacred spot in all Persia. The chief ornament and support of Mash-had is this tomb, to which many thousands of pious pilgrims annually resort, and which had been once greatly enriched by the bounty of sovereigns. Nas\u00edr-udd\u00edn Mirz\u00e1 the son of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h carried away the golden railing that surrounded the tomb, and N\u00e1dir Mirz\u00e1 son of Sh\u00e1h-r\u00fakh Mirz\u00e1 and grandson of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h, took down the great golden ball which ornamented the top of the\ndome over the grave, and which was said to weigh 60 maunds or 420 pounds. The carpets fringed with gold, the golden lamps, and everything valuable were plundered by these necessitous and rapacious princes. Ali M\u016bs\u0101 R\u0101z\u0101 was poisoned by the khalif al-M\u0101mm\u016bn, consequently is called a martyr.\n\n**'Ali Muhammad Khan**, founder of the Rohila government. It is mentioned in Forster's Travels, that in the year 1720 A.D., Bash\u0101r Kh\u0101n and D\u0101d\u0101 Kh\u0101n, of the tribe of Rohilas, accompanied by a small number of their adventurous countrymen came into Hindustan in quest of military service. They were first entertained by Madan Sh\u0101h, a Hindu chief of Seraun, (a small town in the north-west quarter of Rohilkhand,) who by robbery and predatory excursions maintained a large party of banditti. In the course of an adjacent village, D\u0101d\u0101 Kh\u0101n captured a youth of the \u0100t\u0101 sect, whom he adopted and brought up in the Muhammadan faith, by the name of 'Ali Muhammad, and distinguished this boy by pre-eminent marks of paternal affection. Some years after, the Rohilas quarrelling with Madan Sh\u0101h, retired from his country, and associating themselves with Ch\u0101nd Kh\u0101n the chief of Barot, they jointly entered into the service of Azmat Kh\u0101n, the governor of Moradabad. After the death of D\u0101d\u0101 Kh\u0101n, who was slain by the mountaineers in one of his excursions, the Rohila party in a short space of time seized on the districts of Madan Sh\u0101h and 'Ali Muhammad Kh\u0101n was declared chief of the party. From the negligence of government and the weak state of the empire of D\u012bl\u012b in the reign of Muhammad Sh\u0101h, he possessed himself of the district of Katir (now called from the residence of the Rohilas, Rohilkhand) and assumed independence of the royal authority. He was besieged in March, 1745 A.D., Safar 1158 A.H., in a fortress called Bankar and 'Aoul\u0101 and taken prisoner, but was released after some time, and a j\u0113gir conferred on him. The emperor Muhammad Sh\u0101h died in April 1748, A.D. 1161 A.H. and 'Ali Muhammad Kh\u0101n some time after him in the same year at 'Aoul\u0101, which he had ornamented with numerous public and private edifices. He left four sons, viz., Sa'd-ull\u0101h Kh\u0101n, Abdullah Kh\u0101n, Faiz-ull\u0101h Kh\u0101n and Dunde Kh\u0101n.

He reigned over Persia five years and was independent of the government two years prior to this period. Persia during this time, enjoyed a certain degree of peace. He continued to confine his rival Ak\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n to the province of M\u0101z\u012bndar\u0101n.

For some time he was in disgrace with his patron and changed his Takkallus or poetical name from Nawedi to N\u0101-umaidi (or hopeless).

He was co-temporary with the poet Azuri, who died A.D. 1462, 866 A.H.\n\n**'Alisher**, (Am\u012br) surnamed Niz\u0101m-udd\u012bn, was the prime minister of the Sult\u0101n Husain M\u012brz\u0101 ruler of Khur\u0101s\u0101n. He sprang from an illustrious family of the Jaghtai or Chaght\u0101i tribe. His father Gajk\u012bna Bah\u0101dur, held one of the principal offices of government during the reign of Sult\u0101n Ab\u016bl Kas\u012bm B\u0101bar Bah\u0101dur, a descendant of Am\u012br Taim\u016br. His grandfather, by his mother's side, was one of the principal Amirs of Sult\u0101n B\u0101\u012bkara M\u012brz\u0101, the grandfather of Sult\u0101n Husain M\u012brz\u0101. Alisher attached himself originally to Sult\u0101n Ab\u016bl Kas\u012bm B\u0101bar M\u012brz\u0101, who was greatly attached to him, and called him his son. After his death he retired to Mashhad and continued his studies there; which place he subsequently quitted for Samarqand, on account of the disturbances which broke out in Khur\u0101s\u0101n, and applied himself diligently to the acquirement of knowledge in the college of Khw\u0101ja Fazl-ull\u0101h. When Sult\u0101n Husain M\u012brz\u0101 became uncontrolled ruler of Khur\u0101s\u0101n, he requested Sultan Ahmad M\u012brz\u0101, at that time ruler of the countries beyond the Oxus, to send Alisher to him. On his arrival, he was received with the greatest distinction, and raised to the highest posts of honor. Alisher's palace was open to all men of learning; and notwithstanding that the reins of government were placed in other hands, in the midst of the weightiest affairs, he neglected no opportunity of improving both himself and others in the pursuit of knowledge. He was not only honored by his own Sult\u0101n and his officers, but foreign princes also esteemed and respected him. After being employed in the capacity of d\u012bw\u0101n and prime minister for some time, love of study induced him to resign, and bidding a final adieu to public life, he passed the remainder of his days in composing Turkish and Persian works, of which Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 recounts the names of no less than twenty-one. Daulat Sh\u0101h the biographer, M\u012brkband and his son Khv\u0101ndam\u012br, the historians, dedicated their works to him, and amongst other men of genius who were cherished by his liberality may be mentioned the celebrated poet J\u0101m\u012b. His collection of Odes in the Chaght\u0101i or pure Turkish dialect, which he wrote under the poetical name of Naw\u0101i, amounts to 10,000 couplets, and his parody of Niz\u0101m\u012b's five poems, containing nearly 30,000 couplets, is universally admired by the cultivators of Turkish poetry, in which he is considered to be without a rival. In the Persian language also he wrote a collection of Odes, under the poetical name of F\u0101n\u012b or F\u0101n\u0101\u012b, consisting of 6,000 distiches. Alisher was born in the year 1440 A.D., 844 A.H., and died on Sunday the 6th of December, 1500 A.D., 15th Jam\u0101d I, 906 A.H., five years before his royal friend and master Sult\u0101n Husain M\u012brz\u0101. Khv\u0101ndam\u012br has recorded the year of his death in an affectionate chronogram: \"His highness the Amir, the asylum of divine guidance, in whom all the marks of mercy were conspicuous, has quitted the thorny brake of the world, and fled to the rose-garden of pity.\" Since the\nlight of mercy has descended on his soul, those words represent the year of his departure.\" One of his works is called \"Maj\u00e1l\u00eds-ul-N\u00e1f\u00e1s.\"\n\n'Ali Tabar, \u0634\u0647\u06cc\u062f \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0637\u0628\u0627\u0631, (Prince) was the son of prince 'Az\u00edm Sh\u00e1h, and grandson of the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr.

There is a heroic ballad sung or recited by the Hind\u00fa sepoys in a kind of monotonous, but not unmusical sort of chant, accompanied by a sotto voce beat of the dh\u00f3li, which rise to a crescendo in the pause between the verses. Whoever has resided in a military cantonment must have frequently observed the sepoys, when disengaged from military duty, collected in small knots, listening to one of the party reciting some poem or tale to a deeply interested audience. The subject of this lay is the prowess of 'Alha', the r\u0101j\u00e1 of Mah\u00f3ba, a town in Bundelkhand, of which extensive ruins remain. The hero is described as the terror of the Muhammadians; his triumphs over whom are attributed not only to his own valour, but the favor of the goddess K\u00e1lf, whom he had propitiated by the offering of his life. There are many songs, it is said, of this prince, and his brother Udal, a warrior of equal estimation; but they are preserved only traditionally by the Pow\u00e1rs, and their amateur students. The verses are in Bhakha.\n\nAl-H\u00e1di, \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062f\u0649, the fourth khalif of the house of 'Abb\u00e1s succeeded his father al-M\u00e1dhi on the 4th of August, 785 A.D., 23rd Muharram, 169 H., to the throne of Baghd\u00e1d. He reigned one year and one month, and having formed a design to deprive his younger brother H\u00e1d\u00ed-al-Rash\u00edd of his right of succession, and even to assassinate him, was poisoned by his prime minister about the month of S\u00e1bath, 786 A.D., Rah\u00ed 1, 170 A.H. On his death his brother, the celebrated H\u00e1d\u00ed-al-Rash\u00edd ascended the throne.\n\nAl-H\u00e1kim, also called ibn Abd\u00fal H\u00e1kim, an Arabian author who (according to the chronological arrangement of the Arab authorities by Howard Vyse and Dr. Sprenger, in the former's second volume of 'The Pyramids of G\u00edzeh') lived about 1450 A.D., or six hundred years after the death of the khalif al-Mam\u00fan of Baghdad, but by a manuscript note recorded by a gentleman of the British Museum, (1868) it appears that al-H\u00e1kim was nearly contemporary with that prince who flourished between 813 and 842 A.D. Al-H\u00e1kim writes that the Great Pyramid in Egypt was built by a certain antediluvian king Sa\u00farid, and filled by him partly with celestial spheres and figures of the stars together with the perfumery used in their worship; and that khalif al-Mam\u00fan found the body of a man deposited, with jewels, arms, and golden writing, in the coffin, when he broke into the king's chamber of the Great Pyramid. But neither Ab\u00fa M\u00fas\u00e1hir J\u00e1far bin Muhammad Balkh\u00ed, who wrote in about 890 A.D. nor ibn Khurdalbeh, in 920 A.D. have one word about al-Mam\u00fan, or any opening of the pyramid. But when we descend to Masa\u00fad\u00ed, in 967 A.D. he, after an astonishing amount of romancing on what took place at the building of the pyramids 300 years before the Flood.\u2014mentions that, not al-Mam\u00fan, but his father, Kh\u00e1lifa H\u00e1d\u00ed-al-Rash\u00edd, attempted to break into the Great Pyramid, and after penetrating 20 cubits, found a vessel containing 1000 coins of the finest gold, each just one ounce in weight, and marking up the sum which exactly covered the cost of his operations; at which, it is added, he greatly wondered. About the year 1170 A.D. or 340 years after al-Mam\u00fan's age, that prince is mentioned by Ab\u00fa Abd-ull\u00e1h Mu\u1e25ammad bin Abdur Ra\u1e25\u00edm Alk\u00e1s\u00ed, who states that he was informed that those who went into the upper parts of the Great Pyramid in the time of al-Mam\u00fan, came to a small passage, containing the image of a man in green stone, and within that a human body with golden armour &c. &c.\n\nAl-Hasan, \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646, an Arabian who wrote on optics, about the year 1100 A.D.\n\nAlif bin Nur Kash\u00e1n\u00ed, \u0623\u0644\u0641 \u0628\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0631\u0643\u0627\u0634\u0627\u0646\u064a, author of another \"Matla'ul-Anw\u00e1r\", besides the one of the same name written by Mull\u00e1 \u1e24usain W\u00e1ez.

He ascended the throne of Baghd\u00e1d after the dethronement of al-T\u00e1ya' in 991 A.D., 381 A.H. He was a contemporary of Sult\u00e1n Mu\u1e25ammad of Ghazn\u00ed; reigned 41 lunar years and 3 months, and died in 1031 A.D., 422 A.H.

These are a branch of the Mutazell\u00eds, and differ in their opinions from the orthodox Mus\u00e1lm\u00e1ns, in that they deny God's decree, and assert free will; affirming that the contrary opinion makes God the author of evil.\n\nAl-K\u00e1'im Bill\u00e1h or Al-K\u00e1'im-bi-amr-ill\u00e1h, \u0627\u0644\u06a9\u0627\u064a\u0645 \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0644, named Ab\u00fa Ja'far Abd\u00fall\u00e1h, the 26th khalif of the house of 'Abb\u00e1s. He succeeded his father K\u00e1dir Bill\u00e1h to the throne of Baghd\u00e1d in 1031 A.D., 422 A.H., reigned 44 lunar years and 8 months, and died in 1075 A.D., 469 A.H., which was shortly after Sult\u00e1n Maliksh\u00e1h the Selj\u00fak\u00ed had assumed the throne of Persia, and as that monarch was the real master of the empire, the nomination of a successor was deferred till he was consulted. He deputed a son of his prime minister Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk to Baghd\u00e1d with orders to raise al-Mukt\u00e1di the grandson of al-K\u00e1'im to the (nominal) rank of the commander of the faithful.\n\nAl-K\u00e1'im, \u0627\u0644\u06a9\u0627\u064a\u0645, second khalif of the F\u00e1t\u00edm\u00edte race of Barbary; he succeeded his father Obe\u00edd-ill\u00e1h al-M\u00e1dh\u00ed A.D. 924, 312 A.H. During his reign we read of nothing remarkable, except the revolt of Yezid ibn Kond\u00e1t, a man of mean extraction. Al-K\u00e1'em reigned nearly 12 years and died in A.D. 945, 334 A.H.

He had reigned only one year five months and twenty-one days, when his w\u00e1riz ibn Makl\u00e1 deprived him of his sight with a hot iron on Wednesday the 23rd April, 954 A.D.,\n6th Jamad I., 322 A.H., and raised al-R\u00e1zi Billah the son of Muktadir to the throne. It is said that al-K\u00e1hir, after this, as long as he lived, was obliged to beg for charity in the mosque of Baghdad, calling out to the people that assembled there, \"Have pity and give charity to one, who had once been your khalifa.\"\n\n'Al-Kama, \u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0629, son of Kys was one of the pupils of Abdullah bin Mas\u00e1ud, and an eminent man.

He is the author of a celebrated collection of tracts on pure and mixed mathematics, entitled Durrat-at-T\u00e1j.\n\nAl-Mahdi, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u062f\u06cc, the third khalifa of the race of Abb\u00e1s, succeeded his father Ab\u00fa Ja'far al-Mans\u00far to the throne of Baghdad, and was inaugurated on Sunday the 8th of October, 776 A.D., 6th Zil-hijja, 158 A.H. From the accession of al-Mahdi to the year 781 A.D., 164 A.H., the most remarkable event was the rebellion of al-Makna (or al-Makanna), which see. All this time war had been carried on with the Greeks, but without any remarkable success on either side. But after the suppression of the rebellion of al-Makna, the khalifa ordered his son Har\u00fan al-Rash\u00edd to penetrate into the Greek territories with an army of 95,000 men. Har\u00fan, then, having entered the dominions of the empress Ir\u00e1ne, defeated one of her commanders that advanced against him; after which he laid waste several of the imperial provinces with fire and sword, and even threatened the city of Constantinople itself. By this the empress was so terrified, that she purchased peace with the khalifa by paying him an annual tribute of 70,000 pieces of gold, which for the present at least, delivered her from the depredations of these barbarians. After the signing of the treaty, Har\u00fan returned home laden with spoils and glory. This year (i.e. the 164th year of the Hijri or 781 A.D.) according to some of the oriental historians, the sun one day a little after his rising, totally lost his light in a moment without being eclipsed, when neither any fog nor any cloud of dust appeared to obscure him. This frightful darkness continued till noon, to the great astonishment of the people settled in the countries where it happened. Al-Mahdi was poisoned, though undesignedly, by one of his concubines, named Ilasana. She had designed to destroy one of her rivals whom she imagined to have too great an ascendancy over the khalifa, by giving her a poisoned pear. This the latter, not suspecting anything, gave to the khalifa; who had no sooner eaten it than he felt himself in exquisite torture, and soon after expired. This event took place on the eve of Thursday the 4th of August, 785 A.D., 23rd Muharram, 169 H. in a village called Ar R\u00e1d in the dependencies of Mas\u00e1b\u00e1d\u00e1n. He was succeeded by his eldest son al-H\u00e1d\u00ed.\n\nAl-Mahdi, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u062f\u06cc, a khalifa of Barbary, vide Obeid-ullah al-Mahdi and Muhammad al-Mahdi.\n\nAl-Makna, or al-Makanna, \u0645\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u0647, a famous impostor of Khuras\u00e1n who lived in the reign of al-Mahdi the khalifa of Baghdad. His true name was H\u00e1kam ibn Hasham, and had been an under secretary to Abu Muslim governor of that province. He afterwards turned soldier, and passed thence into Mawarranahr, where he gave himself out as a prophet. The name of al-Makna, as also that of al-Burk\u00e1t, that is, the hobbled, he received from his custom of covering his face with a veil or girdle mask, to conceal his deformity, he having lost an eye in the wars. He was other wise of a despicable appearance and a stutterer; though his followers pretended he did this for the same reason that Moses did, viz., lest the splendor of his countenance should dazzle the eyes of his beholders. In some places he made a great many proselytes, deluding the people with a number of juggling tricks which they swallowed as miracles, and particularly by causing the appearance of a moon to rise out of a well for many nights together; whence he was also called in the Persian tongue, S\u00e1zinda M\u00e1h, or the Moon-maker. This wretch, not content with being reckoned a prophet, arrogated to himself divine honors; pretending that the Deity resided in his person. He had first, he said, assumed the body of Adam, then that of Noah and subsequently of many other wise and great men. The last human form he pretended to have adopted was that of Abu Muslim a prince of Khuras\u00e1n, from whom it proceeded to him. At last this impostor raised an open rebellion against the khalifa, and made himself master of several fortified places in Khuras\u00e1n, so that al-Mahdi was obliged to send one of his generals with an army against him about the year 780 A.D., 163 H. Upon the approach of the khalifa's troops, al-Makna retired into one of his strong fortresses which he had well provided for a siege. But being closely besieged by the khalifa's forces, and seeing no possibility of escaping, he gave poison in wine to his whole family and all that were with him in the castle; when they were dead, he burnt their bodies, together with all their furniture, provisions, and cattle; and lastly he threw himself into the flames. He had promised his followers, that his soul should transmigrate into the form of an old man riding on a greyish coloured beast, and that after so many years he would return and give them the earth for their possession; which ridiculous expectation kept the sect in being for several years. English readers will remember the use made of this story by the author of Lalla Rookh.\n\nAl-Mamun, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u06cc\u0646, surnamed 'Abdull\u00e1h, was the seventh khalifa of the race of the Abbasides, and the second son of Har\u00fan-al-Rash\u00edd. He was proclaimed khalifa at Baghdad on the 6th October, 813 A.D., 6th Safar, 198 A.H., the day on which his brother al-Am\u00edn was assassinated. He conferred the government of Khuras\u00e1n upon T\u00e1hir ibn Husain his general, and his descendants with almost absolute and unlimited power. This happened in the year 820 A.D., 205 A.H., from which time we may date the dismemberment of that province from the empire of the khalifs. During the reign of this khalifa nothing remarkable happened; only the African Moslems invaded the island of Sicily, where they made themselves master of several places. Al-M\u00e1min conquered part of Crete, had the best Greek writers translated into Arabic, and made a collection of the best authors. He also calculated a set of astronomical tables, and founded an academy at Baghdad. In Khuras\u00e1n he made T\u00fa\u0161, at that time the capital of the kingdom, his place of residence. Under his patronage Khuras\u00e1n became the resort of learned men; and the city of T\u00fa\u0161, the great rival of Baghdad. He died of a surfeit on the 18th of August, 833 A.D., 17th Rajab 218 A.H., after a reign of 20 years and some months in Asia Minor, aged 48 years, and was buried at Tarsus a city on the frontiers\nof Asia Minor. His wife named B\u00far\u00e1n, daughter of Hasan ibn Sahl his prime minister, outlived him 50 years, and died on Tuesday the 22nd September, 884 A.D., 27th Rab\u00ed I., 271 A.H., aged 80 years. Al-M\u00e1mun was succeeded by his brother al-Mo\u2019tasim Billah.\n\nAl-Mansur, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0635\u064f\u0648\u0631, 2nd khalif of Barbary of the Fatimite race, vide Ism\u00e1il, surmamed al-Mansur.\n\nAl-Mansur, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0635\u064f\u0648\u0631, whose former name was Ab\u00fa Ja\u2019far, was called al-Mansur, the victorious, by his overcoming his enemies. He was the second khalif of the noble house of Bani Abb\u00e1s or Abbasites, and succeeded to the throne of Baghdad after the death of his brother Ab\u00fa Abbas surmamed al-Saff\u00e1h, in 754 A.D., 136 A.H. He was opposed by his uncle, Ab\u00fal-\u2018Abb\u00e1s son of Al\u00ed, who caused himself to be proclaimed khalif at Damascus, but was defeated by al-Mansur\u2019s general, Ab\u00fa Muslim. He laid the foundation of the city of Baghdad on the banks of the Tigris in 762 A.D., and finished it four years after. He was a prince of extraordinary talent and taste, and an ardent lover of science and literature. He got the Pahlawi copy of Pilpay\u2019s Fables translated into Arabic. In the year 775 A.D., 158 A.H., the khalif set out from Baghdad in order to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca; but being taken ill on the road, he expired at Bir M\u00e1im\u00fan, whence his body was carried to Mecca; where, after 100 graves had been dug, that his sepulchre might be concealed, he was interred, having lived, according to some 63, according to others 68 years, and reigned 22 lunar years. He is said to have been extremely covetous, and to have left in his treasury 690,000,000 dirhams, and 24,000,000 dinars. He is reported to have paid his cook by assigning him the heads and legs of the animals dressed in his kitchen, and to have obliged him to procure at his own expense all the fuel and vessels he had occasion for. He was succeeded by his son al-Mahd\u012b. A Christian physician, named Bactishwa, was very eminent at the court of al-Mansur, who understanding that he had an old infirm woman for his wife, sent him three beautiful Greek girls and 3,000 dinars as a present. Bactishwa sent back the girls and told the khalif that his religion prohibited his having more than one wife at a time, which pleased the khalif so much that he loaded him with presents, and permitted him, at his earnest request, to return to his own country of Khuras\u00e1n.\n\nAl-Mo\u2019tamid Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0651\u062f \u0628\u0650\u0644\u0627\u0644, the fifteenth khalif of the house of Abb\u00e1s, was the son of al-Mutwakkil Billah. He was raised to the throne of Baghdad by the Turks after the murder of al-Mu\u2019tadid in 873 A.D., 256 A.H. This year the princes of the Zanj\u00e1ns, Ali or al-H\u00e1bib, made incursions on the western gates of Baghdad, doing mischief wherever he passed. In the year 874 A.D., Ya\u2019k\u00fab ibn-Lys having taken Khuras\u00e1n from the descendants of T\u00e1hir, attacked and defeated Muhammad ibn W\u00e1si (who had killed the khalif\u2019s governor of Fars, and afterwards made himself master of that province) seizing on his palace, where he found a sum of money amounting to 40,000,000 dirhams. In the year 879 A.D., 265 A.H., Ahmad ibn T\u00falan rebelled against the khalif and set up for himself in Egypt. There were now four independent powers in the Moslem dominions, besides the house of Umyya in Spain; viz. The African Moslems, or Aghlabites, who had for a long time acted independently; Ahmad ibn T\u00falan in Syria and Egypt; Ya\u2019k\u00fab ibn al-Lys in Khuras\u00e1n, and al-H\u00e1bib in Arabia and Ir\u00e1k. In the year 883 A.D., 270 A.H., al-H\u00e1bib was defeated and slain by al-Mu\u2019awwafik the khalif\u2019s brother and coadjutor, who ordered his head to be cut off, and carried through a great part of that region which had so long disturbed. In the year 891 A.D., 278 A.H. the Karmatians first made their appearance in the Moslem empire, and gave almost continual disturbance to the khalifs and their subjects. Al-Mo\u2019tamid reigned 22 lunar years 11 months and some days, and died in the year 892 A.D., 279 A.H. He was succeeded by his nephew al-Mo\u2019tazid Billah the son of al-Mu\u2019awwafik.\n\nAl-Mo\u2019tasim Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0633\u0650\u064a\u0645 \u0628\u0650\u0644\u0627\u0644, was the fourth son of Har\u00fan-al-Rash\u00edd, and the eighth khalif of the house of Abb\u00e1s. He succeeded to the throne by virtue of his brother al-Mam\u00edn\u2019s express nomination of him to the exclusion of his own son al-\u2018Abb\u00e1s, and his other brother al-K\u00e1s\u00edm, who had been appointed by Har\u00fan-al-Rash\u00edd. In the beginning of his reign 833 A.D., 218 A.H., he was obliged to employ the whole forces of his empire against one B\u00e1bak, who had been for a considerable time in revolt in Persia and the land of Ir\u00e1k, and had taken upon himself the title of the prophet. He was, however, defeated and slain. In the year 838 A.D., 223 A.H., the Greek emperor Theophilus invaded the khalif\u2019s territories, where he behaved with the greatest cruelty, and by destroying Sozopetra the place of al-Mo\u2019tasim\u2019s nativity, notwithstanding his earnest entreaties to the contrary, occasioned the terrible distinction of Amorium. He is said to have been so robust, that he once carried a burden of 1,000 pounds weight several paces. As the people of Baghdad disturbed him with frequent revolts and commotions, he took the resolution to abandon that city, and build another for his own residence. The new city he built was first called S\u00e1mira, and afterwards Sarmanr\u00ed (for that which gives pleasure at first sight) and stood in the Arabian Ir\u00e1k. He was attached to the opinion of the Mataz\u00e1llites who maintain the creation of the Kur\u00e1n; and both he and his predecessor cruelly persecuted those who believed it to be eternal. Al-Mo\u2019tasim died on Thursday the 5th January, 842 A.D., 18th Rab\u00ed I., 227 H. He reigned 8 years 8 months and 8 days, was born in the 8th month (Shaban) of the year, was the 8th khalif of the house of Abb\u00e1s, ascended the throne in the 21st year of the Hijr\u00ee, died on the 18th of Rab\u00ed I., lived 48 years, fought 8 battles, built 8 palaces, begat 8 sons and 8 daughters, had 8,000 slaves, and had 8,000,000 dirhams and 800,000 dinars in his treasury at his death, whence the official historians gave him the name of al-Musammam, or the Octocory. He was the first khalif that added to his name the title of Billah, equivalent to the Dei Gratia of Christian sovereigns. He was succeeded by his son al-W\u00e1thik or W\u00e1\u0161ik Billah.\n\nAl-Mo\u2019tazid Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0632\u0650\u062f \u0628\u0650\u0644\u0627\u0644, the son of al-Mu\u2019awwafik, the son of al-Mutwakkil Billah, was the sixteenth khalif of the race of Abb\u00e1s. He came to the throne of Baghdad after the death of his uncle al-Mo\u2019tamid Billah in 892 A.D., 279 A.H. In the first year of his reign, he demanded in marriage the daughter of Khamaraw\u00eda Sultan or khalif of Egypt, the son of Ahmad ibn T\u00falan; which was agreed to by him with the utmost joy, and their nuptials were solemnized with great pomp in the year 895 A.D., 282 A.H. He carried on a war with the Karmatians, but very unsuccessfully, his forces being defeated with great slaughter, and his general al-\u2018Abb\u00e1s taken prisoner. The khalif some time after his marriage granted to H\u00e1run, son of Khamaraw\u00eda, the perpetual prefecture of \u00c1w\u00e1sam and Kinn\u00edsirin, which he annexed to that of Egypt and Syria, upon condition that he paid him an annual tribute of 45,000 dinars. He reigned 9 years 8 months and 25 days, and died in 902 A.D., 289 A.H. His son al-Muktaff Billah succeeded him.\n\nAl-Mughira, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u063a\u0652\u0631\u0650\u064a, the son of Sayyid and governor of K\u00e1ifa in the time of Mu\u2019\u00e1wiya the first khalif of the house of Umyya. He was an active man, and of very good parts; he had lost one of his eyes at the battle of Yersnouk, though some say it was with looking at an eclipse. By the followers of Ali he was supposed to be of the wrong party, and one of the chief of them. For thus they reckon, there are five elders on Ali\u2019s side; Muhammad, Ali, F\u00e1tima, Hasan and Husain; and to these are opposed, Ab\u00fa Bakr, \u2019Umar, Mu\u00e1wiya, Amr\u00fa and al-\nMughira. He died in the year 670 A.D., 50 A.H., at Kufa. A great plague had been raging in the city, which made him retire from it; but returning upon its violence abating, he nevertheless caught it, and died of it.\n\nAl-Muhtadi, the fourteenth khalif of the Abbasides, was the son of one of al-Wathik's concubines named Kurb, who is supposed by some to have been a Christian. Al-Muhtadi was raised to the throne of Baghdad after the dethronement of al-Mutta'ib Billah in 869 A.D., 255 A.H. The beginning of his reign is remarkable for the irruption of the Zanjians, a people of Nubia, Ethiopia and the country of Caffres, into Arabia, where they penetrated into the neighbourhood of Basra and Kufa. The chief of this gang of robbers was 'Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Abd-Allah, also called al-Habib, who falsely gave himself out to be of the family of Ali ibn Abu Talib. This made such an impression upon the Shias in those parts, that they flocked to him in great numbers; which enabled him to seize upon the cities of Basra and Ramla, and even to pass the Tigris at the head of a formidable army. In the year 870 A.D., 256 A.H., al-Muhtadi was barbarously murdered by the Turks who had raised him to the throne. He reigned only eleven months and was succeeded by al-Mut'tamid.\n\nAl-Mukhtar, a celebrated Muhammedan chief who had beaten all the generals of the khalifs Yazid, Marwan, and Abdul Malik, and had made himself sole master of Babylonia and Irak, whereof Kufa was the capital. He persecuted all those he could lay his hands on, who were not of Husain's party; he never pardoned any one of those who had declared themselves enemies to the family of the prophet, nor those who, as he believed, had dipped their hands in Husain's blood or that of his relations. He sent an army against Ubad-ud-din towards the son of Yazid, who was sent by the khalif Abdul Malik towards Kufa with leave to plunder it for three days, and slew him. On the 1st August, 686 A.D., Muharram, 67 A.H., al-Mukhtar was killed at Kufa in a battle fought with Misael, the brother of Abdullah the son of Zuber, governor of Basra, in the month of April, 687 A.D., Ramzan 67 A.H., in the 67th year of his age. It is said that he killed nearly 50,000 men.\n\nAl-Muktafi Billah, surnamed Abul Kassim Abd-Allah, the son of Muhammad, and grandson of al-Kaum Billah, was raised to the throne of Baghdad after the death of his grandfather in 1075 A.D., 467 A.H., by orders of Sultan Malikshah Saljuqi who was then the real master of the empire. He was the 27th khalif of the race of Abbas, reigned 19 lunar years and 5 months and died in 1094 A.D., 487 A.H. His death induced Barkayirak the Saljuqi, the reigning Sultan of Persia, whose brother Mahmud had died about the same period, to go to Baghdad, where he confirmed al-Mustazhir the son of the late khalif as his successor, and was himself hailed by the new lord of the faithful, as Sultan of the empire.\n\nAl-Mukadir Billah, the eighteenth khalif of the house of Abbas, was the son of al-Mustazid Billah. He succeeded his brother al-Muktafi to the throne of Baghdad in 908 A.D., 295 A.H. He reigned 24 lunar years 2 months and 7 days, and was murdered by a eunuch on the 29th October, 932 A.D., 25th Shawwal, 320 H. He was succeeded by his brother al-Kahir Billah.\n\nAl-Muktafi Billah, was the seventeenth khalif of the house of Abbas who reigned in Baghdad. He succeeded his father al-Mustazid Billah in 902 A.D., 289 A.H., and proved a warlike and successful prince. He gained several advantages over the Karmatians, but was not able to reduce them. The Turks, however, having invaded the province of Mawarunnahr, were defeated with great slaughter; after which al-Muktafi carried on a successful war against the Greeks, from whom he took Seleucia. After this he invaded Syria and Egypt, which provinces he recovered from the house of Ahmad ibn Tulun in 905 A.D., 292 A.H.; he then renewed the war with success against the Greeks and Karmatians. Al-Muktafi died in 908 A.D., 295 A.H., after a reign of about six years and a half. He was the last of the khalifs who made any figure by their warlike exploits. His successors al-Mukadir, al-Kahir and al-Razi, were so distressed by the Karmatians and numberless usurpers who were every day starting up, that by the 325th year of the Hijri 937 A.D., they had nothing left but the city of Baghdad.\n\nAl-Muktafi Bi-amr-illah, the son of al-Mustazahr was the 31st khalif of the house of Abbas. He succeeded his nephew al-Rashid in A.D. 1136, 530 A.H., reigned about 24 lunar years and died in 1160 A.D., 555 A.H., leaving his kingdom to his son al-Mustanjad.\n\nAl-Mustaa'li Billah, the sixth Fatimite khalif succeeded his father al-Mustansar Billah in the government of Egypt and Syria. During his reign, the power of that dynasty was impaired, and its authority weakened, their political influence having ceased in most of the Syrian cities, and the provinces of that country having fallen into the possessions of the Turkmans on one hand, and the Franks on the other. This people (the Crusaders) entered Syria and encamped before Antioch in the month of October, 1091 A.D., 29th Safar, 490 A.H.; they obtained possession of it on the 26th June, 1098, 16th Rajab, 491 A.H.; the following year they took Maaratun Nommon, and in the month of July, 1099, Sha'ban, 492 A.H., they became masters of Jerusalem, after a siege of more than 40 days. This city was taken on a Friday morning during the ensuing week; the greatest multitudes of Moslems perished, and upwards of 70,000 were slain in the Masjid al-Aksa (or mosque of Umayr). Al-Mustaa'li was born at Cairo on the 24th August, 1076, 20th Muharram, 469 A.H., proclaimed khalif on Thursday the 28th of December, 1094, 18th Zil-hijja 487 A.H., and died in Egypt on the 16th December, 1101 A.D., 16th Safar, 495 A.H. His son Amar bi Akhdam-ullah Abu Ali Mansur succeeded him.\n\nAl-Mustaa'sim Billah, surnamed Abul Ahmad Abd-Allah, was the thirty-seventh and last khalif of the race of Abbas. He succeeded his father al-Mustansar to the throne of Baghdad in 1142 A.D., 640 A.H. In his time Halakhi Kh\u00e1n Tartar, emperor of the Mughals and grandson of the great conqueror Changiz Khan, besieged Baghdad for two months, and having taken that place, seized al-Mustaa'sim and his four sons whom he put to a most cruel death with 800,000 of its inhabitants. Halakhi Khan was very desirous of seizing upon Baghdad, and of adding the whole kingdom of Mesopotamia to his already vast and numerous conquests; but, partly on account of his own scruples, and partly from fear of offending the prejudices of his Sunni followers, who were all of the same faith with the khalif, he refrained for a time from entering the sacred dominion of one who was considered as the head of their holy religion, and the true representative of their beloved prophet. But the glorious days of the house of Bani Abbas had already been numbered, the effeminate Mustaa'sim had personal vices enough to lead to and excuse the final extinction of his race! Ibn al-Kama, his prime minister (who hated him more than any other of his oppressed subjects) from within, and Nasir-uddin Fisi, the preceptor of the Mughal prince (who owed him an old grudge) from without, urged the conqueror to the gates of Baghdad. Nasir-uddin had a few years before been at Baghdad, seeking shelter from persecution, when he was introduced to Mustaa'sim, the latter asked him to what country he belonged? \"Tus,\"\nplease your holiness,\" answered Nasir-uddin. \"Art thou of the asses, or of the oxen of Tus?\" said the khalif (meaning the two principal branches of the Shia faith\u2014Akbaris and Usulis). Mortified by the illustrious refugee was at this insipitable insult, he still submittedly answered, \"Of the oxen of Tus, proud of highness.\" \"Where, then, are thy horns?\" said the insolent buffoon. \"I have them not with me,\" replied Nasir-uddin; \"but, if your holiness permit, I will go and fetch them.\" \"Make haste, hence, then, thou deformed animal,\" said the khalif, \"and never again appear in my presence in so imperfect a state!\" Nasir-uddin kept his promise well; for, at the moment when Baghdad was on the point of being surrendered, and the khalif driven to the last extremity, he sent him a message to the effect that the ox of Tus was at the gate with his horns, and inquiring, when it would please his holiness to receive him? Nasir-uddin had in the city another old offender, whom he was anxious also to chastise. This was Ibn Hajib, also one of the khalif's ministers, and a person of great reputation for his learning; but being an Arabian Sunni, and a very bigoted one too, he had behaved still more cruelly than his master to the distressed Persian Shia when he sought protection at Baghdad. Ibn Hajib having been seized with depression of spirits, the physicians had recommended him (and the priests had granted him dispensation) to take, occasionally, a little wine. This happened when Nasir-uddin was at Baghdad. One day, Ibn Hajib feeling himself particularly melancholy, and having, in consequence, taken a larger dose than usual, he became unusually merry and requested Nasir-uddin to accompany him on the Tigris. Having reached the middle of the stream, he stopped the boat, and promised the several volumes of Nasir-uddin's works which the learned fellow has presented to the khalif\u2014some of them in the original manuscript, and not yet transcribed, and in the presence of their anxious author, he threw them all, one after another, into the river, with such spiteful force, that the water was splashed about in every direction; when turning himself, on each occasion, to his mortified guest, he exclaimed with a sarcastic smile of triumph, \"How wonderfully it bubbles!\" When the turn of Nasir-uddin came, he, too, gave full vent to his revenge. He ordered Ibn Hajib to be cased up to his neck, in an ox's hide, just taken off the animal, and, having filled the skin with air, he laid it for a few hours in the sun, till it became quite dry, and sounded like a drum. Then the victor advanced close to his half exhausted enemy, gave him a kick of triumph, and, as he rolled on the ground, exclaimed, \"How wonderfully it rattles!\" This melancholy event took place on Sunday the 10th of February, 1258 A.D., 4th Safar, 656 A.H., from which time Baghdad was added to the other conquered provinces of this proud emperor. Al-Mustaa'sim reigned 15 lunar years and 7 months.\n\nAl-Musta'in Billah, the son of Muhammad, the son of al-Mustasim Billah was the twelfth khalif of the race of Abbas. He ascended the throne of Baghdad in 862 A.D., 248 A.H., after the death of his cousin or brother al-Mustansir Billah, but was forced to abdicate the throne in 866 A.D., 252 A.H., by his brother al-Mustazir Billah, who afterwards caused him to be privately murdered.\n\nAl-Mustakfi Billah, the 22nd khalif of the Abbasside family, and the son of al-Muktafi the son of al-Mustazir Billah. He succeeded his uncle al-Mustaki in 945 A.D., 333 A.H., reigned in Baghdad one year and four months, and was deposed by his wazir in 946 A.D., 334 A.H. After him al-Mutaf' Billah was raised to the throne.\n\nAl-Mustansir Billah, the son of Tahir, was the fifth khalif of Egypt of the Fatimite race. He succeeded his father A.D. 1036, and with the assistance of a Turk named Basasiri, conquered Baghdad and imprisoned al-Ka'im Billah about the year 1054 A.D., and for a year and half was acknowledged the only legitimate chief of all the Musalmans. Basasiri was defeated and killed by Tughral Beg, A.D. 1059, 487 A.H. Vide Basasiri. Al-Mustansir died in 1094, having reigned 60 years; and was succeeded by his son al-Mustaa'Billah Abd Khasim.\n\nAl-Mustansir Billah I, the eleventh khalif of the race of Abbas, ascended the throne of Baghdad after the murder of his father al-Mutawakkil in December 861 A.D., Shawwal, 247 A.H., and had reigned only six months, when he was cut off by the hand of death in 862 A.D., 218 A.H. He was succeeded by his cousin al-Mustaa'Billah.\n\nAl-Mustansir Billah II, surnamed Abul Ja'far al-Mansur, ascended the throne of Baghdad after the death of his father al-Tahir, in 1226 A.D., 623 A.H. He was the 36th khalif of the house of Abbas, reigned about 17 years, and died in 1242 A.D., 640 A.H., leaving his kingdom to his son al-Mustaa'sim Billah the last of the khalifs.\n\nAl-Mustanjid Billah, the thirty-second khalif of the race of Abbas, succeeded to the throne of Baghdad after the death of his father al-Mutawakkil, in 1160 A.D., 555 A.H., reigned 11 lunar years and died in 1171 A.D., 566 A.H., when his son al-Mustazi succeeded him.\n\nAl-Mustarshid Billah, the twenty-ninth khalif of the Abbaside family, succeeded his father al-Mustazir to the throne of Baghdad in 1118 A.D., 512 A.H. It is related by Ibn Khallikan that when Sultan Masud the son of Muhammad the son of Malikshah Saljuki was encamped outside of the town of Maragha in Azurbayjan, al-Mustarshid was then with him, and on Thursday the 28th or according to Ibn Mustanafi, the 14th or 28th Zilhajda 529 A.H. (corresponding with the 24th August or 7th September, 1135 A.D.) a band of assassins broke into the khalif's tent and murdered him. Al-Mustarshid reigned 17 lunar years and some months, and was succeeded by his son al-Rashid Billah.\n\nAl-Mustazhir Billah, the son of al-Muktafi, was the twenty-eighth khalif of the dynasty of Abbas. He was placed on the throne of Baghdad after the death of his father in 1094 A.D., 487 A.H., by Barkeyarak Saljuki, the Sultan of Persia. He reigned 25 lunar years and some months, and at his death which happened in the year 1118 A.D., 512 A.H., he was succeeded by his son al-Mustarshid.\n\nAl-Mustazi Bi-amr-illah, the thirty-third khalif of the Abbaside family, succeeded his father al-Mustanjid to the throne of Baghdad in 1171 A.D., 566 A.H. He reigned about seven years and died in 1179 A.D., 575 A.H., when his son al-Nasir Billah succeeded him.\n\nAl-Mutaazz Billah, the son of al-Mutawakkil, was the thirteenth khalif of the race of Abbas. He deposed his brother al-Mustaa' in 866 A.D., 252 A.H., and having caused him to be murdered privately, ascended the throne of Baghdad. He did not, however, long enjoy the dignity of which he had so iniquitously possessed himself, being deposed by the Turkish Militia (who now began to set up and depose khalifs as they pleased) in the year 869 A.D., 255 A.H. After his deposition, he was sent under an escort from Sarr Manrae to Baghdad, where he died of thirst and hunger, after a reign of three years and about seven months. The fate of this khalif was peculiarly hard: the Turkish towns had mutinied for their pay; and al-Mutaazz not having money to satisfy their demands, applied to his mother named Kabiba for 50,000 dinars. This she refused, telling him that she had\nno money at all although it afterwards appeared that she was possessed of immense treasure. After his deposition, however, she was obliged to discover them, and even deposit them in the hands of the new khalif al-Muhtadi. They consisted of 1,000,000 dinars, a bushel of emeralds, and another of pearls; and three pounds and three quarters of rubies of the colour of fire.\n\nAl-Mutia' Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u06cc\u0639 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, the twenty-third khalif of the race of Abb\u00e1s was the son of al-Mukta'dir Bill\u00e1h. He ascended the throne of Baghd\u00e1d after al-Mustakfi in 946 A.D., 334 A.H., reigned 29 lunar years and 4 months and died in 974 A.D., 353 A.H. His son al-Tay'a succeeded him.\n\nAl-Mutakfi Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0643\u0641 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, the son of al-Mukta'dir was the twenty-first khalif of the dynasty of Abb\u00e1s. He succeeded his brother al-R\u00e1zi Bill\u00e1h to the throne of Baghd\u00e1d in 941 A.D., 329 A.H., reigned 3 years 11 months and 15 days and died in 945 A.D., 333 A.H. He was succeeded by his nephew, al-Mustakfi the son of al-Mukta'dir.\n\nAl-Mutawakkil, 'Al-allah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0648\u0643\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647. This was the name and title assumed by Ab\u00fa Fazl Ja'far on his accession to the throne of Baghd\u00e1d. He was the tenth khalif of the house of Abb\u00e1s, and the son of al-M\u00f3'tasim Bill\u00e1h. He succeeded his brother al-W\u00e1thik or W\u00e1sik in the year 847 A.D., 232 A.H., and began his reign with an act of the greatest cruelty. The late khalif's waz\u00edr having treated al-Mutawakkil ill in his brother's lifetime, and opposed his election to the khalifat, was on that account now sent to prison, and afterwards thrown into an iron furnace lined with spikes or nails heated red hot, where he was miserably burnt to death. During this reign nothing remarkable happened, except wars with the Greeks, which were carried on with various success. He was very intolerant, especially of the Jews and Christians, on whom he heaped many indignities. He did not stop there. In his imbecility and ferocity he forbade the pilgrimage to Karbal\u00e1, and caused the sacred repository of the ashes of Husain and the other martyrs interred there to be razed. He reigned 14 years 9 months and 9 days, and was assassinated and cut into seven pieces on the 24th December, 861 A.D., 17th Shawwal, 247 A.H., at the instance of his son al-Mustan\u00e1sar who succeeded him.\n\nAl-Muwaffik Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0627\u0641\u0642 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, the son of al-Mutawakkil Bill\u00e1h, the khalif of Baghd\u00e1d and brother and coadjutor of the khalif al-M\u00e1tamid, to whom he was of much service in his battles against his enemies. He died of the elephantiasis or leprosy in the year 891 A.D., 278 A.H., and while in his last illness, could not help observing that of 100,000 men whom he commanded, there was not one so miserable as himself. His son M\u00f3'taz\u00ed, after the death of his brother al-M\u00f3'tamid in 892 A.D., succeeded to the throne of Baghd\u00e1d.\n\nAl-Muwyyid (Isma'il), \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u064a\u064a\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644, whose name is spelt in Lempriere's Universal Biographical Dictionary, \"Alombuddad\", and in Watkin's Biographical Dictionary \"Almuwaddad\", was an Arabian historian, who gave a chronological account of the Saracen affairs in Sicily from 842 to 904 A.D. This MS. is in the library of the Escorial, in Spain, and a Latin version of it is inserted in Muratoris' Rerum Italicarum Scriptores.\n\nAl-Muzani, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0632\u0646\u064a, vide Abu Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Isma'il.\n\nAl-Nasir Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, or al-Nasir-uddin Allah, the son of al-Must\u00e1zi succeeded his father to the throne of Baghd\u00e1d in 1179 A.D. He professed the Shia' faith, and after a long reign of 46 lunar years and 11 months, died in the year 1225 A.D. He was the 34th khalif of the house of Abb\u00e1s, and was succeeded by his son al-T\u00e1hir Bill\u00e1h.\n\nAlp Arsalan, \u0627\u0644\u067e \u0623\u0631\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646, (which means in the Turkish language \"the valiant lion\") was a king of Persia of the Saljukian dynasty, and the son of D\u00e1d\u00ed Beg Saljuk\u00ed. He succeeded his uncle Tughrul Beg in 1063 A.D., 455 A.H., married the sister of the khalif K\u00e1em Bill\u00e1h, and his name, after that of the khalif, was pronounced in the public prayers of the Muhammadans. He was a warlike prince; and, having spoiled the Church of St. Basil in Caesarea, defeated Romanus Diogenes, emperor of the Greeks in 1068 A.D., 460 A.H., who was seized and carried to the conqueror. Alp Arsalan demanded of his captive, at the first conference, what he would have done if fortune had reversed their lot. \"I would have given thee many a stripe\", was the imprudent and virulent answer. The Sult\u00e1n only smiled and asked Romanus what he expected would be done to him. \"If thou art cruel\", said the emperor, \"put me to death. If vain-glorious load me with chains, and drag me in triumph to thy capital. If generous, grant me my liberty.\" Alp Arsalan was neither cruel nor vain-glorious, he nobly released his prisoner, and gave all his officers who were captives dresses of honor, and sent them away. Alp Arsalan after a reign of more than nine years was stabbed about the 15th of December, 1072 A.D., 30th Rabi I, 465 A.H., by a desperate Khw\u00e1rizmian, whom he had taken prisoner and sentenced to death. He was buried at Marv in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and the following is the translation of the inscription engraved on his tomb: \"All ye who have seen the glory of Alp Arsalan exalted to the heavens, come to Marv, and you will behold it buried in the dust.\" He was succeeded by his son Maliksh\u00e1h.\n\nAlp Arsalan, who is by some called Apal Arsalan, was the son of Atsiz, a Sult\u00e1n of Khw\u00e1rizm, whom he succeeded in A.D. 1166, 551\u2014557 A.H. and died in 1162 A.D.\n\nAlptakin or Alptagin, \u0627\u0644\u067e\u062a\u064a\u0646\u0643, vide Alaptak\u00edn.\n\nAl-Rashid or Harun al-Rashid, \u0647\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f, the celebrated hero of the Arabian Nights, was the fifth khalif of the race of Abb\u00e1s and son of al-M\u00e1hid, he succeeded his eldest brother al-H\u00e1di to the throne of Baghd\u00e1d in 786 A.D., 170 A.H. This was one of the best and wisest princes that ever sat on the throne of Baghd\u00e1d. He was also extremely fortunate in all his undertakings, though he did not much extend his dominions by conquest. In his time the Moslem empire may be said to have been in its most flourishing state, though, by the independency of the Moslems in Spain, who had formerly set up a khalif of the house of Umyya, his territories were not quite so extensive as those of some of his predecessors. He, possessed the provinces of Syria, Palestine, Arabia, Persia, Armenia, N\u00e1tolia, Media or Azurb\u00e9jan, Babylonia, Assyria, Sindh, Sijistan, Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, Tabr\u00edstan, Jurj\u00e1n, Z\u00e1b\u00falist\u00e1n, Mawar\u00e1numahr, or great Bukh\u00e1ria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania &c., so that his empire was by far the most powerful of any in the world, and extended farther than the Roman empire ever had done.\n\nIn the beginning of the year 802 A.D., 186 A.H., he divided the government of his extensive dominions among his three sons in the following manner: To al-Amin the eldest, he assigned the provinces of Syria, Ir\u00e1k, the three Arab\u00edas, Mesopotamia, Assyria, Media, Palestine, Egypt, and all the part of Africa extending from the confines of Egypt and Ethiopia to the Straits of Gibraltar, with the dignity of khalif; to al-M\u00e1min the second, he assigned Persia, Kirman, the Indies, Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, Tabr\u00edstan, Z\u00e1b\u00falist\u00e1n and Z\u00e1b\u00falist\u00e1n, together with the vast province of Mawar\u00e1numahr; and to his third son al-K\u00e1sim, he gave Armenia, N\u00e1tolia, Jurj\u00e1n, Georgia, Circassia, and all the Moslem territories bordering upon the Euxine sea. As to the order of succession, al-Amin was to ascend the throne immediately after his father's decease; after him, al-M\u00e1min; and then al-K\u00e1sim, whom he had summoned al-M\u00f3'tasim.\n\nThe most considerable exploits performed by this khalif were against the Greeks, who by their perfidy pro-\nvoked him to make war upon them, and whom he always overcame. In the year 893 A.D., 187 A.H., the khalif received a letter from the Greek emperor Nicephorus, commanding him to return all the money he had extorted from the Empress Irene, or expect soon to see an imperial army in the heart of his territories. This insolent letter so exasperated H\u00e1run, that he immediately assembled his forces and advanced to Heraclea, laying the country, through which he passed, waste with fire and sword. For some time also he kept that city straitly besieged; which so terrified the Greek emperor that he submitted to pay an annual tribute.\n\nIn the year 804 A.D., 188 A.H., war was renewed with the Greeks, and Nicephorus with a great army attacked the khalif's forces with the utmost fury. He was, however, defeated with the loss of 40,000 men, and received three wounds in the action; after which the Moslems committed terrible ravages in his territories, and returned home laden with spoils. The next year H\u00e1run invaded Phrygia; defeated an imperial army sent to oppose him, and having ravaged the country, returned without any considerable loss. In the year 806 A.D., the khalif marched into the imperial territories with an army of 135,000 men, besides a great number of volunteers and others who were not enrolled among his troops. He first took the city of Heraclea, from which he is said to have carried 16,000 prisoners; after which he made himself master of several other places, and, in the conclusion of the expedition, he made a descent on the island of Cyprus, which he plundered in a terrible manner. This success so intimidated Nicephorus, that he immediately sent the tribute due to H\u00e1run, the withholding of which had been the cause of the war; and concluded a peace upon the khalif's own terms. Charlemagne respected his character, and H\u00e1run in token of his friendship presented to the European prince a clock, the mechanism and construction of which were regarded among the prodigies of the age.

He was succeeded by his eldest son al-Amin.\n\n**Al-Rashid Billah**, the thirtieth khalif of the Abbasides succeeded his father al-Mustazarahid in August or September, 1135 A.D., 529 A.H., and died in the year 1136 A.D., 530 A.H. He was succeeded by al-Muktafi the son of al-Mustazahir.\n\n**Al-Razi**, see R\u00e1zi.\n\n**Al-Razi Billah**, the son of al-Muktadir and the twentieth khalif of the house of Abb\u00e1s, was the last who deserved the title of the Commander of the Faithful. He was raised to the throne of Baghdad, after the de-thronement of his uncle al-Kahir Billah by the wazir ibn Makh\u00ee in April 934 A.D., Jamad I, 322 A.H. In the year 936, the khalif finding himself distressed on all sides by usurpers, and having a wazir of no capacity instituted a new office superior to that of wazir, which he entitled Amir-ul-Umra, or great officer. Imad-ud-daula, Ali B\u00f3ya, was trusted with the management of the finances in a much more absolute and unlimited manner than any of the khalif's wazirs ever had been. Nay he officiated for the khalif in the great mosque at Baghdad, and had his name mentioned in the public prayers throughout the kingdom. In short the khalif was so much under the power of this officer, that he could not apply a single dinar to his own use without the leave of the Amir-ul-Umra. In the year 937 A.D. the Moslem empire so great and powerful, was shared among the following usurpers:\n\nThe cities of Wasat, Basra, K\u00fafa with the rest of the Arabian Ir\u00e1k, were considered as the property of the Amir-ul-Umra, though they had been in the beginning of the year seized upon by a rebel called al-Baridi, who could not be driven out of them.\n\nThe country of Fars, Faristan, or Persia properly so called, was possessed by Imad-ud-daula Ali ibn Boya, who resided in the city of Shir\u00e1z.\n\nPart of the tract denominated al-Jabal, together with Persian Ir\u00e1k, which is the mountainous part of Persia, and the country of the ancient Parthians, obeyed Rukn-ud-daula, the brother of Imad-ud-daula, who resided at Isfah\u00e1n. The other part of the country was possessed by Washmak\u00een the Dilm\u00e2mite.\n\nDay\u00e1r Rabia, Day\u00e1r Bikr, Day\u00e1r Modar, and the city of Monsul, acknowledged for their sovereign a race of princes called Hamdanites.\n\nEgypt and Syria no longer obeyed the khalifs, but Mu-hammad ibn T\u00e1j\u00ed who had formerly been appointed governor of those provinces.\n\nAfrica and Spain had long been independent.\n\nCicily and Crete were governed by princes of their own.\n\nThe provinces of Khuras\u00e1n and M\u00e1varunahr were under the dominions of al-Nas\u00edr ibn Ahmad, of the dynasty of the San\u00fadians.\n\nThe provinces of Tabrist\u00e1n, Jurjan or Georgia, and M\u00e1varunahr, had kings of the first dynasty of the Dila-mites.\n\nThe province of Kirman was occupied by Ab\u00fb Ali Mu-hammad ibn Eyliya al-S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00ed, who had made himself master of it a short time before.\n\nLastly, the provinces of Yemama and Bahryn, including the district of H\u00e2j\u00eer, were in the possession of Ab\u00fb T\u00e1hir the Karmatian.\n\nThus the khalifs were deprived of all their dominions, and reduced to the rank of sovereign pontiffs; in which light, though they continued for some time to be regarded by the neighbouring princes, yet their power never arrived to any height. In this low state the khalifs continued till the extinction of the Khalif\u00e1t by Hal\u00e1k\u00fa Kh\u00e1n the Tartar in the year 1258 A.D., 656 A.H.\n\nAl-R\u00e1zi Billah reigned 7 years 2 months and 11 days and died in 941 A.D., 329 A.H. He was succeeded by his brother al-Muttkafi.\n\n**Al-Saharawi**, \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0627\u062d\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a, vide Ab\u00fal K\u00e1s\u00edm.\n\n**Al-Saff\u00e1h**, \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0641\u064e\u062d, surname of Ab\u00fal Abb\u00e1s, the son of Mu-hammad, the son of \u00c1l\u00ed, the son of 'Abdull\u00e1h, the son of Abb\u00e1s the uncle of the prophet. He was proclaimed khalifa by the inhabitants of K\u00edfa on Friday the 29th of November, 749 A.D., 13th Rabi II, 132 A.H., upon which a battle took place between him and Marw\u00e1n II the last khalifa of the house of Umyya or Omna\u00efdes, in which the latter was slain, 5th of August, 750 A.D., 26th Zil-hijja, 132 A.H. Al-Saff\u00e1h after this victory investing himself with sovereign power, laid the foundation of the dynasty of the Abbasides, which continued to be transmitted to his family from father to son for 524 lunar years, during a succession of 37 khalifs, till they were dispossessed by Hal\u00e1k\u00fa Kh\u00e1n the Tartar king of Persia in 1258 A.D., 656 A.H. By the elevation of the house of Abb\u00e1s to the dignity of kha-lif\u00e1t, began that glorious period during which Arabic and Persian literature reached its highest perfection. With some few exceptions these khalifs were the noblest race of kings that ever adorned the throne of sovereignty. Ab\u00fal Abb\u00e1s died, after a reign of more than four years, of the small-pox, on Sunday the 9th of June, 754 A.D., 13th Zil-hijja 136 A.H., and was succeeded by his brother Ab\u00fa Ja'far Almans\u00e9r.\n\n**List of the khalifs of the race of Abb\u00e1s who reigned at Baghdad.**\n\n1.

He died at Kab\u00fal on the 28th April, 1698 A.D., 27th Shawwal 1109 H., and the emperor conferred the title of Amir Kh\u00e1n on his son.\n\nAmir Khan, \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0646, (Naw\u00e1b) entitled U'mdat-ul-Mulk, was the son of the principal favorite of the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr, of the same name, and a descendant of the celebrated Sh\u00e1h Na'm\u00e1t-ull\u00e1h W\u00e1l\u00ed. He was himself a favorite of the emperor Muhammad Sh\u00e1h; was appointed governor of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d in 1739 A.D., 1152 A.H., and recalled to court in 1743 A.D., 1156 A.H. He was naturally free of speech, and the emperor, fond of his repartee, had allowed him more license in conversation than was consistent with respect to his own dignity, when he was on business with the emperor, which by degrees disgusted Muhammad Sh\u00e1h and made him wish his removal from office. He was consequently, with the consent of the emperor, stabbed with a dagger by a person who had been discharged from his service, and fell down dead on the spot. This circumstance took place on Friday the 26th December, 1746, 23rd Zil-hijjah, 1159 H. He was buried after four days in the sepulchre of Kh\u00e1l\u00edf-ull\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n his grandfather, which is close to the Sar\u00e1\u00ed of R\u00fah-ull\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n at Dehl\u00ed.

He was originally in the service of Jaswant Rao Holkar, who becoming insane in 1806 and incapable of the administration of his own affairs, this Muhammadan chief endeavoured to establish an ascendancy at his court, but soon left it with the army he commanded to pursue the separate object of his own ambition, and became the chief of the Pindaris. Treaty was ratified with him by the British Government on the 19th December, 1817. He had on various pretexts avoided the ratification of the engagements which his agent had concluded with the resident of Delhi, but the movement of troops to his vicinity, and their occupation of positions which left him only the option between engaging in an unequal conflict and signing this treaty, induced him to adopt the safer course. He was confirmed in the possession of all the territories he held from the Holkar family, but compelled to surrender his large trains of artillery to the English Government, and to disband that great body of plunderers which had been for more than two years the scourge of Malwa and Rajputana. Amir Khan died A.D. 1834, 1250 A.H.\n\nAmir Khan, whose proper name was Mir Kh\u00e1n, but was changed by the emperor 'Alamgir by adding an affix to it into Amir Kh\u00e1n.

After his death his family through the intrigues of one Bakhsh Ali Kh\u00e1n, embraced the Muhammadan religion, and the younger daughter not long after was consigned to the Seraglio of king Nasiruddin Hydar and became one of the queens of that monarch, under the title of Wilayet\u00ed Mah\u00e1l, or the King's European consort. The elder daughter also received the name and title of Ashraf-un-nisa Beg\u00e1m. She remained unmarried all her life. The brother Joseph Walters received the name of Amir Mirz\u00e1. He was brought up as a Mussulm\u00e1n of the Sh\u00ed'a sect, and always took a pride in showing himself as an orthodox follower of the Crescent. After Wilayet\u00ed Mah\u00e1l's death, her elder sister Ashraf-un-nisa Beg\u00e1m succeeded to her estate, consisting of Government Securities valued at 1,14,00,000 rupees besides jewellery, moveable and immoveable property of considerable value. In 1832 Ashraf-un-nisa died, and was succeeded by Amir Mirz\u00e1 her brother, who, squandered almost the whole property by his reckless prodigality.

He was accidentally killed by an arrow shot by the latter prince. His Diw\u00e1n contains 15,000 verses. His death happened in the year 1147 A.D., 542 A.H.

Vide Shahi (Amir).\n\nAmir Taimur, styled S\u00e1hib Kir\u00e1n, because he reigned more than 30 years. He is also called Timarlang (Tamerlane) from some defect in his feet; was born at Kush in ancient Sogdiana on Tuesday the 9th April, 1336, A.D. 27th Sha'b\u00e1n, 736 A.H. Some say he was the son of a shepherd, and others, that he was descended in a right line from Kaj\u00fal Bahadur, son of T\u00e1ma-na Kh\u00e1n, of the same lineage with Changez Kh\u00e1n the celebrated conqueror of Persia. His father's name was Amir Tur\u00e1gh\u00e1i and mother's Takina Kh\u00e1t\u00fan; however, his obscurity is soon forgotten in the glory of his exploits. Distinguished by his courage and unbounded ambition, he gained a number of faithful adherents and seized the city of Balkh, the capital of Khuras\u00e1n, and having put to death Amir H\u00fasain the ruler of that place, whose sister he had married, he ascended the throne on Wednesday the 10th of April, 1370 A.D., 12th Ramz\u00e1n, 771 A.H. He then subdued Kandah\u00e1r, Persia, and Baghd\u00e1d, and seconded by an enthusiastic army, he penetrated to India, took Delhi on Tuesday the 17th December, 1398 A.D., 7th Rah\u00fa II, 801 A.H., with its immense treasures, and returned to punish Baghd\u00e1d that shook off his yoke. The offending city was given up to pillage, and 80,000 of its inhabitants put to the sword. Now master of the fairest part of Asia, he interfered, at the request of the Greek emperor, in the affairs of B\u00e1iz\u00e1d\u00ed (Bajazet) emperor of the Turks, and commanded him to abandon the siege of Constantinople. The message roused the indignation of B\u00e1iz\u00e1d\u00ed; he marched against the new enemy, and was defeated by him in Phrygia, after a battle of 3 days, on Friday the 21st of July, 1402 A.D., 19th Zil-hijjah, 804 A.H. B\u00e1iz\u00e1d\u00ed fell into the hands of the emperor, and was carried about in mockery in an iron cage. To these conquests Taimur added Egypt and the treasures of Cairo, and then fixed the seat of his empire at Samarqand, where he received the homage of Manuel Paleologus, emperor of Constantinople, and of Henry III, King of Castile, by their ambassadors. Taimur was preparing fresh victories by the invasion of China, when death stopped his career on Wednesday the 18th of February, 1405 A.D., 17th Sha'b\u00e1n, 807 A.H., in the 36th year of his reign, aged 71 years, and was buried at Samarqand. He was the first who founded the dynasty of the Mughul emperors of Delhi. After his death he received the title of \"Firdaus Mak\u00e1n\u00ed,\" i.e., \"May paradise be his place of residence.\" He had four sons, viz., Jahang\u00edr Mirz\u00e1, Umar Sh\u00e1ikh Mirz\u00e1, Mirz\u00e1 G\u00edr\u00e1n and Sh\u00e1hr\u00fakh Mirz\u00e1. Tamerlane on his death-bed named his grandson Pir Muhammad son of Nasirgir Mirz\u00e1, the uncrowned heir of all his dominions; but the contempt with which his will was treated after his death, was equal to the veneration which had been paid to his authority during his life. The Sult\u00e1n Kh\u00e1l\u00ed, another of his grandsons, immediately took possession of the capital of Samarqand, and proclaimed himself emperor. Pir Muhammad did not live long enough to assert his rights, but was assassinated six months after the death of\nhis grandfather. After his death, Sh\u00e1hr\u00fakh Mirz\u00e1 the youngest of the two surviving sons of Tamerlane, succeeded to the inheritance assigned for Pir Muhammad.\n\nList of the kings of Samarkand of the race of Amir Taimur.\nKhal\u00ed Sult\u00e1n, the son of M\u00edr\u00edn Sh\u00e1h,\nSh\u00e1hr\u00fakh Mirz\u00e1, son of Amir Taimur.\nAla-ud-dan\u00e1 Mirz\u00e1,\nUlugh Beg Mirz\u00e1, son of Sh\u00e1hr\u00fakh;\nMirz\u00e1 Babar who subsequently conquered Dehl\u00ed and became the first emperor of the Mughuls in India.\nMirz\u00e1 Abdul-Lat\u00edf,\nMirz\u00e1 Sh\u00e1h Muhammad.\nMirz\u00e1 Ibrahim.\nSult\u00e1n Ab\u00fa Sayy\u00edd.\nMirz\u00e1 Y\u00e1d\u00e1z Muhammad.\n\nAmir Yemin-uddin, \u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u064a\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646, entitled M\u00e1lik-ul-Fuz\u00e1, i.e., the prince of the learned, was a Turk and an excellent poet.

Afterwards Umar the khalif sent him into Egypt, which he reduced in 641 A.D., 20 A.H., and became lieutenant of the conquered country. Usm\u00e1n continued him in that place four years, and then removed him; whereupon he retired to Palestine, where he lived privately till Usm\u00e1n's death. Upon this event, he went over to Mu'\u00e1wiya upon his invitation; and took a great part in the dispute between 'Ali and Mu'\u00e1wiya. The latter restored him to the lieutenancy of Egypt, and continued him in it till his death, which happened in 663 A.D., 43 A.H.

He was a native of Ab\u00edw\u00e1rd in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, was the favorite of Sult\u00e1n Sanjar Sali\u00fak\u00ed, and the rival of the poet Rash\u00edd\u00ed surnamed Watw\u00e1t, who espoused the cause of Atsiz the Sult\u00e1n of Khw\u00e1rizm. Whilst the two princes were engaged in war, the two poets assailed one another by rhymes sent on the point of arrows. He is also said to have been the greatest astronomer of his age. It so happened in the year 581 or 582 A.H., September, 1186 A.D., that there was a conjunction of all the planets in the sign of Libra; Anwari predicted a storm which would eradicate trees and destroy every building. When the fatal day arrived, it was perfectly calm, and there was the whole year so little wind, that the people were unable to winnow their corn. He was therefore accused for his predictions as an astrologer, and was obliged to fly to Balkh where he died in the reign of Sult\u00e1n Al\u00e1udd\u00edn Takash in 1200 A.D., 596 A.H. His death is mentioned in the Khul\u00e1s\u00e1t-ul-Ash\u00e1'ar to have taken place in 587 A.H., and others have written 592 A.H. Anwari, when very young, was sitting at the gate of his college called Mans\u00far\u00edn in T\u00e1is, when a man richly dressed rode by him on a fine horse, with a numerous train of attendants; upon his asking who it was, he was told, that it was a poet belonging to the court. When Anwari reflected on the honor conferred on poetry, for which art he had a very early bent, he applied himself to it more ardently than ever, and having finished a poem, presented it to the Sult\u00e1n, who approved the work and invited him to his palace, and raised him even to the first honors of the State. He found many other poets at court, among whom were Sal\u00e1m\u00e1n, Z\u00e1f\u00edr and Rash\u00edd\u00ed, all men of wit and genius. Anwari has left us a collection of highly esteemed poems, on various subjects called Diw\u00e1n Anwari. Verses from his poems are quoted by Sa'd\u00ed in his Gulistan.\n\nAnwari Khan, \u0627\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0646, a corruption of Ab\u00fa Raih\u00e1n, which see.\n\nAnwar-udd\u00edn Khan, \u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0646, nav\u00e1b of the Karnatic, a soldier of fortune, who had attained power by treacherous connivance to the murder of the legitimate heir, a child whose guardian he had been appointed by Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk. He at first served under one of the Governors of Delhi, and was appointed governor of Koja Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d. Ill success, or perhaps ill conduct, prevented him from being able to pay the usual revenues of his government to the throne, he quitted it privately, and went to Al\u00e1mad\u00edl, where Gh\u00e1z\u00ed-udd\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, the father of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, gave him a post of considerable trust and profit in the city of S\u00edv\u00e1r. After the death of Gh\u00e1z\u00ed-udd\u00edn, his son who had succeeded in the S\u00fabdari of the southern provinces, appointed him Naw\u00e1b of Yalore or Vellore and Rajamandra, countries which he governed from 1725 to 1741 A.D., and in 1741 he was appointed governor of the Karnatic. He was killed in battle fought against Mu-zaffar Jang the grandson of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, on the 23rd of July 1749 O.S., 1162 A.H., who took possession of the Karnatic. Anwar-udd\u00edn was then 107 years old. His eldest son was made prisoner and his second son Muham-mad Ali fled to Trichinopoly. A heroic poem called \"Anwar N\u00e1ma,\" in praise of this Naw\u00e1b was written by \u00c1bd\u00ed, in which the exploits of Major Lawrence, and the first contests between the English and French in India, are recorded with tolerable accuracy.

The latter succeeded his father in March 1816, but being an idiot and unfit to rule, 'Ap\u00e1 Sahib assumed the chief authority under the title of Regent, and had the sole conduct of the public affairs. Although he was in a great degree indebted for his elevation to the English Government, he early evinced a disposition as consistent with the qualities which he owed to that State, as with the obligations of good faith. It was also discovered that he had secretly murdered his predecessor B\u00e1r\u00e1 Sahib (Pars\u00e1r\u00e1m) in order to obtain that elevation which he had so disgraced. He was consequently seized in the beginning of the year 1818, and brought to the Residency, where he continued in confinement till directed to be sent under a strong escort to the Company's territories. When arrived at Raichora, a village within one march from Jabalp\u00far, he contrived by bribing some of his guards, to make his escape. It is believed that, after having for a short period found a refuge in Asirgarh, he fled to the Panj\u00e1b where he remained a miserable dependant on the charity of R\u00e1ja Ranjit Singh.

He was the first king of the S\u00e1s\u00e1nian dynasty. His father B\u00e1h\u00e1k, who was an inferior officer in the public service, after putting to death the governor appointed by Ardaw\u00e1n (Artabanes) made himself master of the province Fars. The old man survived but a short time. His son Ardisher, after settling the affairs of Fars, not only made himself master of Ist\u00e1h\u00e1n, but of almost all Ir\u00e1k before Ardaw\u00e1n, who was the reigning prince, took the field against him, about the year 223 A.D. The armies met in the plains of Hurmuz, where a desperate battle ensued, in which Ardaw\u00e1n lost his crown and his life; and the son of B\u00e1h\u00e1k was hailed in the field with the proud title of Sh\u00e1han Sh\u00e1h, or King of kings. He was contemporary with Alexander Severus the Roman emperor. Ardisher (whom the Roman historians call Artaxerxes) having reigned 14 years as absolute sovereign of Persia, resigned the government into the hands of his son, Shap\u00far, called by the Romans, Sapor or Saporos, in the year 238 A.D.\n\nThe following is a list of the kings of Persia of the S\u00e1s\u00e1nian race.\n\n1.

This is a Turkish title, formed from the word At\u00e1, father or tutor, and Beg, lord; and\nsignifies a governor or tutor of a lord or prince. From the time of the decline of the dynasty of Saljuk to the conquest of Persia by Halak Kh\u00e1n (which occupies a period of more than a century), that country was distracted by the contests of a number of petty princes, or governors, called At\u00e1baks; who taking advantage of the weakness of the last monarchs of the race of Saljuk, established their authority over some of the finest provinces of the empire. One of the most distinguished of these At\u00e1beks was Eldiguz, a Turkish slave, whose descendants reigned over Azurb\u00e9jan. The At\u00e1beks of Fars were descended from Salghur, a Turkish general. Vide Eldiguz and Salghur, also Imad-ud-din Zangi.

He appears to have contented himself with the principality of Azurb\u00e9jan, and fixed his residence at Tabrez. His long reign was only disturbed by one war with his brother Kutlak, in which he was victorious. Kutlak fled into Khwarizm and encouraged Ala-ad-din Takash to advance against Tughral III whom he defeated and slew in 1194 A.D., 590 A.H. Abu Bakr died in 1210 A.D., 607 A.H., and was succeeded by his brother At\u00e1bak Muzaffar.\n\nAtabak Abu Bakr bin-Sa'd bin-Zangi, \u0628\u0646 \u0632\u0646\u06af\u06cc \u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0639\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0628\u06a9\u0631, vide Sunkar.\n\nAtabak 'Ala-ud-daula, \u0627\u0628\u06a9 \u0639\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0644\u06cc\u0644, the son of At\u00e1bak S\u00e1m, one of the At\u00e1beks of Isfahan of the race of the Dilamites.

When Tughral III a prince of the Saljukian dynasty (who was a child of seven years of age) was placed on the throne in 1176 A.D., Muhammad, who was his uncle, became the actual ruler of Persia. This chief after enjoying power 13 years died in March, 1186 A.D., 571 A.H., in which year the conjunction of all the planets took place. He was succeeded by his brother, Kizal Arsalan.\n\nAtabak Muzaffar, \u0627\u0628\u06a9 \u0645\u0638\u0641\u0631, the son of At\u00e1bak Muhammad.

He enjoyed this power 15 years, after which Azurb\u00e9jan was invaded and conquered by Sultan Jalal-ad-din the monarch of Khwarizm A.D. 1223, 622 A.H.

As a specimen of the Urdu language the Nauraz Murassa' was rendered objectionable for students, by his retaining too much of the phraseology and idiom of the Persian and Arabic. On this account a simple version was executed by Mir Anuman of Delhi in 1802 A.D., 1217 A.H., which is styled the \"D\u00e1gh-o-Bah\u00e1r,\" vide Tahsin.\n\nAtal, \u0627\u062a\u0627\u0644, a name assumed by Mir Abdul Jalil of Dehli in his poetical compositions, who gave out that he was by inspiration the pupil of Ja'far Zatalli, and wrote poetry in Persian and Arabic.\n\n'Ata Malik, \u0627\u062a\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u06a9, vide At\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn surnamed 'At\u00e1 Malik.\n\nAtash, \u0627\u062a\u0634, poetical name of Khwaja Haidar Ali of Lakhnau, who is the author of two D\u00edvans or books of Odes consisting of Persian and Urd\u00fa verses.

From the name of this prince we have made John the Priest, who was stripped of his dominions by Changiz Khan in 1202 A.D., 599 A.H. They have since applied the name of John the Priest or Prestre John, to the king of Ethiopia, because he was a Christian. Avank Khan is by some authors called Avant Khan. He was a very powerful sovereign, and the greatest part of Tartary was tributary to him; but he was defeated and put to death by Changiz Khan.\n\nAven Rosch, vide Ibn Rashid.\nAvenzur, vide Abdul Malik bin-Zohr.\nAverroes, vide Ibn Rashid.\nAvicenna, vide Ab\u00fa Sina.\n\nAweis Karani, \u0627\u0648\u0633 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06cc, (Khwaja) an upright Musalm\u00e1n of the Sufi sect, who had given up the world, used to say to those that sought him, \"Do you seek God? If you do, why do you come to me? And if you do not seek God, what business can I have with you?\" He was an inhabitant of Yemen and of the tribe of K\u00e1ran. He was slain in a battle fought by Ali against Mu'awiya I. in 657 A.D., 17th Shawwal, 37 A.H.

He is the author of a Masnawi called \"Anbia N\u00e1ma,\" a history of the prophets who preceded Muhammad.\n\nAyaz, \u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0632, a slave of Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed, who being a great favourite of his master, was envied by the courtiers; they therefore informed the Sultan that they frequently observed Ayaz go privately into the Jewel office; whence they presumed he had purloined many valuable effects. The next time when the slave had entered the treasury, the Sultan followed by a private door, and unobserved, saw Ayaz draw from a large chest a suit of old dirty garments with which having clothed himself, he prostrated himself on the ground and returned thanks to the Almighty for all the benefits conferred on him. The Sultan, being astonished, went to him, and demanded an explanation of his conduct. He replied, \"Most gracious Sire, when I first became your Majesty's servant, this was my dress, and till that period, humble had been my lot. Now that, by the grace of God and your majesty's favor, I am elevated above all the nobles of the land, and am intrusted with the treasures of the world, I am fearful that my heart should be puffed up with vanity; I therefore daily practice this humiliation to remind me of my former insignificance.\" The Sultan being much pleased, added to his rank, and severely reprimanded his slanderers.\n\n'Ayaz (Kazi), \u0639\u06cc\u0627\u0632 \u06a9\u0627\u0632\u06cc, son of M\u00edsa, and author of the \"Sharah Sahih Muslim,\" Mash\u00e1rik-ul-Anw\u00e1r, and several other works.

She was his third wife, and the only one that was a maid, being then only of seven years of age. On which account (some say) her father, whose original name was Abd-All\u00e1h, was named Ab\u00fa Bakr, that is to say, the father of the virgin. An Arabian author, cited by Maracci, says, that Ab\u00fa Bakr was very averse to the giving him his daughter so young, but that Muhammad pretended a divine command for it; whereupon he sent her to him with a basket of dates, and when the girl was alone with him, he stretched out his hand, and rudely took hold of her clothes; upon which she looked fiercely at him, and said, \"People call you the faithful man, but your behaviour to me shows you are a perditions one.\" But this story is most probably one of those calumnies against Muhammad, which were invented and found favour during the Middle Ages. After the death of her husband, she opposed the succession of Ali, and had several bloody battles with him; although violent, her character was respected, and when taken prisoner by Ali, she was dismissed without injury. She was called prophetess and mother of the faithful. She died aged 67 in the year 678 A.D., 58 A.H. Her brother Abdur Rahman, one of the four who stood out against Yezid's inauguration, died the same year. There is a tradition that 'Ayesha was murdered by the direction of Mu'awiya I, and the following particulars are recorded. 'Ayesha having resolutely and insultingly refused to engage her allegiance to Yezid, Mu'awiya invited her to an entertainment, where he had prepared a very deep well or pit in that part of the chamber reserved for her reception, and had the mouth of it deceptively covered over with leaves and straw. A chair was then placed upon the fatal spot, and 'Ayesha, on being conducted to her seat, instantly sank into eternal night, and the mouth of the pit was immediately covered with stones and mortar. There is, however, no trustworthy authority in support of this story.\n\n'Ayn-uddin (Shaikh), \u0639\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646, of Bij\u00e1pur, author of the \"Mulhikat,\" and Kit\u00e1b-ul-Anw\u00e1r containing a history of all the Muhammadan saints of India.

But the state of affairs in Egypt was now tottering to its fall. The descendants of Ali from the death of Al-Must\u00e1'\u00e1l\u00ed Bil\u00e1h A.D. 1161, had become puppets in the hands of their rivals (Amir al-Kh\u00e1l\u00edl al-Miss\u00edni), who wielded all the regal authority of the state; two Amirs, Dargam and Sh\u00e1w\u00e1r, had contested in arms this high dignity, and the latter, defeated and expelled from Egypt, sought refuge and aid from N\u00far-udd\u00edn styled M\u00e1l\u00edk-al-'Adil N\u00far-udd\u00edn Mahm\u00fad, the celebrated ruler of Syria. The sovereign of Damascus eagerly embraced the opportunity of obtaining a footing in Egypt, and in 1163 A.D., 558 A.H., despatched a force under Asad-ud-d\u00edn Shirakoh (the brother of Aiy\u00fab) and his nephew S\u00e1l\u00e1h-udd\u00edn to reinstate Sh\u00e1w\u00e1r; whose rival called in the Christians of Palestine to his support; but ere Amauri (the brother and successor of Baldwin III) could\nenter Egypt, Dargam had been overpowered and slain by Shirakoh, who replaced Sh\u00e1war in his former power. But Sh\u00e1war, faithless alike to friend and foe, now entered into arrangements with the Franks in order to elude the fulfilment of his engagements with N\u00far-udd\u00edn; and Shirakoh, after maintaining himself for some time in Belbes against the joint forces of Jerusalem and Egypt, was compelled to enter into a convention with Amauri and evacuate the country. But he was soon recalled by Sh\u00e1war to deliver him from the vengeance of his new allies to whom he had proved as perilous as to those of his own faith; Cairo was closely besieged by the Franks, and the Fatimite khalif Azid le-din Allah sent the hair of his women, the extreme symbol of Oriental distress, to implore the succour of N\u00far-udd\u00edn (1168 A.D.). Shirakoh again entered Egypt with an army, forced Amauri to retreat, and after beheading the double traitor Sh\u00e1war, installed himself in the twofold office of wazir to the Fatimite khalif, and lieutenant of Egypt in the name of N\u00far-udd\u00edn; but dying the same year, was succeeded in his dignities by his famous nephew S\u00e1lih-udd\u00edn, who after the death of Nur-udd\u00edn in May, 1173 A.D., Shawwal, 569 A.H., became the sole master of Egypt and Syria.

He was a native of Ghazn\u00ed, and formerly served under Prince K\u00e1mr\u00e1n M\u00edrz\u00e1. It is said that he saved the life of Humayun, or had been of some service to him, and defeated by Sher Shah at Jaunpur, for which service he was handsomely rewarded by that emperor after his having recovered the kingdom. He accompanied the emperor to Persia, and as his wife J\u00edj\u00ed Begam became the wet-nurse of Akbar, the emperor's son, he was consequently called Anka Kh\u00e1n. He was the first person that was honored with the rank of \"Haft Haz\u00edr\u00ed,\" or Seven Thousand, by Akbar. The office of Wakil Mutlak, which was taken away from M\u00e1h\u00e1m Anka, was also conferred on him; on which account, Adham Kh\u00e1n Kokalt\u00e1sh, the son of M\u00e1h\u00e1m Anka, took offence, and assassinated Kh\u00e1n 'Azim on Monday the 18th of May, 1562 A.D., 12th Ramzan, 969 A.H., in a room adjoining to that occupied by the emperor. Adham Kh\u00e1n was immediately bound hand and foot, by order of the emperor, and thrown down headlong from a window of the court at Agra, where this circumstance had taken place, and crushed to death. The remains of Kh\u00e1n 'Azim were sent to Delhi, and buried in the vicinity of the Dargah of Nizam-udd\u00edn Aulia, where a mausoleum was erected over his grave by his son Mirz\u00e1 Aziz K\u00f3ka which is still to be seen at Delhi.

He was called K\u00f3ka or Kokalt\u00e1sh on account of his being foster-brother and playmate of Akbar; for his mother whose name was J\u00edj\u00ed Begam, was Akbar's wet-nurse. He was one of the best generals of the emperor, who, in the 16th year of his reign conferred on him the title of 'Azim Kh\u00e1n. He held the government of Gujrat for several years together, and being absent from the presence from a long period, was summoned to court by Akbar in 1592 A.D., 1001 A.H., but as that chief had always entertained the wish to proceed on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and his friends representing to him that the king was displeased with him, and merely sought an opportunity to imprison him, he placed his family and treasure on board a vessel, and on the 15th of March, 1594 O.S., 1st Rajab, 1002 A.H., set sail for Hij\u00e1z without leave or permission. In short, however, he found his situation irksome in that country, and returned to India, where he made his submission, and was restored at once to his former place in the emperor's favor and confidence. He died at Ahmadabad Gujrat, in the 19th year of the reign of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr 1624 A.D., 1033 A.H.

He gained a great number of proselytes in 'Azarbaij\u00e1n and Persian Ir\u00e1k, where he soon grew powerful enough to wage war with the kh\u00e1lifa Al-Mut\u00e1'im, whom though he often beat, so that he became extremely formidable in the beginning of the kh\u00e1lifa Al-Mu't\u00e1'im's reign.

He accompanied prince Aurangzeb to Kanad\u00e1hr, and died there during the siege, on the 19th of July 1649 A.D., 19th Raj\u00e1b, 1059 A.H.\n\nBahadur Nizam Shah, \u0646\u06cc\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0634\u0627\u0647, the last of the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi kings of Ahmadnagar in the Dakh\u00e1n. On the death of his father Ibrahim Nizam Sh\u00e1h, which took place in August 1595 A.D., Zil-hijjah 1003 A.H., several factions arose in Ahmadnagar, each setting up a nominal sovereign. M\u00ed\u00e1n Manj\u00fa, who possessed the city, and acknowledged the title of Bah\u00e1dur Nizam Sh\u00e1h, then an infant, being besieged by his competitors, invited Sultan Mur\u00e1d, son of the emperor Akbar, then governor of Gujr\u00e1t, to his assistance, for which he offered to become tributary to the Mughal power. Sultan Mur\u00e1d embraced the proposal, and arrived before Ahmadnagar with a considerable army. M\u00ed\u00e1n Manj\u00fa by this time, having overcome his rivals, repented of his offers, and prepared to oppose the prince. Having committed the city to the charge of Nasir Kh\u00e1n his deputy, and the care of Ch\u00e1nd Bibi, great aunt to Sultan Bah\u00e1dur, he departed to raise levies, and implore the assistance of Kutb Sh\u00e1h of G\u00f3l-kanda and 'Adil Sh\u00e1h of Bij\u00e1pur. Sultan Mur\u00e1d besieged Ahmadnagar, on the 16th of December 1595 O.S., 23rd R\u00e1b\u00ed II, 1004 A.H., which was gallantly defended. Breaches were made, but were immediately repaired by the heroic conduct of Ch\u00e1nd Bibi, who covering herself with a veil, headed the troops. At length in the month of March 1596, Raj\u00e1b, 1004 A.H., supplies growing scarce in the camp, and the allies of Bij\u00e1pur and G\u00f3l-kanda approaching, Sultan Mur\u00e1d thought proper to accept of some offers of tribute from Ch\u00e1nd Bibi, and raise the siege. Some money was paid, and the districts in Ber\u00e1r belonging to the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi government were ceded to the Mughals. In the year 1600 A.D., beginning of 1009 A.H., Ahmadnagar was taken by the Mughals, and Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h with all the children of both sexes of the royal family were taken prisoners and sent to perpetual confinement in the fortress of Gwal\u00edar.\n\nBahadur Singh Kuchwaha, \u0628\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0633\u0646\u06af\u0647 \u06a9\u0686\u0648\u06c1\u0627, brother to Sakat Singh, died of hard-drinking in the year 1621 A.D., 1030 A.H.\n\nBahadur Shah, \u0628\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u0641\u063a\u0627\u0646, an Afgh\u00e1n, succeeded his father Mahm\u00fad Kh\u00e1n as governor of Bengal in the\nBahadur Shah, the second son of Muzaffar Shah II, of Gujrat. At the time of his father's death, he was absent at Jaunpur, but when Mahmud Shah his younger brother ascended the throne of Gujrat, after the murder of his eldest brother Sikandar Shah, Bahadur returned from thence, and having deprived Mahmud of his kingdom, ascended the throne on the 20th of August 1526, A.D., 15th Zil-Ka'da 932 A.H. He conquered Malwa on the 26th February 1551, 9th Shaban, 947 A.H., and the king of that place, Sultan Mahmud II, who was taken prisoner and sent to Champaur, was put to death on the road. In the year 1536 A.D., 942 A.H., Malwa was taken by the emperor Humayun, and Bahadur being defeated was obliged to fly towards Cambay, where, on his arrival, he heard that a fleet, in which there were between 4 or 5,000 Europeans, had arrived off the island of Diu. He immediately repaired thither with a reinforcement of troops, and on his arrival there, he ordered his barge and went to visit the admiral, with the intention of killing him; but perceiving that he was betrayed, he arose, and was attacked on all sides by the Portuguese; then a soldier struck him over the head with a sword, and threw him into the water, where he was drowned. This event took place on the 14th of February 1537, 3rd Ramazan, 943 A.H., and has been commemorated in two Persian chronograms, comprising the numerals which form the date of the year when it occurred. Their meaning is this: \"The Europeans were the slayers of Bahadur,\" and \"The king of the land became a martyr at Sea.\" Bahadur Shah was 20 years of age when he ascended the throne, reigned 11 lunar years, and was slain at the age of 31. After his death his nephew Miran Muhammad Shah was raised to the throne of Gujrat.\n\nBahadur Shah I, surnamed Kutb-uddin Shah 'Alam, formerly called prince Mua'zzim, was the second son of the emperor Alamgir I, born at Burhanpur in the Dakhani on the 4th October 1643 O.S., 30th Rajab, 1053 A.H. At the time of his father's death, which took place at Ahmadabad, on the 21st February 1707 O.S., 28th Zil-Ka'da 1118 A.H., he being then at Kabul, his younger brother, prince Azim, was proclaimed sovereign of all India in perfect disregard of the late emperor's will. Prince Mua'zzim, with better reason, assumed the crown at Kabul with the title of Bahadur Shah; and both brothers prepared to assert their pretensions by force of arms. The assembly very large armies had met at Delhi at Dhaukot, not far to the south of Agra. A bloody battle ensued on Sunday the 5th June 1707 O.S., 15th Rab'i I, 1119 A.H., in which prince Azim and his two grown-up sons Bedar Bakht and Walijah, were killed. Bahadur Shah reigned nearly five lunar years and died at Lahore on Monday the 18th of February 1712, O.S., 21st Muhamram, 1124 A.H., in the 71st lunar year of his age. He was buried in the environs of Delhi, near the tomb of Khwaja Kutb-uddin, where he had built during his life a mosque entirely of white marble named Moti Masjid. His tomb is also built of the same stone. He received the title of \"Khulid Manzil,\" i.e., \"May his mansion be in paradise,\" after his death. He left four sons, viz., Ma'iz-uddin Jahandar Shah, Azim-ush-Shan, Rafi-ush-Shan, and Jahangir Shah, among whom a battle ensued, wherein the three latter brothers were killed, and Jahandar Shah ascended the throne.\n\nBahadur Shah II, the present and last king of Delhi whose title in full is Abul Muzaffar Siraj-uddin Muhammad Bahadur Shah, a lineal descendant from Amir Timur; is the son of Akbar Shah II, on whose death he succeeded him on the 25th September 1837, 28th Jumada II, 1253 A.H. He was born on Tuesday the 24th of October 1775, 28th Shaban, 1189 A.H.; and Abul Muzaffar is the chronogram of his birth. His mother's name was Lal Bai. A stipend or pension of one lakh of rupees monthly was allowed him by the British Government. He is an excellent Persian scholar and an elegant Urdu poet, and Zafar is his poetical name. His Divan or Book of Odes was printed some years ago at Delhi. He is supposed to be the principal instigator of the mutiny of the native troops throughout India in 1857, and is now deposed and tried, but his life has been guaranteed. In October 1858 he was sent down to Calcutta, from which place he embarked on board H.M. Ship \"Megara\" on Saturday the 4th December 1858, for Rangoon, accompanied by two of his wives, a son and a grandson, and thus ended the royal race of Taimur in India. His sons Mirza Mughal and Mirza Khwaja Sultan, and a grandson named Mirza Abu Bakr, who were known to have taken a prominent part in the mutiny attending the insurrection, were captured on the 22nd September 1857 at the tomb of Humayun, and shot on the spot. During the mutiny in 1857, Bahadur Shah had struck a new coin with the following inscription:\n\nBahadur Singh (Rao), vide Rao Bahadur Singh.\n\nBahai, vide Bahauddin Amili.\n\nBahar, poetical name of Tek Chand, which see.\n\nBaha-uddin, a learned Arabian, known as a favorite of Sultan Salahuddin (Saladin) and the historian of that prince's life.

His father was the first king of the second branch of the Sultans of Ghori. Baha-uddin was the second king, and is said to have reigned 14 years. Imam Fakhruddin Razi who flourished in his time and died in 1210 A.D., 606 A.H., dedicated the work called \"Risala Hayat,\" or book of geometry to him. After the death of Baha-uddin, his son Jalaluddin succeeded him. He was slain by Sultan Muhammad of Khawarij, and appears to have been the last of this branch.\n\nBahadur Singh, the only surviving son of Rajah Man Singh Kachhwa.\n\nBaha-uddin, governor of Isfahan, and author of the \"Muntakhab-ul-Akhbar,\" an abridged history of the patriarchs and prophets, also of Muhammad and his descendants, with a good description of the cities of Mecca and Madina.

This person is mentioned by H. M. Elliot, Esq., in his \"Historians of India,\" and appears to be the same with the preceding. He was a Persian mathematician, says he, and lived in the reign of Sh\u00e1h 'Abb\u00e1s the Great. He was celebrated among his countrymen for a supposed peculiar power which he possessed over the magi and writers of talismans, and was one of the most pious devotees of his time. His works on various subjects are much read in Persia, particularly one entitled \"Kashk\u00f3l,\" or the Beggar's Wallet, being an universal miscellany of literature. The \"J\u00e1'ma'ul-Abbas\u00ed,\" a concise and comprehensive treatise on Shia law in twenty books, is generally considered as the work of Baha-udd\u00edn Muhammad 'Amil, but that lawyer only lived to complete the first five books, dedicating his work to Sh\u00e1h 'Abb\u00e1s. The remaining fifteen books were subsequently added by Niz\u00e1m Ibn-Husain-al-S\u00e1waf.\n\nBaha-udd\u00edn Nakshband (Khwaja), a famous learned Musulm\u00e1n who died on Monday the 1st of March 1359 A.

He was an enthusiastic follower of the doctrine of the S\u00faf\u00eds, and became so celebrated as a preacher and expounder, that people flocked from all parts of Persia to hear him discourse. In the latter part of his life, he left his native country and went and dwelt at Kon\u00eda (Iconium) in Asiatic Turkey, where he died about the year 1230 or 1233 A. D., 628 or 631 A. H., and his son succeeded him as the head of the sect.\n\nBaha-udd\u00edn Zikaria (Shaikh), a Muhammadan saint of Mult\u00e1n, was the son of Kutb-udd\u00edn Muhammad, the son of Kam\u00e1l-udd\u00edn Kureshi. He was born at K\u00f3tkaror in Mult\u00e1n in 1170 A. D., 565 A. H. After his studies he journeyed to Baghdad and became a disciple of Shaikh Shah\u00e1b-udd\u00edn Suharward\u00ed.

During the invasion of the Russians, at that place, it is said, that a book, written in verse in the Persian language, was found in the tomb of this saint. It is said in this book that in the 82nd year of the Hijrjah (1865 A. D.) the Christians will rush upon Taskhund like a river. In the 84th year (1867 A. D.) they will occupy Samarqand, and sweep it away like a prickly thorn. In the 88th year (1871 A. D.) the Christians will take Bukh\u00e1ra, and convert it into a level like the steppe.

After many severe engagements, he forced Banda to take refuge in a fortress, which was blockaded so effectually, as to cut off every supply. The garrison was reduced to the necessity of eating cows, horses, asses, and other animals forbidden by their laws; when at length, having no provision of any sort left, and being reduced to the extremity of famine and disease, they begged for quarter. 'Abdus Samad Khan, having planted a standard on the plain, commanded them to come out and lay their arms under it, which they did. He then divided the meaner sort among his chiefs, who cut off their heads; and threw their bodies into a river near the fortress. Banda and other captives were sent to Delhi, through which he was carried in an iron cage upon an elephant, dressed in a robe of gold brocade. The Sikhs bore the insults of the populace with the greatest firmness, and steadily refused the emperor's offers of life if they would embrace the Muhammadan faith. They were put to death, a hundred each day, on the ensuing seven days. On the eighth day Banda and his son, were put to death without the city. A dagger was put into his hands, and he was commanded to kill his infant son; but refusing, the child was slain by the executioner, his heart torn out, and forced into the father's mouth. Banda was then put to death by the tearing of his flesh with red hot pincers and other tortures, which he bore with the greatest constancy.

He conquered Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Thessaly; and after he had made the emperor of Constantinople tributary to his power, he marched to attack Tamerlane in the east. He was, however, totally defeated near Angoria on Friday the 21st July, 1402 A.D., 19th Zil-hij\u00e1, 804 A.H., and taken prisoner; and when the proud conqueror asked him what he would have done with him if he had obtained the victory, B\u00e1iz\u00e1d\u00ed answered that he would have consumed him in an iron cage. \"Such then shall be thy fate,\" rejoined Tamerlane, and ordered him to be buried alive in his camp in an iron cage.

His father's name was 'Isa-ibn-Adam-ibn-'Isa-ibn-'Ali. His grandfather was a Gabr or magian, but became a convert to Islamism.

There is a cenotaph at Chatigi\u00f3n, called the Rauza of Sultan B\u00e1iz\u00e1d\u00ed. It is related that he was born at Bust\u00e1m in Khuras\u00e1n, of which country he was king; but abandoning regal pomp and cares for the tranquillity of the ascetic life, he came with twelve attending disciples to Chatigi\u00f3n. Their arrival was promptly opposed by the king of the fairies and the\nBaiazid\n\nattendant genii, who desired them forthwith to depart. Sult\u00e1n Baiazid, with feigned humility, entreated to be allowed to remain that night and to occupy only as much ground as could be illumined by a single lamp, called in Beng\u00e1li, chati or chat; on obtaining their consent, he kindled from his urine a lamp of such radiance, that its light extended to Tik Naof, a distance of 120 miles, and scorched the terrified genii, who fled from its flame in dismay. In commemoration of this event, the place was named Chatgram, in common parlance Chatg\u00e1ri, signifying the village of the lamp. This insult and breach of confidence led to inevitable war on the part of the genii, whom Sult\u00e1n Baiazid, in various conflicts, drove from the field; and in his strenuous exertions dropped a ring where the cenotaph now stands\u2014his Karanph\u00fal, or ear-ring, fell in the river, which thence was named the \"Karanph\u00fal;\" and a santh, or shell, dropped from his hand, into the other stream, from which it derived the name of San-khauti. Sult\u00e1n Baiazid then became a Gorchehla (i.e., did penance in the tomb) for 12 years; after endowing it with lands to keep it in repair and defray the expenses of pilgrims and the twelve disciples\u2014he proceeded to Mak\u00e1n-p\u00far, and was succeeded by his disciple Sh\u00e1h\u2014who in the hope of an eternal reward, performed the penance of standing for 12 years on one leg, after which he also proceeded to Mak\u00e1n-p\u00far; leaving the cenotaph under the charge of Sh\u00e1h Pir, an attending disciple of Baiazid. This place was therefore in after ages held in great repute, and visited by numerous pilgrims from distant parts. It is situated on a hill, ascended by a flight of steps, inclosed by a wall about 30 feet square and 15 high, with mitred battlements, and a pillar rising two feet above them at each angle, similar to the buildings of the time of Akbar. The tomb, about 12 feet by 9, is in the centre of the area, with some shells and corals deposited at its head.\n\nBaiazid Taifuri-al-Bustami, \u0628\u0627\u06cc\u0632\u06cc\u062f \u0637\u06cc\u0641\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0645\u06cc, vide Baizaid Bustami.\n\nBaz Bahadur, \u0628\u0632 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0631, whose original name was M\u00e1lik B\u00e1iz\u00e1id, succeeded his father Shuj\u00e1' Kh\u00e1n to the government of M\u00e1lwa in 1554 A.D., 962 A.H., and having taken possession of many towns in M\u00e1lwa which were previously almost independent, he ascended the throne under the title of Sult\u00e1n B\u00e1z Bah\u00e1d\u00far. His attachment to R\u00fapmani, a celebrated courtzean of that age, became so notorious, that the loves of B\u00e1z Bah\u00e1d\u00far and R\u00fapmani have been handed down to posterity in song. He reigned about 17 years, after which the kingdom of M\u00e1lwa was taken, and included among the provinces of the empire of Dehl\u00ed, by the emperor Akbar in the year 1570 A.D., 978 A.H.

When Prince B\u00e1jkara ascended the throne in 1394 A.D., he ordered that the sum of five hundred ducats (in Turk\u00ed bish y\u00faz alt\u00fan) should be paid to Burandak. By a mistake of the Secretary, he received only two hundred; and therefore addressed the following lines to the Sult\u00e1n:\n\n\"The Sh\u00e1h, the terror of his foes,\nWho well the sound of flat'try knows,\nThe conqueror of the world, the lord\nOf nations vanquish'd by his sword,\nGave, while he praised my verse, to me\nFive hundred ducats as a fee.\nGreat was the Sult\u00e1n's generous mood,\nGreat is his servant's gratitude,\nAnd great the sum; but strange to say,\nThree hundred melted by the way!\nPerhaps the words in Turkish tongue\nConvenient meaning may contrive;\nOr else my greedy ear was wrong,\nThat turn'd two hundred into five.\"\n\nThe Sult\u00e1n was extremely entertained at the readiness of the poet; and sending for him assured him that the words \"bish y\u00faz alt\u00fan\" signified in Turkish a thousand ducats, which he ordered to be immediately paid. Dublin University Magazine for 1849. The year of Burandak's death is unknown.

His minister Tauf\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, became regent; and before the prince was of an age to assume the reins of his empire, Tauf\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, assisted by the ruler of Kh\u00e1ndesh and by the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi court, usurped the government. He eventually confined his sovereign in irons in the fort of Parn\u00e1l\u00e1, and assumed the title of king. In the year 1568 A.D., 980 A.H., Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h marched against Tauf\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, under the pretence of releasing the imprisoned prince from his confinement. He took the fort of G\u00e1wal by capitulation, defeated Tauf\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n and made him prisoner with his son; but instead of placing the captive monarch on the throne of Ber\u00e1r, sent him with the other prisoners to his son to be confined in one of the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi forts, where they were all subsequently strangled by the king's order.

He was advanced in years; but notwithstanding his age, gave himself up to pleasures unbecoming his dignity. His reign was marked by an unsuccessful war with the king of Bijapur, and a disgraceful defeat from the Portuguese, who had seized several coasts of his dominions.

He succeeded his father in 1770 A.D. In August 1781 demands were made upon him, by the Governor-General, for additional tribute to be paid to the Company, as the sovereign power now requiring assistance in its exigency. The r\u0101j\u0101 declined, pleading willingness, but inability. He was seized by Mr. Hastings\u2019 order, at Ban\u0101ras; a revolt took place in his behalf on the 20th August; nearly two companies of sepoys and their officers were destroyed,\u2014and the r\u0101j\u0101 escaped in the confusion. The Governor-General immediately assumed control of the province; and troops were called in to oppose the r\u0101j\u0101, who now headed the numbers flocking to his support. He was defeated at Latifpur\u2014and, firstly, his stronghold of Bijapur\u0101 was seized, and his family plundered by force under Major Popham. The r\u0101j\u0101 had fled, on his retreat to Latifpur to Bundelkhand. His government was declared vacant, and the zam\u012bnd\u0101r bestowed on the next heir, a nephew of the r\u0101j\u0101, a minor. After these transactions at Ban\u0101ras, the Governor-General proceeded to Audh, to obtain an adjustment of the heavy debts due to the Company by the Waz\u012br \u2018Asaf-ud-daula. The territories of the Begams, (one, the mother of Shuj\u0101-ud-daula, the late Naw\u0101b; the other, the mother of the Waz\u012br) were seized, on a charge of aiding the insurrection of Chait Singh. The r\u0101j\u0101 found an asylum in Gwalior for 29 years, and died there on the 29th March, 1810 A.D. The lands were transferred to a collateral branch of the family, the present representative of which is named R\u0101j\u0101 Ud\u0101t Narain. See Balwant Singh.

He flourished towards the close of the twelfth century of the Christian era. He may be called the poet laureate of Prat\u012br\u0101j, the Chah\u0101n emperor of Delhi, who, in his last battle with Shah\u012bd-ul-Isl\u0101m Ghori, was taken prisoner and conveyed to Ghazni, where his bard, Ch\u0101nd, followed him. Both perished by their own hands, after causing the death of their implacable foe, Shah\u012bd-ul-Isl\u0101m. Like the Greek bard, Homer, countries and cities have contended for the honor of having been the place of birth of this the most popular poet of the Hind\u016bs. Delhi, Kanauj, Mah\u014dba, and the Panj\u0101b, assert their respective claims, but his own testimony is decisive, whence it appears that he was a native of L\u0101hor. In his \u2018Prithir\u0101j Chauh\u0101n R\u0101sa,\u201d when enumerating some of the heroes, friends and partizans of his hero, he says, \u201cNiddar was born in Kanauj, Siluk and Jait, the father and son, at Ab\u0101; in Mundava the Parih\u0101r, and in Kurrik Kangra the Haol\u012b R\u0101o, in N\u0101gor, Balbhaddar, and Ch\u0101nd, the bard, at L\u0101hor.\u201d\n\nChand Saudagar, \u0635\u0648\u0627\u062f\u06af\u0631 \u0686\u0646\u062f, a Bangali merchant.\n\nChand, \u0686\u0646\u062f, vide Teik Chand.\n\nChanda Kunwar, \u06a9\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0686\u0646\u062f, the wife of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Kharag Singh of L\u0101hor.\n\nChanda, \u0686\u0646\u062f, also called M\u0101h-lik\u0101, a dancing girl, or queen of Haidar\u0101b\u0101d, was a poetess of much taste and merit. She is the author of a D\u012bw\u0101n which was revised by Sher Muhammad Kh\u0101n Im\u0101n. In the year 1799 A.D., in the midst of a dance, in which she bore the chief part, she presented a British officer with a copy of her poems, accompanied with the following complimentary observations, in the form of the usual gazal:\n\nSince my heart drank from the cup of a fascinating eye,\nI wander beside myself, like one whom wine bewilders.\nThey searching glances leave nothing unseated;\nThey face, bright as flame, consumes my heart.\nThou soughtest a Nazr, I offer thee my head;\nAlbeit thy heart is not unveiled to me.\nMy eyes fixed on thy lineaments\u2014emotion agitates\nmy soul.\nFresh excitement beats impatient in my heart.\nAll that Chand\u0101 asks is, that, in either world,\nThou wouldst preserve the ashes of her heart by thy side.\n\nGarcin de Tassy informs us that there is a copy of her D\u012bw\u0101n in the East India House Library, which she herself presented to Captain Malcolm on the 1st of October, 1799 A.D.\n\nChanda Sahib, \u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628 \u0686\u0646\u062f\u06c1, surname of Husain Dost Kh\u0101n, a relation of Dost \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, Naw\u0101b of Arcot, whose daughter he had married. He had made his way to the highest offices of the government by the services of his sword, and was esteemed the ablest soldier that had of late years appeared in the Carnatic. He invigilated the queen of Trichinopoly, and got possession of the city in 1736 A.D. He was taken prisoner by the Marhattas on the 26th March, 1741 A.D., and imprisoned in the fort of Sit\u0101ra, but was released by the aid of Mons.

At the same time there being a scarcity of provisions in the Mughal camp, the prince and Kh\u0101n-Kh\u0101n\u0101n thought it advisable to enter into a treaty with the besieged. It was stipulated by Chand Bibi that the prince should keep possession of Berar, and that Ahmadnagar and its dependencies, should remain with her in the name of Bah\u0101dur, the grandson of Burh\u0101n Sh\u0101h.

He was born in 1154 A.D., 649 A.H., and at the age of 13 he began to reign, but the conspiracies of his subjects obliged him to fly for safety to Avant Khan, a Tartar prince, whom he supported on his throne, and whose daughter he married. The ties were not binding, Avant Khan joined against Changez, who took signal vengeance on his enemies, and after almost unequalled vicissitudes, he obtained, at the age of 49, a complete victory over all those who had endeavoured to effect his ruin, and received from the Khans of Tartary the title of Kh\u00e1k\u00e1n in 1206 A.D., 602 A.H., and was declared emperor of Tartary.

To secure the independence of his position against the encroaching power of the Marhattas, he entered into a close alliance with the Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o I about the year 1733 A.D., 1146 A.H., and at his demise, he bequeathed him a third of his dominions, under an express stipulation, that his posterity should be protected by the Peshw\u00e1 and his heirs.\n\nChatur S\u00e1l died 1735 A.D., leaving two sons, Hirde S\u00e1l and Jagat R\u00e1j. The division of the dominions of Bundelkhand, bequeathed to the Peshw\u00e1, comprised the Mahils of Kalp\u00ed, Sirounj, K\u00fcnch, Garra Kota and Hirdainagar. Gangadhar B\u00e1la was nominated by the Peshw\u00e1 as his naib to superintend the collections. Afterwards the principal leaders in Bundelkhand having fallen in battles, and the ruin of the country having been completed by the subsequent conquest of the raja of Panna by N\u00e1na Arjun, the grandson of B\u00e1khat Singh, a descendant of Chatur S\u00e1l, it hence became the object of N\u00e1na Farw\u00e1war the P\u00fama minister, notwithstanding the stipulations by which the former Peshw\u00e1 obtained from Chatur S\u00e1l and his heirs their dominions, to annex the whole of Bundelkhand to the Marhatta States. For this purpose he gave the investiture of it to \u00c1li B\u00e1h\u00e1dur, son of Shamsher B\u00e1h\u00e1dur, an illegitimate son of the Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, whose descendants now are called the Naw\u00e1bs of Banda.

He formed the acquaintance of this young and beautiful woman, and they resolved to be married. But the Begam did not wish the union with a man so inferior to herself to take place where she was known, and so obtained the permission of the Chief Commissioner to leave Audh on the pretence of making a pilgrimage to Mecca.

His mother was a daughter of Raja Bihari Mal Kachhwaha. After the death of his brother, prince Sultan Murad, he was sent to the Dakhlan by his father, accompanied by a well appointed army, with orders to occupy all the Nizam Shahi territories. Alamgir was taken in the beginning of the year 1696 A.H., or 1696 A.D., but Danial died on the 8th April, 1696 A.H., 1st Zil Hijjah, 1013 A.H., in the city of Burhanpur, aged 33 years and some months, owing to excess in drinking. His death and the circumstances connected with it, so much affected the king his father who was in a declining state of health, that he became every day worse, and died six months after. From the chronogram it appears that the prince Danial died in the year 1012 A.H., or 1604 A.D., a year and six months before his father.\n\nDanish, \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634, poetical name of Mir Razi who died in 1665 A.D., 1076 A.H.\n\nDanishmand Khan, \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634\u0645\u0646\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646, whose proper name was Muhammad Shafi' or Mullah Shafi', was a Persian merchant who came to Sufrat about the year 1646 A.D., 1056 A.H., from which place he was sent for by the emperor Shah Jahan.

After the death of his eldest brother Shahnawaz Khan in 1618 A.D., 1027 A.H., he was honored with the rank of 5000 by the emperor Jahangir and appointed governor of Berar and Ahmadnagar in the Dakhin. He was also governor of Bengal for some time, and on his return to the Dakhin, the emperor, being displeased with him on some account, ordered Mahabat Khan to strike off his head, which he did, and sent it to the king. This circumstance took place 1625 A.D., 1034 A.H.\n\nDarab Khan, son of Mukhtiar Khan Sabzwari, a nobleman in the service of the emperor Alamgir.

His mother Mumtaz Mahal was the daughter of Asaf Khan, wazir, the brother of Nur Jahangir Begum. In the 20th year of his age, i.e., in the year 1633 A.D., 1043 A.H., he was married to the princess Nadira, the daughter of his uncle Sultan Parvez, by whom he had two sons, viz., Sulaiman Shikoh and Siphr Shikoh. In 1658 A.D., during the illness of his father, several battles took place between him and his brother Aurangzeb Alamgir for the throne, in which Dara being defeated, was at last obliged to fly towards Sindh, where he was captured by the chief of that country and brought to the presence of Aurangzeb loaded with chains, on a sorry elephant without housings; was exposed through all the principal places and then led off to a prison in old Delhi; thereafter after a few days, in the night of the 29th of Safar, 1659 O.S., 21st Zil Hijjah, 1069 A.H., he was murdered by the order of Aurangzeb; his body exhibited next morning to the populace on an elephant, with its head cut off and carried to the emperor, who ordered it to be placed on a platter, and to be wiped and washed in his presence. When he had satisfied himself that it was the real head of Dara, he began to weep, and with many expressions of sorrow, directed it with its corpse to be interred in the tomb of the emperor Humayun. Siphr Shikoh, his son, who was also taken captive and brought with his father, was sent away in confinement to Gwalior. Sulaiman Shikoh, his eldest son, who, after the defeat of his father had taken refuge in Srinagar for some time, was subsequently, in 1670 A.D., 1071 A.H., given up by the raja of that place to the officers of Aurangzeb and conveyed to Delhi. He was then sent to Gwalior, where he and his brother Siphr Shikoh both died within a short space. Dara Shikoh is the author of the work called \"Safnat-ul-Aulia,\" an abridgment of the Life of Muhammad, with a circumstantial detail of his wives, children, and companions, &c., also of a work entitled \"Majma-ul-Bahrain\" (i.e., the uniting of both seas,) in which he endeavours to reconcile the Brahmin religion with the Muhammadan; citing passages from the Koran to prove the several points. In 1656 he likewise, with the same intent, caused a Persian translation to be made by the Brahmans of Banaras, of the Apokrit, a work in the Sanskrit language, of which the title signifies \"the word that is not to be said;\" meaning the secret that is not to be revealed. This book he named \"Sarr-i-Ashr,\" or Secret of Secrets; but his enemies took advantage of it, to traduce him in the esteem of his father's Muhammadan soldiers, and to stigmatize him with the epithets of Kafir and Rafizi (unbeliever and blasphemer), and finally effected his ruin; for Aurangzeb his brother made a pretence of that, and consequently had all his bigoted Muhammadans to join him. Monsieur Anquetil du Perron has given a translation of this work, in two large volumes in quarto, on which a very good critique may be found in the Second Number of the \"Edinburgh Review.\" There is also a copy of the Persian version of this work in the British Museum, with a MS. translation, made by N.B.

When during the fall of Delhi every body fled from the city, Dard remained in poverty contented with his lot. He was a Sufi and a good singer. A crowd of musicians used to assemble at his house on the 22nd of every month. Some biographers say that he was a disciple of Shah Gulshan, meaning Shaikh Sa'dullah. Besides a Divan in Persian and one in Rekhta, he has written a treatise on Sufism called \"Risala Wardidat.\" He died on Thursday the 3rd of January, 1785 A.D., 24th Safar, 1199 A.H.\n\nList of his Works.\n\n| Ali Naqa wa-Dard. | Ilm-ul-Kitab. |\n|-------------------|---------------|\n| Ali Sard.         | Divan in Persian. |\n| Dard Dil.         | Divan in Urdu. |\n\nDardmand, poetical name of Muhammad Taqfi of Delhi, who was a pupil of Mirta Jan Janam Mazhar, and the author of a Sakinama and of a Divan.

This prince was much addicted to sensual excesses; and the propensity was rendered more degrading by his inclination to associate with persons of low origin and mean connections, by whom he was induced to attack the frontiers of the kingdom of D\u00e1d\u00ed. He had several skirmishes with Munaim Kh\u00e1n, Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n, governor of Jaunpur, but was subsequently joined by his master, the emperor Akbar, when an obstinate battle took place on the 30th of July, 1575 A.D., 21st Rab\u00ed' II, 983 A.H., in which D\u00e1d\u00ed Sh\u00e1h was defeated and obliged to retire to a fort on the borders of Katak.

The year of this event is commemorated in a Persian Hemistich.

In the meantime, to sanction his own measures by the appearance of legal authority, he released prince D\u00e1war Bakhsh from prison, and proclaimed him king. N\u00far Jah\u00e1n Beg\u00e1m, endeavouring to support the cause of Shahj\u00e1h\u00e1n, her son-in-law, was placed under temporary restraint by her brother, the wazir, who then continued his march to L\u00e1h\u00f3r.

He was a Gw\u0101la by caste, and flourished in the reign of the Emperor Farrukh-siyar. The wonderful feats of this man are sung or recited accompanied by the beat of a dh\u016bl throughout Hind\u00fast\u00e1n. A full and affecting account of this hero is given in the \"Bengal Annual\" published at Calcutta in 1833, p. 169.\n\nDaya Ram, \u062f\u06cc\u0627 \u0631\u0627\u0645, a chief of H\u00e1tras, tributary to the Honorable Company, who, about the year 1814 A.D., confiding in the extraordinary strength of his fort, shewed a spirit of contumacy and disobedience. A train of Artillery was brought against this place from Cawnpur, and a few hours of its tremendous fire breached the boasted fortification.\n\nDilami, \u062f\u06cc\u0644\u0645\u06cc and S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00ed were two dynasties which divided between them the kingdom of Persia towards the beginning of the 10th century. They both rose to power through the favor of the Khal\u00edfs of Baghd\u00e1d, but they speedily threw off the yoke. The Dil\u00e1mi divided into two branches, exercised sovereign authority in K\u00edrm\u00e1n, Ir\u00e1k, F\u00e1ris, Khuz\u00edst\u00e1n, and Lar\u00edst\u00e1n, always acknowledging their nominal dependence on the Khal\u00edf, and during the whole period of their rule, one of the southern branch of this family was vested with the dignity of Amir-ul-Umra, or vizir, and managed the affairs of the khalifate. Several of the Dil\u00e1mi were able and wise rulers, but Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed put an end to the rule of the northern branch in 1029 A.D., and the Salj\u00faks subjugated the southern one in 1056 A.D., by the capture of Baghd\u00e1d, their last stronghold. Their more powerful rivals, the S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00ed, had obtained from the Khal\u00edf the government of Transoxiana in 874 A.D.; and to this Isma'il, the most celebrated prince of the family, speedily added Khw\u00e1rizm, Balkh, Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, S\u00edst\u00e1n, and many portions of northern Turki-st\u00e1n. Rebellions of provincial governors distracted the Sam\u00e1n\u00edda monarchy towards the end of the 10th century; and in 999 A.D. their dominions north of Persia were taken possession of by the Khan of Kashghar, the Persian provinces being added by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed to his dominions.

This robber assumed the lofty title of king of the two worlds, and aimed, doubtless, at carving out for himself such independent principality, after the example of Hydar 'Ali, in whose service he originally commenced his adventurous career. Subsequently he murdered the displeased of Tip\u00fa Sultan, who chained him like a wild beast to the walls of his dungeons in Seragapatan, from which \"durance vile\" he has been liberated by the English soldiers after the taking of Seragapatan. He now threatened Mysore with 500 cavalry. The Government of Madras instructed Colonel Wellesley to pursue him wherever he could be found and to hang him on the first tree. His subjugation and subsequent death (in 1800) with the extirpation of his formidable band of free-booters, relieved the English Government from an enemy, who, though by no means equal to Hydar and Tip\u00fa, might eventually have afforded considerable annoyance.\n\nDil, \u062f\u06cc\u0644, poetical name of Zorawar Kh\u00e1n of Sirkar Kol.

The Hind\u00fa histories of the kingdom of M\u00e1lwa go back as far as the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bikarm\u00e1jit, whose accession to that kingdom has given rise to an era which commences 57 years before Christ. After him reigned R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bh\u00f3j and many others who are all mentioned among the rajas of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n. During the reign of Ghay\u00e1s-udd\u00edn Balban king of Delhi in the year 1310 A.D., 710 A.H., the Muhammadans first invaded and conquered the provinces of M\u00e1lwa; after which it acknowledged allegiance to that crown until the reign of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h Tughlak II, 1387 A.D., 789 A.H. At this period Dilawar Kh\u00e1n, a descendant on his mother's side from Sult\u00e1n Shah\u00e1b-udd\u00edn Gh\u00f3r\u00ed, was appointed governor of M\u00e1lwa, previously to the accession of Muhammad Tughlak, and he subsequently established his independence. In the year 1398 A.D., 801 A.H., Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, king of Delhi, being driven from his throne by Amir Taim\u00fas (Tamerlane), made his escape to Gujr\u00e1t, and then to M\u00e1lwa, where he remained three years, after which, in 1401 A.D., 804 A.H., he, at the instance of the Delhi nobles, quitted M\u00e1lwa, in order to resume the reins of his own government. Dilawar Kh\u00e1n shortly afterwards assumed royalty and divided his kingdom into estates among his officers whom he ennobled. Dilawar Kh\u00e1n on assuming independence, took up his residence in Dh\u00e1r, which place he considered as the seat of\nhis government, but he frequently visited the city of M\u00e1nd\u00f3, remaining there sometimes for months together. He only survived his assumption of the royal titles a few years; for in the year 1495 A.D., 808 A.H., he died suddenly, and his son Alp Kh\u00e1n ascended the throne under the title of Sultan H\u00f3shang Sh\u00e1h. Including Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n eleven princes reigned in M\u00e1lwa till the time of the emperor Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, whose son Akbar eventually subdued and attached it to the Delhi government.

A storm was raised which he had not the courage to encounter; and disguising himself in female attire, he escaped from Arkat to his own fort of Vellore.\n\nDost Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, ruler of K\u00e1b\u00f3l and Kundah\u00e1r, was one of the brothers of Fath\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, the celebrated waz\u00edr of Mahm\u00fad, ruler of H\u00edrat and chief of the Barakzai clan. He was the most powerful chief in Afghanistan, and had been for many years previous to the restoration of Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1'ul-Mulk by the British in 1838, ruled that country. On the death of this prince, Dost Muhammad again assumed the reins of government.\n\nOn the base and cruel murder of Fath\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n by Mahm\u00fad at the instigation of Prince K\u00e1mr\u00e1n, his brothers revolted from their allegiance under the guidance of 'Az\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, the governor of Kashmir, and drove Mahm\u00fad and his son K\u00e1mr\u00e1n from K\u00e1b\u00f3l. Az\u00edm Kh\u00e1n in the first instance offered the vacant throne to Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1', but offended by some personal slight, withdrew his support, and placed in his room, Aiyy\u00fab, a brother of Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1', who was content to take the trappings with the power of royalty. On Az\u00edm Kh\u00e1n's death, his brothers dissatisfied with their position conspired against his son, Hab\u00edb-ull\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n, and seizing his person, by threats of blowing him from a gun, induced his mother to deliver up the residue of Az\u00edm Kh\u00e1n's immense wealth. Aiyy\u00fab's son was killed in these disputes, and he himself alarmed by these scenes of violence, fled to L\u00e1h\u00f3r. Dost Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, the most talented of the brothers, then took possession of the throne and became de facto king of K\u00e1b\u00f3l. Sher Dil Kh\u00e1n, accompanied by four brothers, carried off about half a million sterling of Az\u00edm Kh\u00e1n's money, and seated himself in Kandah\u00e1r, as an independent chief. One of his brothers, some years ago, and Kandah\u00e1r was until lately ruled by Koh\u00e1n Dil Kh\u00e1n, assisted by two surviving brothers Rah\u00edm Dil and Mir Dil. In the year 1839 the British army entered K\u00e1b\u00f3l and placed Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1'ul-Mulk on the throne on the 8th May, and Dost Muhammad Kh\u00e1n surrendered to the British Envoy and Minister in K\u00e1b\u00f3l on the 4th November after having defeated the 2nd Bengal Cavalry by a desperate charge. He was subsequently sent down to Calcutta, where he arrived, accompanied by one of his sons, on the 23rd May, 1841. He was set free in November 1842 and returned to K\u00e1b\u00f3l, where he reigned as before till his death, which took place on the 9th June, 1863 A.D., 21st Zil-hijjah 1279 A.H., and his youngest son Amir Sher \u00c1l\u00ed succeeded him.\n\nDoulat Khan Lodi, who, according to Fir\u00edsh\u00e1, was an Afgh\u00e1n by birth, originally a private Secretary, who after passing through various offices was raised by Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad Tughl\u00e1q, and attained the title of 'Az\u00edz Mum\u00e1l\u00edk. After the death of Mahm\u00fad, the nobles raised him to the throne of Delhi in April, 1413 A.D., Mujarr\u00e1m, 816 A.H. In March 1414, 13th R\u00e1b\u00ed I, 817 A.H., Khiz\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, governor of Mult\u00e1n, invaded Delhi, and after a siege of four months obliged Doulat Kh\u00e1n on the 4th June 1414, Jam\u00e1da I, 817 A.H., to surrender. He was instantly confined in the fort of Fir\u00edz\u00e1b\u00e1d, where he died after two months.\n\nDoulat Khan Lodi, who invited B\u00e1bar Sh\u00e1h to India, was a descendant of the race of that name who heretofore reigned at Dehl\u00ed. He was a poet and a man of learning.

His violence, rapacity and lawless ambition, were the main causes of the war in 1802 with the confederate Maratha chieftains. Hostilities having broken out with the British, Sir Arthur Wellesley (afterwards Duke of Wellington) defeated Doulat Rao at Assaye in 1803, while Lord Lake drove the Marhattas from the whole of the Doab. He married Baji Bai, reigned 33 years, and died on the 21st March, 1827, 21st Shaban 1242 A.H. He was succeeded by Jhanko Rao Sindhiya.\n\nDoulat Shah, \u062f\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0634\u0627\u06c1, son of Bakht Shah of Samarqand, and author of the Biography of Poets called \"Tazkira Doulat Shahi.\" He flourished in the reign of Sultan Hussain Mirza of Hiraat, surnamed Abdul Ghazi Bahadur, and dedicated the work to his prime minister, the celebrated Amir Nizamuddin Alsher. This work was written in 1486 A.D., 991 A.H., and contains the Lives or Memoirs of ten Arabian, and one hundred and thirty-four Persian poets, with various quotations from their works, and anecdotes of the princes at whose courts they resided. It also gives an account of six poets then residing in Hiraat; two of whom were principal ministers of the Sultan; viz., Alsher, and Amir Sheikh Ahmad Sulehi. Vide Faizi Kirmani.

In the partition of lands which were assigned to the chiefs, in the time of Hafiz Rahmat Kh\u00e1n, Dundey Kh\u00e1n obtained the districts of Bisaul, Muradabad, Chandp\u00far and Sambhal in Rohilkhand. He died previous to the Rohila war which took place in 1774 A.D., leaving three sons, the eldest of whom Muhi-ullah Kh\u00e1n, succeeded to the largest portion of his territories.\n\nDunyapati Singh (raja), \u0631\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u062f\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u067e\u0627\u062a\u06cc \u0633\u0646\u06af, His father died in 1790 A.D., at which time he was only seven years of age. He inherited from his grandfather Rup Rai the Chaklas of Kora, Fathapur and Kara, but was dispossessed by the Nawab Wazir, and a Nankar allowance of 24,000 rupees granted to the raja on his exclusion. This was subsequently reduced to 7,500 rupees. The original grant amounted to 52,000 per annum, payable from 14 mahals, but in 1770 A.D., the Nawab Najaf Kh\u00e1n acquiring unlimited dominion over these provinces, dispossessed his father of eleven of the villages, by which his income was reduced to 20,000 rupees. In 1787 his father was dispossessed of the remaining three villages by Zainul-Abidin Kh\u00e1n, the Amil, but as the raja was about to proceed to hostilities, the Amil agreed to allow him 10,000 Rs. for the first year, and 20,000 thereafter, but failed in the fulfilment of his promise. In 1792 A.D., Zainul-Abidin died, and was succeeded by his son B\u00e2kar Ali Kh\u00e1n, and from that period up to 1802, the raja Dunyapati Singh was allowed 8,000 rupees per annum, which was confirmed by Government in 1805 in perpetuity.\n\nDuplex, a French officer, governor of Pondicherry.

Overtures had been made for an union with Dalpat Sah, raja of Singalgarh (which is situated on the brow of a hill that commands a pass on the road about halfway between Garha and Sangar;) but the proposal was rejected on the ground of a previous engagement, and some inferiority of caste in the part of the Garha family, who was of the race of the Chandeli rajas. Dalpat Sah was a man of uncommonly fine appearance, and this added to the celebrity of his father's name and extent of his dominions, made Durgawati desirous as himself for the union, but he was by her given to understand, that she must be relinquished or taken by force, since the difference of caste would of itself be otherwise an insurmountable obstacle. He marched with all his troops he could assemble, met those of her father and his rival,\u2014gained a victory and brought off Durgawati as the prize to the fort of Singalgarh. Dalpat Sah died four years after their marriage, leaving a son named Bir Narayan about three years of age, and his widow as regent during his minority. Asaf Khan, the imperial viceroy at Kara Manikpur on the Ganges in the province of Allahabad, invited by the prospect of appropriating so fine a country and so much wealth as she was reputed to possess, invaded her dominions in the year 1564 A.D., at the head of 6,000 cavalry and 12,000 well disciplined infantry, with a train of artillery. He was met by the queen at the head of her troops, and an action took place in which she was defeated. She received a wound from an arrow in the eye; and her only son, then about 18 years of age, was severely wounded and taken to the rear. At this moment she received another arrow in the neck; and seeing her troops give way and the enemy closing around her, she snatched a dagger from the driver of her elephant, and plunged it in her own bosom. Her son was taken off the field, and was, unperceived by the enemy, conveyed back to the palace at Churagarh, to which Asaf Khan returned immediately after his victory and laid siege. The young prince was killed in the siege; and the women set fire to the place under the apprehension of suffering dishonor if they fell alive into the hands of the enemy. Two females are said to have escaped, the sister of the queen, and a young princess who had been betrothed to the young prince Bir Narayan; and these two are said to have been sent to the emperor Akbar. In this district of Jabalpur, the marble rocks and the palace called Madan Mahal is worth seeing. There is some doggerel rhyme about the palace which is not generally known though of some interest. This building stands on a single granite boulder, and was constructed by the Gond princess Ranee Durgawati, at the time of the Muhammadan invasion of Central India. Years after the cession of the country to the British, a wag of a Pandit wrote on the entrance door of the palace the following lines:\n\nMadan Mahal ke chhain me,\nDo tangan ke bich,\nGarh nau lakh rupi,\nAur soni ka do int.\n\nTranslation\u2014\n\nIn the shade of Madan Mahal\nBetween two boulders\nThere are buried nine lakhs of rupees\nAnd two bricks of gold.\n\nIt did not take long for the news of the appearance of this writing on the door to spread abroad, and the very person to fall a dupe to the Pandit's trick was Captain Wheatley, at that time a Political Assistant at Jabalpur. He mustered some peons and laborers, and having proceeded to the spot, commenced digging for the treasure on the part of Government. The native lady, in whose possession was the village lands on which the palace stood, came rushing down to the Agent to the Governor-General and represented that she was being plundered of her\ntreasure by Captain Wheatley. \"Pagli,\" replied Sir Wm. Sleeman, \"he is as mad as you are; the Pandit would not have divulged the secret were it of much value.\" Many years have since elapsed, and many others not possessed of Sir William's wisdom have fallen dupes to the Pandit's poetical trick; but for the very durable nature of the marbles, there have been enough of excavations made in and about the building to raze it to the ground.\n\nE.\n\nEgypt, kings of, vide Moizz-li-din-allah Abi Tamim Ma'd.\n\nEkkoji, the founder of the Tanjore family was the son of Shahjih Bhosla, and brother of Sciwaji, but from another consort.

He was born on the 16th September 1547, A.D., 1st Sh\u00e1ban, 954 A.H., and was first presented to Akbar in the 12th year of his reign, and introduced his brother Ab\u00fa'l F\u00e1zl six years later. After the death of the poet laureate Gh\u00e1z\u00edl of Mashhad, about the year 1572 A.D., or some years after, or, according to the \"M\u00e1sir-ul-Umr\u00e1,\" in the 33rd year of the emperor, Faizi was honored with the title of \"Malik-ush-Shu'a'ra'\" or king of poets. In history, philosophy, in medicine, in letter writing, and in composition, he was without a rival. His earlier compositions in verse, bear his titular name of Faizi, which he subsequently dignified into Faizayi, but he survived to enjoy his last title only one or two months, and then met his death. Besides desiring to imitate Kh\u00e1tib-i-Kashg\u00edr in the five poems of N\u00e1z\u00e1n\u00ed, he wrote in imitation of them his \"Mak\u00e1iz Adw\u00e1r,\" \"Sulaim\u00e1n and Bilka\u00eds,\" \"Nal Daman,\" \"Haft Kh\u00e1t\u00edwar,\" and \"Akbar Nama.\" The story of Nal Daman is an episode of the Mah\u00e1th\u00edrah, which he translated into Persian verse at the command of the emperor Akbar. He was the first Musalm\u00e1n that applied himself to a diligent study of Hind\u00fa literature and science. Besides Sanskrit works in poetry and philosophy, he made a version of the \"Bija Ganita\" and \"Lila-wati,\" of Bhaskar Ach\u00e1ry\u00e1, the best Hebrew works on Algebra and Arithmetic. He was likewise author of a great deal of original poetry, and of other works in Persian. He composed an elaborate Commentary upon the Kur\u00e1n, making use of only those 13 out of the 28 letters of the Alphabet which have no dots, and which he named \"Sav\u00e1ta'-ul-Ih\u00e1m\"; a copy of this extraordinary monument of wasted labour (says Mr. Elliot) is to be seen in the Library of the East India House. There is also another book of the same description which he wrote and called \"Maward-ul-Kalam.\" Faizi suffered from asthma and died at Agr\u00e1h on Saturday the 4th of October, 1595 O.S., 10th Safar, 1004 A.H., aged 49 lunar years and some months; and, as many supposed him to have been a deist, several abusive chronograms were written on the occasion, of which the following is one: \"He which was an infidel.\" There is also an India or collection of Letton which goes after his name. His mother died in January, 1590 A.D., 998 A.H., and his father in August, 1593 A.D., Z\u00e9ka'd, 1001 A.H. He was a profound scholar, well versed in Arabic literature, the art of poetry and medicine.

This prince, in the course of a few days, in 1794 was imprisoned and assassinated by his younger brother Ghul\u00e1m Muhammad, who forcibly took possession of the government. The English, having espoused the cause of Ahmad Ali, the infant son of the murdered prince, defeated and took Ghul\u00e1m Muhammad prisoner at Bithoura. He was conveyed to Calcutta, where, under pretence of going on a pilgrimage to Mecca, he embarked on board a ship, probably landed at one of the ports in Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n's dominions, and thence made his way to the court of K\u00e1b\u00fal in 1797 A.D., 1212 A.H., where, united with the agents of Tip\u00fa in clamours against the English, he urged Zam\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h, the son of Taimur Sh\u00e1h, to invade Hindust\u00e1n, promising that, on his approach to Dehl\u00ed, he should be joined by the whole tribe of Rohelas.

It appears from that preface, that Yaz\u00eddj\u00e1rd, the last king of the S\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00edan race, took considerable pains in collecting all the chronicles, histories, and traditions connected with Persia and the sovereigns of that country, from the time of 'Kal\u00e1umors to the accession of the Khusr\u00fas, which by his direction were digested and brought into one view, and formed the book known by the name of \"Siar-ul-Maluk,\" or the B\u00e1st\u00e1n N\u00e1ma. When the followers of Muhammad overturned the Persian monarchy, this work was found in the plundered library of Yaz\u00eddj\u00e1rd. In the tenth century one of the kings of the S\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00edan dynasty, directed Dak\u00edki the poet to verify that extensive work, but the poet only lived to finish a thousand distichs, having been assassinated by his own slave. Nothing further was done till the reign of Sultan Mahm\u00fad, when a revenue-officer furnished the Sultan with a copy of the B\u00e1st\u00e1n N\u00e1ma, the existence of which was till then unknown. From this work, he selected twelve stories, which he delivered to seven poets to be composed in verse, that he might be able to ascertain the merits of each competitor. The poet Unsar\u00ed gained the palm, and he was accordingly engaged to arrange the whole in verse. Fird\u00e1us\u00ed was at this time at Tus, his native city, where he cultivated his poetical talents with assiduity and success. He had heard of the attempt of Dak\u00edki, and of the determination of the reigning king Mahm\u00fad, to patronize an undertaking which\npromised to add lustre to the age in which he lived. Having fortunately succeeded in procuring a copy of the B\u00e1st\u00e1n N\u00e1ma, he pursued his studies with unremitting zeal, and soon succeeded that part of the poem in which the battles of Zul\u00e1k and Farr\u00fakh\u00ed are described. The performance was universally read and admired, and it was not long before his fame reached the ears of the Sult\u00e1n, who immediately invited him to his court. It is related that when Firdaus\u00ed, on the invitation of the Sult\u00e1n, reached the capital of Ghazni, he happened to pass a public garden where the three royal poets, Unsari, Asjad\u00ed and Farr\u00fakh\u00ed were enjoying themselves. The poets observed him approach and at once agreed that if the stranger chanced to have any taste for poetry, which they intended to put to test, he should be admitted to their friendship, and in order to decide as to his merits they settled among themselves to repeat each in turn a hemistich, and leave to Firdaus\u00ed to complete the fourth, but at the same time satisfied in their own minds, that there was no other word in the Persian language that would rhyme with the three, which they had taken care to pre-occupy. Firdaus\u00ed joining them and hearing the proposal, promised to exert his powers. They then commenced each with an extemporaneous hemistich:\n\nUnsari...... The light of the moon to thy splendour is weak,\nAsjad\u00ed ...... The rose is eclipsed by the bloom of thy cheek;\nFarr\u00fakh\u00ed ..... They eye-lashes dart through the folds of the Joshan,\nFirdaus\u00ed .... Like the javelin of Geo in the battle with Pushan.\n\nThe poets were astonished at the readiness of the stranger, and ashamed at being totally ignorant of the story of Geo and Pushan, which Firdaus\u00ed related as described in the B\u00e1st\u00e1n N\u00e1ma. They immediately treated him with the greatest kindness and respect, and afterwards introduced him to Mahm\u00fad, as a poet capable of undertaking the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma. Mahm\u00fad considered himself never so much honored as when Firdaus\u00ed set his foot at Ghazni; he was never more proud, than that Firdaus\u00ed was by his command, composing, in his faultless verse, a history of the monarchs of Persia, his predecessors. Reward then appeared to him too great to offer, to induce the poet to undertake the task, no promises too splendid to make him. \"Write, unequalled one,\" cried he, \"and for every thousand couplets a thousand pieces of gold shall be thine.\" Firdaus\u00ed obeyed, but resolved to accept no reward till he had completed the work he had undertaken, and for thirty years he studied and laboured that his poem might be worthy of eternal fame. In this he succeeded, and presented an elegant copy of his book to Mahm\u00fad, but the patience of the Sult\u00e1n was exhausted, his enthusiasm was gone, his liberality had faded away, and when the 60,000 couplets of the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma was ended, there was a pause, which brought to the poet disappointment and to the monarch such everlasting disgrace as has obliterated all his triumphs. Mahm\u00fad received the book, coldly applauded its diligence and dismissed him. Many months elapsed, and Firdaus\u00ed heard no more of his work; he then took occasion to remind the king of it by the following epigram:\n\n'Tis said our monarch's liberal mind,\nIs like the ocean unconfined,\nHappy are they who prove it so,\n'Tis not for me that truth to know.\nI've plunged within its waves, 'tis true,\nBut not a single pearl could view.\n\nShamed, picqued, and offended at this freedom, the Sult\u00e1n ordered 60,000 pieces of silver dirhams to be sent to the author, instead of the gold which he had promised. Firdaus\u00ed was in the bath at the time the money arrived, and his rage and amazement exceeded all bounds when he found himself thus insulted. He immediately distributed the paltry sum amongst the attendants of the bath and the slave who brought it. The excited poet then relieved his mind by a satire full of stinging invective, and caused it to be transmitted to the favorite Wazir who had instigated the Sult\u00e1n against him; it was carefully sealed up, with directions that it should be read to Mahm\u00fad on some occasion when his mind was perturbed with affairs of State, as it was a poem likely to afford him entertainment. Firdaus\u00ed having thus prepared his vengeance, quitted the court and was safely arrived in M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n where news reached him that his lines had fully answered the purpose he had intended they should do. Mahm\u00fad had heard and trembled, and too late discovered that he had ruined his own reputation for ever. After his satire had been read by Mahm\u00fad, the poet feared to remain too long in one place; he sought shelter in the court of the Khalf\u00ed of Baghdad, in whose honor he added a 1000 couplets to the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma, and who rewarded him with 60,000 gold dinars which had been withheld by Mahm\u00fad. Mahm\u00fad pretended to have discovered that his Wazir had deceived him in attributing impiety to Firdaus\u00ed, and he at once sacrificed that favorite, dismissing him with disgrace. Thinking, by a tardy act of liberality, to repair his former meanness, Mahm\u00fad dispatched to Firdaus\u00ed the 60,000 pieces he had promised, a robe of State, and many apologies and expressions of friendship; but the poet was dead, having expired in his native town full of years and honours, surrounded by his friends and kindred. Firdaus\u00ed died at T\u00faz (now called Mashhad) his native country in 1020 A.D., 411 A.H., aged 89 years; but H\u00e1j\u00ed Kh\u00e1l\u00edya says, he died in 1025 A.D., 416 A.H. Besides the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma, he is the author of other poems called \"Abi\u00e1t Firdaus\u00ed.\"\n\nFirdaus\u00ed-al-Thawil, a Turkish historian, and author of the Turkish work called \"Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma\" which comprises the history of all the ancient kings of the East. Bavar\u00edz or Baha\u00edz II., to whom the book was dedicated, ordered the author to reduce it from its original bulk of 300 volumes to 80. Firdaus\u00ed, however, felt so mortified at this proposal, that he preferred leaving the country altogether, and emigrated to Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, in Persia. Firdaus\u00ed flourished in 1500 A.D.\n\nFirishta, whose proper name is Muhammad K\u00e1s\u00edm, and who is the author of the history called \"T\u00e1r\u00edkh Firish-ta,\" was born at Astr\u00e1b\u00e1d on the borders of the Caspian Sea, about the year 1570 or 1550 A.D., 978 or 958 A.H. His father, a learned man, by name Ghul\u00e1m 'Al\u00ed Hind\u00fa Sh\u00e1h, left his native country when our author was very young and travelled into India. He eventually reached Ahmadnagar in the Dakh\u00e1n during the reign of Murtaz\u00e1 Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h I., and was appointed by the Sult\u00e1n to instruct his son Mir\u00e1n Husain, in the Persian language, but he soon died after his selection, and Firishtha was left an orphan in early youth. After the death of Murtaz\u00e1 Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h in 1589 A.D., 996 A.H., he proceeded to Bij\u00e1pur, and was presented by Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, minister to Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm 'Adil Sh\u00e1h II., by whose request he wrote the history which goes by his name, in the year 1023 Hijr\u00ed (1614 A.D.). The year of his death is altogether unknown. Briggs supposes that it occurred in 1612 A.D., 1021 A.H., making him only 41 years of age. M. J. Mohl supposes him to have revised his work up to at least 1623 A.D., 1033 A.H., making his age not less than 73, as he supposes him to have been born in 1550 A.D. Firishtha styles his work, \"Gulshan-i-Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm\u00ed,\" and \"Naur\u00e1s N\u00e1ma.\" Its former name is derived from the king to whom it was dedicated; and hence it is frequently quoted under the name of \"T\u00e1r\u00edkh Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm\u00ed.\" The latter name was given to it in commemoration of the new capital, Naur\u00e1s, which his patron Tor\u00e1h\u00e1n Adil Sh\u00e1h, commenced building in the year 1599 A.D.

The Jats are a stalwart and brave race, and showed what they could do under his leadership, but when left to themselves they are so divided by factions, that Hurriana has always fallen an easy prey to every adventurer who has taken it into his head to subdue it. Thus it was overrun by the Marhattas, under Messrs. Louis and Perron, by the Rohillas under Amir Kh\u00e1n, and another leader, and finally by the British. George Thomas came out to India as a common seaman, and having deserted his ship, first took service with Madho Rao Scindhia about the year 1770 A.D. The famous Begam of Scindhia was then in the zenith of her power, and he left Scindhia to serve her, and shortly after, having collected a body of men, he left her, and marched down to Hurriana, and in no time carved out a kingdom for himself. He made the city of Hansi his capital and built a strong fort in it. He built another fort about 20 miles to the south of the town of Rohtak, and called it after his own Christian name Georgegarh, or as the natives call Jahajgarh. After a few years the Marhattas under Mons. Louis invaded his territories. He hastened to give them battle, and throwing himself into the small fort of Jahajgarh, he fought them for three days, though his force was infinitely smaller than theirs. His cavalry, which was composed principally of that rascally tribe the Rajghars, having gone over to the enemy, and his Lieutenant, an Englishman, of the name of Hopkinson, being killed, his troops at length gave way, and he fled on a favourite Arab horse, to Hansi, a distance of about 60 miles. We are not aware how long he lingered in the neighbour...\nhood after his defeat, but he died at Ban\u00e1ras on his way to his native country, Ireland.

He was fortunate enough to secure the esteem of Amir Taimur, who sought every occasion to do him service. After the death of that tyrant, he attended the court of his son Shahrukh Mirza, and received from the young prince Mirza Baisanghar every demonstration of kindness and regard. To him he dedicated his works under the name of \"Zubdat-ut-Tawarikh Baisangham,\" which contains a complete history of the world, and an account of the institutions and religions of different people down to 1425 A.D., 829 A.H.

He was born at Shiraz in the reign of the Muzaffaridians, and was living at the time when Amir Taimur (Tamerlane) defeated Shah Mansur the last Sultan of that dynasty. The language of Hafiz has been styled among the Musalmans, \"Lis\u00e1n-ul-Ghaib,\" the language of mystery. From his frequent celebration of love and wine in his odes he has not improperly been denominated, by some Orientalists, the Anacreon of Persia. He died in 1389 A.D., 971 A.H. at Shiraz, where his tomb is yet to be seen at a place called Musalla, and is visited as a sacred spot by pilgrims of all ages. After his death a collection of 569 of his odes was made by Sayyad K\u00e1sim Anvar, entitled \"Diwan Hafiz.\" A few of his poems may be understood in a literal sense; but in general they are figurative, and allude to the Sufi doctrines; most of them have been at different times translated into some of the European languages. At the head of the English translators, stand Sir W. Jones, Messrs. Richardson and Carlyle. There have been two other Persian poets of the name of Hafiz, one of them surnamed Halwai, that is to say, the confectioner, who lived in the reign of Sultan Shahrukh, the son of Tamerlane, and the other was named Aj\u00e1n Rumi. Many zealous admirers of Hafiz insist, that by wine he invariably means devotion; and they have gone so far as to compose a dictionary of words in the language, as they call it, of the Sufis: in that vocabulary, sleep is explained by meditation on the divine perfections, and perfume by hope of the divine favor; gates are illapses of grace; kisses and embraces, the raptures of piety; idolaters, infidels, and libertines, are men of the purest religion, and their idol is the Creator himself; the tower is a retired oratory, and its keeper, a sage instructor; beauty denotes the perfection of the Supreme Being; tresses are the expansion of his glory. Like the hidden mysteries of his essence; down on the cheek, the world of spirits, who encircle his throne; and a black mole, the point of indissoluble unity; lastly, wantonness, mirth, and inebriety, mean religious ardour and abstraction from all terrestrial thoughts.\n\nHafiz Muhammad, author of the \"Hawi Saghir.\"\n\nHafiz Rahmat Khan, \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 \u0631\u062d\u0645\u062a \u062e\u0627\u0646, a celebrated Rohila chief. He joined his countrymen during the administration of Ali Muhammad Khan, who advanced him to an important station, and Pilibhit and Bareily were given to him and Muradabad to another chief named D\u00edw\u00e1n Kh\u00e1s. Having attained his office, by military ability and genius, he at length wholly superseded the authority of Sadul-ud-din Khan, the son of Ali Muhammad Khan, and was advanced to the supreme administration of affairs. He fell in his engagement to pay forty lacs of rupees to Nawab Shujuddaula of Audi for the protection of his country from the ravages of the Marhattas, was killed in a battle fought by the naw\u00e1b by the assistance of the English on the 23rd April, 1774 A.D., 10th Safar, 1188 A.H.

This sect made a great noise in Bagh-d\u00e1d in the reign of the Khal\u00edf Al-Muktadir in 929 A.D., 317 A.H. Moronzi chief of the sect, had asserted that God had placed Muhammad on his throne, which assertion he founded upon the passage of the Kor\u00e1n: \"Thy Lord shall soon give thee a considerable place or station.\" All the other sects of the Musalm\u00e1ns regard the explanation of the Hanbalites as a shocking impiety. They maintain that this \"considerable place or station,\" was the post or quality of a mediator, which they affirm to belong to their prophet. This dispute passed from the schools to the public assemblies. At length they came from words to blows which cost the lives of several thousands. In the year 935 A.D., 323 A.H., the Hanbalites became so insolent, that they marched in arms on the city of Bagh-d\u00e1d, and plundered the shops on pretence that wine was drunk in them. Ahmad was a traditionist of the first class, and composed a collection of authenticated traditions called \"Musnad,\" more copious than those any other person had till then been able to form: it is said that he knew by-heart one million of those traditions.

It was estimated that the number of men present at his funeral was 800,000, and women 60,000; and it is said that 20,000 Christians, Jews and Magians became Moslems on the day of his death. In the year 835 A.D., Ram\u00e1z\u00e1n, 220 A.H., some time in the month of September, he was required by the Khal\u00edf Al-Mot\u00e1sim Bill\u00e1h to declare that the Kor\u00e1n was created, but would not, and although beaten and imprisoned, persisted in his refusal.

He was one of the most celebrated doctors of the Musalm\u00e1ns, and chief of the sect of Hanifites; and though his sect is the principal of the four which they now indifferently follow, he was ill-used during his lifetime, and died in the prison at Bagh-d\u00e1d 767 A.D., 150 A.H. His principal works are, the \"Musnad,\" i.e., the foundation or support, wherein he established all the points of the Musalm\u00e1n faith: a Treatise entitled \"F\u00edkh-l\u00e1mm,\" or Scholastic Divinity; and a Catechism called \"Mua'llim-al-Isl\u00e1m\" i.e., the Instructor.\n\nHis principal work is entitled the \"F\u00edkh-ul-Akbar,\" it treats of the Ilm-ul-Kalam, and has been commented upon by various writers, many of whom are mentioned by H\u00e1ji Khalfa. Vide Ab\u00fa Hanifa. Some say that the Musnad was written by Im\u00e1m Hanb\u00e1l. By the Shias he is as much detested and censured, as by their antagonists he is admired and exalted. For allowing his disciples to drink n\u00e1b\u00edz, which is a wine made of dates, he is accused by the Persians of departing from the clear injunction of the Prophet against all intoxicating beverages.\n\nHarindar Narain Bhup, Maharaja, \u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0646\u062f\u0631 \u0646\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0646 \u0628\u06be\u067e, the raja of K\u00fach Beh\u00e1r, who died at Benares on the 30th May, 1839, aged 70 years. He was of the Rajbansi caste, and a follower of Siva, but his style of living was very unlike that of a Hind\u00fa. He used to marry without any regard to caste, and entered into the connubial relation with any woman he took a fancy to. He did not even spare married women. The number of his wives or r\u00e1n\u00eds was no less than 1200!\nHari Rao Holkar, H\u00e1ri R\u00e1o Holk\u00e1r, r\u00e1s\u00e1 of Indor, was the cousin and successor of Malhar R\u00e1o III, the adopted son and successor of Jaswant R\u00e1o Holkar.

He was one of the ablest writers of his time, and is the author of the \"Muk\u00e1m\u00e1t Har\u00ed,\" a work consisting of 50 Oratorical, Poetical, Moral, Ecomastic, and Satirical discourses, supposed to have been spoken or read in public assemblies; but which were composed by the author at the desire of An\u0101sharw\u00e1n-Ibn-Khal\u00edd, wazir to Sult\u00e1n Mu\u1e25ammad Salj\u00faq\u00ed. He died at Basra in the year 1122 A.D., 516 A.H. Poets, historians, grammarians and lexicographers look upon the Muk\u00e1m\u00e1t as the highest authority, and next to the Kur\u00e1n, as far at least as language is concerned. His book has been translated either entirely or partially into nearly every Eastern and European tongue.\n\nHarkaran, H\u00e1rik\u00e1r\u00e1n, the son of Mathura D\u00e1s, a Kambh\u00f3h of Mult\u00e1n, was a Munshi in the service of Naw\u00e1b Y\u00e1'th\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, and is the author of a collection of letters called \"Insh\u00e1e Harkaran,\" or the Forms of Harkaran, translated into English by Dr. Francis Balfour, M.D. The second edition of this work was printed in England in 1804.\n\nHarun-al-Rashid, H\u00e1run al-Rash\u00edd.

He came to India with Mirz\u00e1 Shahr\u00fakh, son of Ans\u00e9r Taim\u00far, and died at Kandah\u00e1r where his tomb is resorted to by pilgrims.

He is the author of a book called \"Bhogbal,\" or the \"Kot Sh\u00e1h\u00e1r.\" It is a curious but obscene satire on women, said to be a translation or paraphrase from the Sanskrit in Hindi verse. There is another translation of the same book in Persian prose called \"Lazzat-un-Nisa,\" by Ziy\u00e1udd\u00edn Nakhshab\u00ed.\n\nHasan Askari, H\u00e1sn Ask\u00e1r\u00ed, or Ab\u00fa'l-\u1e24asan 'Al\u00ed-al-'Ask\u00e1r\u00ed, was the eleventh Im\u00e1m of the race of 'Al\u00ed, and the eldest son of Im\u00e1m 'Al\u00ed N\u00e1ki who was the tenth.

He was made a commander of 2500 for his services in Bangash, and was put towards the end of Akbar's reign, in charge of Kabul, receiving Fort Roht\u00e1s in the Panjab as jagir. Hasan Beg, after making a useless attempt to incriminate others, was put into a cow-hide and in this state he was tied to donkeys and carried through the bazar. He died after a few hours from suffocation.

He is the author of a history also called \"Muntakhab-ut-Taw\u00e1r\u00edch,\" besides the one written by Abdul K\u00e1dir Bad\u00edsh\u00ed. He commenced the work before the close of Akbar's reign, and completed it in the fifth year of the emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, i.e., 1610 A.D., 1019 A.H., in which year, he tells us, he was appointed D\u00edv\u00e1n of Patna.\n\nHasan-bin-Muhammad Sharif, H\u00e1sn bin Mu\u1e25ammad Shar\u00edf, author of the \"Ans-ul-'Ushsh\u00e1k,\" the lover's companion, containing an explanation of all the metaphors and phrases used by the poets; with numerous quotations from those held in the greatest estimation.

He was an immediate descendant of Sult\u00e1n Argh\u00fan Kh\u00e1n, king of Persia, (whose sister was his mother) and one of the principal chiefs of the Mughals, the nephew of Sultan Abu Sa'id. He married Baghd\u00e1d Kh\u00e1tn\u00ed, daughter of Amir Chob\u00edn or Jev\u00edn, but the prince being deeply enamoured of her charms, Amir Hasan, after the death of her father, was forced to resign his consort to him in 1327 A.D., 728 A.H. A few years after the death of Abu Sa'id, Amir Hasan married his widow Dilsh\u00e1d Kh\u00e1tn\u00ed, went to Baghd\u00e1d, seized that city, and became the founder of a petty dynasty of princes. His life was passed in contests to establish his authority over the territories of Baghd\u00e1d, and he died before this object of his ambition was accomplished, in July 1356 A.D., Raj\u00e1b, 757 A.H. His son Sultan Owes Jal\u00e1yer was more fortunate: he not only succeeded in completing the conquest his father had commenced, but carried his arms into Azurbj\u00e1n and Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n. Sultan Owes died in October 1374 A.D., 776 A.H., and left his government to his second son Sultan Husain Jal\u00e1yer. This excellent prince, who is also alike celebrated for his benevolence and love of justice, lost his life in an action in 1382 A.D., 784 A.H., with his brother Ahmad, surnamed Tik\u00e1n\u00ed, a cruel and unjust ruler, whose enormities compelled his subjects to invite Amir Taim\u00far (Tamerlane) to their relief in 1393 A.D., and almost the whole of the future life of Ahmad passed in an ineffectual struggle with that conqueror. He fled to Egypt for safety, and when, after the death of Taim\u00far, he returned to recover his dominions, he was taken and put to death by Kara Yusuf, a Turkman chief in 1410 A.D., 813 A.H.\n\nHasan Imam, H\u00e1sn 'Im\u00e1m, the eldest son of 'Al\u00ed, the son of Ab\u00fa T\u00e1lib, and F\u00e1tima, the daughter of Mu\u1e25ammad; was born on the 1st March 625 A.D., 15th Ram\u00e1zn\u00ed, 3 A.H. After the death of his father in January, 661 A.D., Ram\u00e1zn\u00ed, 40 A.H., he succeeded him as second Im\u00e1m, and was proclaimed Khilaf\u00e1 by the Arabians, but perceiving the people divided and himself ill-used, he after six months resigned the Khilaf\u00e1t to Mu'\u00e1wiya, who assigned to him about 150,000 pounds a year, besides\nlarge presents. After this Hasan and his brother Husain retired and lived privately at Madina, where after a few years he died of poison, administered to him by one of his wives, whom Yazid, the son of Mu'awia submitted to commit that wickedness, on the promise of marrying her afterwards. But instead of a new husband, she was forced to be contented with a good sum of money which Mu'awia gave her for her pains; for Yazid was not so mad as to trust himself to such embraces. This mournful event took place on the night of the 17th March, 659 or 670 A.D., Safar, 49 A.H. He was buried in Madina at a place called Bakia. Hasan is said to have been an person very like his grandfather Muhammad, who when he was born, spit in his mouth and named him Hasan. He had twenty children, fifteen sons and five daughters. Though his wives were remarkably fond of him, yet he was apt very frequently to divorce them and marry new ones.\n\nHasan Kashi, Moulana, \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u06a9\u0627\u0634\u06cc, a poet who was a native of Kashi. He is the author of many Kasideh and Ghazals. The year of his death is not known, but he appears to have flourished about the 8th century of the Hijri era.\n\nHasan Khwaja, \u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u062d\u0633\u0646, vide Hasan Sanjari.\n\nHasan Khwaja, \u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u062d\u0633\u0646, a dervish, the son of Khwaja Ibrahim.

He was one of the chiefs, who, during the period of trouble and confusion which took place after the death of Sultan Abu Sa'id, king of Persia, in 1335 A.D., rose to eminence. He fought several battles with Amir Hasan Buzurg, and met his death accidentally by the hands of his quarrelsome wife, in December 1343 A.D., Rajab, 744 A.H.\n\nHasan Maimandi, \u0645\u06cc\u0645\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u062d\u0633\u0646. It is recorded by some that he was one of the ministers of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni. This statement is altogether incorrect and unfounded, says Mr. Elliot, as it is not mentioned by any great historian. But his son who is commonly called Ahmad-bin-Hasan Maimandi was a minister of that monarch. Hasan Maimandi was, during the lifetime of Sultan Nasiruddin Subuktigin, employed as Diwan or Collector of Revenues at Kasha Bust; but Nasiruddin was led by the secret machinations of his enemies to entertain an unfavourable opinion of him, till he was at last, in consequence of his having been convicted of extortion and fraud to a large amount, hanged by order of that Sultan; so that the general notion which prevails that he was the wazir of Sultan Mahmud, is erroneous.\n\nHasan, Mir, \u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u062d\u0633\u0646, a Hindustani poet of Lakhnau, and author of the novel called \"Masnavi Mir Hasan,\" containing the loves of Badr-i-Munir and Benazir in Urdu verse, which he completed and dedicated to Nawab 'Asaf-uddaula in the year 1755 A.D., 1199 A.H. It is also called \"Sahur-ul-Bayan.\" His ancestors were of Hira, but he was born at Delhi and went early in life to Lakhnau, where he was supported by Nawab Safdar Jang and his son Mirza Nawazish Ali Khan. He is also the author of a Diwan of about 8000 verses, and of a Tazkira of Urdu poets. He died in 1790 A.D., 1204 A.H. His father's name was Mir Ghulam Husain Zahir.\n\nHasan Mirza, \u0645\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u062d\u0633\u0646, son of Mulla Abdur Razzaq of Lajhjan.

He was styled Sheikh-ul-Jabal, an Arabic title, which signifies \"the chief of the mountains.\" The name by which this ruler and his descendants are indiscriminately known in European history, is, \"The Old Man of the Mountain.\" His followers or descendants were also called Hasani, and the English word \"assassin,\" is supposed to have been formed from a corruption of this term. Hasan Sabbah was at first a mace-bearer to Sultan Alp Arsalan; but in consequence of a quarrel with Nizam-ul-Mulk, the minister of that prince, he retired to Rai, his native country; and from thence, to Syria, where he entered into the service of a chief of the family of Ismail the son of Ja'far Sadiq, and adopted the tenets of that sect. The first object of Hasan was to possess himself of a stronghold; and he succeeded in gaining by stratagem the mountain fort of Alamut, situated between Kazwin and Gilan. The fort was built by Hasan-bin-Zaid in the year 860 A.D., 246 A.H., and Hasan Sabbah took it in 1089 A.D., 482 A.H. From this fortress he commenced depredations on the surrounding country, and added several other hill forts to the one he had already seized. That of Riddab, which is also near Kazwin, was next to Alamut in consequence. Malik Shah Saljuqi, the reigning Sultan, had sent a force to reduce him, but without any success. In the month of October, 1093 A.D., Ramazan, 485 A.H., Nizam-ul-Mulk, who was the follower of the Buyids from Isfahan to Baghdad, was stabbed by one of the followers of Hasan Sabbah who was his personal enemy. Hasan Sabbah died in 1124 A.D., 26th Rabii II, 518 A.H. Rukn-uddin, who was the last of this family, and who is better known under the name of Khidir Shah or Khur Shah, after a weak and ineffectual struggle fell before Hallaki. That conqueror not only made him prisoner, but took and dismantled all his strongholds. This event took place in the month of November, 1256 A.D., Zil-Kada' 654 A.H. It was his father Ala-uddin Muhammad who forced Nasiruddin Tusi to remain with him for some years, till he was released by Hallaki Khan. Vide Ismail and Ismailis. The successor of Hasan was Buzurg Umed.\n\nHasan Salimi, \u0633\u0644\u06cc\u0645\u06cc \u062d\u0633\u0646, vide Salimi.\n\nHasan Sanjari, Khwaja, \u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0633\u0646\u062c\u0631\u06cc, also called Khwaja Hasan Dehlawi, a celebrated Persian poet of Delhi, who was a contemporary of the famous Amir Khusrus, and had become at the age of 50 years a disciple of Sheikh Nizamuddin Aulia.

The life of the child, however, was miraculously preserved; and the unnatural mother first recognised her son, when his fortune and valour had advanced him to the rank of a victorious general in her army. Hum\u00e1\u00ed immediately resigned the crown to him, and retired to a private life after she had reigned 32 years. Her son reigned about 12 years, and is called by the Persians D\u00e1r\u00e1 or D\u00e1r\u00e1 I.\n\nHumam, Hak\u00edm, brother of Hak\u00edm Ab\u00fa'l Fatha Gh\u00e1l\u00ed, a well educated and learned man in the service of the emperor Akbar.

Meeting one day in a bath, Hum\u00e1m, observing S\u00e1d\u00ed to be very bold, presented to him a basoon with the bottom upwards; asked him, \"Why do the\nHumam\n\nheads of the people of Shiraz resemble this?\" Sa'di, having turned the basin with the empty side upwards, replied, \"First tell me, why do the heads of the people of Tabrez resemble this?\" Many other anecdotes are related of them.

He succeeded his father upon the throne at Agra on the 26th December, 1530 A.D., 6th Jum\u00e1da I, 937 A.H., and conferred the government of Kabul, Kandah\u00e1r, Ghazn\u00ed, and the Panj\u00e1b on his brother Mirz\u00e1 K\u00e1mr\u00e1n, and Askar\u00ed on the government of Sark\u00e1r Sambhal, to Mirz\u00e1 Hand\u00e1l, Sark\u00e1r Alwar, and the government of Dadakhsh\u00e1n to Mirz\u00e1 Sulaim\u00e1n, the son of Kh\u00e1n Mirz\u00e1, the son of Sult\u00e1n Muhammad, the son of Sult\u00e1n Ab\u00fa Sa'id. Humay\u00fan was defeated the first time by Sher Kh\u00e1n (afterwards Shah Sh\u00e1h) in a battle fought on the banks of the Chaunsa in Beh\u00e1r on the 26th June, 1539 A.D., 9th Saf\u00e1r, 946 A.H., and the second time at Kanjori on the 17th of May, 1540 A.D., 19th Mu\u1e25arram, 967 A.H. The capital no longer afforded him a place of refuge; even his brothers became his enemies, and would not grant him shelter in their provinces. He fled from one place to another, subject at times to the greatest hardships; and was at last obliged to quit the kingdom and seek an asylum in Persia, where he arrived in July, 1544 A.D., 951 A.H., and was hospitably and honorably entertained for some time by Sh\u00e1h Tahmasp of Persia, who assisted him with troops. During the absence of Humay\u00fan, which extended to a period of fifteen years, five kings ascended the throne of Delhi, viz. Sher Sh\u00e1h, his son Salim Sh\u00e1h, Muhammad Sh\u00e1h Adil\u00ed, Ibrahim Kh\u00e1n, and Sikandar Sh\u00e1h. Humay\u00fan having overcome his brothers at Kabul and Kandah\u00e1r, commenced his march from the former city in the month of January, 1555 A.D., Saf\u00e1r, 962 A.H., towards India. He took the Panj\u00e1b, and advancing towards Delhi, defeated Sikandar Sh\u00e1h on the 22nd of June, 1555 A.D., 2nd Sha'b\u00e1n, 962 A.H., in a battle fought at Sarhind. Sikandar, after his defeat, fled to the mountains of Sew\u00e1lk\u00edk, and Humay\u00fan having reached Delhi in triumph, became a second time emperor of Hindust\u00e1n. Bair\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, to whose valour and talent the king was principally indebted for his restoration, was rewarded with the first offices in the state with the title of Khan Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n. The year of this victory was found by Bair\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n to be contained in the words, \"The sword of Humay\u00fan.\" Seven months after this victory, on the 21st January, 1556 A.D., as Humay\u00fan was coming down at the time of evening prayers from the terrace of the Library at Delhi, he fell headlong over the steps, and died on the 25th January, 1556 A.D., 11th Rab\u00ed' I, 963 A.H. The words \"Alas! my sovereign fell from the throne,\" contain the year of his demise. He was buried at Gilokh\u00e1ri, a distance of four kos from the city of Sh\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d on the banks of the river Jumna; and a splendid monument was erected over his remains some years after, by his son Akbar, who succeeded him. Humay\u00fan died at the age of 49, after a reign of 25 years, including the fifteen years of his banishment from his capital. The foundation of his mausoleum was laid in 1565 A.D., 973 A.H., was superintended by H\u00e1j\u00ed Begam mother of Akbar, and was finished in 16 years at a cost of 15 lakhs of rupees. Farrukh-siy\u00e1r, 'Alamg\u00edr II, D\u00e1r\u00e1 Shikoh and other princes are also buried in this mausoleum.

According to the will of his father, he conferred the office of Wak\u00edl-ul-Sal\u00e1ma on Khw\u00e1ja Mahm\u00fad G\u00e1w\u00e1n, with the title of Malik-at-Talab\u00ed, and the government of Bij\u00e1pur. He was an unjust prince, and a great tyrant, on which account he was surnamed \"the cruel.\" He reigned 3 years 6 months and 6 days, and was murdered with one stroke of a heavy club on the 1st of September, 1461 A.D., 28th Zil-Ka'da, 865 A.H., during a fit of intoxication by his own servants who were wearied out with his inhuman cruelties. He was succeeded by his son Sult\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, then only eight years of age.\n\nHunain, \u062d\u0646\u064a\u0646, surname of Ab\u00fa Zaid 'Abdur Rahm\u00e1n Hunain, son of Is-h\u00e1k, son of Hunain, was a celebrated Christian physician who translated many books out of the Greek into Syriac and Arabic.\n\nHurmu\u017e or Hurmu\u017e I, \u0647\u0631\u0645\u0648\u0632 \u06cc\u06a9\u0645, the third king of Persia, of the Sasanian race, was the son of Sh\u00e1hp\u00far I, whom he succeeded in 272 A.D. He is the Hormisd\u00e1s of the Greek authors, and is said to have resembled, both in person and character, his grandfather Ardish\u00e9r. The mother of this monarch was the daughter of Mahr\u00fakh a petty prince, whom Ardish\u00e9r had put to death, and whose family he had persecuted, because an astrologer had predicted that a descendant of Mahr\u00fakh should attain the throne of Persia. This lady had fled to the tents of a shepherd where she was seen by Sh\u00e1hp\u00far when hunting. This prince became enamoured, and married her privately. His father Ardish\u00e9r, going one day unexpectedly to his son's house saw young Hurmu\u017e. He was greatly pleased with the appearance of the child and made enquiries, which compelled Sh\u00e1hp\u00far to confess all that had happened. The joy of the old king was excessive. \"The prediction of the astrologers,\" he exclaimed, \"which gave me such alarm, is, thank God, confirmed, and a descendant of Mahr\u00fakh shall succeed to my crown.\" Hurmu\u017e was a virtuous prince, but reigned only one year and ten days. He died about the year 273 A.D., and was succeeded by his son Bahr\u00e1m I.\n\nHurmu\u017e or Hurmu\u017e II, \u0647\u0631\u0645\u0648\u0632 \u062f\u0648\u0645, the eighth king of Persia of the Sasanian race. He succeeded his father Nars\u00ed about the year 303 A.D., ruled Persia seven years and five months and died 310 A.D. No events of any consequence occurred during the reign of this prince. At his death he left no son; and the kingdom was on the point of being thrown into confusion, when it was declared that one of the ladies in the harem was pregnant, and that there were certain indications of the embryo being a male. When the child was brought forth, it was named Sh\u00e1hp\u00far; and every care was taken to give the young sovereign an education suited to his high duties.\n\nHurmu\u017e or Hurmu\u017e III, \u0647\u0631\u0645\u0648\u0632 \u062b\u0627\u0644\u062b, the second son of Yezidgird II, succeeded his father, of whom he was always the favourite, 456 A.D. His elder brother F\u00edroz, though at first compelled to fly across the Oxus, soon returned to assert his right at the head of a large army, which aided by a general defection of the Persians, who deserted his weak brother, obtained an easy victory, and the unfortunate Hurmu\u017e was, after a short reign of little more than one year, dethroned and put to death 457 A.D.\nHurmuz or Hurmuz IV, the Hormisdas III of the Greeks) was declared successor to his father the great Chosroes, surnamed Nansherwin the Just, and ascended the throne of Persia 57 A.D. His subjects revolted against him at the instigation of Bahr\u00e1m Chob\u00edn or Varanes his general, whom he had offended by sending him a female dresser when he had been defeated by the Romans. They confined Hurmuz and put out his eyes to disqualify him from ascending the throne, and soon after put him to death 590 A.D. His son Khusro Purvez having collected a force to oppose Bahr\u00e1m, who with the intention of taking the government into his own hands was advancing towards Mad\u00e1n, was defeated; and with great difficulty effected his escape to the territories of the Romans, from whose emperor Maurice, he met with the most friendly and hospitable reception. Bahr\u00e1m Chob\u00edn took possession of the vacant government; but his rule was short: for within eight months from the period of his taking possession of Mad\u00e1n, he was defeated by an army of Romans and Persians commanded by Khusro, and fled to Tartary.\n\nHusain, \u062d\u0633\u06cc\u0646, poetical name of Muzaffar Husain, an author who is also called Shahid or Martyr.

He fought several battles with Bahl\u00f3l Lod\u00ed, the king of Dehl\u00ed, and was at last defeated, and so closely pursued that he left his horse and escaped on foot. The army of Dehl\u00ed advanced without any other check to Jaunp\u00far which fell to the arms of Bahl\u00f3l, while Husain Sh\u00e1h, abandoning his capital, was obliged to content himself with a small tract of country yielding only a revenue of five lakhs of rupees. Bahl\u00f3l having delivered over Jaunp\u00far and its kingdom to his own son B\u00e1bak, enjoined him not to deprive Husain Sh\u00e1h of the small tract to which he was confined, terming it his family estate. This event took place about the year 1476 A.D., 881 A.H., and the subversion of the Shark\u00ed dynasty may be dated from that year. The reign of Husain Sh\u00e1h lasted for a period of 19 lunar years. Some years after the death of Bahl\u00f3l Lod\u00ed (which happened in 1489 A.D., 894 A.H.) Husain Sh\u00e1h incited the prince B\u00e1bak to rise up against his brother Sikandar Lod\u00ed, king of Dehl\u00ed, and wrest the government out of his hands; but B\u00e1bak was defeated in the first action and retired to Jaunp\u00far, to which place he was pursued by the king. Jaunp\u00far fell shortly after, and was added to the kingdom of Dehl\u00ed. Husain Sh\u00e1h was now induced to seek refuge with 'Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn R\u00e1'\u00e1b, king of Bengal, by whom he was treated with the respect due to his station till his death which took place in 1499 A.D., 905 A.H.

In the 12th chapter of this work, he gives an account of all the Physicians who were from India.

He was born at Corduba in Spain, where his father held the office of high priest and chief judge, under the emperor of Morocco. His knowledge of law, divinity, mathematics, and astrology was very extensive, and to this was added the theory rather than the practice of medicine. On the death of his father, he was appointed to succeed him. Falling\nunder the suspicion of heresy, he was deprived of his posts, and thrown into prison, from whence he was at last delivered and reinstated in his office of judge. He wrote a treatise on the art of physic, an Epitome of Ptolemy's Almagest, a treatise on astrology, and many amorous verses; but when he grew old, he threw the three last into the fire. As to religion, his opinions were, that Christianity is absurd; Judaism, the religion of children; and Muhammadanism, the religion of swine. The best edition of his works is that of Venice, published in 1608. He is said to have died in 595 A.D., corresponding with 1199 A.D., but Lampri\u00e8re in his Universal Biography says, that he died at Morocco in 1206 A.D.\n\nIbn-Sabbagh-al-Shafi, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0635\u0628\u0627\u063a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0641\u0639\u064a, surname of Ab\u00fa Nasr 'Abdul S\u00e1diq-in-Muhammad, author of the \"Udadat-ul-'Alim W\u00e1t Tariq-ul-S\u00e1lim.\" He died 1084 A.D., 477 A.H.\n\nIbn-Sad, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0639\u062f, author of the Tabak\u00e1t.\n\nIbn-Sina, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0633\u064a\u0646\u0627, vide Ab\u00fa S\u00edna.\n\nIbn-Shahab-uz-Zohri, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0648\u0631\u064a, an Arabian author who flourished during the Khil\u00e1fat of 'Umar-ibn-'Abdul 'Aziz.\n\nIbn-Siraj, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0631\u0627\u062c, whose proper name is Ab\u00fa Bakr Muhammad, was an Arabian author, and died in 928 A.D., 316 A.H.\n\nIbn-Ukba, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0642\u0628\u0629, surname of Jamal-udd\u00edn Ahmad, author of the \"Umdat-ut-T\u00e1lib.\" He died 1424 A.D., 828 A.H.\n\nIbn-Ukda, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0642\u062f\u0629, vide Ab\u00fa'l-Abb\u00e1s Ahmad-bin-Muhammad.\n\nIbn-ul-Arabi, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a, vide Ibn-Arabi.\n\nIbn-ul-Hajar, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0645\u0632, vide Ibn-Hajar.\n\nIbn-ul-Jazari-bin-Muhammad, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0631\u064a, an Arabian author who died in the year 1430 A.D., 833 A.H.\n\nIbn-ul-Khashab, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0634\u0628, whose proper name is Ab\u00fa Mu\u1e25ammad 'Abdullah, was an excellent penman.

What fool, you must be, he said, the king to be looking for your camel on the roof of a house. The man rejoined, And what a fool you must be to look for God in the cares and troubles of a crown!

For some time Kam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n behaved with due moderation in his office, but at length was guilty of some offence towards Ch\u00e1nd Sult\u00e1na, who used her threats to effect his destruction. She secretly sent a message to H\u00e1j\u00ed Kishwar Kh\u00e1n, an officer of high rank, who caused him to be murdered. After this event Kishwar Kh\u00e1n, by the support and patronage of Ch\u00e1nd Bibi, grasped the authority of the State, and ruled with uncontrolled sway, till he was assassinated. Akhl\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n next assumed the regency; but after some time he was seized by Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, who put out his eyes, and became regent of the empire. He was expelled by the king in 1590 A.D., and his eyes put out and himself confined in 1592 A.D.

The race of Aghlab continued to enjoy their new principality peaceably till the year 910 A.D., 298 A.H., during which time they made several descents on the island of Sicily, and conquered a part of it.

He had no sooner ascended the throne, than another competitor arose in the province of the Panj\u00e1b, in the person of Ahmad Kh\u00e1n, a nephew of the late Sheir Sh\u00e1h. He defeated Ibrahim Kh\u00e1n in a battle, and the latter retreated to Sambhal, while Ahmad Kh\u00e1n took possession of Agra and Delhi, and assumed the title of Sikandar Sh\u00e1h in May the same year. Ibrahim Kh\u00e1n was killed by Sulaim\u00e1n, King of Bengal, in Orissa in a battle fought in 1567 A.D., 975 A.H., and is buried there.

The last of these, Imam Mahdi, is supposed by them to be concealed (not dead), and the title which belongs to him, cannot, they conceive, be given to another; but among the Sunnis it is a dogma, that there must be always a visible Imam or \"father of the church.\" The title is given by them to the four learned doctors who are the founders of their faith, viz.: Imams Hamifa, Malik, Sha'fi'i, and Hanbal. Of these four sects, the Hanbalite and Maliki may be considered as the most rigid, the Sha'fi'ite as the most conformable to the spirit of Islamism, and the Hanfite as the wildest and most philosophical of them all. Two other Imams, Abu Daud-uz-Zahiri, and Sufian-us-Sauri were also chiefs of the orthodox sects, but their opinions had not many followers, and after some time were totally abandoned. Ibn-Jarrir-ut-Tabari, whose reputation as an historian is so familiar to Europeans, founded also a particular sect, which disappeared soon after his death.

They maintain, that Isma'il, who was the eldest son, but died during his father's life, should have succeeded to the dignity of Im\u0101m, and not Mus\u012b K\u0101z\u012bm, who was his younger brother, and became the seventh Im\u0101m. Hasan Sabbah was of this sect. Vide Isma'ilis.\n\nIsma'il I, Safwi, Shah, \u0627\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u06cc\u0644 \u0633\u0641\u06cc \u0634\u0627\u06c1, the son of Sult\u0101n Haidar, was the first monarch of the Safwian dynasty of kings who reigned in Persia. He traced his descent from Mus\u012b K\u0101z\u012bm the seventh Im\u0101m, who was descended in a direct line from 'Al\u012b, the son-in-law of Muhammad. Almost all his ancestors were regarded as holy men, and some of them as saints. The first of this family who acquired any considerable reputation was Shaikh Safi-uddin, who had settled at Ardibel, and from whom this dynasty takes its name of Safviya or Safwi. His son Sadr-uddin Musa, as well as his immediate descendants, Khwaja Ali, Shaikh Tur\u0101h\u012bm, Sult\u0101n Junaid, and Haidar, acquired the greatest reputation for sanctity. Contemporary monarchs, we are informed, visited the cell of Sadr-uddin. The great Taim\u016br (Tamerlane), when he went to see this holy man, demanded to know what favour he should confer upon him. \"Release those prisoners you have brought from Turkey,\" was the noble and pious request of the saint. The conqueror complied; and the grateful tribes, when they gained their liberty, declared themselves the devoted disciples of him to whom they owed it. Their children preserved sacred the obligation of their fathers; and the descendants of the captives of Taim\u016br became the supporters of the family of Safi, and enabled the son of a devotee to ascend one of the most splendid thrones in the world. Khwaja 'Ali, after visiting Mecca, went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and died at that city. His grandson Junaid sat on the maz\u0101d as a spiritual guide after his death, and his father Shaikh Tur\u0101h\u012bm; and so great a crowd of disciples attended this holy man, that Jah\u0101n Sh\u0101h, the chief of the tribe of the Black Sheep, who at that time ruled Azurbaj\u0101n, became alarmed at their numbers, and banished him from Ardibel. Junaid went to Day\u0101rbik\u0101r, whose ruler, the celebrated Uzzan Hasan, received him kindly, and gave his sister in marriage to Junaid. He afterwards went with his disciples to Shirw\u0101n, where he was slain in a conflict with the troops of the king of that province in 1456 A.D., 860 A.H. His son Sult\u0101n Haidar succeeded him, and his uncle, Uzzan Hasan and Sult\u0101n Ab\u016b Sa'id, became sovereign of all Persia, gave him his daughter in marriage. The name of this princess according to Muhammadan authors, was 'Alam Sho'a, but we are informed by\nIsma'il, surnamed al-Mansur, third or fourth Khalif of Barbary of the race of the Fatimites, succeeded his father al-K\u0101sim 945 A.D., 334 A.H., and having defeated and slain Yezid-ibn-Kondat who had rebelled against his father, caused his body to be flayed, and his skin stuffed and exposed to public view. Al-Mansur died after a reign of seven years and sixteen days in 952 A.D., 30th Shawwal 341 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Ab\u016b Tam\u012bm Ma'd surnamed Mo'izz-uddin-allah.\n\nIsma'il 'Adil Shah, Sultan, of Bijapur, surnamed Ab\u016b'l Fatha, succeeded his father Y\u016bsuf 'Adil Sh\u0101h on the throne of Bijapur in the Dakkhin in 1510 A.D., 915 A.H., and died after a glorious reign of 25 lunar years on Wednesday the 27th of August, 1534 A.D., 16th Safar, 941 A.H., and was buried at K\u016bk\u012b near the tomb of his father.

Their ruler, who may be justly termed the chief of the assassins resided on a lofty mountain, called Al\u0101hm\u016bd, and fate was in his hands; for there was no shape which his followers could not assume, no danger that they could not brave, to fulfil his mandates. These were the Isma'il\u012bs or assassins, well-known by the Crusaders, as subjects of the Old Man of the mountain.

His father Burh\u0101n Sh\u0101h, having received assistance from the emperor Akbar, marched against his son, but was defeated. However in a short time after this, he renewed his attempts, and being joined by a great majority of the chiefs and people, attacked Jam\u0101l Kh\u0101n the king's minister, who was killed in the action on the 27th April, 1590 O.S., 13th Rajab, 990 A.H.

S\u00e1mi\u00e1n, the great-grandfather of Isma'il, is termed, by European writers, a keeper of herds, and a robber; but this merely designates the occupation of a Tartar chief. His father Nasr Ahmad, the son of Asaf, the son of S\u00e1mi\u00e1n, was appointed governor of Mawaran Nahar by the Khalif Mo'tamid in the year 875 A.D., 261 A.H. On his death, his son Isma'il succeeded him, and, after his conquest over Amuri-bin-Lais, whom he seized and sent to Baghdad, in 900 A.D., became independent. The power of the dynasty of the S\u00e1mi\u00e1ns extended over Khuras\u00e1n, Seistan, Balkh and the countries of Transoxiana, including the cities of Bukhar\u00e1 and Samarqand.

His remains were transported to \u00c1grah, and buried on the left bank of the Jamna, where a splendid mausoleum was built over his relics by his daughter Nur Jah\u00e1n. It was completed in 1628 A.D., and is still in a high state of preservation. As is said, but it seems not to be true, that she intended to raise a monument of silver to his memory, but was reminded by her architect, that one of less covetable material stood a fairer chance of duration. After his death, his son 'Abdul Hasan was appointed Wazir with the title of 'Asaf Kh\u00e1n. No private family ever made such alliances with royal blood, as this Tartar; for, his own daughter, his son's daughter and the daughter of his grandson, were married to three successive emperors of Hindust\u00e1n; and another daughter of his grandson, to prince Mur\u00e1d Bakhsh, who disputed the throne with 'Alamgir, and for some days thought himself in possession of it. The place where he is buried, was a garden built by Itmad-uddaula during his lifetime. There are two tombs of yellow stone under the Rauza, one of which is of Itmad-uddaula and the other is said to be his wife's. It has a very large gate towards the east, built of red stone. It has two minars on both sides in the same number as there are two on the side of the Jamna towards the west.

He is said by some authors to have died at Sikr\u00ed in 1563 A.D., 971 A.H., but the author of the \"M\u00e1sir-ul-'Umra\" writes that his death took place in 1573 A.D., 981 A.H., and that K\u00e1sim Arsal\u00e1n found the chronogram of his death to be \"fakhariy\u00e1s.\" His eldest son Ghay\u00e1suddin '\u00c1li was also endowed with an excellent disposition, and served Akbar for a long period. In the 26th year of Akbar's reign, 1581 A.D., he was honored with the title of Nakib Kh\u00e1n, by which he is now best known. In the time of Jah\u00e1ngir he attained still further honors, and died at Ajmir in 1614 A.D., 1023\nA. II. He was buried there in a marble tomb within the area of Mo'in-ud-din Chishti's mausoleum, where his wife also lies buried by his side. Nakib Khan was one of the compilers of the first portion of the \"T\u0101r\u012bkh Al\u012b,\" and the translator of the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata,\" though this honour is usually ascribed to Faizi.

One of the most beautiful examples of female modesty to be found in the annals of woman is recorded of this princess, celebrated in song and history as the heroic, the witty, the generous, the elegant, the accomplished, and the beautiful Jahan Ara Begum. One night, (26th March, 1614 A.D., 27th Mu\u1e25arram, 1054 A.H.) as she was returning from her father's apartments to the harem, in one of the passages which connect the latter building with the body of the palace, her flowing drapery was unhappily ignited by the flame of a lamp. Her whole dress, which was of the finest muslin, was instantly in flames, and though her life was in imminent peril, but knowing that she was then within hearing of many young nobles of the court, she gave no sign of alarm, lest they should run to her assistance, and behold her unveiled or lay their hands upon her in order to extinguish the flames. Heroically enduring all the agonies which fire could inflict, she withheld her cries, and rushed forward until she reached the women's apartments, and there sunk upon the floor, almost lifeless. For a long period, no hopes were entertained of her recovery, but she was ultimately restored to health by an English physician named Dr. Boughton who was then at S\u00farat, and had been sent for by the emperor her father then in the Dakh\u00edn, although her beauty was cruelly impaired. The emperor, in reward for Dr. Boughton's services, besides other favours, granted him, at his disinterested request, a patent for his countrymen to trade free of customs throughout his dominions. The large Masjid of red stone adjoining the fort of Agra near the T\u00edp\u00fa (now demolished) was built by her in the year 1618 A.D., 1058 A.H., at a cost of five lacs of rupees. She died in the reign of her brother the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr on the 5th September, 1680 A.D., 3rd Ramaz\u00e1n, 1092 A.H., and lies buried in the yard of the mausoleum of Niz\u00e1m-udd\u00edn Aulia at Delhi. The name of Jahan Ara will ever adorn the pages of history as a bright example of filial attachment and heroic self-devotion to the dictates of duty, more especially when we view it in contrast with the behaviour of her sister Roshan Ara, who, by aiding the ambitious designs of Aurangz\u00e9b, enabled him to dethrone Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. The amiable and accomplished Jahan Ara not only supported her aged father in his adversity, but voluntarily resigned her liberty and resided with him during his imprisonment in the fort of Agrah. Her tomb is of white marble, open at the top, and at the head is a tablet with a Persian inscription inlaid in black marble letters, to the following effect: \"Let no one scatter over my grave anything but verdure, for such best becomes the sepulchre of one who had a humble mind.\" On the margin is written: \"The perishable fak\u00edr Jahan Ara Begum, daughter of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, and the disciple of the saints of Chisht\u00ed, died in the year of the Hijra, 1092 A.H.\"\n\nJahan Bano Begam, the daughter of Prince Mur\u00e1d, the son of the emperor Akbar. She was married to Prince Parwoz, the son of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, by whom she had Nadira Begam, who was married to Dara Sheko, the eldest son of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n.\n\nJahandar Shah, surnamed Muhammad Muizz-uddin, was the eldest son of the emperor Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, and grandson of 'Alamg\u00edr. He was born in the Dakh\u00edn on Wednesday the 8th April, 1663 A.D., 10th Ramaz\u00e1n, 1073 A.H. The death of his father, which took place in February, 1712 A.D., Mu\u1e25arram, 1124 A.H., was followed by the usual struggle among his sons for the crown. The incapacity of Jah\u00e1ndar Sh\u00e1h, the eldest, had given a great ascendancy to the second whose name was Azim-us-Sh\u00e1n. He was supported by most of the nobility and of the army, but his other brothers joined their interests, and were kept together by the persuasions and false promises of Zulfik\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n the Amir-\nJahandar Shah, Prince, the eldest son of the emperor Sh\u0101h '\u0100lam. In April, 1784 A.D., on account of the unsettled affairs of his father, he made his escape from Delhi and repaired to Lakhnau, where Mr. Hastings had arrived to regulate the concerns between the wazir, Asaf-uddaula, and the Company. He accompanied Mr. Hastings to Benares, which place he chose for his residence. He had an allowance of five lacs of rupees per annum from the Nawab wazir at the earnest request of Mr. Hastings. He died in Benares on the 1st of April, 1788 A.D., 25th Safar 1202 A.H., after an illness of little more than twenty-four hours; aged about 35 years, and was buried with every honour due to his rank near the tomb of a venerated Muhammedan in Benaras. The English Resident and principal people of the city attended his funeral. He left behind him three sons, whom, with the rest of his family, he recommended to the care of the English, under whom they still enjoy a comfortable asylum and allowance at Benaras. Gar\u00e7in-de-Tassy informs us, that there is a work of his in the India House, which has the title of \"Bay\u00e1z Inayet Murshidzada.\" He is also called Mirz\u00e1 Jawan Bakht, and his poetical title is Jah\u00e1nd\u00e1r. The narrative written by this prince, was translated by Mr. Scott, and published in the appendix to Mr. Hastings' Review of the state of Bengal.\n\nJahangir, (emperor) surnamed N\u016br-udd\u012bn Muhammad, was the eldest son of the emperor Akbar the Great; was born in the village of Sikri on Wednesday the 31st of August, 1569 A.D., 17th Rabi' I, 977 A.H., and was named Mirz\u00e1 Salim on account of his coming into the world, as supposed, by the prayers of Shaikh Sulim Chishti, a venerable Shaikh and dervish who resided in the village of Sikri, now called Fathapur Sikri, in the province of Agra. His mother, who received the title of Mariam Zamman, was the daughter of Nasir Dihk\u00e1zi, the Kachhwah\u00e1. After the death of his mother, which took place on the 16th of October, 1605 A.D., he succeeded him by the title of N\u016br-udd\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. He reigned 22 lunar years, 8 months and 15 days from the day of his father's demise, and died in camp on Sunday the 28th of October, 1627, A.D., 28th Safar, 1037 A.H., on his way to L\u0101h\u016br from Kashmir, aged 59 lunar years, 11 months and 12 days; and was interred in the suburbs of L\u0101h\u016br in the garden of his favourite wife N\u016br Jah\u00e1n Begam. He was succeeded by his son Mirz\u00e1 Khurram, who took the title of Sh\u0101h Jah\u00e1n. His favourite Sult\u0101na N\u016br Jah\u00e1n, who survived him 18 years, is also buried in the same mausoleum. Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, after his death, received the title of \"Jannat M\u0101k\u0101n\u012b.\" It was to this prince that Sir Thomas Roe was sent as ambassador by King James I. Sir Thomas has given a good description of the grandeur of the court of Hindust\u00e1n; but very little notice is taken of the embassy in the chronicles of the East. In 1612, Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr permitted the Company to establish factories at S\u016brat, Ahmad\u00e1b\u0101d, and Calcutta. Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr wrote his own Memoir in Persian, called \"Tuzak Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr\u012b\" which has been translated by Major David Price, London, 1829, 184 pages 4to. It is also called Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr N\u00e1ma.\n\nJahangir Kuli Khan, Kabuli, \u062c\u06c1\u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0631 \u06a9\u0648\u0644\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0627\u0628\u0644\u06cc, an am\u012br of the rank of 5000, who was appointed governor of Bengal by the emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr in 1607 A.D., 1016 A.H., and died there in 1608 A.D., 1017 A.H.\n\nJahangir, \u062c\u06c1\u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0631, a cousin and husband of Sikandar Begam of Bhopal.

He held it till the death of that prince in 1447 A.D., 850 A.H., after which he conquered most part of Persia, and carried his arms as far as Day\u00e1rbik\u00e1r, and fell in a battle which he fought against Hasan Beg, commonly called Uzz\u00e1s Hasan, the ruler of that province, on the 10th of November, 1467 A.D., 12th Rabi' II, 872 A.H., aged 70 years. He reigned more than 30 lunar years, and as he was slain in battle against Hasan Beg, the chronogram of the year of his death was found to contain the words \"Slain by Hasan Beg.\"\nJahan Shah, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646, (prince) the third son of the emperor Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h.

The present city of Joannpur was built by F\u00edr\u00fas Sh\u00e1h in the year 1570 A.D., 1712 A.H., in the name of his uncle P\u00e1sh\u00e1 Sh\u00e1h Muhammad J\u00e9r\u00e1n, the date of which is found in the words \"Sh\u00e1h Joannpur.\" According to Colonel Tod, Jaichand reigned about the 12th century of the Christian era, and one of his grandsons named Scoff, with a few retainers, planted the R\u00e1th\u00f3r standard in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r in the year 1212 A.D.\n\nJai Chand, \u0631\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u062c\u0646\u062f, a r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Nagarkot or K\u00e1ngra, who lived in the time of the emperor Akbar.\n\nJaikishun, \u06a9\u0634\u0648\u0646, a Kashmiri Br\u00e1hman whose poetical name was 'Izzat, was the agent of Naw\u00e1b Is-h\u00e1k Kh\u00e1n.\n\nJaimal, \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644, a r\u00e1j\u00e1, famous in history as \"the bravest of the brave.\" In 1568 A.D. Ud\u00e1l Singh, the son of Rana Sanka or Sanga, and the founder of the capital Udaipur in Chitt\u00f3r, came under the displeasure of the emperor Akbar.

He was once defeated by Subakt\u00e1g\u00edn, the Sult\u00e1n of Ghazn\u00ed, with great slaughter, and again on Monday the 27th November, 1001 A.D. by his son Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad, when Jaip\u00e1l with fifteen of his principal chiefs, being his sons and brethren, were taken prisoners, and 5000 of his troops were slain on the field of battle. He was afterwards released by Mahm\u00fad, but in compliance with a custom which prevailed among the Hind\u00fas, that whatever r\u00e1j\u00e1 was twice overpowered by strangers, became disqualified to reign, he ordered a funeral pile to be prepared, and having set fire to it with his own hands, perished therein. He was succeeded by his son Anandp\u00e1l.\n\nJaipal II, \u062c\u06cc\u067e\u0627\u0644 \u062f\u0648\u0645, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of L\u00e1h\u00f3r, son of Anandp\u00e1l whom he succeeded in 1013 A.D. He was routed in a great battle by Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad in 1022 A.D. on the banks of the river R\u00e1v\u00ed, the result was the permanent occupation of L\u00e1h\u00f3r by a Muhammadan governor, and the appointment of a Viceroy of L\u00e1h\u00f3r by Mahm\u00fad. This was the foundation of the Muhammadan empire in India.\n\nJai Singh I, \u0631\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u062c\u06cc \u0633\u06cc\u0646\u06af \u0627\u0648\u0644, (r\u00e1j\u00e1) of the tribe of Kachhw\u00e1h\u00e1, commonly called Mirz\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1, was the son of r\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1h\u00e1 Singh, the son of Part\u00e1v Singh, the son of r\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Singh. He served under the emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, and was made governor over the conquered provinces of the Dakh\u00edn about the year 1664 A.D. by the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr. He was recalled to court in 1666 A.D., but died on the road, soon after his arrival at Burh\u00e1npur, 28th Muhrarram 1078 A.H. According to Orme's Historical Fragments of the Maghul Empire, Jai Singh died at Burh\u00e1npur soon after the pretended revolt of Sult\u00e1n Muazzim the son of the emperor, and seems to have been poisoned by the procurement of 'Alamg\u00edr. There never was a prince among the r\u00e1jputs equal to him in accomplishments. He was completely learned in Hindi, and understood the Turkish, Persian, and Arabic languages. He left two sons, R\u00e1m Singh his eldest, and Kir\u00e1t Singh. The former was honoured after his father's death with the title of r\u00e1j\u00e1, and put in possession of his father's territories. Jai Singh had built several fine edifices at Agra of which no sign remains now, but the name and place on which the buildings stood is still called Jaisinghpura.\n\nJai Singh II, Saw\u00e1i, \u0633\u0648\u0626\u06cc, a r\u00e1j\u00e1 of the tribe of Kachhw\u00e1h\u00e1 r\u00e1jputs, was the son of Bishun Singh, the son of Kishun Singh, the son of R\u00e1m Singh, the son of Mirz\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Singh. He is commonly called Mirz\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Singh Saw\u00e1i. He was the zamind\u00e1r or r\u00e1j\u00e1 of a considerable territory in the province of Ajmir named Amer, but since the prince's founding a new city called Jaipur, the r\u00e1j\u00e1ship has also taken that name. Bishun Singh, the father of Jai Singh and Bij\u00e1j Singh, died about the year 1693 A.D., Sambat 1750, and after his death the title of r\u00e1j\u00e1 was bestowed on Jai Singh by the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr with the rank of 1500, and subsequently with that of 2000. After the death of that emperor, he espoused the cause of Azim Sh\u00e1h, the son of 'Alamg\u00edr, whilst his brother Bij\u00e1j Singh aided Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, who on his accession to the throne confirmed the rank of 2000 on the latter. Bij\u00e1j Singh quarrelled with his brother for the r\u00e1j\u00e1ship, and neither being willing to displace either, confiscated their estate, and appointed Sayyad Husain Ali Kh\u00e1n of B\u00e1h\u00e1, as Fa\u00fajd\u00e1r of that place. When the emperor marched to the Dakh\u00edn to punish his brother K\u00e1m\u00edbksh\u00e1h, 1708 A.D., 1120 A.H., Jai Singh, with the aid of r\u00e1j\u00e1 Aj\u00edt Singh R\u00e1th\u00f3r, engaged the Fa\u00fajd\u00e1r in battle and having killed him took possession of the province. In the reign of Farrukh-siy\u00e1r he was honoured with the title of Dh\u00edr\u00faj\u00ed R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Singh, and in the time of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, with that of Saw\u00e1i. In the year 1732 A.D., 1145 A.H., he was appointed governor of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. His love of science makes him one of the most remarkable persons of his nation. He built five observatories for astronomical studies, namely, at D\u00e9hl\u00ed, Banaras, Mathr\u00e1, Ujain and Jaipur, and published a work on astronomy called \"Zij Muhammed Sh\u00e1h\u00ed.\" He also erected a Karav\u00e1nsarai and market in every province of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n for the convenience of travellers at his own expense. After his death, which took place in September, 1743 A.D., 9th Sh\u00e1b\u00e1n, 1156 A.H., three of his wives with many concubines burned themselves on his funeral pile.

He is said to be the author of 400 works, amongst which are the commentary on the \"Durr-al-Munshir,\" and the last half of the \"Tafs\u012br Jalalain,\" the author of the other half was Jalaluddin Mahali who died in 1450 A.D., 854 A.H. Another work of Sayuti is called \"Lubb-ul-Lubab.\" It is a dictionary of patronymic names, and of others under which the Arabic authors are much more frequently quoted than under their proper names. The confusion under which the Arabs labour to identify men known under different names, has induced them to prepare dictionaries for obviating this difficulty. S\u0101m\u0101ni (or Sam\u0101n\u012b) in the sixth century of the Hijra published one, entitled, \"Fil Ans\u0101b,\" in which he does not only explain the sense and origin of these names, but also mentions with regard to every word the true names of the authors who have had them. This work was abbreviated in the succeeding century by Ibn-ul-Asir, and this extract shortened by Sayuti. There is another work of Sayuti called \"Fut\u016bhul-Sal\u0101t-un-Wasfuz Zalzala,\" containing an account of all the earthquakes which took place from the year 713 A.D., 94 A.H., to his time. He wrote this work on the subject of earthquakes in Egypt, with a view of shewing to his countrymen that earthquakes are ordained by God to punish men for their sins. This work was translated from the Arabic by A. Sprenger, Esq., M.D. Vide Journal, Asiatic Society, Vol. XVII., Part II., p. 741.

It is related that the emperor had ordered that all the ladies at court should provide precious stones, and bring them to a market-place that he had erected, and there shew their wares publicly to all the noblemen at court, who were ordered to buy them at whatever prices the ladies put upon them; and that the king himself was to be a buyer, to put the greater honour on the new erected market. The ladies obeyed, and took their booths, as they thought fit. On the market day, the king and the noblemen came to market, and bought the jewels and other trifles the ladies had to dispose of. The king coming to the booth of a very pretty lady, asked her what she had to sell. She told him she had one large fine rough diamond still to dispose of. He desired to see it, and he found it to be a piece of fine transparent sugar-candy of a tolerable diamond figure. He demanded to know what price she set on it, and she told him with a pleasant air, that it was worth a lakh of rupees, or \u00a312,500 sterling. He ordered the money to be paid, and, falling into discourse with her, found her wit was as exquisite as her beauty, and ordered her to sup with him that night in his palace. She accordingly went and stayed with him three nights and days, and then went back to her husband, whose name was Jam\u0101l Kh\u0101n. The husband received her very coldly, and told her that he would continue civil to her, but would never live with her again but in the same manner as if she was his sister. Upon which she went to the palace, fell at the emperor's feet, and told him what her husband had said. The king in a rage gave orders to carry her husband to the elephant garden, and there put him to death by an elephant. The poor man was soon apprehended, and as they dragged him from his house, he begged to have leave to speak to the king. A friend of his ordered the messengers of death to stop awhile, till he had acquainted the king with the request, which was accordingly done, and he was ordered to be carried into the court of the palace, that the king might hear what he had to say; and being carried thither, the king demanded what he would have. He answered, that what he had said to his wife was the greatest honour which he was capable of doing his king, because, after he had honoured his wife with his embraces, he thought himself unworthy ever after to cohabit with her. The king, after pausing a little, ordered him to be unbound, and brought to his own room, where, as soon as he came, the king embraced him, and ordered a royal suit to be put upon him, and gave him command of five thousand horse more, but took his wife into his own harem.\u2014Asiatic Journal, Vol. XXX., p. 215.\n\nJamal-uddin Ahmad, Shaikh, \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0634\u064a\u062e, a celebrated Muhammadan saint of Hansi, and grandfather of Shaikh Kutb-uddin Manawwar.\n\nJamal-uddin Ataullah, Amir, \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0637\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631, nephew of Sayyad Asif-uddin 'Abdullah.

Even princes, who were themselves men of erudition and excellent talents, have lavished upon him the most unbounded praises and the highest honours.

He is celebrated as the founder of Persepolis, which is to this day called Istakhr and Takht Jamshed. He introduced the solar year and ordered the first day of it, when the sun entered Aries, to be celebrated by a splendid festival. His country was invaded by Zuh\u0101k, a Syrian king, and the unfortunate Jamshed was obliged to fly before the conqueror. He was pursued by the agents of Zuh\u0101k, through S\u012bst\u0101n, India, and China, and was at last seized and carried before his cruel enemy like a common malefactor, who ordered him to be placed between two boards and sawn asunder with the bone of a fish.

A translation of part of it may be found in Sir William Jones's Second Volume of the Asiatic Researches. The author was a Jewish Rabbi, contemporary and opponent of Muhammad, and had written some satirical verses upon him; but afterwards being desirous of a reconciliation with the prophet, he wrote the above poem, which had the desired effect. Some authors say that he died in the first year of the Hijra, that is, 622 A.D., 1 A.H. But, according to Ockley's History of the Saracens, \"Ka'b came in the ninth year of the Hijra, and made his peace with Muhammad, with a poem in his praise.\" By this it appears that he was living in 631 A.D.

Kabir was a S\u00fafi or Deist of the most exalted sentiments and of benevolence unbounded. His poems which are still universally esteemed, inculcate the purest morality, good will and hospitality towards all men; and breathe so fine a spirit of toleration, that both Hind\u00fas and Musalm\u00e1ns contend for the honour of his having been born of their religion. From the disinterested, yet alluring, doctrines his poems contain, a sect has sprung up in Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, under the name of Kabir Panthi, who are so universally esteemed for veracity, and other virtues, among both Hind\u00fas and Musalm\u00e1ns, that they may be with propriety considered the Quakers of this country. The time of Kabir's death seems involved in equal obscurity with the manner of his decease and burial. They relate that he lived a long time at K\u00e1s\u00ed (Ben\u00e1ras) and Gay\u00e1, and sojourned also at Jagarn\u00e1th, where he gave great offence to the Br\u00e1hmans, by his conduct and tolerant doctrine.

He succeeded his brother about the year 1259 A.D., 655 A.H., and founded the Yuen dynasty in China. Being ordered by his brother Mang\u00fa, then Khakan of the Mongols, to subjugate Corea and China, he entered China with an immense army in 1260 A.D., drove out the Tartars of the Kin dynasty and took possession of North China. In 1279 he completed the ruin of the Song dynasty by invading and subduing Southern China so that his dominion now extended from the Frozen Ocean to the Straits of Malacca and from Corea to Asia Minor\u2014an extent of territory, the like of which had never before, and has never since, been governed by any one monarch. The rule of the Mughuls, hitherto severe and barbarous, changed its character in the reign of this prince, who adopted entirely the manners of the Chinese, and who is regarded, even by that people, as one of the best and most illustrious of their emperors.

He was vain and proud; and appears to have been in continual distress from the unfortunate result of schemes that his ambition led him to form, but which he wanted ability to execute. His life is connected with a thousand fables, which though improper in this place, form excellent materials for Ferdousi, who has given, in his history of this period, the extraordinary and affecting tale of the combat between Rustam and his unknown son, Suhrah, who is killed by his father. This part of the Shah-nama has been beautifully translated in English verse by J. Atkinson, Esq., Assistant Surgeon on the Bengal Establishment, and member of the Asiatic Society in 1814. Kaikaus when grown old, resigned his crown in favour of his grandson Kaikhusro, the son of Siawakhsh.\n\nKaikaus, Amir, grandson of Kaikus, prince of Jurjan, and one of the noblemen who lived at the court.\nKaikhosro, the third king of the Kayanian dynasty of Persia and the grandson of Kaik\u00e1\u00fcs. He ascended the throne in the lifetime of his father who resigned the crown in his favour. He had several battles with Afrasi\u00e1b the king of T\u00far\u00e1n, who was at last defeated, taken prisoner, and slain. Soon after these events Kaikhosro resolved to devote the remainder of his life to religious retirement; he delivered over Kabul, Buzulistan and Nimroz to Rustam, as hereditary possessions; and resigned his throne to Luhrisp the son-in-law of Kaik\u00e1\u00fcs and his own son by adoption and affection. After these arrangements, he went accompanied by some nobles to a spring which he had fixed upon as the place of his repose. Here he disappeared, and all those that went with him were destroyed on their return by a violent tempest. He lived 90 years and reigned 60.\n\nKaikhosro, the son of Sult\u00e1n Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, governor of Mult\u00e1n, who was the eldest son of Sult\u00e1n Ghay\u00e1s-udd\u00edn Balban, king of Dchl\u00ed. After his father's death in 1285 A.D., he was made governor of Mult\u00e1n by his grandfather, and after his decease in 1286 A.D., was murdered at Rohtak by Malik Niz\u00e1m-udd\u00edn, wazir of Kaikub\u00e1d who ascended the throne as king of Delhi.\n\nKaikubad, the founder of the second or Kayanian dynasty of the kings of Persia, was a lineal descendant of Man\u00fachehr, according to some accounts he was his great-grandson. This prince had retired to the mountain of Alburz, from which place he was brought by Rustam the son of Z\u00e1l and proclaimed king of Persia. He committed the administration of government into the hands of Z\u00e1l, whose son Rustam, was appointed to lead the Persians against the dreaded Afrasi\u00e1b who had again passed the Oxus and invaded Persia. In this battle, Rustam overcame Afrasi\u00e1b, and afterwards a peace was concluded, by which it was agreed that the Oxus should remain as it had been hitherto, the boundary between the two kingdoms. Kaikubad lived some time after this in peace; he is said to have reigned 120 years. He left four sons: Kaik\u00e1\u00fcs, Arish, Rum and Armen. To the former he bequeathed his throne, and enjoined all the others to obey him.\n\nList of kings of the second or Kayanian dynasty.\n\n1. Kaikubad.\n2. Kaik\u00e1\u00fcs.\n3.

In the year 1287 A.D., 686 A.H., his father having heard the state of affairs at Dchl\u00ed, marched from Bengal to visit and advise his son. They met on the banks of the Gh\u00e1gra at Beh\u00e1r, and the whole scene was so affecting, that almost all the court shed tears. On this occasion the celebrated poet Amir Khusro wrote the poem called the \"Kir\u00e1n-us-Sadain,\" or the conjunction of the two planets. Kaikubad was assassinated through the instigation of Fir\u00f3z Malik Khilj\u00ed in 1288 A.D., who ascended the throne by the title of Jal\u00e1l-udd\u00edn Fir\u00f3z Shah Khilji, and became the first Sult\u00e1n of the 2nd branch of the Turk dynasty called Khilji.\n\nKaiomurs, the first monarch of Persia according to all Muhammadan writers. This king is stated to have reclaimed his subjects from a state of the most savage barbarity. They say he was the grandson of Noah, and the founder of the first dynasty of Persian kings called Pishd\u00e1dian. His son Si\u00e1mak was killed in one of the battles with the barbarians or Devs; and when that monarch carried Hoshang, the infant son of Si\u00e1mak, to share in the revenge he meant to take upon his enemies, his army was joined by all the lions, tigers and panthers in his dominions, and the Devs were routed and torn to pieces by the auxiliaries, who had left their native forest to aid the just king. After this victory, Kaiomurs retired to his capital Balkh. He reigned 30 years, and was succeeded by his grandson Hoshang.\n\nThe following is a list of kings of the first or Pishdadian dynasty.\n\n1. Kaiomurs.\n2. Hoshang.\n3. Tuhmurs, surmamed Deoband.\n4.

The author of the work, the Pandit Kalhan\u00e1, of whom we merely know that he was the son of Champaka, and lived about 1150 A.D., under the reign of Si\u00f1ha Deva of Kashmir\u2014reports that before entering on his task, he had studied eleven historical works written previously to his time, and also a history of Kashmir by the sage Nila, which seems to be the oldest of all. Kalhan\u00e1 begins his work, with the mythological history of the country, the first king named by him is Gonarda, who, according to his chronology, would have reigned in the year 2448 B.C., and the last mentioned by him is Si\u00f1ha Deva, about 1150 after Christ.\n\nKali Das, a celebrated Hind\u00fa poet who lived towards the commencement of the Christian era. He was one of the nine splendid gems that adorned the court of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bikarm\u00e1jit (Vikramaditya). Some say that he flourished in the time of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bh\u00f3j. He wrote the \"Nalod\u00eda\" for the purpose of exhibiting his unbounded skill in alliteration. In four books, containing on the average fifty-four stanzas each, he has given such illustrations of their subject as can never be surpassed. This work has been published in Europe, with a Latin translation by a continental scholar, Ferdinandus Benary. No reason can be imagined, why K\u00e1l\u00ed D\u00e1s should again write the history of Nala and Damayanti, after it had been so elegantly written in flowing verse by Vy\u00e1sa Deva, except that he intended in this simple story to shew forth his ingenuity in alliteration. He is also the author of the poem called \"Kum\u00e1ra Sambhava,\" and of another called \"Maha N\u00e1r\u00e1k.\"\n\nKali Sahib, surname of Ghul\u00e1m Nasir-uddin, the son of Maul\u00e1n\u00e1 Kutb-uddin, the son of Maul\u00e1n\u00e1 Fakhr-uddin.

He died in 1800 A.D., 1215 A.H., and the chronogram of the Hijri year of his death is contained in the word Daregh\u00e1.\n\nKamal Ghayas, Maulana, of Sh\u00e9r\u00e1z, a poet and physician who flourished in the time of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sult\u00e1n.\n\nKamal Khan, G\u00edkh\u00e1r, prince of the G\u00edkhars, was the son of Sultan S\u00e1rang, the son of Malik Kal\u00e1n II, the son of Malik Kal\u00e1n I, the son of Malik Khar, who was the founder of the principality of the G\u00edkhars.

He was, however, after some years released by Sal\u00edm Sh\u00e1h the son of Sher Sh\u00e1h, but during his confinement, his uncle Sult\u00e1n \u00c1dam had taken possession of the country. In the first year of the reign of Akbar he was introduced to that monarch and was employed in his service. He by degrees rose to the rank of 5000, and was afterwards put in possession of his dominions by that emperor, and Sult\u00e1n \u00c1dam his uncle taken prisoner and made over to Kam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n who put him in confinement where he died.

He is commonly called Kam\u00e1l Khujandi, born Khujand, a town situated in one of the most beautiful and fertile districts of Persia. After having made the pilgrimage to Mecca, he settled at Tabrez, a place where he found extremely agreeable during the reign of the princes of the family of Jal\u00e1yer. The principal personages of Tabrez became his pupils, and he led a life of literary ease and enjoyment; but when Tuktamish Kh\u00e1n surprised Tabrez, Shaikh Kam\u00e1l was made prisoner, and was carried to Serai in Kapj\u00e1k by order of Mang\u00fa Kh\u00e1n the grandson of Chang\u00e9z Kh\u00e1n, where he remained four years, after which he was permitted to return to Tabrez, near which city the Sultan Awes Jal\u00e1yer built him a house.

He collected an army chiefly composed of the different tribes of Zand and Maff\u00ed, defeated the Afgh\u00e1ns in several engagements, finally drove them out of the country, and secured to himself the kingdom of F\u00e1rs, or the southern division of Persia, while Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n partially remained in possession of the descendants of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h; and the countries bordering on the Caspian Sea were retained by Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24asan Kh\u00e1n K\u00e1ch\u00e1r, ruler of M\u00e1zdar\u00e1n the great-grandfather of \u2019Ak\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h K\u00e1ch\u00e1r. Karim Kh\u00e1n, after subduing his enemies, obtained independent power for twenty-six years; and during the last twenty, viz., from 1759 to 1779, he had been, without a competitor, the acknowledged ruler of Persia.

He came from Kh\u00f3z\u00edst\u00e1n to the villages near K\u00e1f\u00e1, and there pretended great sanctity and strictness of life, and that God had enjoined him to pray fifty times a day; pretending also to invite people to the obedience of a certain Im\u00e1m of the family of Mu\u1e25ammad; and this way of life he continued till he had made a very great party, out of whom he chose twelve apostles to govern the rest, and to propagate his doctrines. Afterwards his courage failing him, he retired to Syria, and was never heard of any more. This sect began in the Khil\u00e1f\u00e1t of Al-Mo\u2019tam\u00edd; they multiplied greatly in Arabian Ir\u00e1k or Chalde\u00e1, and maintained perpetual wars against the Khil\u00e1f\u00ed. In the year 931 A.D., they besieged and took the city of Mecca, filled the well Zamzam with dead bodies, defiled and plundered the temple and carried away the black stone; but they brought it again in 950 A.D., and fastened it to the seventh pillar of the portico, giving out, that they had both taken it away, and brought it back again, by express order from heaven.

The English, deceived by his elegance of manners, and convinced of his skill in the finances of Bengal, raised him to the masnad in the room of his father-in-law in 1760 A.D., 1174 A.H. He, in the latter years of his government, retired to Munger, and actuated by a keen resentment against the English, for their extensive encroachments on his authority, and the commerce of his country, formed the plan of throwing off their yoke, and annihilating their influence in Bengal; but was deposed and defeated, in a battle fought on the Odwa Nala on the 2nd August, 1763 A.D., 22nd Muharram, 1177 A.H., and the deposed Nawab Ja'far Ali Khan was again placed on the masnad. Kasim Ali, incensed to madness at these reverses, fled to Patna from Munger, and there cruelly ordered the massacre of the English in his power: there were 50 gentlemen, Messrs. Ellis, Hay, Lushington, and others, and 100 of lower rank. On the 5th October, they were brought out in parties, and barbarously cut to pieces, or shot under the direction of a German, named Samru or Sombre. Munger fell to the English early in October; Patna was stormed on the 6th November, and the Ex-Nawab Kasim Ali fled to the wazir of Audh, with his treasures, and the remnant of his army. On the 23rd of October, 1764 A.D., Major Carnac fought the celebrated battle of Buxar, completely routing the wazir Shuja-uddaula's army. The following day the Moghul emperor Shah Alam threw himself on the protection of the British, and joined their camp with the imperial standard of Hindustan. The British army advanced to overrun Audh. The wazir refused to deliver up Kasim Ali, though he had seized and plundered him. Kasim Ali made his escape at first into the Rohela country, with a few friends and some jewels, which he had saved from the fangs of his late ally, the wazir, and found a comfortable asylum in that country; but his intrigues rendered him disagreeable to the chief under whose protection he resided, he was obliged to leave it, and took shelter with the Rana of Gohad. After some years' residence in his country, he proceeded to Jodhpur, and from thence came to try his fortune in the service of the emperor Shah Alam during the year 1771 A.D., 1188 A.H., but was disappointed, and died shortly after in 1777 A.D., 1191 A.H., at Kotwal an obscure village near Delhi, unmindful even by his own family. With Kasim Ali ended, virtually, the powers of the Subadars of Bengal.\n\nKasim Ali Khan, Nawab, \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0642\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0646, uncle to the nawab of Rampur.

He was born at Tabrez; and was a member of a considerable family of the tribe of Sayyad, descended from the same stock as the Prophet. In his youth he dedicated himself, under the guidance of Shaikh Sadr-uddin Musa Ardibil, to the contemplative life and deep study of the Sufis. He then journeyed to Gilan, where he soon acquired great fame; and subsequently went into Khurasan. During his residence at Hiraat, he obtained such celebrity, and was surrounded by so many princes and learned men, his followers, that Mirza Shahrukh (the son of Amir Timur), moved by jealousy of the Sayyad, and attentive to the danger of the increase of the Sufi creed, commanded him to retire from the capital. In order to mitigate the harshness of this command, Baisanghar, the son of Shahrukh, a learned and noble prince, took upon himself to make it known to the Sayyad, which he did in the most humane manner, inquiring of him, in the course of conversation, why he did not follow the counsel contained in his own verse. The Sayyad inquires in which verse, and Baisanghar immediately quoted the following:\u2014\n\n\"Kasim cease at once thy lay;\nRise and take thy onward way;\nOther lands have waited long,\nWorthy thy immortal song:\nGive the bird of paradise\nWhat the vulture cannot prize;\nHoney let thy friends receive,\nTo thy feet the carrion leave.\"\n\nThe Sayyad thanked him and immediately set out for Balkh and Samarqand, where he remained for a time. He afterwards, however, returned to Hiraat, where as before, he was constantly followed by great and powerful men. His death occurred in the village of Kharjard in Jam near Hiraat, where a garden had been bought for him by his disciples, in which he greatly delighted. This event took place in the year 1431 A.D., 855 A.H., and his tomb was erected in the very garden which he so much enjoyed. Amir Alisher afterwards plentifully endowed it.

He espoused the cause of 'Az\u00edm Sh\u00e1h against his brother Bah\u00e1d\u00far Sh\u00e1h, and died of his wounds a few days after the battle in June, 1707 A.D., 1119 A.H.\n\nKhudyja, \u062e\u062f\u06cc\u062c\u0647, or Khad\u00edja, the first wife of Muham-mad. She was a widow and dealt in merchandise. She had employed Muham-mad for some time to drive her camels, and afterwards married him. Muham-mad had several children by her, but all of them died young, excepting three daughters, one of whom was F\u00e1tima, who was married to 'Al\u00ed. After her marriage with Muham-mad she lived 22 years, and died at Mecca three years before the commencement of the Hijr\u00ed era, and three days after the death of Ab\u00fa T\u00e1lib the father of 'Al\u00ed, and uncle of Muham-mad, in August, 619 A.D., aged 62 lunar years. Mr. Burckhardt informs us that the tomb of Khudyja is still remaining, and is regularly visited by pilgrims. It is enclosed by a square wall, and presents no objects of curiosity except the tombstone, which has a fine inscription in Kufic characters, containing a passage from the Kur\u00e1n, from the chapter entitled, \"S\u00farat-ul-Kursi\".\n\nKhurd\u00e1dbih, \u062e\u0631\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0628\u06cc\u0647, or Ibn-Khurd\u00e1zb\u00ed, surname of Ab\u00fa'l Kasim 'Ulaid-illah bin-Abdul (or 'Abdullah) Ibn-Khurd\u00e1zb\u00ed. This author has been the object of considerable controversies among the orientalists of Europe. Khurd\u00e1zb\u00ed (the grandfather of our author) was a magian, and was converted to Islam by the Bar-makides. Ab\u00fa'l Kasim (our author) was consequently appointed over the post and intelligence department in the provinces belonging to the Jab\u00e1l (mountain); subsequently he came to the court of the Khalifa Mo'tamid, and became one of his privy counsellors. He is the author of several works, among which are\u20141, \"Kit\u00e1b Adab-us-Sam\u00e1,\" (from which Masi'd\u00fafi gives a very interesting extract in his life of Mo'tamid); 2, \"Kit\u00e1b Jamh\u00far Ans\u00e1bul-ul-Fars\" containing the most celebrated Genealogies of the Persians; 3, \"Kit\u00e1b-al-Mas\u00e1l\u00edk-wal-Mun\u00e1d\u00edk,\" a geographical work on the roads and kingdoms; 4, \"Kit\u00e1b-al-Sh\u00e1ris,\" on drink; 5, \"Kit\u00e1b-ul-Lahwwal-Mal\u00e1h,\" on playing and amusements; 6, \"Kit\u00e1b-al-Al\u00e1h\u00e1\" on the stars, and 7, \"Kit\u00e1b-ul-Nud\u00e1m\u00e1-wal-Jul\u00e1s\" on courtiers and companions. The Geography of Ibn-Khurd\u00e1zb\u00ed, says Sir H.M. Elliot, is the only work which we possess of this author, and of this there is only one copy in Europe. The MS. in question is ancient, bearing the date of 1232 A.D., 630 A.H., but it wants in most instances the diacritical points. It is preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, No. 993. Ibn-Khurd\u00e1zb\u00ed died about the year 912 A.D., 300 A.H.\n\nKhurram Bakht, Mirza, \u0645\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u062e\u0631\u0645 \u0628\u062e\u062a, the son of Mirz\u00e1 Jah\u00e1nd\u00e1r Sh\u00e1h, the son of Sh\u00e1h 'Alam, king of Dehl\u00ed.\n\nKhurram Begam, \u062e\u0631\u0645 \u0628\u06cc\u06af\u0645, the wife of Mirz\u00e1 Sulai-m\u00e1n Bad\u00e1jksh\u00ed.\n\nKhurram, Mirza, \u0645\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u062e\u0631\u0645, original name of the emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n before he came to the throne.

His father Amir Mahm\u00fad Saif-udd\u00edn, a Turk of the tribe of L\u00e1ch\u00edn, came from Balkh to India and fixed his residence at Pat\u00e1l\u00e1 where Khusro was born in the year 1253 A.D., 651 A.H. Khusro died six months after the death of N\u00edz\u00e1m-udd\u00edn Aulia, who was his spiritual guide, and was buried close to his tomb at Gh\u00e1y\u00e1sipur in old Dehl\u00ed. His death happened in September, 1325 A.D., Ram\u00e1z\u00e1n, 725 A.H. Khusro unfortunately lived at a period, says Sir H.M. Elliot, when vice was triumphant throughout Hind\u00fast\u00e1n. He, however, had the happiness, during the last few years of his life, to see a just prince, Gh\u00e1y\u00e1s-udd\u00edn Tughl\u00e1k, on the throne whose virtues he has commemorated in his history, called \"Tughl\u00e1k-n\u00e1ma,\" and whom he survived but a few months. The following beautiful poems are particularly admired by his countrymen; and in fact they rival those of the most esteemed poets of Persia.\n\n1. Tuhfat-ul-Saghir. 5. Hasht Bahisht.\n2. Shatt-ul-Hay\u00e1t. 6. Sikandar-n\u00e1ma.\n3. Ghurrat-ul-Kam\u00e1l. 7. Risala Nasr.\n4. Ba\u0161\u00e1 N\u00e1ki\u00e1.\n\nBesides these there are several other poems, viz., \"Nuh Siphr,\" or the nine spheres, a beautiful mystical poem; the \"Kir\u00e1n-us-S\u00e1dy\u00e9n\" or the auspicious conjunction, a poem in praise of Sult\u00e1n Mu'izz-udd\u00edn Kaikub\u00e1d, king of Dehl\u00ed, and his father N\u00e1s\u00edr-udd\u00edn Baghra Kh\u00e1n, king of\nKhusro\n\nBengal, who came to visit him. The \"Mak\u0101la\" containing memoirs of the first four Khal\u012bf\u0101s, viz., Ab\u016b Bakr, 'Umar, Usm\u0101n and 'Al\u012b, with a treatise on the Sufi tenets, written in 1324 A.D., the \"Ishk\u0101,\" a collection of poems on love subjects, the \"Math\u0101-ul-Anwar,\" on the Sufi doctrines, and his Div\u0101n, which is held in great estimation in India, containing poems chiefly on mystical theology and divine love; many of them have been set to music, and are chanted by the devotees or S\u016bf\u012bs; frequently producing extravagant ecstasies, termed by them wuj\u016bd, or spiritual delirium. The Khamsa or the five celebrated books of Amir Khusro, which contains about 18,000 verses, are the following:\n\n1. Hasht Bahisht.\n2. Sikandar-n\u0101ma.\n3. Panj Ganj.\n4. Laili-wa-Majn\u016bn.\n5. Shifin-wa-Khusro.\n\nKhusro is said to have written 99 books, some of which, besides the abovementioned, are the following:\n\n1. Ajiz Khusrowi.\n2. Ain-e-Sikandari.\n3. Khizir Khani.\n4. Insh\u0101' Amir Khusro.\n5. Jaw\u0101hir-ul-Bahr.\n\nKhusro Malik, son of Khusro Shah, was the last Sultan of the race of Ghaznavides. He ascended the throne at L\u0101hor after the death of his father in 1160 A.D., 555 A.H., was defeated in 1184 A.D., 580 A.H., by Shah\u0101bul-din Ghor\u012b, then governor of Ghazn\u012b, who took him prisoner and sent him to his brother Ghay\u0101suddin to Fir\u014dz K\u014dh, where he died after some years.\n\nKhusro Malik, the brother-in-law of Sultan Muhammad Shah I, Tughlak, whose sister named Khuddwandzida he had married. He had once formed the project of taking the life of Sultan Fir\u014dz Shah the successor of Muhammad Shah, by concealing a number of persons in the rooms adjacent to where the king sat, but was saved by D\u0101war Malik, the son of Khusro Malik, who made a sign to him that danger was to be apprehended, upon which the king left the room and took refuge on the top of the house.\n\nKhusro Parvez, the son of Hurmuz III (or IV), king of Persia of the Sassanian race. He, by the assistance of the Roman emperor Maurice, after defeating Bahr\u0101m Chobin, his father's general, who had taken possession of the kingdom, ascended the throne of Persia 591 A.D. The moment he was firmly established on the throne, he fulfilled in the most faithful manner the engagements he had entered into with his ally; and publicly adopted the emperor Maurice as his father; but when that emperor was slain in 603 A.D., he instantly declared war, on the grounds of avenging his father and benefactor. His generals invaded the Roman territories; Dara, Edessa, and other strong places on the frontier, were soon subdued; Syria was completely pillaged, Palestine overrun, Jerusalem taken, and the true cross, which had been enclosed in a golden case, and buried deep in the earth, was discovered, and borne in triumph to Persia. His reign of only thirty-three years, was marked by a success never surpassed by the most renowned of his ancestors. Persia was, however, invaded by Heraclius the Roman emperor, who defeated the troops of Khusro wherever he encountered them, and marched, in one direction, as far as the Caspian, in another to Isfah\u0101n; destroying in his progress all his splendid palaces, plundering his hoarded treasures, and dispersing, in every direction, the countless slaves of his pleasure. The subjects of Khusro had lost all regard for a monarch whom they deemed the sole cause of the desolation of his country; a conspiracy was formed against him: he was seized by his eldest son Sheroya or Siros; his 18 sons were massacred before his face, and he was cast into a dungeon, and soon afterwards died or was put to death in 628 A.D., 7 A.H., after he had reigned 38 years. The glory of the house of Chosroes (N\u0101usherw\u0101n) ended with the life of Khusro; his natural son enjoyed only eight months the fruit of his crime.\n\nThe Muhammedan authors say, that Khusro had received an epistle from Muhammad, inviting him to acknowledge Muhammad as the apostle of God. He rejected the invitation, and tore the epistle. \"It is thus,\" exclaimed the Arabian prophet, \"that God will tear the kingdom, and reject the supplications of Khusro.\" The historians of Muhammad, says Gibbon, date this embassy in the seventh year of the Hijri which commenced 11th May, 628 A.D. Their chronology is erroneous since Khusro died in the month of February of the same year. Gibbon, Vol. VIII, p. 205.\n\nKhusro Shah, a descendant of the ancient kings of Badakhsh\u0101n, whom B\u0101bar Shah defeated about the year 1505, and took possession of his country and made it over to his cousin Kh\u0101n Mirz\u0101.\n\nKhusro Shah, surnamed Niz\u0101m-uddin, was the son of Bahr\u0101m Shah of Ghazn\u012b. He succeeded his father at L\u0101hor in 1152 A.D., 547 A.H., and died there after a reign of seven years in 1160 A.D., 555 A.H. He was succeeded by his son Khusro Malik.\n\nKhusro Shah, called also Malik Khusro, a favourite slave and wazir of Sultan Mub\u0101rik Shah Khilji, king of Dakhli, whom he murdered on the 4th April, 1321 A.D., 5th Rab\u012b' I, 721 A.H., and ascended the throne by the title of N\u0101sir-uddin Khusro Shah. He was soon after assassinated on the 26th August, 1321 A.D., 30th Rajab, 721 A.H., by Gh\u0101zi Beg Tughlak, who, the next day, mounted the throne and assumed the title of Ghay\u0101suddin Tughlak Shah I.\n\nKhusro, Sultan, the eldest son of the emperor Jah\u00e1ngir; was born in the month of August, 1587 A.D., Ram\u0101zn, 995 A.H., at L\u0101hor. His mother was the sister of R\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101n Singh, the son of R\u0101j\u0101 Bhagw\u0101n D\u0101s, and after the birth of Khusro she got the title of Shah Begum. He died in the Dakhin on the 16th of January, 1622 A.D., 13th Rab\u012b' I, 1031 A.H., aged 36 lunar years, and his remains appear to have been transported to Allah\u0101b\u0101d, where he lies buried in a garden surrounded by pukka walls, called the garden of Sultan Khusro, and where his mother Shah Begum is also buried. The dome over his tomb has an inscription of several Persian verses, and contains the chronogram of the year of his death in the words \"Faiz L\u0101q\u012b.\" It is related in the work called \"Ma'\u0101ris Kutub Shah\u012b\" that Khusro was strangled by a man named Ra\u1e93\u0101 by the order of Shah Jah\u0101n his younger brother.\n\nKhuzai, a celebrated author, descendant from a tribe of Arabs called Khuz\u0101'a.

He flourished in the time of the emperor Akbar, and wrote chronograms at the birth of Sultan Shah Murad, second son of the emperor, who was born in the year 1570 A.D., 978 A.H. He put the \"Singhasan Battisi\" into Persian verse, but did not complete it. He is the author of a Diwan.\n\nKhwaja Husain Sanai, a Persian poet, and son of Ghay\u00e1s-ud-din Muhammad.

The different rulers who have governed in the provinces of Jaunpur and Antarbed (territories south of Delhi lying between the rivers Jamna and Ganges) are styled by historians the Sharki kings. It appears from the Tawarikh Mubarak Shahi, that Sultan Muhammad Shah, son of Firuz Shah Tughlaq, king of Delhi, created one of his eunuchs, named Malik Sarwar, his prime-minister, and honoured him with the title of Khwaja Jahan; that upon the death of Muhammad Shah, and on the accession of his son Sultan Mahmud Shah Tughlaq, a boy of ten years of age, in 1342 A.D., 756 A.H., he was appointed governor of the Eastern provinces of the empire, viz., Kanauj, Aulha, Kara and Jaunpur, the latter of which he made the seat of his government. The reign of Mahmud Shah was interrupted by serious internal commotions; and Khwaja Jahan taking advantage of these circumstances, and perceiving the weakness of the government arising out of the king's minority, assumed the title of Malik-us-Shark (King of the East), founded an independent kingdom at Jaunpur, and died in the year 1400 A.D., 802 A.H., after a short reign of six years. He was succeeded by his adopted son Malik Wasil or Karanfal, who assumed the title of Mubarak Shah Sharki, and died in 1402 A.D., 804 A.H. After his death his brother Ibrahim Shah Sharki succeeded him, and died about the year 1441 A.D., 845 A.H., after a reign of more than forty years. He was succeeded by Sultan Mahmud Shah Sharki, who died in 1452 A.D., 856 A.H., and left the kingdom to his son Muhammad Shah, who was killed in battle about the year 1458 A.D., 861 or 862 A.H., when Husain Shah, his brother, succeeded him. He had several battles with Bahlol Lodhi, king of Delhi, and was at last obliged to seek refuge in the court of Sultan 'Ala-ud-din, king of Bengal, where he died in 1499 A.D., 905 A.H.\n\nKhwaja Jahan, an Amir of 5000, who died in the time of Jahangir, in the year 1619 A.D., 1029 A.H., at Lahore.\n\nKhwaja Jahan, vide Mahmud Gawani.\n\nKhwaja Kamgar, vide Ghairat Khan.\n\nKhwaja Kirmani, an excellent Persian poet of Kirmania, surnamed Malik-ul-Fuzl, or king of the learned.

He has written about 20,000 verses, and one of his poetical compositions is called \"Humde Humayun.\" Mir or Amir Kirmani, and Ahmad Kirmani, were also two Persian poets.

He chose the admired subject of Yusuf and Zalekha for one of his poems. He was called to Hira, in the time of the Sultan Husain Mirza, to celebrate the events of his reign in verse, and appears to have devoted himself to the task in rather a laborious manner, for he wrote 12,000 lines of a poem on the subject dictated; and would, no doubt, have added as many more, had not death put an end to his enthusiasm. He was the author of many admired poems; among others, \"A Dispute between the Sun and the Moon,\" and \"Between the Pen and the Sword.\" He flourished about the year 1480 A.D., 885 A.H.\n\nKhwaja Mua'zzam, a man of a very mischievous character, was the brother of Hamida Bano Begum, and husband of Bibi Fatima, the emperor Akbar Shah's aunt.

After his death, his office and titles were conferred by the king on his son Sult\u00e1n Kuli with the territory of Golkanda, part of Teling\u00e1na, in j\u00e1gir. On the decline of the Bahmani authority, when 'Adil Sh\u00e1h and others assumed royalty, he also in the year 1512 A.D., 918 A.H., styled himself Sultan of Teling\u00e1na under the title of Kuli Kutb Sh\u00e1h. He was a chief of great abilities and ruled the country for a period of 50 years; 18 of which he governed Teling\u00e1na in the name of Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h, and reigned as king 32 lunar years; at the end of which he was assassinated by a Turkish slave supposed to have been bribed by his son and successor, K\u00e1bul Kutb Sh\u00e1h.

In the beginning of his reign he was engaged in war with 'Adil Sh\u00e1h of Bij\u00e1pur, with whom he concluded peace in the year 1587 A.D., giving him his sister in marriage. The air of Golkanda not agreeing with his constitution, he founded a city at about eight miles distance, which he called Bh\u00e1g\u00edagar, after his mistress Bh\u00e1gmat\u00ed a celebrated courtezan; but being afterwards ashamed of his honour, he changed it to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Sh\u00e1h 'Abb\u00e1s, emperor of Persia, courted his alliance, by asking his daughter in marriage for one of his sons; and Kutb Sh\u00e1h, esteeming connection with so august a monarch as an honour, complied with the request. He was much esteemed for his abilities, was an encourager of literature, and is the author of the work called \"Kulli\u00e1t Kutb Sh\u00e1h,\" a very copious volume, containing Hind\u00ed, Dakh\u00e1n\u00ed, and Persian Poems, on a variety of subjects.

He was installed by the Sult\u0101n about the year 1140 A.D., and became the first king of Khw\u0101rizm of the race called Khw\u0101rizm Sh\u0101h\u012b.

He married the daughter of Sult\u0101n Bahr\u0101m Sh\u0101h, king of Ghazn\u012b, and having founded the city of F\u012br\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d in Gh\u014dr, made it his capital, and assumed all the dignities of a sovereign. At length he was induced to attack Ghazn\u012b. Sult\u0101n Bahr\u0101m obtaining intimation of his intentions contrived to get him into his power, and eventually put him to death. This is the origin of the feuds between the houses of Gh\u014dr and Ghazn\u012b. Saif-uddin S\u016br\u012b, prince of Gh\u014dr, brother of the deceased, raised an army to revenge his death, with which he marched direct to Ghazn\u012b, which was evacuated by Bahr\u0101m, who fled to India. After some time Saif-uddin was betrayed into the hands of Sult\u0101n Bahr\u0101m by the inhabitants of Ghazn\u012b.

In this manner he was led round the whole city; after which, being put to torture, his head was cut off and sent to his uncle Sult\u0101n Sanjar Salj\u016bk\u012b, while his wazir Sayyad Majd-uddin was impaled.\n\n**Kutb-uddin Munnowar, Shaikh,** a Muhammadan saint of H\u0101ns\u012b, who was a grandson of Shaikh Jam\u0101l-uddin Ahmad.

The resentment of a personal injury led B\u00e1d\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, a grandson of Hal\u00e1l\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, to rebel against him, and the unfortunate monarch was, after a short struggle, made prisoner, and put to death in January, 1295 A.D., Safar, 694 A.H. B\u00e1d\u00ed Kh\u00e1n succeeded him.\n\n---\n\n**L.**\n\n**Lab\u00edd**, whose full name is Ab\u00fa A\u2019kil Lab\u00edd bin-Rab\u00ed\u00e1t, was one of the most distinguished Arabian poets, and one of the seven whose verses constituted the Mua\u2019l-lak\u00e1t, a series of prizes suspended in the Ka\u2019ba. He was still an idolater when Muhammad commenced publishing his laws. One of his poems commenced with this verse: \u201cAll praise is vain which does not refer to God; and all good which proceeds not from Him is but a shadow;\u201d no other poet could be found to compete with it. At length the chapter of the Kur\u00e1n, entitled Bur\u00e1t, was attached to a gate in the same temple, and Lab\u00edd was so overcome by the verses at the commencement, as to declare that they could only be produced by the inspiration of God, and he immediately embraced Isl\u00e1mism. When Muhammad was apprised of the conversion of Lab\u00edd, the finest genius of his time, he was exceedingly delighted, and requested him to answer the invectives and satires of Amra-alkys and other infidel poets who wrote against the new religion and its followers. The following sentence is also attributed to him, which is the finest which ever fell from the lips of an Arab:\u2014\u201cAll is vain which is not of God.\u201d Lab\u00edd is said to have lived to the age of 140 years, and died at the city of K\u00fat\u00e1 in 41 of the Hijr\u00ed (758 A.D.). (There is some mistake in the date of his death.) \u2014*Ockley\u2019s History of the Saracens.* Lab\u00edd is supposed to be the friend and tutor of Amra-alkys, commonly called Kaisand Majm\u00fan, the lover of Lyba.\n\n**Lachhmi Narayan**, of Benares.

These two lovers are very famous throughout the East. Laili was the daughter of a neighbouring Chief. She was equally accomplished with her lover; and nothing seemed likely to disturb the happiness which their permitted attachment promised, till the avarice of her father destroyed at once all their hopes. Laili was commanded to think of Kais no more, as she was destined to be the bride of one more rich and powerful; and in spite of the grief and remonstrances of the unfortunate pair, they were separated. Kais became insane from disappointment, and his name was therefore changed to Majm\u00fan, (the distracted). Death at length put a period to his miseries, and his faithful mistress soon followed him, leaving her cruel parent to his late and vain remorse, and the memory of these victims of avarice to eternal honour and regret. *Vide* Majm\u00fan.\n\n**Lais**, or **Laith**, is the proper name of a brazier, who by his valour raised himself to the highest posts in the dominions of Darham, who then reigned in Saj\u00edst\u00e1n.

He is the greatest of the Oriental moralists, and held in the highest esteem by the Orientals for his wisdom and virtues; even Mu\u1e25ammad speaks of him in the 31st chapter of the Qur\u0101n which is called \"S\u016bra Lukm\u0101n,\" with profound reverence. Lukm\u0101n's wisdom, like Solomon's, is supposed to have been of divine origin. One day as he was in his room, working at his trade (he was a carpenter) several angels invisibly entered and saluted him. Lukm\u0101n, hearing voices, looked around him, but not seeing any one, made no reply. The angels then said: We are messengers from God, thy Creator and ours, who hath sent us to thee to inform thee, that He designs to make thee a monarch and His vicegerent on earth.\" Lukm\u0101n answered: If it be the absolute will of God that I shall become a monarch, that will must be accomplished; and I trust that He will grant me grace to execute His commands faithfully; but if the liberty of choice be given me, I should prefer abiding in my present condition; the only favour that I ask from God being, that He would preserve me from offending Him; for were I to offend Him, all the dignities of the world would be but a burden to me. This reply was so agreeable to God that He at once bestowed on Lukm\u0101n the gifts of Knowledge and Wisdom to a degree hitherto unparalleled. The Muslims of Lukm\u0101n are ten thousand in number; and \"any one of these,\" says an Arabian commentator, \"is of much greater value than the whole world.\" His wisdom and the striking morality of his fables, are so like those of \u1e24\u0101sop that he is considered by some as the same personage.\n\nLutf, the poetical name of M\u012br Amman, a Hind\u016bst\u0101n\u012b lyric poet, and one of the learned natives formerly attached to the College of Fort William.

He died on the 30th June, 1839 A.D., 1255 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Abdul Majid. The reign of Mahmud has been full of important events. The Greeks, in 1821 A.D., threw off the Ottoman yoke, and after a sanguinary contest have been declared independent; and in 1828 A.D., a war with Russia took place, in which the armies of Mahmud were uniformly defeated, and the Russians were only prevented from advancing to Constantinople by large concessions on the part of the Turks, and the mediation of the European powers.\n\nMahmud bin-Faraj, a famous impostor who gave himself out for Moses risen from the dead; but was flogged to death by the order of the khalif Mutawakkil.\n\nMahmud Boria, Pahlawan, a Muhammedan saint of Persia who followed the occupation of a boatman, and is the author of the work called \"Kitab Kanz.\"\n\nMahmud Gawan, Khwaja, styled Malik-ut-Tajjar Khwaja Jahang, was the wazir of\nMahmud Shah II, Bahmani, the fourth Sultan of the race of Bahmani kings of the Dakhin, succeeded his father Muhammad Shah II on the throne at Ahmadabad Bedar in March, 1482 A.D., Safar, 887 A.H., in the twelfth year of his age.

In his reign, about the year 1540 A.D., 947 A.H., the fort of Surat (Surat) on the shore of the sea, was completed by Khudawanda Khan, before which time the Portuguese were in the habit of attacking the Muhammadans along that coast. Mahmud Shah reigned about 18 years, and was slain on the 16th of February, 1554 A.D., 13th Rabi' I, 961 A.H., while he was asleep, by one Daulat, at the instigation of Burhan, private chaplain to the king, who hoped by that means to ascend the throne of Gujrat. The same year died also Salim Shah king of Delhi, and Nizam Shah Babi the Sultan of Ahmednagar in the Dakhin. The words \"Zawal Khusroan,\" i.e., Destruction of Kings, commemorate the date of this event. Mahmud Shah was buried in the vault of Sultan Mahmud Baikara, close to the mausoleum of Sheikh Ahmad Khattu, and was succeeded by Ahmad Shah II.\nMahmud Shah I, Khilji, was the son of Khan Jah\u0101n Khilji styled Malik Mughis and 'Az\u012bm Humay\u016bn the prime-minister of Hoshang Shah, after whose death Mahmud in conjunction with his father having succeeded in poisoning his sovereign Muhammad Shah the son of Hoshang Shah, ascended the throne of M\u0101lw\u0101 on Tuesday the 15th of May, 1436 A.D., 29th Shaww\u0101l, 839 A.H. He reigned 34 lunar years, and died on the 27th of May, 1469 A.D., 19th Z\u012b-Ka'da 873 A.H., aged 68 years. The numerals of the two Persian words give the year of his death. He was succeeded by his son Ghay\u0101s-uddin Khilji who reigned 33 years and left his kingdom to his son Sultan Nasir-uddin. He reigned 11 years and 4 months and was succeeded by his son Sultan Mahmud II, who was defeated and slain by Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujrat in 1531 A.D., 937 A.H., and Malwa incorporated with the kingdom of Gujrat.\n\nMahmud Shah II, the third son of Sultan Nasir-uddin, after whose death he ascended the throne of Malwa on the 3rd May, 1511 A.D., 3rd Safar 917 A.H., Malwa was taken by Bahadur Shah king of Gujrat on the 26th February, 1531 A.D., 9th Shaban 937 A.H., and Mahmud Shah taken prisoner with his seven sons and ordered into confinement. He was sent to the fort of Champaner, but died or was murdered on his way to that place, and the kingdom of Malwa became incorporated with that of Gujrat. After the death of Bahadur Shah, one Kadir Khan and after him Shujah Khan ruled over Malwa for some years, and after the demise of the latter his son Baz Bahadur reigned till the year 1570 A.D., 978 A.H., when that kingdom was entirely subdued by the emperor Akbar.\n\nMahmud Shah Purbi, succeeded his father Firuz Shah to the throne of Bengul in 1494 A.D., 899 A.H.

He was raised to the throne of Delhi after the death of his brother Humayun Shah in April, 1394 A.D., Jumada II, 796 A.H., at the age of ten years. His minority and the dissensions of the nobles encouraged many of the surrounding chiefs to revolt and become independent. In his time Timur invaded India, and defeated Mahmud Shah in a battle fought (according to Firuzshah) on the 15th of January, 1399 A.D., 7th Jumada I, 801 A.H.) and according to Sharafuddin Yezdi, on Tuesday the 7th of Rabi' II, 801 A.H., corresponding with the 17th December, 1398 A.D., when Mahmud fled to Gujrat, and Timur the next day took possession of Delhi.\n\nOn the eighth of Rabi'us-Sani', with the sun In Conqueror, Timur died Delhi won. Timur soon after his conquest of Delhi returned to Persia with an immense treasure from India. After the departure of that conqueror, Nasrat Khan, son of Fatma Khan, the son of Firuz Shah took possession of Delhi, and ascended the throne with the title of Nasrat Shah. He was succeeded in 1400 A.D., by Ikbal Khan, after whose death Mahmud Shah, who was then at Kanauj, returned, and ascended the throne of Delhi the second time in December, 1405 A.D., 22nd Jumada II, 808 A.H. But the governors of provinces no longer acknowledged allegiance to the throne, having established their independence during the civil war. Mahmud Shah died on the 4th of March, 1413 A.D., 29th ZI-Ka'da 815 A.H., and was succeeded by Daulat Khan Lodhi. With Sultan Mahmud the empire of Delhi fell from the race of the Turks who were adopted slaves of Sultan Shahabuddin Ghori.\n\nMahmud, Sultan, \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f \u063a\u0648\u0631\u064a, the celebrated king of Ghazni, was the eldest son of Sultan Nasiruddin Subuktigin. His father at his death, 997 A.D., 337 A.H., unmindful of the superior right of Mahmud (who was then employed in the government of Khurasan,) bequeathed his kingdom to Ismail, a younger son. Ismail attempted to confirm himself the power to which he was raised, but on the approach of Mahmud, after a vain attempt at resistance, he was compelled to throw himself upon the clemency of his offended brother. Mahmud reigned more than 33 lunar years, during which time he made twelve expeditions into India; took Lakhur, Delhi, Kanauj and other parts of Hindustan; many hundred temples of the Hind\u016bs he levelled with the ground; many thousand idols he demolished, and broke to pieces the famous idol of Somnath, the fragments of which he distributed to Ghazni, Mecca and Medina. He was born on the 15th December, 967 A.D., 9th Muharram 357 A.H., and died on Thursday the 23rd of Rab\u012b' II, 421 A.H., which year and date is inscribed on his tomb at Ghazni, corresponding with the 30th April, 1030 A.D.

This was doubtless another marriage of policy, for Maimuna was 51 years of age, and a widow, but the connexion gained him two powerful proselytes. One was Khalid, the son of Walid, a nephew of the widow, who by his prowess obtained the appellation of \"The Sword of God.\" The other was Khalid's friend, 'Amr\u00fa the son of 'As; the same who assailed Muhammad with poetry and satire at the commencement of his prophetic career. Maimuna was the last spouse of the prophet, and, old as she was at her marriage, survived nearly all his other wives. She died many years after him in a pavilion at Sarif, under the same tree in the shade of which her nuptial tent had been pitched, and was there interred. This event took place about the year 671 A.D., 51 A.H.\n\nMaisana, the Bedouin bride of the khalif Mu'awiya I., and the mother of Yezid, was a daughter of the tribe of Kalab; a tribe remarkable for the purity of dialect spoken in it. She was married to Mu'awiya whilst very young; but this exalted situation by no means suited the disposition of Maisana, and amidst all the pomp and splendour of Damascus, she languished for the simple pleasures of her native desert. She was an excellent poetess, and had pleased Mu'awiya's fancy to that degree with some of her verses, that he made her go back into the desert amongst her own relations, and take her son Yezid along with her, that he also might be brought up a poet. This part of his education succeeded, for he was reckoned to excel in that way, though his chief talent consisted in making himself a drunken wretch. Maisana did not revisit Damascus till after the death of Mu'awiya, when Yezid ascended the throne.\n\nMajd Hamkar Farsi, also called Majd-uddin Haibat-ullah, vide Majd-uddin Hamkar.\n\nMajd, Maulana, author of the work called \"Rauzat ul-Khuld.\"\n\nMajd-uddaula, a Sult\u00e1n of the race of Boya called Boyaites, was the son of Fakhr-uddaula, the brother of 'Azd-uddaula, Sult\u00e1n of Fars and Irak.

He had been raised by the death of his father in August, 997 A.D., Shaban 387 A.H., when very young, to the government of the city and the surrounding country. During the minority of this prince, all the power was in the hands of his mother. Mahmud commanded one of his officers to inform the lady, that she must submit to his authority, or prepare for war. \"Had such a message been sent,\" replied the heroine, \"in the life of my deceased lord, it must have occasioned great embarrassment. That is not the case now. I know Sult\u00e1n Mahmud; and from his character, am assured he will never undertake an expedition without calculating all the chances. If he attacks, can conquer? A weak woman, where is the glory of such an achievement? If he be repulsed, the latest news will hear of the shame of such a defeat!\" Mahmud, either swayed by the above reasons, or others of more weight, did not prosecute his designs upon Rei until Majd-uddaula was of age, and had assumed the reins of government. He then advanced an army; by the leader of which the prince was deluded to an interview, and seized; his treasures and dominions passed into the hands of Mahmud; who sent him, and his family prisoners to Ghazni.\n\nMajd-uddaula, title of 'Abdul Majid Khan, which see.\n\nMajd-uddin Ahmad ibn-Muhammad Sajawandi, author of a commentary or Tafsir called \"Ain ul-Ma'ani.\" There is another work of the same title on Sufism written by Shahab-uddin Burhanpuri.\n\nMajd-uddin Baghdadi, a pupil and disciple of Shaikh Najm-uddin Kubra.

For this purpose he made a desperate Tapass\u0101, wishing to remember then every thing he knew in his present generation. This could not be fully granted; but he was indulged with writing upon a brass plate a few things which he wished more particularly to remember; then he was directed to bury the plate, and promised that he should remember the place in the next generation. Makunda went to Allahabad, buried the plate and then buried himself. Nine months after he was born in the character of Akbar, who, as soon as he ascended the throne, went to Allahabad, and easily found the spot where the brass plate was buried.\" (Mill's British India, Vol. II, page 152.) The translation of the inscription on the brass plate, is as follows:\u2014In the Safavid year 1596 of the 12th day of the 2nd fortnight of the month of Magh, I, Makunda Bramhehari, whose food was nothing but milk, sacrificed myself at Var\u0101g (Allahabad) the grand place of worship, with the design that I should become the ruler of the whole world.\" The above date corresponds with the 27th of January, 1542 A.D., and Akbar was born on Sunday the 15th of October the same year, being three or four days less than nine lunar months after the above circumstance.\n\nMaldeo Rao, \u0645\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648 \u0631\u0627\u0624, a r\u0101j\u0101 of M\u0101rw\u0101r of the R\u0101thor tribe of r\u0101jp\u016bts, and a descendant of Jodh\u0101 R\u0101o who founded Jodhpur.

At that time Malhar R\u0101o the present ruler was a prisoner.

About this period several commotions happened in the Dehli Government, owing to the rebellion of Sultan Salim, the death of Akbar, and revolt of Sultan Khusrav, successively, Ambar had leisure to regulate his country, levy great armies, and even dared to seize several of the imperial districts. When the authority of the emperor Jahangir was established, he sent frequent armies to the Dakhin, but Ambar was not to be subdued. He at length gave up the places taken from the Mughals to the prince Shah Jah\u00e1n, to whose interest he became attached, and continued loyal till his death which took place in the year 1626 A.D., 1035 A.H., in the 80th year of his age.

Mahm\u016bd the youngest, was only four years of age when his father died; but the ambition of his mother, the Sult\u0101na Kh\u0101t\u012bm Turk\u0101n, placed the crown upon his infant head. However, she was soon compelled to resign, and after some time they both died, and Sultan Barkay\u0101rak succeeded him.\n\nMalik Sharki, Mirza, \u0645\u064a\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0634\u0631\u0642\u064a, an author.\n\nMalik ul-Afzal, \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a, surnamed N\u016br-udd\u012bn 'Ali, the eldest of the seventeen sons of S\u0101l\u0101h-udd\u012bn Y\u016bsuf ibn-Ayy\u016bb. On the death of his father at Damascus in 1193 A.D., 589 A.H., he took possession of that kingdom, whilst his brother Malik ul-'Az\u012bz 'Usm\u0101n obtained that of Egypt, and their brother Malik uz-Z\u0101hir continued to hold Aleppo. Damascus was afterwards besieged and taken by his uncle Malik ul-'Adil Saf\u012b-udd\u012bn Ab\u016b Bakr (the Saphadin of Christian writers). N\u016br-udd\u012bn 'Ali in a poetical address to the khalif N\u0101s\u012br, lamented the similarity of his own fate to that of the khalif 'Ali ibn-Ab\u016b T\u0101lib (his namesake) in being thus excluded from his rights by Ab\u016b Bakr and 'Usm\u0101n; the khalif in his reply consoled him by the assurance that in him he should find the N\u0101s\u012br (protector) whom 'Ali had sought in vain; but the intercession of the khalif was unavailing to procure the restitution of any part of his territories. In 1198 A.D., however, on the death of his brother, the Sultan of Egypt, N\u016br-udd\u012bn became At\u0101bak, or guardian, to his infant nephew Malik ul-Mans\u016br, and attempted by the aid of his brother, the Sultan of Aleppo, to recover Damascus from his uncle; but the expedition failed, and Saf\u012b-udd\u012bn retaliated by invading Egypt, and expelled the young Sultan and his guardian, 1199 A.D. The unfortunate N\u016br-udd\u012bn now retired to Samosata, where he died apparently without issue. He was born in June, 1171 A.D., whilst his father was acting as waz\u012br to the Egyptians.

Sh\u00e1hp\u00far was enraged at this imposture, and wished to punish the author of it; but M\u00e1n\u00ed found means to escape, and fled as far as the borders of China, having first told his followers, that he was going to heaven; and promised to meet them in a certain grot, at the end of the year. In this retreat he amused himself with painting a number of strange figures and views, which at the year's end, he shewed to his disciples, as a work given to him by angels. He was a very ingenious artist, and had a lively fancy, so that his pictures, which were finely coloured, easily persuaded the credulous multitude, in the infancy of the art in Asia, that they were really divine; they were bound together in a book called Art\u00e1ng, which is often alluded to by the Persian poets. Mingling the pure doctrines of Christianity with paganism, he taught that there were two principles of all things, eternal and coeval; that is, God and the Devil, that from the former all good, and from the latter all evil proceeded. The good being, he called, the author of the new testament, the bad of the old. God, he added, created the soul, the devil, the body. He promised also many miracles, and sent them; but for fear to be Sh\u00e1hp\u00far to cure his son, but he pretended now failed him, the child died. Sh\u00e1hp\u00far arrested the disappointed father ordered the prophet to be flayed alive, and his skin stuffed with chaff to be hung up at the gates of the capital, where Epiphanius who refuted his doctrines, saw it. Some say this impostor was put to death in the reign of Bahr\u00e1m, grandson of Sh\u00e1hp\u00far.\n\nMani, a poet, who although called K\u00e1sagar M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n\u00ed, i.e., a porcelain manufacturer of M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n; yet his talents introduced him to Muhammad Muhs\u00edn Mirz\u00e1, a son of Sult\u00e1n Husain Mirz\u00e1, in whose service he was killed by the Uzbeks in 1507 A.D., 913 A.H.

The Mus\u00e1l\u00e1h\u00eds differed in their opinions about the character of this person. Some took him to be a saint, and gave out that he performed miracles; others believed him to be a sorcerer or a juggler, and that he only deceived people with his tricks. He was, however, condemned and sentenced by the khalif of Baghdad, Maktd\u00e1r, and was put to death, because he used to proclaim \"An-ul-hak,\" i.e., \"I am the truth,\" or in other words, \"I am God.\" When they had taken him to the place of execution they first cut off both his hands, and then his legs; they plucked out his eyes, cut out his tongue, and separated his head from his body. They then burned his mangled corpse to ashes, and threw it into the Tigris. This circumstance took place in the year 919 A.D., 306 A.H., but according to Ibn-Khallik\u00e1n, on the 24th Zi-Ka'da, 399 A.H., corresponding with 26th March, 922 A.D. Shaikh Husain is commonly called Mansur Hall\u00e1j though it is the name of his father. He is considered by the S\u00faf\u00eds to be one of their most eminent spiritual leaders, who, they believe, had attained the fourth or last stage of Sufism.

Manuchehr died after a reign of 120 years, and was succeeded by his son Nauzar, in the latter part of whose reign died S\u00e1m, the son of Nar\u00edm\u00e1n.

During the reign of Kar\u012bm Kh\u0101n, he went from India to Shir\u0101z, where his\nfollowers soon amounted to more than thirty thousand. The orthodox priests took alarm, and prevailed on the mild Karim Khan to banish the saint from his capital, but his reputation was increased by the act of power which proclaimed him dangerous. After Karim Khan's death, Mir Masum, who resided in a small village near Isfahan, deputed his first disciple, Payale Ali, to teach in that city. That holy person soon died, and was succeeded in his office by his son Nur Ali Shah; who, though young in years, was, (to use the phrase of his historian), \"old in piety.\" The number and rank of Mir Masum's followers excited alarm in the priests of Isfahan, who transmitted so exaggerated an account of the vile proceedings of the Sufis to Ali Murad Khan, the king, and recommended him so strongly to support the faith, by punishing those whose opinions were alike hostile to true religion and good government, that the monarch, the moment he received their representation, sent orders to put off the head and ears of some amongst the most zealous of the obnoxious sect; and as further directions to shave the beards of all who had adopted their opinions. The ignorant soldiers intrusted with the execution of this mandate, were not very capable of discriminating between true believers and infidels; and we are assured by a contemporary writer, that many orthodox Muhammadans had their noses and ears cut off, and their beards shaved on this memorable occasion.\n\nMir Masum Ali and Nur Ali Shah, after wandering from one place to another, re-visited Kirm\u00e1n, where Mushtak Ali, the most pious of his disciples, was put to death. At Kirm\u00e1nshah Nur Ali Shah was placed in confinement; and Mir Masum was murdered when at prayers in the midst of his followers. This sect, however, notwithstanding the efforts of their enemies, continued to increase in numbers; and Nur Ali Shah, with all who adhered to him, were banished the kingdom. His avowed disciples were at this period about sixty thousand; but many more were supposed to be secretly devoted to him. He is said to have been poisoned at Mauasal. It is related that two inhabitants of Kirm\u00e1nshah, who were distinguished by an extraordinary appearance of zeal, dressed his dinner on the day that he was suddenly attacked by violent spasms, which in a few hours terminated his existence. Their flight led all to suspect them of having poisoned him. Nur Ali died at 5 o'clock on the morning of the 3rd June, 1860 A.D., 16th Mu-harram, 1215 A.H. He expired close to the grave of the prophet Jonas, within a league of Mauasal.\n\nMatin, \u0645\u062a\u0646, the poetical name of Shaikh Abdul Raza bin-'Abdullah Matin.

Taking altogether, therefore, he had held possession of Syria, either as governor or khalif, for nearly 40 years. There are different reports about his age; some say 70 years and others 75.

Therefore, as soon as he had made his abdication, the officers of the court proceeded to the election of a khalif and their choice fell upon Marw\u0101n, the son of Hish\u0101m. In the meantime Abdullah the son of Zubair had been declared khalif in Arabia, \u1e6cr\u0101\u1e63, Khuras\u0101n, Egypt, and a great part of Syria.

In composing Rokhta, he was a pupil of Mirz\u0101 Ja'far 'Ali Hazrat, and in Persian, a pupil of Mak\u012bn. He resided at Lakhman and received a handsome allowance from the British Government as well as from the nawa'i 'Asaf-uddaula. He has written a Masnavi called \"Aziz Muhabbat,\" containing the loves of \"Sisi and P\u0101n\u016b,\" at the request of Mr. Johnson who had the title of Mumt\u0101z-uddaula, and is also the author of a Diwan. According to a chronogram of Jurat, he died in 1807 A.D., 1222 A.H.\n\nMuhammad, \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f, (or Mahomed) the Arabian prophet, author of the \"Kur\u0101n,\" was born on Monday the 20th of April, 571 A.D., 10th Rab\u012b' I, A.H., at Mecca in Arabia, and was of the tribe of Kureish, the noblest of the country. Arab writers make him to be descended in a right line from Ishmael the son of Abraham; but do not pretend to any certainty in the remote part of his genealogy. He lost his father, 'Abdullah, before he was two years old, and his mother, 'Amina, before he was six; but their attention was supplied by the care of his grandfather 'Abdul Muttalib, who at his death, which happened two years after, left him under the guardianship of his son Ab\u016b Talib, with whom he continued till he was twenty-five, when he was placed in the service of a woman, named Khudiy\u0101, the widow of a rich merchant at Mecca, who sent merchandize into Syria. This woman fell in love with Muhammad, the driver of her camels, and married him. In his frequent journeys through Arabia, he had observed the various sects which divided the opinions of the eastern Christians, and he considered that nothing could so firmly secure to him the respect of the world as laying the foundation of a new religion. He, in his 40th year, assumed the title of the Apostle of God, and greatly increased his fame and his followers, by the aid of pretended visions. When he found himself exposed to danger at Mecca, he left the city, and retired to Madina, where his doctrines found a more friendly reception. This event which happened in the year 622 A.D., forms the celebrated era of the Muhammedans, called the hijra or hi'jri, which signifies Separation. At Madina the prophet erected his standard, and as for thirteen years before he had endeavoured to spread his doctrines by persuasion, he now propagated them by the sword. In the eleventh year of the Hijra the prophet fell sick, and after a confinement of thirteen days, he died on Monday the 8th of June, 632 A.D., 12th Rab\u012b' I, 11 A.H., aged 63 lunar years. He was buried in the same place where he died, in the chamber of the most beloved of his wives 'Ayesha, the daughter of Ab\u016b Bakr, at Madina, where his remains\nare still preserved. It is very remarkable that though Muhammad himself so often declared in the Koran that he wrought no miracles, yet his followers have ascribed a great many to him. For instance, they affirm, that he caused water to flow from his fingers; that he split the moon in two; that the stones, trees, and beasts acknowledged him to be the true prophet sent from God, and saluted him as such; that he went one night from Mecca to Jerusalem, from whence he ascended up to heaven, where he saw and conversed with God, and came back again to Mecca before the next morning; with many more miracles equally incredible. Muhammad permitted by his law, four wives to each of his followers; but did not limit himself to that number; for he observed that a prophet, being peculiarly gifted and privileged, was not bound to restrict himself to the same laws as ordinary mortals. The authors who give him the smallest number of wives, own that he had fifteen, four of whom, however, never shared conjugal rites. Their names and the year when they died, are as follow:\n\n| A.

He was a brave and able monarch, conquered Cappadocia, Servia, Wallachia, and other provinces, and was at peace with Manuel Paleologos, emperor of Constantinople, to whom he restored some of his provinces, and died at Andrianople of a bloody flux, 1422 A.D., 825 A.H., aged 47 years. He was succeeded by his son Mur\u00e1d II (Amurath).\n\nMuhammad II, \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064c \u062b\u0627\u0646\u064d, (Mahomet II) emperor of the Turks, surnamed the Great, succeeded his father Mur\u00e1d II (Amurath) in February, 1451 A.D., Mubarram, 855 A.H. His reign was begun with preparations for war; he besieged Constantinople, and conveyed over the land some of his galleys into the harbour, which the Greeks had shut up against the invaders. Constantinople was taken by him on Tuesday the 29th of May, 1453 A.D., 20th Jum\u00e1da I, 857 A.H., and in her fall poured forth her fugitive philosophers and learned men to revive literature in the Western world. Muhammad by his victories, deserved the name of Great; and the appellation of Grand Seignor, which he assumed, has descended to his successors. After subduing two empires, twelve tributary kingdoms and two hundred towns, he was preparing for the subjugation of Italy, when a colic proved fatal to him, and he died on Thursday the 3rd May, 1481 A.D., 3rd Rab\u00ed' I, 886 A.H., after a reign of 31 lunar years. His death was the cause of universal rejoicings over the Christian world, whose religion he had sworn to exterminate, for the tenets of Muhammad. He was of an exceeding courage and strength, of a sharp wit, and very fortunate; but withal, he was faithless and cruel: and in his time occasioned the death of 80,000 Christians of both sexes. His son Bajezid II succeeded him.\n\nMuhammad III, \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064c \u062b\u0627\u0644\u062b, emperor of the Turks, succeeded his father Mur\u00e1d III in January, 1595 A.D., Ju'm\u00e1da I, 1003 A.H. to the throne of Constantinople. He began his reign by ordering nineteen of his brothers to be strangled, and ten of his father's wives to be drowned, whom he supposed to be with child. He made war against Rodolphus II, emperor of Germany, and invaded Hungary with an army of 200,000 men, but his progress was checked by Maximilian the emperor's brother, who would have obtained a decisive victory, had not his troops abandoned themselves to pillage. Muhammad, obliged to retire from Hungary, buried himself in the indolence of his seraglio. He died of the plague, after a reign of 9 years in January, 1604 A.D., Shaban, 1012 A.H., aged 59 years, and was succeeded by his son Ahmad I.\n\nMuhammad IV, \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064c \u0631\u0627\u0628\u0639, emperor of the Turks, was the son of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, whom he succeeded on the throne of Constantinople in 1649 A.D., 1059 A.H. He pursued the war with the Venetians, and after reducing Candia, with the loss of 200,000 men, he invaded Poland. His arms proved victorious; but the disgrace was wiped off by the valour of Sobeski, king of Poland, who the next year routed his enemies at the battle of Choetzin. He was deposed in 1687 A.D., 1098 A.H., and sent to prison where he died in 1691 A.D., 1102 A.H. He was succeeded by his brother Sulaim\u00e1n II.\n\nMuhammad Abd, \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064c \u0639\u0628\u062f, author of a Persian work on Jurisprudence called \"Asa'ul-Isl\u00e1m,\" the Foundation of Muhammadanism, and of one called \"Fi'kha Sunnat wa-Jam\u00e1'a.\"\n\nMuhammad 'Adil Shah, \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064c \u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644 \u0634\u0627\u0647, king of Bij\u00e1pur, succeeded his father Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm 'Adil Shah II, in the year 1626 A.D., 1036 A.H. As the armies of the emperor of Delhi were daily extending their conquests in the Dakhin, and he knew that should the country of Ahmadnagar be reduced, his own would become the object of attack, he assisted Niz\u00e1m Shah against the imperial arms; and more than once suffered for his conduct, being obliged to purchase peace by large contributions. In the year 1653 A.D., 1044 A.H., the armies of the emperor with Niz\u00e1m invaded the Dakhin three quarters and laid waste the country of Bij\u00e1pur without mercy. After the reduction of Daulatab\u00e1d and other forts, with most part of the kingdom of Niz\u00e1m Shah, Muhammad 'Adil Shah agreed to pay a considerable tribute to the emperor. He was the last king of Bij\u00e1pur who struck coins in his own name. In the latter part of his reign, his vassal Sew\u00e1j\u00ed, the son of S\u00e1h Bh\u00f3s\u00e1, by stratagem and treachery obtained great power, and the foundation of the Bij\u00e1pur monarchy became weakened. He died in November, 1656 A.D., Mubarram, 1067 A.H., and was succeeded by his son 'Al\u00ed 'Adil Shah II.

He is the author of several works; was born on the 28th October, 1658 O.S., 10th Rabi' I, 1058 A.H., and died aged 87 lunar years on Friday the 2nd of January, 1713 O.S., 15th Zil-hijjah, 1124 A.H.

Upwards of twelve centuries have passed since Egypt fell under the arms of the successful General of the Khalif Omar; for a little over five centuries it remained in the possession of the successors of the conqueror; their power was put to an end by the Turkmans in 1171 A.D., and about eighty years afterwards the latter were in their turn expelled by the Mamlocks. The Mamlocks raised one of their own number to the throne with the title of Sultan, and the dynasty lasted till 1517, when the last of the Mamlock Sult\u00e1ns was put to death by the Turkish Sultan Salam, who appointed a Pasha to the government assisted by a council of twenty-four Mamlock boys or chiefs. This state of things lasted till 1798, when the French under Bonaparte landed in Egypt, and after destroying the Mamlocks, were themselves attacked and defeated by the British in 1801. After the departure of the British, the country fell into anarchy till it was restored by Muhammad 'Ali, who by the massacre of the remaining Mamlocks made himself master of the situation. The treaty of London in 1841 made the government of Egypt hereditary in the family of Muhammad 'Ali, and Isma'il Pasha is his grandson. Egypt has now ceased to be a province of Turkey. Its ruler has had all the powers of an independent sovereign conceded to him by the F\u00e1rm\u00e1n which dates from the 8th of June, 1873 A.D. Muhammad was born in 1769, entered the Turkish army, and in 1799 was sent to Egypt at the head of a contingent to co-operate with the British against the French invaders. Here his fine military qualities rapidly developed themselves, and he at length became the Commander of the Albanian Corps d'arm\u00e9e in Egypt. He was soon after involved in disputes with the Mamlocks who had long practically ruled Egypt. They were at length entirely exterminated in 1820. He declared himself independent of the Porte in 1838, and died on the 2nd August, 1849 A.D. He was succeeded by his son or grandson Isma'il Pasha.\n\nMuhammad 'Ali Shah, whose former title was Naw\u00e1b Nasir-ud-daula, was the son of Sa'\u00e1dat 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, Naw\u00e1b of Audh.

Some say the esteem in which he was held, that Shah Sulaim\u00e2n pressed upon him the hand of his daughter, which, strange to say, he declined. One alone of this celebrated man's works, called \"Hakk ul-Yokin,\" which he dedicated to Sh\u00e2h Husain, extends to fourteen folio volumes. It contains a body of the theology of the Shias, and quotes and refutes the arguments opposed to the opinions advanced, illustrating the whole with evidences of the truth of the Shia doctrines and with numerous traditions. Besides this, he wrote on many other subjects. One of his works treating exclusively of Had\u00ees, is called \"Bah\u00eer ul-Anw\u00e2r.\" He died 1698 A.D., 1110 A.H., aged 72 years.\n\nMuhammad Bakir Damad, Mir, His father Sayy\u00e2d Mahm\u00fbd was styled D\u00e2m\u00e2d, because he was the son-in-law of Shaikh 'Al\u00ee Am\u00eel\u00ee.

He resided for many years in Isfah\u00e2n, and is the author of several compilations, one of which is called Utk\u00eel Mub\u00fbn.

This work, though mentioned by H\u00e1j\u00ee Khalf\u00e2, had hitherto escaped the industry of European explorers, but a portion of it (four books) has been found in the Royal Library of Paris, and the remainder in Herr von Hammer-Purgstall's collection. In a passage in the Fuhrist this learned gentleman has found that the Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights) had a Persian origin. In the eighth book, the author says that the first who composed tales and apologues were the kings of the first dynasty of the Persians; then those of the Arsacides the third of the four ancient dynasties of Persia; these tales were augmented and amplified by the Sasanides. The Arabs, he then proceeds to say, translated them into their tongue, composing others like them. The first book of this kind was the Haz\u00e2r Afs\u00e2na, or Thousand Tales, the subject of which the writer explains, mentioning Shahrz\u00e2da and Din\u00e2rz\u00e2da as the two females who practice the ruse upon the king. \"It is said,\" continues the author, \"that this book was composed by Hum\u00e2, the daughter of Bahman.\" The truth is, that the first who\nMuhammad had these tales told him at night, was Alexander the Great, in order that he might keep awake, and be upon his guard. The kings who came after him made use, for the same purpose, of the Thousand Tales, which fill up a thousand nights, and two hundred conversations beside, in the light of the moon, which were related in a number of nights.

He by the command of the khalif in the year 711 A.D., 92 A.H., marched with a large army to Sindh and having defeated and killed the raja of that country took possession of it on Thursday the 23rd June, 712 A.D., 10th Ram\u00e1zan, 93 A.H. From amongst the prisoners captured in the fort of Alor, two daughters of the raja were sent to Damascus, and the khalif sent them to his harem, consigning them to the care of his people till their grief should be assuaged. After two months they were brought to the presence of the khalif. When they raised the veils from their faces, the khalif was smitten with their beauty, and asked their names; one was called Girp\u00e1deo, the other S\u00edr\u00e1jdeo. The khalif ordered one to his own bed; she said, \"O my Lord, I am not fit for the king's service, we have both for three days been with Bin-K\u00e1sim, who after dishonouring us, sent us here.\" The king was highly incensed, and directed that his servants should seize Bin-K\u00e1sim, sew him up in a cow-hide, and send him to Syria. When Bin-K\u00e1sim received this order, he directed the messengers to do as they were directed. They obeyed the order, covered Bin-K\u00e1sim with a raw cow-hide: after enduring the torture for three days he died. They then put his body into a box, and conveyed it to the khalif who opening it in the presence of the two women, said, \"Behold how absolute is my power, and how I treat such servants as Bin-K\u00e1sim.\" The women replied, \"Oh king, just men ought not to be precipitate in great affairs, or be too hasty to act, either upon the representation of friends or foes.\" The khalif asked their meaning, they said, \"We made this accusation against Bin-K\u00e1sim because of the hatred we bore him, seeing that he slew our father, and through him we lost all our property and possessions, and became exiles from our own country; but Bin-K\u00e1sim was like a father and brother to us, he looked not on us for any bad purpose, but when our object was revenge for the blood of our father, we accused him of this treachery: this end attained, do with him as you will.\" The khalif on hearing this, suffered great remorse; he ordered the two women to be tied to horses, and dragged to death, and they buried Bin-K\u00e1sim in the burial place at Damascus.

He was born at Delhi on the 30th of July, 1321 A.D., 4th Rajab, 721 A.H. His proper name is Sul\u00e1d-udd\u00edn Muhammad Husaini, but he was commonly called Muhammad Ge\u00eds\u00e1 Dar\u00e1z, on account of his having long ringlets. He lived at Kulbarga in the reign of the Bahmani Sult\u00e1ns, and had the address to engage Prince Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, to become his disciple, and build him a fine house and a superb convent. When this prince ascended the throne, in 1422 A.D., 825 A.H., the credit of the saint became so great, that from the lord to the artificer, all made it their glory to follow his instructions; so that his tomb became a place of pilgrimage to all sects. He died in the Dakhin in the beginning of the reign of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h in 1422 A.D., and is buried at Hasam\u00e1b\u00e1d, commonly called Kulbarga. His tomb is a magnificent edifice covered with a dome, in the middle of an extensive court. During the reigns of the Dakhin Sult\u00e1ns, great sums of money were occasionally offered to his descendants who reposed near the saint, in vows and presents, and many villages were assigned by the kings to defray the expenses of the tomb. He is said to be the author of several works, among which are the \"Ad\u00e1b ul-Mur\u00edd,\" the \"Waj\u00edd ul-Ashk\u00edn,\" containing the whole duty of a Sufi disciple, &c., and also of a book of Fables in Persian entitled \"Asm\u00e1r ul-As\u00e1r.\" His son named Muhammad Akbar, is the author of the \"Ak\u00e1\u00e9l Akbar\u00ed,\" containing the principles of the Muhammadian faith.\n\nMuhammad Ghazzali, vide Ghazz\u00e1l\u00ed.\n\nMuhammad Ghor\u00ed, vide Shah\u00e1b-uddin Ghor\u00ed.\n\nMuhammad Ghaus Jilani, Hazrat Shaikh, a celebrated Muhammadian saint whose tomb is at Uchcha of the Gil\u00e1n\u00eds in Mult\u00e1n, and round whose shrine this town was built and after whom it was named. He was a descendant of Shaikh 'Abdul K\u00e1dir Jil\u00e1n\u00ed Baghd\u00e1d\u00ed, and came to Uchcha about the year 1394 A.D. The D\u00e1\u00fadputtras have continued to be his mur\u00edd or disciples, and the mur\u00edd of his successors from the time of their first leaving Shik\u00e1rpur.\n\nMuhammad Ghaus, Shaikh, of Gw\u00e1l\u00edar, his proper name is H\u00e1j\u00ed Ham\u00edd-uddin, styled Ghaus-ul-'Alam, one of the greatest saints of India, who is said to have resided for twelve years in the practice of asceticism in the jangal which lies at the foot of the Chun\u00e1r hills, consuming the leaves and fruits of the forest as his sole food; and so celebrated was he for the fulfillment of his blessings and predictions, that even powerful kings used to come and visit him and pay their respects. He afterwards went to Gw\u00e1l\u00edar, where he engaged himself in the pursuits of his holy calling and in making proselytes; and managed to content himself with the proceeds of a j\u00e1gir, which yielded a crore of tangas. He was the mushriq or master of Shaikh Waj\u00edd-udd\u00edn 'Alw of Gujr\u00e1t, and died on the 14th September, 1562 O.S., 14th Muharram, 970 A.H. The chronogram of the year of his death is \"Sheikh Aulisab\u00fad,\" i.e., Shaikh was a saint. He is the author of several works, among which are the \"Jawghir ul-Khamsa,\" and another entitled \"Gulz\u00e1r Abr\u00e1r\" containing the memoirs of all the Sufi Shaikhs of India with their places of burial and many other particulars. His brother Shaikh Ph\u00fal who served under the emperor Humay\u00fan, was killed at Agra 1537 A.D., 945 A.H., by the adherents of Mirz\u00e1 Ha\u00fad\u00e1l who had rebelled against his brother. His tomb is on a hill near the fort of Bay\u00e1na. They were the descendants of Khw\u00e1ja Far\u00edd-udd\u00edn Muhammad 'Att\u00e1r in the seventh generation. Their grandfather's name was Mo'in-udd\u00edn Katt\u00e1l, whose tomb is in Jaunp\u00far, and father's name Kiy\u00e1m\u00ednd. He lies buried in Z\u00e1h\u00far\u00e1\u00e1b\u00e1d commonly called Kumbra, in Ghaz\u00edp\u00far.

In the reign of his brother, the emperor Akbar, he had the government of K\u00e1b\u00fal, of which he remained during his life in undisturbed possession. He had twice invaded the Panjab; once in 1566 A.D., 974 A.H., and the second time in February, 1581 A.D., Muharram, 989 A.H., when the emperor found it necessary to proceed himself with an army, and Mirza Muhammad Hak\u00edm was obliged to retreat before him.

He was a native of Arabia, but completed his studies at Shiraz and came to India where he was employed by the prince Azim Shah as a physician. In the reign of Farrukh-siyar the title of Hakim ul-Maml\u0101k was conferred on him. He went on a pilgrimage to Mecca in the time of the emperor Mu\u1e25ammad Shah, and after his return to India, he died in the month of April, 1737 A.D., Zil-hijjah, 1149 A.H., at Delhi.

The name of this monarch, as inscribed on the walls of some of the apartments of the Alhambra, was Ab\u016b \u1e62udd\u0101l, but is commonly known in Moorish history as Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn-Alahmar. He was born in Arjona, in 1195 A.D., 591 A.H. of the noble family of the Bani Nasar; when he arrived at manly years, he was appointed Alcayde or governor of Arjona and Jaen, and gained great popularity by his benignity and justice. Some years afterwards, on the death of Ibn-H\u016bd, when the Moorish power of Spain was broken into factions, many places declared for Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn-Alahmar; he seized upon the occasion, made a circuit through the country, and was everywhere received with acclamation. It was in the year 1238 A.D., that he entered Granada amidst the enthusiastic shouts of the populace. He then claimed king with every demonstration of joy, and soon became the head of the Moslems in Spain, being the first of the illustrious line of Bani Nasar that had sat upon the throne. He caused the mines of gold and silver, and other metals found in the mountainous regions of his dominions, to be diligently worked, and was the first king of Granada who struck money of gold and silver with his name, taking great care that it should be skilfully executed. It was about this time, towards the middle of the 13th century, that he commenced the splendid palace of the Alhambra. He retained his faculties and vigour to an advanced age. In his 79th year, he took the field on horseback, accompanied by the flower of his chivalry, to resist an invasion of his territories, but was suddenly struck with illness, and in a few hours he died vomiting blood, and in violent convulsions.

This work is one of the most important of several treatises which have been composed by that sect. The main object of the author in composing it, was, in the first instance probably to show his own learning; in the next, to justify the claims of Sayyid Ahmad (of whom he was a constant and confidential adherent) as a devotee gifted with a surpassing degree of religious capacity and illimitable zeal. It makes reference especially, in its explanations and allusions, to the peculiar divisions which prevail in India among those who aspire to the honors of religious initiation. These are generally numbered, as the followers of one or other, of three venerated Pir's, each of whom has given a name to a distinct school or sect; the first, the \"Tar\u012bka-i-K\u0101diria,\" which traces its origin to 'Abdul K\u0101dir Jih\u0101ni. Another, the \"Tar\u012bka-i-Chishtia,\" so called from its founder Khw\u0101ja Mo'in-uddin Chisht\u012b, whose tomb is at Ajmer; the third, the \"Tar\u012bka-i-Nakshbandia,\" derived from a Khw\u0101ja Bah\u0101'uddin Nakshband, a native of Bukh\u0101ra. It was one of the peculiar pretensions of Sayyid Ahmad, that he held himself privileged to be the founder of a school of his own, to which he gave the name of the \"Tar\u012bka-i-Mu\u1e25ammadia.\" His book was written some time about the year 1822 A.D., and it is to be remarked, as a new feature in the history of efforts for the propagation of Mu\u1e25ammadanism, or for the reform of its corruptions, how extensively the emissaries of this sect have availed themselves of the press to disseminate their tenets. The \"Sir\u0101t ul-Must\u0101k\u012bm,\" the \"Takw\u012bat ul-I'm\u0101n,\" the \"Hid\u0101yat ul-Momin\u012bn,\" and a little tract attached to it, named the \"M\u0101z\u016br ul-K\u0101fir wa'l Bid\u0101'\u012b,\" and two other tracts, entitled the \"Nasheen ul-Muslim\u012bn,\" and \"Tam-b\u016br ul-Ghaff\u0101r\u012bn,\" have all been printed at private presses in Calcutta or at Hughli.

When it was presented to him, he forbade its being continued; and prohibited all other historians or authors from relating the events of his life, preferring (says his panegyrist) the cultivation of inward piety to the ostentatious display of his actions. This monarch, whose reign is admired by the Muhammedans, and detested by the Hindust, after having imprisoned his father, mounted the throne of Delhi in 1658 A.D., 1068 A.H. At this period the glory of the house of Babar may be said to have arrived at its zenith. The empire extended from the north-west mountains of Kabul to the southern limits of Chittagong; and the kings of Golkonda and Bijapur paid tribute. He is also the author of a \"Shah-nama,\" a \"Roz-nama,\" or Journal, and another work entitled \"Akhbar Hasana.\"\n\nMuhammad Khalil-ullah Khan, \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u062e\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062e\u0627\u0646, surnamed Ashk, is the author of a history of Amir Hamzah, uncle of Muhammad, which he professes to have drawn from a compilation made by order of Sultan Mahmud, the Ghaznavide; and observes, \"What renders this present history at all times interesting is this, that it informs us of the customs of various nations, and that it instructs us in the art of doing battle, and of taking towns and kingdoms. Accordingly Mahmud, to avoid the necessity of counsel from any one, had portions of it read to him as a daily observance.\"\n\nMuhammad Khan Bangash, Nawab, \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0634, styled Ghazanfar Jang, a Rohela chief of the tribe of Bangash. He founded the city of Farrukhabad in the name of his patron the emperor Farrukhsiyar. In the reign of Muhammad Shah 1730 A.D., 1143 A.H. he was appointed governor of Malwa, but unable to cope with the Marhattas on account of their repeated incursions, he was removed in 1732 A.D., 1145 A.H., and appointed governor of Allahabad. Muhammad Khan having planned the reduction of the Bundelas of whom Rajah Chatursal was chief, entered that country in 1733 A.D., 1146 A.H. with an army, and took several places; but as he was but little acquainted with the roads, Chatursal, with the assistance of Peshwa Baji Rao, surrounded him suddenly with an army. The nawab, unable to combat a superior force, took refuge in the fortress of Jaipur, where he was closely blockaded by the enemy for some time, when his son Kaim Jang having collected an army of the Afghans, marched to Jaipur and escorted his father in safety to Allahabad. The imperial ministers, making a pretence of Muhammad Khan's ill-success, removed him from the Subadar. He died in the month of June, 1743 A.D., Jamada I, 1156 A.H., and was succeeded in his jagir by his son Kaim Jang, commonly called Kaim Khan.\n\nThe following is a list of the Nawabs of Farrukhabad:\n\nMuhammad Khan, Bangash.\nKaim Jang, son of ditto.\nAhmad Khan, brother of Kaim Jang.\nMuazzaf Jang, son of Ahmad Khan.\nTafazzul Husain Khan.\n\nMuhammad Khan, Mir, \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u0631, commonly called Kh\u00e1n Kal\u00e1n, was the eldest brother of Shamsuddin Muhammad Anka Kh\u00e1n. He served under the emperors Humayun and Akbar, and was made governor of the Panjab by the latter, which office he held for several years, and died 1575 A.D., 983 A.H. He was an excellent poet, and has left a Diwan in Persian, and another in the Turkish language.

This prince was blest with a bright and comprehensive genius, taking great delight in learning and the company of learned men. He, with his own hand, made a choice collection of the beauties of poetry, selected from the most famous in that art. The work consisted of 20,000 couplets, and was deemed the criterion of taste. Among the learned men in the prince's court, Amir Khusro and Khwaja Hasan bore the first rank in genius and in his esteem. The throne of Persia was at this time filled by Arghun Kh\u00e1n, the son of Abka Kh\u00e1n, and grandson of Halak\u00fa Kh\u00e1n.

The fortunes of this monarch, who from a natural weakness in his eyes, was incapable of rule, had been for many years upheld by the character of his eldest son, Hamza Mirz\u00e1, and his power terminated at the death of that prince, who fell under the blow of an assassin in his own private apartments on the 24th November, 1586 A.D., 22nd Zil-hijjah, 994 A.H. The chiefs of Khuras\u00e1n immediately proclaimed 'Abb\u00e1s, the king's second son, as king of Persia, and in the year 1588 A.D., 996 A.H., marched with him to Kazwin, the capital of the empire, which they took possession of without opposition, and the unfortunate Muhammad was deserted by every inhabitant of Kazwin and by his own army.\n\nMuhammad Khuda Banda Sultan, surnamed Alj\u00e1l\u00ed, a descendant of Changze Kh\u00e1n, succeeded his brother Sult\u00e1n Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, the son of Argh\u00fan Kh\u00e1n to the throne of Persia in May, 1304 A.D., Shaww\u00e1l, 703 A.H. He is said to have been a just prince, and was the first monarch of Persia who proclaimed himself of the sect of 'Ali. He gave a public proof of his attachment to this sect, by causing the names of the twelve Im\u00e1ms to be engraven on all the money which he coined. He built the celebrated city of Sul-t\u00e1n\u00ed in 'Azurb\u00e9j\u00e1n or Media, which he made the capital of his dominions, and where he afterwards was buried. The dome over his tomb is fifty-one feet in diameter, and is covered with glazed tiles.

On his arrival at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d in 1761 A.D., 1174 A.H., he was seized and imprisoned, and ultimately put to death in the fort of Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d by order of Shuj\u00e1'uddaula, he being jealous of his ambitious views in assisting the prince in the invasion of Bengal, and regarding Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d as his right, it having been given only in deputation by his father, Safdar Jang, to Muhammad Kuli Kh\u00e1n, who had refused to surrender it to the son.\n\nMuhammad Kuli Kutb Shah, vide Kuli Kutb Sh\u00e1h II.\n\nMuhammad Kuli Salim, vide Salim.\n\nMuhammad Kuresh, Mirza, the second son of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h.

On his accession it was determined that the names of his two predecessors, viz., Rafi-uddarj\u00e1t and Rafi-uddaula who reigned about three months each, should be struck out of the list of kings, and that his reign should commence from the death of the emperor Farrukh-siyar.

This emperor may be deemed the last of the race of Amir Taimur who reigned in D\u00e9lh\u00ed and enjoyed any power. The few princes of that sovereign's family who were raised to the throne after Muhammad Sh\u00e1h were mere pageants, whom the nobles of the court elevated or cast down as it suited the purposes of their ambitions.\n\nMuhammad Shah 'Adil or 'Adli, an Afghan of the tribe of S\u00far, whose original name was Mub\u00e1r\u00edz Kh\u00e1n, was the son of Niz\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n S\u00far, the brother of Sher Sh\u00e1h, and brother-in-law of Salim Sh\u00e1h after whose death in 1554 A.D., 961 A.H., having murdered his son Firoz, a boy of twelve years of age who had been raised to the throne, he assumed royal dignity with the title of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h 'Adil.

Two years afterwards, the youthful son and successor of Safdar Ali met the fate of his father, and common report attributed to Murtaza Khan a principal share in the contrivance of this murder.

As success in any project seldom fails to draw in imitators, Muhammad having raised himself to such a degree of power and reputation, by acting the prophet, induced others to imagine they might arrive at the same height by the same means. His most considerable competitors in the prophetic office was Musailima and Al-Aswad. Musailima pretended to be joined in commission with Muhammad, and published a satire in imitation of the Kur\u00e1n. He sent Muhammad a letter, offering to go halves with him, in these words: \"From Musailima, the apostle of God, to Muhammad, the apostle of God. Now, let the earth be half mine and half thine.\" But Muhammad believing himself too well established to need a partner, wrote him this answer: \"From Muhammad the apostle of God, to Musailima the liar. The earth is God's; he giveth the same for inheritance unto such of his servants as he pleaseth; and the happy issue shall attend those who fear him.\" During the few months which Muhammad lived after the setting up of this new imposture, Musailima grew very formidable; Ab\u00fa Bakr, Muhammad's successor, in the second year of his reign and the 12th of Hijr\u00ed (633 A.D., 12 A.H.) sent an army against him under the command of Kh\u00e1l\u00edla, the son of Wal\u00edd, who defeated and slew him in battle.

He was the son of that nobleman's daughter, and on his death, he collected an army and gave out that his grandsire had in his will not only appointed him to inherit the greatest part of his treasures, but had likewise nominated him to succeed to the government of the southern province. Nasir Jung, his uncle, who had taken possession of his father's wealth, was enabled to keep his father's army in pay; and this was so numerous, that the forces which Muzaffar Jang had collected were not sufficient to oppose him with any probability of success. Muzaffar Jang subsequently went to Arcot where he defeated and killed Anwaruddin Khan, the nawab of that place, by the assistance of the French in a battle fought on the 23rd of July, 1749 A.D., and was acknowledged the lawful Subadar of the Dakhin. He was, however, after some months obliged to surrender himself to Nasir Jung, who kept him in close confinement; but after the murder of Nasir Jung in December, 1750 A.D., 17th Muharram, 1164 A.H., he was again raised to the masnad by the assistance of the French. His reign was, however, of short duration, for he was not long after assassinated by the same persons who had raised him to power. His death took place on the 3rd of February, 1751 A.D., 17th Rab'i I, 1164 A.H.; when Salabat Jung, the third son of the old Nizam, was placed on the masnad by the French.\n\nMuzaffar Kawami, Maulana, \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0638\u0641\u0631 \u0643\u0648\u0627\u0645\u064a, vide Kawami.\n\nMuzaffar Khan, Nawab, \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0638\u0641\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0646, was the younger brother of Amir ul-Umra Khan Dauran Abdul Samad Khan, by whose interest he was appointed governor of Ajmer in the reign of Farrukh siyar, and was ordered to march with a numerous army against the Maratha chief Mahir Rao Holkar, who had invaded the territories of the Maharaja Jaising Sahib of Amber (now called Jaipur).

In the year 1572 A.D., 980 A.H., the emperor Akbar was invited by Ya'tmad Khan to occupy Gujrat as in former times; upon which Akbar advanced on the capital of that kingdom which he took possession of on the 20th of November of the same year 14th Rajab, 980 A.H., and re-united it to Delhi as a province of Hindustan. Muzaffar Shah, who had abdicated his throne in favour of Akbar, was sent to Agra in the first instance, but was subsequently remanded into close confinement, from which he not only made his escape but flying into Gujrat, collected a respectable force, attacked the viceregent Khubuddin Khan, and slew him in action; and after an imprisonment of nearly nine months re-ascended the throne of Gujrat. His reign was, however, of short duration; for in the year 1583 A.D., 991 A.H., Akbar having deposed Mirza Khan Khankhanan, the son of Bairam Khan to re-take Gujrat, Muzaffar Khan was defeated in a pitched battle and fled to Junaagarh; and as he was pursued by Khan Azim, he cut his throat with a razor.

She was married to prince Darsh Shikoh, the eldest son of the emperor Shah Jah\u00e1n, on the 23rd January, 1634 A.D., by whom she had two sons viz., Sulaiman Shikoh and Siphr Shikoh.

He was the son of a shepherd, born in the province of Khurasan, 1687 A.D., but by selling some of his father's sheep, he collected a number of desperate followers who shared his dangers and the booty gained in plundering caravans. By degrees he saw himself at the head of 6,000 brave adherents, and his assistance was solicited by Shah Tahmasp II, king of Persia, whose throne was usurped by Ashraf, the chief of the Afghans. With impetuous valour, Nadir attacked and routed the enemy, and then seated his master on the throne of his ancestors at Isfahan, 1730 A.D. He then pursued the flying Afghans to Kandahar, and on his return, taking advantage of the odium created by an unfavourable treaty made by Shah Tahmasp with the Turks during his absence, he deposed the king; and his son, an infant of six months he proclaimed Shah, by the name of Akbar III. This event took place on the 16th August, 1732 A.D., 1145 A.H. Nadir assumed to himself the sovereign power, and after having recovered all that had been taken from Persia, he concluded a peace with the Ottoman Porte in 1736 A.D. On the death of the young Shah Abbas the same year, he signified his intention of resigning his honours; but the nobles, excited by his private intrigues, invested him with the sovereign power. The historian of Nadir is careful in informing us, that the crown of Persia was placed upon the head of the conqueror exactly at 20 minutes past 8 in the morning of the 26th February, 1736 A.D., Shawwal, 1148 A.H. Nadir, now elevated to the height of his ambition, wisely saw that war was the only support of his greatness, and therefore with a numerous army he marched against India in 1739. The Mughal empire was rapidly conquered, 200,000 men were put to the sword, and a booty of one hundred and forty-five millions, in which was the imperial throne set with diamonds of an immense value, called the Peacock Throne, was brought away by him from Delhi. He latterly became capricious, proud and tyrannical, and was guilty of such cruelty, that the nobles conspired against him and assassinated him on the night of Sunday the 10th May, 1747 A.D., 10th Jumada I, 1160 A.H., after he had reigned 20 years over one of the most extensive and powerful empires of the world. He was buried at Mashhad nine days after his death. His nephew and murderer Ali Kul Kh\u00e1n who took the title of 'Ali Shah or Adil Shah, succeeded him. On his accession, he put to death thirteen of the sons and grandsons of Nadir; the only descendant of the conqueror that was spared, was his grandson, Shahrukh, the son of Raza Kul, who was 14 years of age. Adil Shah was soon after deprived of sight and imprisoned. After him Ibrahim his brother reigned for some time in 1748 A.D., Shahrukh in 1749 A.D., Sulaiman in 1750 A.D., Isma'il bin-Sayyad Mustafa from 1750 to 1759 A.D., and after him Karim Kh\u00e1n Zand and Ak\u00e1 Muhammad Kh\u00e1n K\u00e1jar, which see.\nNafis bin 'Iwaz, author of the Arabic work called \"Hall-i-Mujiz ul-Kam\u00e1n.\" He was a contemporary of Mirz\u00e1 Ulagh Beg.\n\nNaftuya, \u0646\u0641\u0637\u064a\u0629, or Nift\u00faya, was called so, because an offensive smell like naphtha issued from his body.

At the request of Mirz\u00e1 Muhsin Kh\u00e1n, his brother of Naw\u00e1b Saff\u00e1r Jang, who was sent on an embassy to N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h by Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, the emperor after his invasion of Hindust\u00e1n, Najaf Kh\u00e1n and a sister much older than himself were released. This lady married her deliverer, and Najaf Kh\u00e1n accompanied her and her husband to Delhi, where he was treated with parental affection by Mirz\u00e1 Mahsin, and at his death attached himself to Muhammad Kuli Kh\u00e1n his son, the governor of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, who was shortly after seized and put to death by his first cousin Naw\u00e1b Shuj\u00e1-uddaula the son of Saff\u00e1r Jang. Najaf Kh\u00e1n upon this event, retired with a few followers into Bengal, and offered his services to the Naw\u00e1b Mir K\u00e1s\u00edm 'Ali Kh\u00e1n, then at war with the English, who gave him great encouragement. When K\u00e1s\u00edm 'Ali took refuge with Shuj\u00e1-uddaula, Najaf Kh\u00e1n not choosing to trust himself in the power of the latter, repaired to Bundelkhand, and served G\u00fam\u00e1 Singh, one of the chiefs of that country. Upon the flight of Shuj\u00e1-uddaula, after the battle of Buxar, he offered his services to the English, representing himself as the rightful lord of the province of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, was received with respectful welcome, and even put in possession of a part of it; but when peace was concluded with the Naw\u00e1b W\u00e1z\u00edr, the English discovering the falsehood of his claim, set it aside, and rewarded his attachment with a pension of two lakhs of rupees and strong recommendations to the emperor Sh\u00e1h 'Alam. The recompense was greater than his services to the English, as he had kept up a correspondence with Shuj\u00e1-uddaula, whom he would have joined, had he been successful in the battle of K\u00f3r\u00e1. From Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d he accompanied the emperor Sh\u00e1h 'Alam to Delhi in 1771 A.D., and having reduced the city of Agrah from the J\u00e1ts, he was appointed Amir-ul-'Umr\u00e1 with the title of Zulfik\u00e1r-uddaula.

He is the author of a number of excellent poems; one of which is called \"Husn wa-Ishk,\" but that held in the greatest estimation is a satire on the conquest of Golconda by Alamgir, 1687 A.D., in which the author lashes not only the generals, but even the emperor himself, whose conduct in destroying the Muhammedan kings of Bijapur and Golconda, while the Marhattas and other Hindu chiefs had excelled the standard of defiance, was much disapproved of by many of the zealous Musalmans. The officers and soldiers were also much disgusted by incessant wars in the Dakhin, and the very great hardships they suffered during his campaigns in that country. This book goes by the name of the author, Na'mat Khan 'Ali,' and has no other title; it is sometimes called \"Wakiya Na'mat Khan 'Ali.\" He also compiled a very excellent book on Oriental Cookery.

This miscreant was an adopted son of B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o II., the ex-Peshw\u00e1 of P\u00e1\u00f1\u00e1 who died in December, 1852 A.D. According to Mr. Shephard's narrative of the Kahmp\u00far Mutiny, B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o died on the 28th January, 1851 A.D. Of all the butcheries in the disturbances of 1857, that enacted by this vile wretch, stands pre-eminent. Out of seven hundred and fifty living souls (all Christians) in the strength and vigour of life, few escaped to tell the horrible tale. Lieutenants Delafosse and Thomson of the 53rd N. I., Ensign Brown, 56th N. I., and two other soldiers, were the only survivors of the massacre. Three men and four women are reported to have also escaped and reached Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. They escaped the massacre in the river and were hid in Kahmp\u00far, until the arrival of General Havelock's forces. The pension of the ex-Peshw\u00e1 amounting to 8 laks of rupees per annum, was not continued to the N\u00e1h\u00e1, and this appears to have been his principal, if not sole grievance, though he invariably maintained friendly relations with the European residents, and indeed on many occasions treated them with apparently cordial hospitality. His residence was at Bith\u00far, situated ten miles from Kahmp\u00far, where he owned an estate left him by his patron the ex-Peshw\u00e1, and he was allowed a retinue of 500 infantry and cavalry, with three guns of small calibre, and these troops were of course entirely independent of European authority. A proclamation was issued by the Governor-General in March, 1858 A.D., wherein a reward was offered of one lakh of rupees to any person who should deliver N\u00e1h\u00e1 Dhondh\u00fapant of Bith\u00far, the district officer commanding in any military camp or at any military post; and, in addition to the pecuniary reward, a free pardon was guaranteed to any mutineer, deserter or rebel (excepting the Naw\u00e1bs of Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, Barelli, Banda and R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mainp\u00far) who should so deliver up the N\u00e1h\u00e1 S\u00e1hib.\n\nNanak, \u0646\u0627\u0646\u06a9, or N\u00e1h\u00e1k Sh\u00e1h, the founder of the sect called Sikhs, was born in the year 1469 A.D. He was the son of a Hind\u00fa grain-merchant, and disciple of Sayyad Husain, and as some say of Kabir, and consequently a sort of Hind\u00fa deist, but his peculiar tenet was universal toleration. He maintained that devotion was due to God, that forms were immaterial, and that Hind\u00fa and Muhammadan worship were the same in the sight of the Deity. During his travels, N\u00e1h\u00e1k was introduced to the emperor B\u00e1j\u00edr\u00e1h, before whom he is said to have defended his doctrine with great firmness and eloquence. N\u00e1h\u00e1k died in the month of August, 1539 A.D., aged 70 years. After his sect had silently increased for more than a century, it excited the jealousy of the Musulm\u00e1n government, and its spiritual chief, the Gur\u00fa Arjun, was put to death in 1606 A.D., within a year after the decease of the emperor Akbar. This tyranny changed the Sikhs from inoffensive quietists into fanatical warriors. They took up arms under Harg\u00f3b\u00ednd, the son of their martyred pontiff, who inspired them with his own spirit of revenge and of hatred to their oppressors.\n\nThe following are the names of the Sikh Gurus from N\u00e1h\u00e1k:\n\nGur\u00fa N\u00e1h\u00e1k Sh\u00e1h, the founder of the sect, died 1539 A.D.\nAngad, who wrote some of the sacred books, died 1552\nAmard\u00e1s, died 1574\nR\u00e1md\u00e1s who initiated Amrits\u00edr, died 1581\nArjunmal, he compiled the \"Adi Granth,\" died 1606\nHarg\u00f3b\u00ednd, who was the first warlike leader, died 1644\nHar R\u00e1h, grandson of Harg\u00f3b\u00ednd, died 1661\nHar Krishan, son of Har R\u00e1h, died 1664\nTeigh Bah\u00e1dur, uncle of Har Krishan, died 1675 put to death.\nGobind, son of Teigh Bah\u00e1dur, he remodelled the Sikh government, he was assassinated by a Path\u00e1n soldier in 1708 Assassinated.\nBanda, put to death by the Musulm\u00e1ns, died 1715 put to death.\n12 Missals of the Sikhs captured L\u00e1hor and occupied the Panjab.\nCharat Singh of Sukelpa misl, died 1774\nMah\u00e1 Singh his son, extended his rule, and his wife became regent, and Lakhp\u00e1t Singh her minister, died 1792\nRanjit Singh established L\u00e1hor independency in 1805, vide Ranjit Singh, died 1839 [June, 27th\n\nNandkumar, \u0646\u0646\u062f\u06a9\u0645\u0627\u0631, a rich M\u00edh\u00e1j\u00e1n of Calcutta and Fa\u00fajd\u00e1r of Hughl\u00ed. All the power of the State had been committed to him without control, in the time of the Naw\u00e1b Je'f\u00e1r 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n. He was a treacherous enemy to the English. He was convicted of a forgery, condemned to suffer death, and was hanged at the appointed place of execution in Calcutta, the 5th August, 1775 A.D., 7th Jum\u00e1da II., 1189 A.H. His treasure and effects were given up to his son R\u00e1j\u00e1 G\u00f3rd\u00e1s. It is said there were fifty-two laks of rupees in money, and about the same amount in jewels and rich goods. In his house were found the seals of several eminent persons which he had forged. The Br\u00e1hm\u00e1ns of Calcutta were struck with such horror when that execution took place, that they rushed into the sacred waters of the river to purge themselves of the pollution of such a sight, and looking upon Calcutta as a second A\u00e9ldama or field of blood, they crossed the river and settled at Bali, six miles from the scene of execution. They gradually extended their habitation beyond Bali and formed the village Utarp\u00e1ra.\n\nNarayan Rao Peshwa, \u0646\u0627\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0631\u0627\u0624 \u067e\u0634\u0648\u0627, the third son of B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1, succeeded his brother M\u00e1lh\u00f3 R\u00e1o in November, 1770 A.D.

He wrote on all subjects, and some of his works are to this day standard books in Persian Universities. He was a fair Greek scholar, and made a new translation of Euclid into Arabic, wherein he proves most of the propositions, sometimes in two, three, and four ways, wholly different from the demonstrations of the Greek author. He likewise translated the Almaj\u00edsti, and wrote a volume of learned explanatory notes upon it. He also wrote several works on geometry, astronomy, philosophy, theology, and dissertations on miscellaneous subjects. During the Mughal persecutions he wandered among the mountains of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and was taken captive by Alaudd\u00edn Muhammad, a descendant of Has\u00e1n Sabbah who forced him to remain with him for several years and employed him as his waz\u00edr. It was during his captivity,\nthat he wrote the most celebrated of all his treatises, a well-known and excellent little work on moral philosophy, which he styled \"Akhlaq Nasiri,\" or the morals of Nasir in complement to Nasir-uddin 'Abdul Rahim, governor of the fortress of Dez; but this flattery did not procure him his liberty, he remained in that mountainous region till he was released by Halak Kh\u00e1n in November 1256 A.D., 654 A.H. It was Nasir-uddin that persuaded Halak Kh\u00e1n to march against Baghdad, which was taken in 1258 A.D. The \"Akhlaq Nasiri\" is a translation in Persian of the \"Kitab ut-Taharat fil Hikmat Amali,\" an Arabic work by Abu Ali Muhammad of Mecca. There are two other works on Sufism which he wrote, one called \"Asaf ul Ashraf,\" the Praises of the Virtuous, and the other \"Bahar ut-Majani,\" the Sea of Truth. He is also the author of a work entitled \"Khulafa-nama Ikhlas,\" and another work on Prosody called \"Masalush-sho'ab.\" Nasir-uddin died in the reign of Alakh\u00e1n, the son of Halak Kh\u00e1n on the 24th January, 1273 A.D., 18th Zulhijjah 672 A.H., and was buried at Baghdad near the tomb of Imam Muzaffar Jang.

He has also left us a Diw\u00e1n consisting of 30,000 verses. He was a contemporary of Khw\u00e1ja 'Ab\u00fa'l Hasan Jurj\u00e1n\u00ed and the celebrated physician Avicenna. Some say that he was a Deist, and others considered him to be an Atheist, on which account he was persecuted by the Muhammadans, and fled from one city to another, till at last he was obliged to conceal himself among the hills of Badakhshan. Danial Shah has given a very interesting account of Nasir Khusro in his Tozkra. In 1872 there was discovered among the Elliot papers, an Arabic work by Nasir Khusro on the buildings and water-works of Jerusalem. He is most precise in his information. It is said, that if this work had been found a little earlier, it might have saved the Palestine exploration Committee some diggings and considerable outlay.

General Briggs, in his translation, says that he reigned only nine years, whereas it appears from Major Stewart's Bengal History, which seems to be correct, that he reigned 35 years, consequently his death must have happened in the year 1452 A.D., 856 A.H. He was succeeded by his son B\u00e1rbak.

It is related in several Histories such as the \"Khul\u00e1sat ul-Hik\u00e1ti,\" the \"Hajj-n\u00e1ma,\" and the History of H\u00e1jji Muhammad Kandah\u00e1ri, that the first establishment of the Muhammadan faith in the country of Sindh took place in the time of H\u00e1jji J\u00e1j bin Y\u00fasuf, governor of Basra, at the time when Walid the son of the Khalif 'Abdulmalik was ruler of the provinces of both Tr\u00e1ks. H\u00e1jji J\u00e1j deputed Mahm\u00fad Husain in the year 706 A.D., 87 A.H., with a select army into Mikr\u00e1u, and he subdued that country; and made converts of many of the inhabitants called Balochis. He afterwards deputed Budmin to conquer D\u00edb\u00e1l (modern Thatta on the Indus). Budmin failed in his expedition, and lost his life in the first action. H\u00e1jji J\u00e1j, not deterred by this defeat, resolved to follow up the enterprise by another. In consequence, in the year 912 A.D., 93 A.H., he deputed his cousin Im\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn Muhammad bin Kh\u00e1sim, the son of Akil or \u00daqail Thaffi or Sakafi with six thousand soldiers to attack D\u00edb\u00e1l, and after about five days conquered the place, and H\u00e1jji D\u00e1hir, the ruler of D\u00edb\u00e1l was slain in battle. After the death of Muhammad bin Kh\u00e1sim's tribe who trace their origin from the Ansaris, established a government in Sindh; after which the zamindars, of the tribe of S\u00faman\u00e1, usurped the power, and held independent rule over the kingdom of Sindh for the space of 500 years. In the course of years, the dynasty of S\u00faman\u00e1 was subverted, and the country subdued by another dynasty called S\u00faman\u00e1, whose chief assumed the title of Jam. During the reigns of these dynasties in Sindh, the Muhammadan kings of India Proper, such as those of Ghazn\u00ed, Gh\u00f3r and Dehl\u00ed, invaded Sindh, and seizing many towns, appointed Muhammadan governors over them. Among these rulers, Nasir-uddin Kabbachha asserted his independence, and caused the public prayers to be read in his name as king of Sindh. Nasir-uddin was one of the Turkish slaves of Shah\u00e1b-udd\u00edn Muhammad Gh\u00f3ri, who made him governor of Uchcha in Mult\u00e1n about the year 1203 A.D., 600 A.H. He espoused the daughter of Sultan Kur\u00e1b-udd\u00edn Eit\u00e1kb viceroy, and afterwards king of Dehl\u00ed, after whose death in 1210 A.D., 607 A.H., having seized many of the towns subjected to the Sindh government, he reduced the territory of the S\u00faman\u00e1s to the small tract of country around Thatta, and relinquishing the allegiance to the throne of Dehl\u00ed, became independent. Besides Sindh, his kingdom embraced the provinces of Mult\u00e1n, Kohr\u00e1n and Sursati. He was twice attacked by Taj-udd\u00edn Elduz of Ghazn\u00ed, but he successfully repelled both these invasions. In 1225 A.D. Shams-udd\u00edn Alt\u00edmsh, king of Dehl\u00ed, made several attempts to remove him from his government, and even marched for that purpose as far as Uchcha, when Nasir-uddin having no hopes of eventually repelling the arms of the Dehl\u00ed monarch, placed his family and personal attendants with his treasure, in boats, and endeavoured to occupy a contiguous island; when a storm coming on, the boat founded, and every one perished. This Nasir-uddin reigned in Sindh and Mult\u00e1n for a period of 22 years. In the latter end of the reign of Muhammad Tughlak of Dehl\u00ed, Sindh owned allegiance to that monarch; nevertheless, occasionally taking advantage of local circumstances, the Sindhis contrived, for a considerable period, to shake off their allegiance. The first of the family of which we have any account was Jam Afr\u00e1.\n\nThe following is a list of the Jam dynasty of S\u00faman\u00e1, originally Edj\u00e1pts.\n\n| Year | Name | Reign |\n|------|------|-------|\n| 737 | Jam Afr\u00e1 | 3 years and 6 months from 1336 |\n| 754 | Chob\u00e1n, his brother | 14 years and 1 month |\n| 769 | Bani, son of Jam Afr\u00e1 | 15 years and 1 month |\n| 782 | Timm\u00e1ji, son of Jam Afr\u00e1 | 13 years |\n| 793 | Sal\u00e1h-udd\u00edn, converted to Muhammadanism | 1391 |\n| 796 | Niz\u00e1m-udd\u00edn, his son | 1393 |\n| 812 | Alisher, his son | 1409 |\n| 827 | Gir\u00e1n, son of Timm\u00e1ji | Died on the second day after his accession |\n| 854 | Fatha Kh\u00e1n, son of Iskandar Kh\u00e1n | 1423 |\n| 856 | Tughlak, his brother-in-law | 27 years, succeeded by his kinsman Jam Mub\u00e1rak, who was deposed after a reign of 3 days |\n| 894 | Niz\u00e1m-udd\u00edn, commonly called Jam Nanda | 1460 |\n| 927 | Fir\u00f3z, his son | 32 years, when Sh\u00e1h Beg Argh\u00e1n, governor of Kandah\u00e1r in 1520 A.D. marched to conquer Sindh, and occupied the whole country, even to the possession of Thatta |\n| 930 | Sh\u00e1h Beg Argh\u00e1n | 3 years |\n| 966 | Sh\u00e1h Husain Argh\u00e1n | 1554 |\n| 982 | Mahm\u00fad of Bakk\u00e1r | Reigned till 1572 A.D., when the emperor Akbar annexed Sindh to the empire |\n\nNasir-uddin Kazi Baizawi, \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0638\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u064a\u0632\u0627\u0648\u064a, the son of Im\u00e1m Badr-udd\u00edn Umar bin-Fakhrudd\u00edn 'Ali Baizawi.

When the emperor B\u00e1bar slew Ibrahim the son of Sikandar Lodi, and ascended the throne of Dehl\u00ed in 1526 A.D., 932 A.H., many of the adherents of the Lod\u00ed dynasty sought protection on the coasts of Bengal, and among others the prince Mahm\u00fad (brother to Tirah\u00edn Lodi).

After an administration of 30 years, the fame of the wazir, his wealth and even his services, were transformed into crimes. This venerable statesman, at the age of 39 years, was dismissed by his master, accused by his enemies, and was stabbed by an assassin, who was a follower of Hasan Sab\u00e1h, the Old Man of the mountain, on Friday night the 15th of October, 1092 A.D., Ram\u00e1z\u00e1n, 485 A.H., at a place called Nah\u00e1w\u00e1d. His body was carried to Isf\u00e1h\u00e1n where he was interred with great pomp. It is said that the assassin was suborned against him by Maliksh\u00e1h, who was fatigued to see him live so long. The Sult\u00e1n survived him 35 days only.

In the reign of the emperor Farrukh-siy\u00e1r, he held the government of Mor\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d and was afterwards appointed governor of M\u00e1liw\u00e1, which province he restored to a flourishing condition, but the reputation he acquired rendered him an object of jealousy to the two brothers, Sayyad 'Abdullah Kh\u00e1n and Husain 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, who wished to remove him to another quarter less favourable to his interest than the frontier of the Dakh\u00edn; but Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk not willing to quit his post, excused himself, and resolved to seek an independent power in the Dakh\u00edn. The disturbed state of that country gave him a pretence for raising troops, and turned his attention to the conquest of the Dakh\u00edn. By intrigue and money he obtained possession of the fort of Asirgarh about the year 1717 A.D., and procured the junction of several officers of the province. He was pursued from Hindust\u00e1n by the force under Dill\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n and another under 'Alam 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, both of whom he defeated and slew in battle in April, 1720 A.D., and at last remained without a rival in the Dakh\u00edn. In the reign of Muhammed Shah, after the death of the two Sayy\u00e1ds, he was invited to court by that emperor; and on his arrival at Delhi, the high office of wizar\u00e1t was conferred on him, but Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk being soon disgusted with\nthe state of things at court, sent in his resignation, and marched off for the Dakhin, and though he continued to send honorary presents, on fixed occasions to the emperor, he thenceforth conducted himself, in other respects, as an independent prince, and governed the provinces of the Dakhin for 30 years with great ability and success. He was present in the battle which took place between Muhammad Shah and Nadir Shah and is the progenitor of the present Nizam-ul-Mulk. He died on the 22nd May, 1743 A.D., 11th Jumada II, 1161 A.H., three days after the death of the emperor Muhammad Shah, aged 104 lunar years, and was buried at Burhanpur near the tomb of Shah Burhanuddin Gharib. He left behind him six sons, viz., Ghazi-ud-din, Nasir Jang, Salabat Jang, Nizam 'Ali, Basalat Jang and Mughal 'Ali, and was succeeded in the government of the Dakhin, by the second, Mir Ahmad surnamed Nasir Jang, who was present at Burhanpur when his father died; the eldest Ghazi-ud-din Khan then residing at Delhi in the office of Amir-ul-'Ummah. Nasir Jang was assassinated in December, 1750 A.D., and Muzaffar Jang a grandson of Nizam-ul-Mulk was placed on the throne, and soon after assassinated in February, 1751 A.D.; Salabat Jang, by the influence of the French, was then proclaimed and reigned until 1761 A.D., when he was imprisoned, and in 1763 A.D. put to death by his brother Nizam 'Ali, who ascended the throne and reigned until the 6th August, 1803 A.D., when he died, and was succeeded by his eldest son Mirza Sikandar Jah. Sikandar Jah died on the 23rd May, 1829 A.D., and was succeeded by his son Mir Farkhunda 'Ali Khan the present Nizam (1858). Nizam-ul-Mulk appears to be the author of a Diwan which was found in the library of Tipu Sultan called \"Diwan 'Asaf Nizam-ul-Mulk.\"\n\nNizam-ul-Mulk Bahr\u00ed, \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0628\u062d\u0631\u06cc, the father of Ahmad Nizam Shah Bahr\u00ed who was the first king of the Nizam Shah\u00ed dynasty. Nizam-ul-Mulk was originally a Brahman of Bijanagar, but being taken prisoner in his infancy by the army of Sultan Ahmad Shah Bahmani, was made a Musulman, and was educated as one of the royal slaves. He finished his education under the same tutor with the king's eldest son Sultan Muhammad, and became eminently learned in Persian and Arabic literature. On the accession of Sultan Muhammad II to the throne of the Dakhin in 1463 A.D., he was raised to the rank of a thousand and the charge of the royal falconry was entrusted to him, on which account he was called Bahr\u00ed, i.e., a falconer. By degrees he rose to the highest honours and was appointed governor of Tilangana. On the death of Sultan Ahmad Shah in 1486 A.D., he by his will became first minister to his son Sultan Mahomed II who added Bir and other districts to his jagir. This he committed to his son Malik Ahmad, who took up his residence at Khairar and employed himself diligently in the affairs of his government, and after his father's death set up a separate dynasty in the Dakhin called Nizam Shah\u00ed, the capital of which was Ahmadnagar. Nizam-ul-Mulk who had the sole power of the administration in his hands, latterly paid little or no regard for the king's authority, was murdered by the orders of the Sultan about the year 1486 A.D., 891 A.H., or some time afterwards.\n\nNizam-ul-Mulk Mahmud, \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0645\u062f\u0648\u062d, the son of Abi Sa'id Junaidi, a general and wazir of Shamsuddin Altamsh, king of Delhi.

She had attracted the notice of the prince Sultan Salim (afterwards Jahangir); but was, at the suggestion of his father the emperor Akbar, in order to withdraw the lady from the attentions of the prince, married to Sher Afghan Khan, a young Persian lately come into the service, and to whom Akbar gave a jagir in Bengal. After the death of his father, Jahangir appointed Kutb-uddin Khan his foster-brother the son of Shaikh Salim Chishti, as governor of Bengal with the intention that he might procure for him the object of his passion. Kutb-uddin Khan on his arrival at Burdw\u00e1n was slain by Sher Afghan Khan, who was himself despatched by Kutb-uddin's attendants, Nur Jahan was seized and sent as a prisoner to Dehl\u00ed, and was at first placed by the emperor among the attendants of his mother, but he subsequently married her in the sixth year of his reign 1610 A.D., 1019 A.H., changed her name, which was Mehr-un-Nisa', into Nur Jahan (the light of the world), and raised her to honours such as had never before been enjoyed by the consort of any king in India. From this period her ascendancy knew no bounds; the emperor took no step without consulting her on every affair in which she took an interest; her will was law. A circumstance so uncommon in an Asiatic government is thus recorded on the coins of that period. \"By the order of the emperor Jahangir, gold acquired a hundred times additional value by the name of the empress Nur Jahan.\" Her father Mirza Ghay\u00e9s or Ayas was made prime minister with the title of Ya'tm\u00e1d-uddaula; and her two brothers were raised to the first rank of 'Umra, by the titles of Ya'tk\u00e1d Khan,\nand 'Asaf Kh\u00e1n. One of the accomplishments by which she captivated Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, is said to have been her facility in composing contemporary verses. After the death of her husband, she was treated with much respect and allowed a stipend of \u00a3250,000 a year. She survived Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr eighteen years, and died aged 72 in 1645 A.D., 1055 A.H., at L\u00e1h\u00f3r, where she was buried in the mausoleum of her husband close to his tomb; some say, near the tomb of her brother 'Asaf Kh\u00e1n on the banks of the R\u00e1wi, at L\u00e1h\u00f3r. Hugh Murray in his History of British India, p. 230, by his erroneously asserting, that she was buried in the mausoleum at Agra called the T\u00e1j Mah\u00e1l, has misguided many others. Even so late as the year 1858 A.D., the author of the \"History of the Indian Revolt,\" page 109, says \"that this was the mausoleum of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n and his favourite wife N\u00far Jah\u00e1n.\"\n\nNur Muhammad, Sayyad of Bad\u00e1\u00fan, was a learned and pious Musulm\u00e1n of the sect of Nakshband.

He succeeded his father, Azz-udd\u00edn Mas\u00e1'\u00fad, 1193 A.D., 589 A.H., (the year of the death of S\u00e1lih-udd\u00edn). During a reign of 15 years, he established in some measure the declining power of his house, and compelled the minor princes of his family, to acknowledge his supremacy as lord paramount. He died 1210 A.D., 607 A.H., regretted by his subjects as a mild and beneficent ruler. His son Azz-udd\u00edn, after a reign of between seven and eight years, was succeeded by an infant son bearing the title of N\u00far-udd\u00edn Arsal\u00e1n II who survived him only a few months.\n\nNur-uddin 'Ali, Malik Mansur, the second Sult\u00e1n of the dynasty of Tartar or Bahar\u00ede Muml\u00edks in Egypt, was placed on the throne by the Amir after the assassination of his father Malik Mo'izz 'Azz-udd\u00edn El\u00edak, 1257 A.D., 655 A.H., at the age of fifteen. His short reign of two years was troubled by continual feuds among the Muml\u00edk chieftains, and attempts on the part of the Ayy\u00fab\u00ed princes of Syria to recover the lost sway of their family in Egypt; and the apprehension of an irruption of the Mughals under Hal\u00e1k\u00fa, who had taken Bagh\u00e1d\u00e1d and destroyed the Khil\u00e1f\u00e1t, shewed the necessity of substituting a ruler of matured years and experience.

In the partition of his father's extensive dominions, which followed his death in 1193 A.D., Damascus and Southern Syria with Palestine fell to the lot of N\u00far-udd\u00edn; but in the dissensions which soon followed, he was stripped of his kingdom by his uncle Saif-udd\u00edn 'Ab\u00fa Dahr (the Saphadin of Christian writers), and his brother Us'm\u00e1n, made Sult\u00e1n of Egypt, 1196 A.D. Vide Malik-ul-Afza.\n\nNur-uddin Mahmud, Malik-ul-'Adil, one of the most celebrated and powerful of the Muhammadan rulers of Syria in the age of the Crusades, born 1117 A.D., 511 A.H., was a younger son of 'Im\u00e1d-udd\u00edn Zangi, the second of the dynasty of the At\u00e1baks of 'Irak and Syria. At the death of his father, who was murdered by his own Maml\u00edks at the siege of Jabb\u00e1r, 1146 A.D., 541 A.H., N\u00far-udd\u00edn hastening to Aleppo with the signet of the deceased prince, secured the possession of that city and of his father's Syrian dominions; while Mesopotamia, with Mousal for a capital, fell to the lot of the elder brother Saif-udd\u00edn; and the feeble attempts of Alp Arsl\u00e1n, a prince of the house of Salj\u00fak, to assert his ancestral claims to the dominion of these provinces, were easily frustrated by the combined power of the two brothers. The earliest exploits of the reign of N\u00far-udd\u00edn were in continuance of the Holy War which his father had assiduously waged against the Latin Christians of Palestine: Josceline de Courtenay, whose capital of Edessa had been taken by Zangi a few years previous, was signalily repulsed in an attempt to recover it, and the Christian inhabitants, who had aided the enterprise, were put to the sword without mercy by command of N\u00far-udd\u00edn, who even levelled the fortifications of the town to prevent its ever again becoming a bulwark to the kingdom of Jerusalem. The recovery of this important fortress was the avowed object of the second Crusade, undertaken 1147 A.D., 545 A.H., under Louis VII of France and the emperor Conrad; but of the mighty hosts which they led from Europe, only a miserable and dispirited remnant escaped the arrows of the Sulj\u00fak\u00ed Turks in their march through Anatolia to Palestine, the project of retaking Edessa was abandoned as hopeless, the siege of Damascus, which was attacked by the crusading monarch in conjunction with Baldwin III of Jerusalem, was foiled when on the eve of success by the address with which the minister of the Muslim prince Mujir-udd\u00edn fomented the mutual jealousies of the Christian leaders; and this vast armament, which if properly directed might have overwhelmed the rising power of N\u00far-udd\u00edn, only served by its failure to extend and confirm it. Resuming the offensive immediately after the departure of the crusaders, he invaded the territory of Antioch, and in a pitched battle (27th June, 1149 A.D.), routed and slew the prince Raymond, whose head was sent as a trophy to the Khal\u00edf at Bagh\u00e1d\u00e1d; and though he sustained a severe defeat in the following year from his ancient opponent Josceline de Courtenay, who surprised his camp, this disgrace was amply compensated by the captivity of that active leader, who was soon after seized while hunting by a marauding party of Turkmans, and died in confinement, while the remaining dependencies of Edessa, the fortress of Aintab, Tellbash\u00e9r, Ravend\u00e1n, &c., fell almost without resistance into the power of N\u00far-udd\u00edn, whose dominions now included the whole of Northern Syria. Mujir-udd\u00edn was still the nominal ruler of Damascus and the southern portion, but the government was entirely in the hands of his waz\u00edr Mo'in-udd\u00edn An\u00e1r, whose daughter N\u00far-udd\u00edn had married; and after the death of this able minister, the inhabitants, alarmed at the capture of Ascalon by Baldwin III in 1153 A.D., and dreading an attack from the Christians, humbly offered their allegiance to N\u00far-udd\u00edn (1154) as the prince of his protection. The weak Mujir-udd\u00edn resigned his powers and sought an asylum at the court of the Khal\u00edf of Bagh\u00e1d\u00e1d, which then seems to have been the usual retreat of deposed princes; while N\u00far-udd\u00edn, the circuit of whose realms now encompassed on all sides by land the Latin territories in Palestine, and extended to the frontiers of the Fatimite possessions\nin Egypt, fixed his capital at Damascus, which he raised from the ruinous state in which it had been left by an earthquake, and adorned with mosques, fountains, colleges, and hospitals. The death of Baldwin III in 1162 A.D., released N\u00fcr-uddin from the ablest of his antagonists, his brother and successor, Almaric, or Amoury, being far inferior to Baldwin, both in prowess and abilities. Mesopotamia, ruled by Sultan's nephews, acknowledged his supremacy as head of the family; he was now, by his officers, absolute master of Egypt; his name was recited with that of the Khalif Mustazi of Baghdad in all the mosques throughout his dominions, and even in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, which Tur\u00e1n Shah, brother of S\u00e1l\u00e1h-uddin, had made dependencies of Egypt. But the power and glory of N\u00fcr-uddin had now attained their highest pitch, the three remaining years of his life were unmarked by any memorable achievement, and disquieted by the forebodings of the future downfall of his house by the ambition of S\u00e1l\u00e1h-uddin, who, though not ostentatiously acting as his lieutenant, and making public professions of loyalty and obedience, had in fact become independent master of Egypt, and eluded or disregarded all the orders of his nominal sovereign. N\u00fcr-uddin was preparing to march into Egypt to reduce or expel his refractory vassal, when an attack of quinsy terminated his life at Damascus after a prosperous reign of 27 years on the 26th of May, 1173 A.D., 21st Shaww\u00e1l, 569 A.H. His son Malik-us-S\u00e1l\u00e1h Ism\u00e1'il, a youth, 11 years old, succeeded to the titular sovereignty of his extensive dominions, but was speedily stripped by S\u00e1l\u00e1h-uddin, of Damascus and the greater part of Syria, and died 8 years afterwards, reduced to the sovereignty of Aleppo and its dependencies.\n\nNur-uddin Muhammad, Mirza, \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f, son of 'Al\u00e1-udd\u00edn Muhammad, the son of Khw\u00e1j\u00e1 Husain.

The accounts given by Eastern and Western authors, of the successes of this king in his invasions of the Roman empire, differs but very little. Some of the former have falsely asserted that he took an emperor of the Romans prisoner; and they have all, with a partiality that, in national historians writing of this monarch, seems almost excusable, passed over the few reverses which his arms sustained. But the disgraceful peace which the emperor Justinian purchased at the commencement of the reign of Nousherw\u00e1n, the subsequent war, the reduction of all Syria, the capture of Antioch, the unopposed progress of the Persian monarch to the shores of the Mediterranean, his conquest of Iber\u00eda, Calchos, and the temporary establishment of his power on the banks of the Phasis, and on the shores of the Euxine, are facts not questioned by his enemies. They, however, assert, that his genius, as a military leader, even when his fortune was at the highest, was checked by Belisarius, who was twice sent to oppose his progress; and whose success, considering his want of means, and the character of the court he served, was certainly wonderful. In all the negotiations which took\nplace between the emperor Justinian and Nousherw\u00e1n, the latter assumed the tone of a superior. His lowest servants were treated, at the imperial court, in a manner calculated to inflame the pride, and raise the insolence of a vain and arrogant nation: and the impressions which this conduct must have made, were confirmed by the agreement of the Roman emperor to pay 30,000 pieces of gold; a sum which could have been of no importance to Nousherw\u00e1n, but as it showed the monarch of the Western world in the rank of one of his tributaries. In a second war with the Roman emperors Justin and Tiberius, Nousherw\u00e1n, who though 80 years of age, still led his armies, experienced some reverses of fortune: but the perseverance and valour of the aged sovereign were ultimately rewarded by the conquest of Dara and the plunder of Syria, 572 A.D. He died after a prosperous reign of 48 years about the year 579 A.D., and was succeeded by his son Hurmuz IV.\n\nMuhammad, who was born during the reign of Nousherw\u00e1n, 571 A.D., used to boast of his fortune, in being born when so just a king reigned.

There is a stone scraped into furrows, on which, it is said, Pir Badar used to sit; there is also another bearing an inscription, which from exposure to the weather, and having on it numerous coats of whitewash, is illegible. There is a mosque near the tomb, with a slab of granite, bearing an illegible inscription, apparently from the Kur\u00e1n.

He was murdered by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaudp\u00far while engaged in the congenial occupation of riting some of the R\u00e1j\u00e1's property. He was succeeded by his son Damaji who was an unworthy representative of his illustrious sire. He had the audacity to declare open war against the Peshwa while the Peshwa was unencumbered with any other quarrels, and as the result of this unequal contest, he lost half of his possessions, and was forced to hold the other half himself as a fief from the Peshwa. Syaji, the son of Dauroji, was a fool, and Anand R\u00e1o was a fool, that is, not fools in the conventional and uncomplimentary sense of the word, but literally fools\u2014persons of weak intellect. But they were the heirs to the throne, and it was sought to make them the victims of an usurpation. The British Government was horrified at this iniquity and they stepped in to prevent it. Afterwards when the British were engaged in their fresh struggle with the Peshwa, Baroda sided with us. The Marhatta confederacy was broken up, and in the final settlement, the Gaikow\u00e1r received a large accession of territory. Anand R\u00e1o died in 1819 A.D., and was succeeded by Sajaji R\u00e1o.

The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sit\u00e1ra, R\u00e1mn\u00e1j\u00e1, a weak prince, being upon the throne, it was concerted between the two principal officers of the state, B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o the Peshw\u00e1, and Raghoji Bhosla, the Bakhshi or Commander-in-Chief, to divide the dominions of their master. In consequence of this arrangement, the former retained the government of the western provinces, continuing at the ancient capital of P\u00fana; the latter took the eastern and fixed his residence at Nagpur, a principal city in the province of Ber\u00e1r; whilst R\u00e1mn\u00e1j\u00e1 was confined to the fortress of Sit\u00e1ra, the Peshw\u00e1 administering the government in his name.

This occasioned a contention between J\u00e1noji's brother Samoji and Madh\u00faji. The former claimed the government in the right of priority of birth, and the latter as father and guardian of the adopted child. They were accordingly engaged in hostility until the death of Samoji or Sabhoji, who was killed in an engagement with his brother on the 27th of January, 1775 A.D. From that period the government of Ber\u00e1r was held by Madhoji or Madh\u00faji Bhosla.\n\nBhosla R\u00e1j\u00e1s of N\u00e1gpur or Ber\u00e1r.\n\n| Name                  | Year |\n|-----------------------|------|\n| Raghoji Bhosla I      | died 1753 |\n| J\u00e1noji                | 1772 |\n| Madhoji               | 1788 |\n| Raghoji Bhosla II     | 1816 |\n| Parsoji (strangled by Apa Sahib) | 1816 |\n| Mudoji (Apa Sahib) was acknowledged by the English in 1816 and... | deposed 1818 |\n| Partap Singh N\u00e1ryan grandson of Raghoji Bhosla put on the throne | 1818 |\n| Raghoji Bhosla III    | 1853 |\n\nRaghoji Bhosla II, succeeded his father Madhoji Bhosla in the government of Ber\u00e1r or N\u00e1gpur in May, 1788 A.D. and died on the 22nd of March, 1816 A.D., when his son Parsoji succeeded him.\n\nRaghunath Shah, of the Mandla district, who was a direct descendant of the eldest branch of the Gond dynasty, was executed in 1857 A.D. for rebellion, and his estates confiscated.

On the death of B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, who left two sons M\u00e1dh\u00fa R\u00e1o and N\u00e1ryan R\u00e1o, both minors, the power of the state was for some years wielded by his brother Raghn\u00e1th as regent. M\u00e1dh\u00fa R\u00e1o was enabled to take the reins of government into his own hands after some time, but died in 1772 A.D., and was succeeded by his brother N\u00e1ryan R\u00e1o. He was soon after murdered in consequence of a plot which Raghb\u00f3ba had formed against him. Raghb\u00f3ba was acknowledged Peshw\u00e1 after his death; but it appeared soon after that the widow of N\u00e1ryan R\u00e1o was with child. The ministers proclaimed the event during Raghb\u00f3ba's absence. He was defeated and fled to Surat.\n\nRahim Beg, Mirza, of Sardh\u00e1na, author of a small work on Persian and Arabic poetry, entitled \"Makhzan Shu\u00e1r\u00e1\" which he composed in the year 1852 A.D., 1268 A.H.

At this period the princes of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, from Bengal to Sindh including M\u00e1lw\u00e1 and Gujr\u00e1t, had been subdued by the victorious arms of the emperor Akbar; and R\u00e1j\u00e1 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, in order to avoid so unequal a contest, dropped the title of king, which his brother had assumed, and wrote a letter to Akbar, begging that he might be considered as his vassal and tributary. In order to convince him of his sincerity, he sent him many rich and valuable presents. After the death of Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h II, king of Ahmadnagar in the year 1596 A.D., 1004 A.H., the prince Mirz\u00e1 Mur\u00e1d and Mirz\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n the son of Bair\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, marched for the purpose of subduing the Dakh\u00edn.

His death happened on the 26th January 1597 A.D., 15th Jum\u00e1da II, 1005 A.H. after he had reigned 21 years. His body was carried to Burh\u00e1np\u00far, where he was buried with due honours.

He succeeded his brother in July 1689 A.D. On his accession Sambh\u00e1jj\u00ed in April 1680, was seized and sent to reside in one of the forts of the Karnatic, with a decent appanage, but without any power in the government, and there he continued to reside till the death of his brother (July 1689) when he was acknowledged his successor. In his time the fortress of S\u00edt\u00e1ra was taken by 'Alamg\u00edr on the 21st April, 1700 A.D., 13th Zil-K\u00e1'd\u00e1 1111 A.H., but before it fell, R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m died of the small-pox the same year at Jhinj\u00ed. He was succeeded by his son Karan, who survived him but a few days, when another son of his, named Soiwa an\ninfant only two years old was put on the masnad under the guardianship of R\u00e1m Ch\u00e1nd Pandit and regency of his mother, T\u00e1r\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed. But when, after the death of 'Alamg\u00edr, R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1h\u00fa or S\u00e1h\u00ed II, was released from confinement, he was put aside, and S\u00e1h\u00ed was crowned at Sit\u00e1ra in March 1708 A.D.\n\nList of R\u00e1j\u00e1s.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1s of Berar or N\u00e1gpur, vide Raghoji Bhosla I.,\nof Chittour and N\u00e1gpur, vide R\u00e1ma Sanka or M\u00e1ldeo R\u00e1o,\nof Gw\u00e1l\u00edar, vide R\u00e1noji Scindia,\nof Jaipur or Jaingar, vide Bih\u00e1ri Mal or Sandhal deva,\nof M\u00e1lw\u00e1 or Indor of the Holkar family, vide Mah\u00e1ir R\u00e1o I.,\nof M\u00e1rw\u00e1r or Jodhpur, vide Jodh\u00e1 R\u00e1o and M\u00e1ldeo R\u00e1o,\nof Bharptpur, vide Ch\u00faraman J\u00e1t,\nof Sit\u00e1ra, vide S\u00e1h\u00ed,\nof Indor vide Mah\u00e1ir Sol Holkar I.\n\nRaj Indar Goshain, \u0631\u0627\u062c \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u06af\u0648\u0634\u0627\u06cc\u0646, chief of a sect of Hind\u00fa ascetics who used to go about stark naked.

Neither the precise period, nor the causes which led him to abjure the religion of his fathers now appear; but he steadily denounced idol-worship, and suffered on this account great persecution from the Br\u00e1hmans. On quitting the place of his nativity in 1750 A.D., he wandered over the country, and eventually repaired to Bhiwi\u00e1ra, in the Udaipur territory, where, after a residence of two years, Bhir Singh, R\u00e1na or prince of that state, was urged by the priests to harass him to a degree which compelled him to abandon the town. The chief of Sh\u00e1hpura offered the wanderer an asylum at his court, where he arrived in the year 1767 A.D., but he does not seem to have settled there permanently until two years later, from which time, it may be proper to date the institution of the sect. R\u00e1m Charan expired in April, 1798 A.D., in the 79th year of his age, and his corpse was reduced to ashes in the great temple at Sh\u00e1hpura. R\u00e1m Charan composed 36,250 Sabds or hymns, each containing from five to eleven verses. He was succeeded in the spiritual directorship by R\u00e1mjan, one of his twelve disciples. This person died at Sh\u00e1hpura in 1809 A.D. after a reign of 12 years 2 months and 6 days. He composed 18,000 Sabds. The third hierarch, Chitra D\u00e1s succeeded him and died in 1824 A.D. He wrote 10,000 Sabds, and about 4000 S\u00e1kti or epic poems, in praise of men eminent for virtue not only of his own faith, but among Hind\u00fas, Musalmans and others. After him Chitra D\u00e1s ascended the guddi, and died in 1831 A.D. He is said to have composed 1000 Sabds, but would not permit their being committed to paper. N\u00e1r\u00e1y\u00e1n D\u00e1s the fourth in descent from R\u00e1m Charan, succeeded him and was living in 1835 A.D.

He obtained an appointment in the Customs Department at Benares which gave him 1,200 rupees a year. He is the author of several Masnav\u00eds such as \"Muht\u00ed-l-Ishk,\" \"Muht\u00ed-l-Dard,\" \"Muht\u00ed-l-Gh\u00e1ni,\" &c. He also translated some books on mysticism from the Sanskrit, as \"Muht\u00ed-ul-Iftak\u00e1\u00ed,\" \"Muht\u00ed-ul-Ashr\u00e1,\" \"Gulsh\u00e1n-i-Ma'rif\u00e1t,\" \"Muht\u00ed Ma'rif\u00e1t,\" &c.\n\nRamji, \u0631\u0645\u06cc \u062c\u06cc, son of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhagw\u00e1n D\u00e1s the uncle of the celebrated R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Singh. He, together with his two brothers, Bijji R\u00e1m and Say\u00e1m R\u00e1m, was crushed to death under the feet of an elephant by order of the emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr in the early part of his reign.\n\nRam Mohan Rao, \u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0648\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627\u0624, afterwards R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m Mohan R\u00e1o, a Br\u00e1hm\u00e1n of a respectable family in Bengal, whose birth and mission are briefly stated in Maundur's Biographical Treasury, was early celebrated for his precocious genius, high linguistic attainments, and other natural gifts which in his after-life procured for him the reputation of a reformer. Among several other reforms, the degenerate state of Hind\u00faism demanded his earliest attention, and he with his wonted zeal and assiduity, took upon himself to introduce a reform which at the risk of his purse and reputation, he succeeded in a great measure in affecting among his former co-religionists. His object was to reconstruct and varnish the old Hind\u00faism, and not to abandon it altogether as some of the modern pseudo-reformers propose. He picked up morals and precepts from the Vedas, Dus\u00e1sanas and Upanishads, which he thought most appropriate and instructive; but never accepted them as revelations. He likewise borrowed rules and precepts from other religions, but more particularly from Christianity. His originality of mind, his natural logical powers, his mastery of mental and moral philosophy, and above all his ardent desire to establish the true knowledge of God among his countrymen, made him discard all the prevailing religions of the world as revelations. When in England, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 always\nattended the Unitarian church and much approved of its doctrines. He embarked for England and arrived at Liverpool on the 8th April, 1831 A.D., and died at Stalynton Grove near Bristol, while on a visit to that country, for the purpose of giving information and of promoting the interests of his countrymen, by advocating a more liberal intercourse with India. After his death his followers in Bengal strictly adhered to the faith, and multiplied in number by thousands. The works of Sir W. Hamilton and Bishop Berkeley have also become their guides in points of philosophy. In a word the Brahmins are not idolaters, as considered by some, nor infidels as supposed by many. They are rather the religious and enlightened people of the age as they consider themselves. Raja Ram Mohan translated the Upanishads of the Yajur Veda according to the Comment of Shankar Acharya into English, establishing the unity and incomparability of the Supreme Being, whose worship alone can tend to eternal beatitude. A translation of the Vedant (an abridgment of all the sacred writings) in Hindustani and Bengali, was made by this Hindu philosopher and philanthropist. The Raja also published an abstract of it in English. His tomb is in Arno's Vale cemetery in Bristol.\n\nRamraj, \u0631\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062c, a Raja of Bijj\u00e1nagar or Bijj\u00e1nagar, who was slain in battle against the four Muhammadan princes of the Dakhin. This celebrated action took place on the banks of the Krishna river on Friday the 23rd of January 1656 A.D., 20th Jum\u00e1da II, 972 A.H. It cost Ramraj his life, and ended in the defeat of the Hindu army with the loss of nearly one hundred thousand men. Ramraj being defeated, was taken prisoner and brought before Hussain Nizam Shah who ordered his head to be struck off, and caused it to be placed on the point of a long spear to be announced to the army; and afterwards kept at Bijj\u00e1npur as a trophy.\n\nRam Narayan, Raja, \u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0646\u0627\u0631ayan, He was deputy governor of Patna in the time of Mir Ja'far 'Ali Khan the Nawab of Bengal. Mir K\u00e1sim 'Ali, on his accession to the masnad in 1760 A.D., 1174 A.H., having detected embezzlements of large sums from the revenues, the jagirs, and pay of the troops, confiscated its effects. About seven lacs of rupees in money and goods were found in his house, and nearly the same sum was recovered from persons to whom it had been entrusted by himself and his women. He was then kept in confinement with several others on suspicion. In August 1763 A.D., Muhrurr\u00e1m, 1177 A.H., a few days before Mir K\u00e1sim 'Ali's defeat by the English on the banks of the Udwa nala, he commanded these persons to be put to death, and Raja Ram Narayan was drowned in the Ganges with a bag of sand tied round his neck. Ram Narayan was a Persian scholar and wrote poetry in Persian and Urdu, having adopted the word \"Mauz\u00fcn\" for his poetical name.\n\nRamraja, \u0631\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0627, succeeded S\u00e1hih II as Raja of Sit\u00e1ra in December, 1749 A.D.

He poisoned Bakhat Singh his uncle, and usurped the throne. At his death 1773 A.D., disorganization prevailed in M\u00e1rwar, promoted by the Marhattas, who then got footing in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and by the evils generated by its feudal institutions. At Tonga, however, the Rathors defeated De Boigny, the celebrated general of Scindia; but they were crushed at the subsequent battles of P\u00e1tan and Mairta by the reigning prince Bijai Singh.\n\nRam Singh I, \u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0633\u0646\u06af \u0627\u0648\u0644, Raja of Jaipur, he was honoured after the death of his father Raja Jai Singh I, by the emperor 'Alamgir in 1666 A.D. with the title of Raja, and put in possession of his father's territories.

He rebelled against the emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr for some time, but was at last compelled by force of arms to acknowledge fealty to the throne of Delhi. The emperor ordered to be cut in marble, the images of Amar Singh and his son Karan, which, when finished and brought to him, he took to Agra and placed in the garden-seat, called Jharokha Darsh\u00e1n, where the people assembled every morning to pay their respects to the emperor.

His son Udai Singh is the founder of the capital Udaipur. The Udaipur chief is, in the estimation of all the Hind\u00fa\ndynasties of India, par excellence the head, without a rival and free from stain. It is true that the independence of the \"great R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Chittour\" was assailed by the Moguls, and that they succumbed to circumstances; but they never acknowledged a superior in birth or descent. The family dates back upwards of a thousand years. It was in 1614 A.D., in the reign of the emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, that the house was first compelled by force of arms to surrender that complete independence it had then maintained for eight hundred years, and was acknowledge fealty to the Mogul of Delhi. In 1512 we first hear of the renowned R\u00e1na Sang\u00e1 of Chittour. His army consisted of 80,000 horse, supported by 500 war elephants. Seven R\u00e1j\u00e1s of the highest rank, and a hundred and thirteen of inferior note attended his stirrup in the field. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jaipur and M\u00e1rw\u00e1r served under his banner, and he was the acknowledged head of all the R\u00e1jput tribes. In 1527 A.D. he espoused the cause of the dethroned dynasty of Delhi. All the princes of R\u00e1jput\u00e1n ranged themselves under his banner, and he advanced with 100,000 men to drive Babar across the Indus. The first conflict took place at Biana where the advanced guard of the Moguls was totally routed by the R\u00e1jputs. In 1568 A.D. Udai Singh, the son of R\u00e1na Sang\u00e1, came under the displeasure of Akbar. He fled and left the defence of his capital Chittour to R\u00e1ja Jaimal who was killed by Akbar himself. His death deprived the garrison of all confidence, and they determined to sell their lives as dear as possible. The women threw themselves on the funeral pile of the R\u00e1ja, and the men rushed frantically on the weapons of the Moguls and perished to the number of 8000. In 1614 Part\u00e1p Singh resigned and recovered the greatest portion of his dominion before Akbar died. In 1675 A.D. Aurangz\u00e9b marched against Udaipur and succeeded in subjugating it, but the alienation of the R\u00e1jputs from the Moguls was momentary, and recovery ensued. The great boons of the chiefs of Udaipur in that their house never gave a daughter to the Mogul zenana. Jaipur and Jodhpur did, and gloried in these imperial alliances as conferring additional dignity on their families.\n\nList of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Udaipur.\n\n| R\u00e1na S\u00e1nk\u00e1 | died 1528 |\n| Udai Singh, son of R\u00e1na S\u00e1nk\u00e1 | |\n| Part\u00e1p Singh, son of Udai Singh | 1594 |\n| Amar Singh, son of Part\u00e1p Singh | 1619 |\n| Karan, son of Amar Singh, embellished Udaipur | |\n| Jagat Singh, son of R\u00e1na Karan, tributary to Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n | 1652 |\n| R\u00e1j Singh, son of Jagat Singh | 1680 |\n| Jai Singh, son of R\u00e1j Singh | |\n| Amar Singh II. | |\n| Sangram Singh | |\n| Jagat II pays chouth to the Marhattas |\n\nRanbir Singh, Maharaja, the present independent ruler of Kashmir, is the son of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Gul\u00e1b Singh whom he succeeded about the month of July or August, 1857 A.D.\n\nRanchhor Das, a learned K\u00e1yeth of Jaump\u00far, and author of a work on the art of writing prose and poetry, entitled \"Da\u00e1k\u00e1ch-ul-Insh\u00e1,\" which he wrote in the year 1732 A.D., 1145 A.H.\n\nRandhir Singh, the J\u00e1t R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bhartp\u00far, was the eldest son of Ranjit Singh whom he succeeded.

From this inferior station he gradually rose, and afterwards accompanied the Peshw\u00e1 in the expedition which was undertaken at the close of the reign of R\u00e1ja Sah\u00faji against the province of Malw\u00e1.

He was born in the city of Hamd\u00e1n in 1247 A.D., 645 A.D., was by profession a physician, and it was probably from his skill in the science of medicine that he procured office under the Tartar Sultan of Persia. He spent most of his life in the service of Ab\u00fa Kh\u00e1n, king of Persia. At a subsequent period Gh\u00e1z\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, who was a friend of literature, appointed him to the post of Waz\u00edr in 1298 A.D., 697 A.H. in conjunction with Sa'd-uddin who became his enemy. Rashid-uddin was maintained in his office by Alj\u00e1it\u00fa, surnamed Khud\u00e1 Banda, the brother and successor of Gh\u00e1z\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, and was treated by him with great consideration and rewarded with the utmost liberality. Rashid-uddin in his first rupture with Sa'd-uddin, was compelled in self-defence to denounce him, and to cause him to be put to death. Amir 'Ali-Sh\u00e1h J\u00fab\u00e1n a person of low origin, was appointed Sa'd-uddin's successor at Rashid-uddin's request, but they soon fell out, and shortly after the death of Alj\u00e1it\u00fa who was succeeded by his son Sultan Ab\u00fa Sa'id, Amir 'Ali Sh\u00e1h so far succeeded in prejudicing the Sultan against the old minister, that he was removed from the wizar\u00e1t in 1317 A.D., 717 A.H. A short time afterwards he was recalled, but it was not long before he again lost favour at court, and was accused of causing the death of his patron Alj\u00e1it\u00fa Kh\u00e1n. It was charged against him that he had recommended a purga-\ntive medicine to be administered to the late king, in opposition to the advice of another physician, and that under its effects the king had expired. He was condemned to death, and his son Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, the chief butler, who was only 16 years old, and by whose hands the potion was said to have been given to the king, was put to death before the eyes of his parent, who was immediately afterwards cloven in twain by the executioner. His head was borne through the streets of Tabriz, and proclaimed by the public crier as the head of a Jew. Rash\u00edd-ud-d\u00edn was 73 years old when he died, and his death occurred on the 19th July, 1318 A.D., 17th Jum\u00e1da I, 718 A.H. His eldest son Ghay\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn was subsequently raised to the same dignities as his father, and met with an equally tragic death. Amir 'Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h continued by his address to maintain his high honours and the favour of his master for the space of six years when he died; being the only Wazir, since the establishment of the Mongol monarchy, who had not met with a violent death.

He held at his father's death, 1092 A.D., the government of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and took little concern in the troubles that ensued on that event; but after the death of his brother, Sult\u00e1n Muhammad, he may be deemed the actual sovereign of Persia. He forced Bahr\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h, a monarch of the race of Ghazni, whose capital was L\u00e1hor, to pay him tribute; and Al\u00e1dd\u00edn, prince of Gh\u00f3or, who had defeated Bahr\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h and taken Ghazni, yielded in his turn to the superior fortune of Sanjar, by whom he was defeated, made prisoner and tributary to the house of Salj\u00fak.

He next marched, 1153 A.D., 548 A.H., against the Turkman chief Ghuz who had withheld his usual tribute of 40,000 sheep: an action unusual, in which he was defeated and taken prisoner. During his long confinement of four years, his dominions were ruled by his favourite Sult\u00e1n Kh\u00e1tam Turk\u00e1n: at whose death in 1156 A.D., 551 A.H., Sanjar made an effort to escape and was successful; but he lived only a short time after he regained his liberty, for he died on Friday the 24th May, 1157 A.D., 11th Rab\u00ed' II, 552 A.H., in the 73rd year of his age, and was buried in Marv. The Salj\u00fak dynasty in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n ceased with his existence, and most part of his kingdom fell into the possession of Khw\u00e1rizm Sh\u00e1h Atsiz ibn-Muhammad ibn-Anushtakim the grandfather of Takash Khw\u00e1rizm Sh\u00e1h.

Rather was appointed to succeed him, Sarbaland Kh\u00e1n made some opposition to his successor, but was defeated and prevented from coming to court by the emperor. He was, however, after some time appointed governor of Allah\u00e1bd, 1732 A.D., 1145 A.H., when he deputed his son Kh\u00e1n\u00e1z\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n to command, himself residing at court.

He was the uncle of Shaikh Jun\u00e1id as well as his master. The following anecdote is related on good authority: Sari Sakti said that for thirty years he never ceased imploring divine pardon for having once exclaimed, \"Praise be to God!\" and on being asked the reason, he said: \"A fire broke out in Baghdad, and a person came up to me and told me that my shop had escaped, on which I uttered those words, and even to this moment I repent having said so, because it showed that I wished better to myself than to others.\" He died on Wednesday the 9th of August, 870 A.D., 6th Ram\u00e1zan, 256 A.H., and is buried at Baghd\u00e1d.

The cause of this murder is thus recorded: \"'Al\u00e1-uddaula having accidentally met the niece of his waz\u00edr Mah\u00e1b\u00e1t Jang, a young lady who bore the repute of being the most beautiful woman of the age, first commanded, and then entreated, her to withdraw her veil, that he might enjoy one look at her face. The modest damsel, overwhelmed with confusion and terror, entreated the prince's pardon, and, pleading chastity, her veil was refused to gratify his curiosity; but he, being charmed with her exquisite grace and the delicious tone of her voice, was fired with a hasty determination, and himself withdrew the veil. He gazed in ardent admiration on her lovely countenance for a few seconds; then dropping the drapery, he asked forgiveness for his rudeness, and paying the beauty some princely compliment, passed on. The unhappy girl fled in tears, to her father, 'Ats\u00fallih, and to her uncle the waz\u00edr, and with mixed indignation and shame, declared the sad tale of her disgrace, and immediately afterwards destroyed herself with poison.

The absolute sovereignty of the fortress and city of Tanjore itself, were at the same time guaranteed to the prince.

He began life in an indifferent school for the character of reformer and saint, which he ultimately assumed, as a saw\u00edr serving with Amir Kh\u00e1n's free-booting horse in M\u00e1lw\u00e1. Quitting that service, he repaired to Delhi, and became a disciple of Sh\u00e1h 'Abdul 'Az\u00edz, a very celebrated devotee of the city; the fame of whose knowledge and piety has been widely extended throughout the side of India. It is frequently said by natives, that it was from Sh\u00e1h 'Abdul 'Az\u00edz that Sayyad Ahmad derived the peculiar opinions by which he subsequently promulgated, and the design which he adopted of preaching up a religious war. It is at least certain, that the chief of his first disciples, and the most constant associates of all his fortunes, were two near relatives of 'Abdul 'Az\u00edz, one his nephew, Maulv\u00ed Muhammad Ism\u00e1'il, author of the Sir\u00e1t-ul-Mustak\u00edf\u00edn, the other his son-in-law, and also partially a contributor to the book, named Maulv\u00ed 'Abdul H\u00e1\u00ed. By these persons, Muhammad Ism\u00e1'il is generally esteemed to have been a man of much talent and learning. The extreme honour which he and his brother Maulv\u00ed paid to Sayyad Ahmad, who was himself nearly illiterate, had a powerful effect in attracting towards him the respect of the vulgar. They rendered him almost menial offices, running, it is said, with their shoes off, by the side of his palankeen, when, he moved out with his servants. From his first leaving Delhi, he assumed the name of a religious teacher, and commenced spreading his religious doctrines. The general spirit by which these were animated (identical nearly with that of the tenets of the Arabian Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, of whom the sect of Sayyad Ahmad may perhaps be accurately termed an Indian imitation) was the ardent profession of Muham-madamism in its primitive simplicity and fervour, and the utter rejection of all idolatrous or superstitious innovations, whencesoever derived. The manner in which they were at first actually received was, however, highly favourable. When Sayyad Ahmad at last came down to Bengal, he had got together many followers, and had established an extensive reputation. He arrived in Calcutta with considerable means towards the end of 1821 A.D., and immediately a great majority of the Muhammadans of the place, of all ranks and stations, flocked to become, or to profess themselves, his disciples. In the early part of 1822, he proceeded with his friends, the two Maulv\u00ed's, to Mecca, from whence he returned in October of the next year, having touched for a few days at Bombay, where, with reference to the shortness of his stay, his success, in gaining numerous followers, was nearly as remarkable as in Calcutta. In December, 1823 A.D., he again started for Upper India. The next important event of his career, his commencing a religious war in the L\u00e1hor territories, did not occur till after a considerable interval, though the enterprise was one in which he had long openly announced his intention to engage. Its date is given in the \"Targh\u00edb-ul-Jih\u00e1d,\" or \"Incitement of Religious War,\" a little treatise written in Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed during the continuance of the struggle, by a Maulv\u00ed of Kanauj, with the view, as its name purports, of rousing the Faithful to rally round the standard which had been raised in the Panjab. \"The tribe of Sikhs,\" says the indignant Maulv\u00ed, \"have long held sway in L\u00e1hor and other places. Their oppressions have exceeded all limits. Thousands of Muhammadans they have unjustly killed, and on thousands have they heaps of death. The '\u00c1z\u00edz\u00ed have been free to murder, and the killing of cows, they have entirely prohibited. When at length their insulting tyranny could no longer be borne, Sayyad Ahmad, going to the direction of K\u00e1bul and Kandah\u00e1r, roused the Muhammadans of those countries, and nerveing their courage for action in the service of God, some thousands of believers became ready at his call to tread the path of God's service; and on the 21st December, 1826 A.D., 20th Jam\u00e1d\u00e1 I., 1242 A.H., the Jih\u00e1d against the K\u00e1f\u00edr Sikhs began.\" The events of this war were watched with a natural interest by the Muhammadan population of India generally, whether followers of Sayyad Ahmad or not. Many of the inhabitants of our Western Provinces went in bodies to range themselves under his standard; and his emissaries gathered large contributions of money and jewels, even from our own distant Presidencies, and from the principal Muhammadan towns of the Dakhin. The prominent occurrences of the war, the perseverance with which it was kept up, the temporary and occasional successes which Sayyad Ahmad met with, and his ultimate death in battle, are well known. With his death, the struggle appears to have entirely ceased.\u2014Journal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. I., p. 480.\n\nSayyad 'Ali or Sayyad 'Ali Hamdani, \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0647\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646\u06cc, a famous Sayyad who fled to Kashmir from his native city of Hamd\u00e1n where he had incurred the wrath of Amir Tim\u00far.

He flourished about the year 1670 A.D., 1081 A.H., and is the author of a D\u00edv\u00e1n.\n\nSayuf Zafar, Naubahari, \u0633\u06cc\u0648\u0641 \u0638\u0641\u0631 \u0646\u0648\u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631\u06cc, this is his correct name, however see under Saif-uz-zafar Naubah\u00e1ri.\n\nSayuti, \u0633\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u062a\u06cc, vide Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn Say\u00fat\u00ed.\n\nSidi or Sayyad Maula, \u0633\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627, a venerable sage, in a mendicant dress, who travelled from Jurj\u00e1n\u00ed towards the east and arriving at Dehl\u00ed, set up a great academy and house of entertainment for travellers and the poor of all denominations. Though he was very religious, and brought up in the Muhamm\u00e1dan faith, yet he followed some particular tenets of his own, so that he never attended public worship. He kept no women nor slaves for himself, and lived upon rice only; yet his expenses in charity were so great, that, as he never accepted any presents, men were astonished whence his finances were supplied, and actually believed, that he possessed the art of transmuting other metals into gold. He made nothing of bestowing two or three thousand pieces of gold to relieve the wants of any noble family in distress. In short, he displayed more magnificence in his feasts than the princes themselves. He expended daily upon the poor 1000 maunds of flour, 500 maunds of meat, 80 maunds of sugar, besides rice, oil, butter and other necessaries in proportion. He latterly began to bestow titles and offices upon his disciples, and to assume a tone and manner sufficiently indicative of his design on the throne. One of his followers dissatisfied with the part assigned to him, went privately to the king (Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn F\u00edroz Khilj\u00ed) and disclosed the plot. The king caused him to be apprehended and trodden to death by an elephant. This event happened in the year 1291 A.D., 690 A.H., and is accounted one of the most remarkable\nevents that took place in the reign of that monarch, for many believed him entirely innocent of the charge.\n\n**Sidi 'Ali Kapudan**, or Captain of the fleet of Sultan Sulaiman I, emperor of Constantinople. He is the author of the work called \"Mirat-ul Mumalik,\" or Mirror of Countries, containing a description of his journey overland from the Indian shores to Constantinople; and of the \"Muhif,\" that is the Ocean, a Turkish work on Navigation in the Indian Seas. This work the author finished at Ahmadabad the capital of Gujrat in December, 1554 A.D., Muharram, 962 A.H. It was translated by the Baron Joseph von Hammer, Professor, Oriental Languages, at Vienna, and communicated through the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1837.\n\n**Simi Naishapuri**, a very learned Musalm\u00e1n of Naishapur. It is said that in one night and day, he composed 3,000 verses.

See Kutrib.\n\n**Seindha**, for Raj\u00e1s of the Seindha family, *vide* Ranj\u00f3ji Seindha.\n\n**Seiwaji or Siwaji**, a celebrated chief of the Bhosla family and founder of the Marhatta States in the Dakhin, of whose origin we have the following account. Bhim Son, raja of Udaipur, the first in rank among the Hind\u00fa princes, had a son named Bh\u00e1g Singh by a concubine of a tribe very inferior to his own. On the death of his father, Bh\u00e1g Singh finding himself despised and neglected by his relations, the Sisodha rajas, who from the low caste of his mother, regarded him only as a bastard, and not of their tribe, became weary of the indignities shewn him; and moved from Udaipur to Kh\u00e1nesh where he embraced the service of a Zamind\u00e1r, named Raj\u00e1 'Al\u00ed Mohan. He afterwards retired into the Dakhin, where he purchased a tract of land near the present Marhatta capital of Puna, and settled upon it as Zamind\u00e1r, in which situation he died. Bh\u00e1g Singh had four sons, two of whom, Mall\u00faji and Bamb\u00faji, being of an enterprising spirit, entered into the service of J\u00e1lho R\u00e1e, a Marhatta chief of distinguished rank at the court of Bahadur Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h. Mall\u00faji had a son named S\u00e1hi or S\u00e1\u00faji who married the daughter of J\u00e1lho R\u00e1e, and thus the Bhosla family became incorporated with the Marhattas, and are commonly esteemed as such in Hindust\u00e1n. S\u00e1hi, after the death of his father, left Ahmadnagar with his followers and entered into the service of Ibrahim 'Adil Sh\u00e1h, king of Bij\u00e1pur, who gave him a j\u00e1gir in the Karnatic, with a command of ten thousand horse. Soon after this in May, 1627 A.D. his son Sew\u00e1ji, afterwards so celebrated in the Dakhin, was born, from the daughter of J\u00e1lho R\u00e1e Marhatta. S\u00e1hi having disagreed with his wife, sent her, with the infant Sew\u00e1ji, to reside at Puna, of which, and the vicinity, he had obtained a grant. Sew\u00e1ji though neglected by his father was properly educated, and at the age of seventeen excelled in every accomplishment. Military fame was his first passion; and the government of Bij\u00e1pur being now weakened by intestine divisions and the encroachments of the Mughals, he had soon an opportunity of signalizing himself among other rebels. He raised a banditti, and plundered the neighbouring districts, and having now taken possession of the j\u00e1gir, raised more troops, successfully levied contributions on several Zamind\u00e1rs, and much extended the limits of his territories. At this crisis the prince Aurangzeib, governor of the imperial territories in the Dakhin, was meditating the overthrow of his brother D\u00e1ri Shikoh, the favourite son of the emperor Shah Jah\u00e1n, who was now in a dangerous state of health. For this purpose he was preparing an army to march to Agra; and, observing the enterprising genius of Sew\u00e1ji, sent him an invitation to his service. Sew\u00e1ji pretending to be struck with horror at the rebellion of a son against a father, received the prince's messenger with indignity, drove him from his presence, and ordered the letter he had brought, to be tied to the tail of a dog. Aurangzeib for the present stifled his resentment, but never would forgive Sew\u00e1ji's insolence, and hence may be dated his tedious war in the Dakhin, and finally the ruin of the Mughal empire by the Marhattas. Aurangzeib having left the Dakhin in 1658 A.D., 1068 A.H., Sew\u00e1ji resolved to turn the inactivity of the imperial troops, and the weakness of the Golkanda and Bij\u00e1pur princes, to the utmost advantage. He took the strong fortress of R\u00e1igurh, which he fixed upon as the seat of his government. The Bij\u00e1pur government having in vain desired his father S\u00e1hi (who disclaimed all connection with him) to repress the excesses of his son, at length sent against him a considerable force under a general named Afzul Kh\u00e1n. Sew\u00e1ji with artful policy invited him to come and receive his submission. Afzul Kh\u00e1n advanced without opposition to his tent, when he was stabbed by the treacherous Zamind\u00e1r in embracing him. Upon a signal given, the Marhattas rushed from an ambuscade, attacked the unsuspecting army of Bij\u00e1pur, which, deprived of their chief, was quickly defeated. Sew\u00e1ji plundered their rich camp, and by this victory became master of all K\u00f3kan, the Zamind\u00e1rs of which flocked to acknowledge his authority, to save their possessions. The strong fortress of Sit\u00e1ra and other places also opened their gates to receive him. In the course of only three years, Sew\u00e1ji became a powerful prince, his authority being acknowledged over almost the whole coast of M\u00e1rwar. He built palaces and erected fortifications in every part of his country; gave much trouble to the emperor 'Alamgir; reigned more than twenty years, and left a character which has never since been equalled or approached by any of his countrymen. He died on the 14th April, 1680 A.D., 24th Rab\u00ed I, 1091 A.H., but according to Elphinstone's History of India, on the 5th April the same year, aged 53 years. His funeral pile was administered with the same sacrifices as had been devoted the year before to the obsequies of the Maharaj\u00e1 Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur; attendants, animals, and wives, were burnt with his corpse. He was succeeded by his son Sambha or Sambhaji.\n\n**Seoji or Shioji**, a grandson of the renowned Jaich\u00e1nd, the last R\u00e1thor monarch of Kanauj. He with a few retainers migrated in the year 1212 A.D., and planted the R\u00e1thor standard in M\u00e1rwar. His successors in process of time, by valour, and by taking advantage of the times, enlarged the state, and in 1432 A.D., J\u00f3dh\u00e1 Rao of M\u00e1rwar, founded the modern capital of Jodhpur, to which he transferred the seat of government from Mand\u00f3r. The name of M\u00e1rwar is a corruption of M\u00e1rduwar, also called Mar\u00fa-deis, or \"the region of death.\" Anciently, and properly, it included the entire western desert, from the Satluj to the ocean.\n\n**Shabib**, the son of Yezid, the son of N\u00e1\u00edm, was a Kh\u00e1rajite. It is related that his\nfather Yezid was sent by 'Usm\u00e1n the Khalif to assist the Syrian Muhammadans against the Greeks in the twenty-fifth year of the Hijra. The Musalm\u00e1ns obtaining the victory, the Christians were exposed for sale. Among the captives Yezid espied a beautiful maid, whom he bought, and married. She proved with child of Sh\u00e1hid, who was born on the 10th of the month of Zil-hijjah, being the day on which the pilgrims kill the sacrifices at Mecca. He opposed Hajjaj the governor of Mecca for a long time, and was at last drowned in a river. His body being drawn out, his head was cut off and sent to Hajjaj. This happened in 696 A.D., 77 A.H.\n\nShadan, \u0634\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0646, poetical title of R\u00e1e Chandra L\u00e1l, an Amir in the service of the Niz\u00e1m of Haidarabad.\n\nShaddad, \u0634\u062f\u0627\u062f, the Adite, was the son of 'Adand the first king of the 'Adites, a race of ancient Arabs; the smallest of their tribe is said to have been 60 cubits high, and the largest 100 cubits. 'Ad had two sons, Shadd\u00edd and Shadd\u00e1d; on the death of their father they reigned conjointly over the whole earth. At length Shadd\u00edd died, and his brother Shadd\u00e1d ruled after him. Shadd\u00e1d was fond of reading the ancient books, and when he met with descriptions of Paradise and of the world to come, his heart enticed him to build its like upon the earth. A pleasant and elevated spot being fixed upon, Shadd\u00e1d despatched one hundred chiefs to collect skilful artists and workmen from all countries. He also commanded the kings of Syria and Omnis to send him all their jewels and precious stones. Forty camel-loads of gold, silver, and jewels were daily used in the building, which contained a thousand spacious quadrangles of many thousand rooms. In the areas were artificial trees of gold and silver whose leaves were emeralds, and fruits consisting of pearls and jewels. The ground was strewed with ambergris, musk and saffron. Between every two of the artificial trees was planted one of delicious fruit. This romantic abode took up 500 years in the completion. To this paradise he gave the name of Ir\u00e1n. When finished Shadd\u00e1d marched to view it, and when arrived near divided two hundred thousand youthful slaves, whom he had brought with him from Damascus, into four detachments, which were stationed in cantonments prepared for their reception on each side of the garden, towards which he proceeded with his favourite courtiers. Suddenly was heard in the air a voice like thunder, and Shadd\u00e1d looking up, beheld a personage of majestic figure and stern aspect, who said, \"I am the Angel of Death, commissioned to seize thy impure soul.\" Shadd\u00e1d exclaimed, \"Give me leisure to enter the garden,\" and was descending from his horse, when the seizer of life snatched away his impure spirit, and he fell dead upon the ground. At the same time lightnings flashed, and destroyed the whole army of the infidel; and the rose-garden of Ir\u00e1n became concealed from the sight of man.\n\nIt was during the reign of Mu\u00e1w\u00eda, the first Khalif of Damascus, that some of the principal incidents connected with the Paradise of Shadd\u00e1d, are said to have taken place. This Paradise, though invisible, is still supposed to be standing in the deserts of Aden, and sometimes, though very rarely God permits it to be seen.\n\nCrighton, in his \"History of Arabia,\" says that \"The whole fable seems a confused tradition of Belus and the ancient Babylon; or rather, as the name would import, of Benhadad, mentioned in Scripture as one of the most famous of the Syrian kings, and who, we are told, was worshipped by his subjects.\"\n\nShadid, \u0634\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u062f, an eminent Musalm\u00e1n doctor and author who died in the year 1447 A.D., 851 A.H.\n\nShaf\u00e1'i, \u0634\u0627\u0641\u0639\u06cc, a poet who had assumed the title of Sult\u00e1n on account of his being a descendant of the royal race of Gihkars, whose territory was between the countries of the Panjab and Hasan Abdal.

In his youth he was a pupil of M\u00e1l\u00edk ibn-'Aus. His followers were at one time very numerous in Khuras\u00e1n; but at present his opinions are rarely quoted, either in Persia or India.

After the defeat of Sh\u00faj\u00e1-ud-daula's prime-minister, at Buxar on the 23rd October, 1764 A.D., 26th R\u00e1b\u00ed' II, 1178 A.H., and his flight to the upper province, the king followed the English to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d where he granted the East India Company the sanad of the Diw\u00e1n\u00ed of Bengal dated 12th August, 1765 A.D., 24th Safar, 1179 A.H., on the Company agreeing to pay the emperor 24 lacs of rupees annually from the revenues of the three provinces, viz., Bengal, Beh\u00e1r, and Ury\u00e1s. This important business being settled by Lord Clive, he returned to Calcutta, leaving General Smith to attend the emperor but in fact to rule him; for the General remained in the fortress, and his majesty in the camp; and the sound of the imperial mulets in the city being disagreeable to General Smith, he forbade the bard to play, nor did the servants of the court refuse. Sh\u00e1h 'Alam continued to reside at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d under the protection of the English till the year 1778 A.D., 1185 A.H., when growing weary of his retirement, he proceeded to Dehl\u00ed where he arrived on the 25th of December the same year, but not long after fell into the power of Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir Kh\u00e1n a Rohela chief, who put out his eyes on the 10th of August, 1788 A.D., Ramaz\u00e1n, 1185 A.H. Sh\u00e1h 'Alam after this event re-assumed the throne and died on the 19th November, 1806 A.D., 7th Ramaz\u00e1n, 1221 A.H., aged 81 lunar years. Sh\u00e1h 'Alam's poetical name was 'Af\u00e1'\u00edf. He was a good poet, and has left a Diw\u00e1n called Diw\u00e1n 'Af\u00e1'\u00edf, in Persian and Urdu verses. His remains were deposited close to the tomb of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h adjoining the Moti Masjid near the Darg\u00e1h of K\u00fatb Sh\u00e1h.\n\nShah 'Alam, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645, a celebrated Muhammedan saint, was the son of K\u00fatb 'Alam, which see.\n\nShah 'Ali, Hazrat, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a, a pious Sayyad who is the author of several works on religion, in Persian, Arabic, and Gujr\u00e1t\u00ed.

He passed the first part of his life as a Dervish or mendicant, but was afterwards employed by the emperor Akbar, and raised to the dignity of an Amir. He was appointed governor of Bengal in 1584 A.D., 992 A.H., and died in the 44th year of the reign of that monarch, 1590 A.D., 1000 A.H., aged 70 years. He was buried at Ajm\u00e9ir near the mausoleum of Khv\u00e1ja Mo'in-udd\u00edn Chisht\u00ed. His liberality and the money he expended was so great, that it made the people think that he had in his possession the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nShah Beg Arghun or Urghun, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u06cc\u06af \u0627\u0631\u063a\u0648\u0646, king of Sindh and founder of the Arghun family, was the son of Mirz\u00e1 Zunn\u00fan Beg Argh\u00fan, the commander-in-chief and head of the nobles at the court of Sult\u00e1n H\u00fasain Mirz\u00e1 king of Khuras\u00e1n, and governor of Kandah\u00e1r and the provinces of Sh\u00edl, Sit\u00e1mak and Argh\u00fan. Mirz\u00e1 Zunn\u00fan met his death in attempting to resist an invasion under Muhammad Kh\u00e1n Sh\u00e1hb\u00e1n\u00ed Uzbak. After his death the government of Kandah\u00e1r devolved on his son Sh\u00e1h Beg Argh\u00fan. When the emperor B\u00e1bar Sh\u00e1h invaded the province of Kandah\u00e1r, Sh\u00e1h Beg unable to resist him retreated towards Sindh, and having overcome J\u00e1m Fir\u00f3z the last king of the Sam\u00e1n\u00ed dynasty, 1521 A.D., 927 A.H., he settled himself as king in that country. His reign was, however, but of short duration, for he died two years and some months after the conquest, in the year 1523 A.D., 930 A.H., and his eldest son Sh\u00e1h Husain Argh\u00fan succeeded him.\n\nShah Begam, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u06cc\u06af\u0645, this was the title conferred on Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr on his first wife who was the daughter of Bhagw\u00e1n D\u00e1s the son of R\u00e9j\u00e1 Beh\u00e1ri Mal. She was married to prince Sal\u00edm (afterwards Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr) in 1584 A.D., 993 A.H., and became the mother of Sult\u00e1n Khusro who was born in 1587 A.D., 995 A.H. When Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr rebelled against his father Akbar, and was living independently at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d he gave himself up more than ever to debauchery. He had always entertained a peculiar dislike for his eldest son Sult\u00e1n Khusro whose own levity and violence seem to have given him reasons for his displeasure. Some circumstance in their disputes so affected Khusro's mother that she swallowed poison (opium) in 1603 A.D., 1012 A.H., and died at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d where she was buried in a place called Sult\u00e1n Khusro's garden, where her son Sult\u00e1n Khusro also was afterwards buried.\n\nShah Begam, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u06cc\u06af\u0645, a daughter of Muhammad Muk\u00edm, brother of Sh\u00e1h Beg Argh\u00fan, governor of Kandah\u00e1r and afterwards king of Sindh. She was married to K\u00e1s\u00edm K\u00f6k\u00e1, who was killed in the wars of the Uzbaks.

He was however defeated and slain in a battle against Sh\u00e1h 'Isma'il Safwi, in 1516 A.D., 916 A.H., when his skull was overlaid with gold, and made into a drinking cup by that monarch. After his death Taim\u00far Sult\u00e1n succeeded him and J\u00e1n\u00ed Beg Sult\u00e1n and 'Abdull\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n divided Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1 between themselves. The Uzbaks were Tartars who came from the borders of Russia, where they had been governed by a race of princes descended from Shaib\u00e1n\u00ed, the grandson of Changaz Kh\u00e1n; but they derived their name from Uzbak, the seventh of their race, who introduced the Muhammadan religion among them. The last prince of this tribe was Burg\u00fa Kh\u00e1n, who was slain by Sh\u00e1h Bakht, upon which the Uzbaks quitted their ancient habitation, and conquered Khuras\u00e1n, Khwarizm, &c.\n\nShahi, Mir or Amir, poetical name of 'Ak\u00e1 Malik son of Jam\u00e1l-udd\u00edn Firozkohi.

He wrote a beautiful hand, was a good musician and painter. He flourished in the time of Baisanghar Mirz\u00e1 and Sult\u00e1n B\u00e1bar, and died at Astrabad in 1450 A.D., 854 A.H., aged more than 70 years. He was buried at his own request at Sabzw\u00e1r.

After his death the government of Sindh was divided between two rivals, Mahm\u00fad the governor of Bakkar and Mirz\u00e1 'Isa Turkh\u00e1n governor of Thatta, who both assumed the title of king, and between whom frequent dissensions arose, and battles were fought. The emperor Akbar on coming to L\u00e1h\u00f3r reduced the whole of the province of Bakkar exclusive of the fort, till at last Mahm\u00fad was willing to give it up, and Akbar deputed Ge\u00eds\u00ed Kh\u00e1n to receive it, but Mahm\u00fad died before his arrival, 1574 A.D., 982 A.H., after a reign of 20 lunar years, and Akbar thus became possessed of Upper Sindh, and put an end to the hopes of the race of Mahm\u00fad.

In the year 1722, Mahm\u00fad, an Afghan chief of Kandah\u00e1r besieged Ist\u00e1f\u00e1n, and compelled Sult\u00e1n Husain to surrender and resign his crown to him. This circumstance occurred on the 23rd of October the same year 1135 A.H., and the unfortunate Sult\u00e1n was confined in a small palace, where he remained seven years; when a reverse of fortune which threatened their downfall led his enemies, whose chief was Ashraf the successor of Mahm\u00fad, to put an end to his existence. This melancholy event took place in November, 1729 A.D., 1142 A.H. The Safw\u00e1n family may be said to have actually terminated with Sult\u00e1n Husain. His son Tahmasp, assumed the title of king, and struggled for a few years with his fate, but a weak effeminate, and debauched youth, was unsuited for such times; and he only merits a place in history, as his name furnished a pretext for the celebrated N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h to lay the foundation of his great power.\n\nShah Husain Sayyad, vide Hak\u00edkat.\n\nShahidi, poetical name of Mir 'Abdul W\u00e1hid of Bilgr\u00e1m, which see.\n\nShaista Khan, Nawab, the son of Asaf Kh\u00e1n the prime minister.\n\nShahidi Kummi, an author who was a native of Kumm, and died in 1529 A.D., 935 A.H.\n\nShah Jalal, a Muhammadan saint of great sanctity, whose tomb is in Syl\u00e9th.

He was born at L\u00e1h\u00f3r on the 5th January, 1592 A.D., 29th Rab\u00ed I, 1000 A.H., and named Mirz\u00e1 Khurrum. His mother Balm\u00e1t\u00ed was the daughter of R\u00e1j\u00e9 Udai Singh, son of R\u00e1j\u00e9 Maldeo of Jodhpur, and sister to R\u00e1j\u00e9 S\u00far\u00e1j Singh. At the time of his father's death he was absent in the Dakhin, but the throne was secured for him by his father-in-law, 'Asaf Kh\u00e1n the w\u00e1zir, the brother of N\u00far Jahan Begam. He marched towards L\u00e1h\u00f3r on hearing of the throne being at his disposal; and began his reign 4th February, 1628 A.D., 8th Jum\u00e1d\u00e1 II, 1037 A.H. He was the most magnificent prince that ever appeared in India. The most striking instance of his pomp and prodigality was his construction of the famous Peacock throne. It took its name from two peacocks fashioned splendidly in sapphires, emeralds, rubies and other appropriate jewels which formed the chief ornament of a mass of bullion and precious stones that dazzled every beholder. Tavernier, a jeweller by profession, reports, that it cost nearly six millions and a half sterling. His greatest splendour was shown in his buildings. He founded a new city at Dehl\u00ed called after him Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d, but of all the structures erected by him, there is none that bears any comparison\nwith the T\u00e1j Mahal at Agra, a mausoleum of white marble decorated with mosaics, which for the richness of the material, the chasteness of the design, and the effect at once brilliant and solemn, is not surpassed by any edifice, either in Europe or Asia. T\u00e1j Mahal is a corruption of Mumt\u00e1z Mahal, the name of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n's favourite wife, whose sepulchre it forms. Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n reigned thirty years and was deposed and confined in the fort of Agra by his son 'Alamg\u00edr Aurangzeib on the 9th of June, 1658 A.D., 17th Ramaz\u00e1n, 1068 A.H., and died at Agra after an imprisonment of 7 years and 10 months, on Monday night the 23rd of January, 1666 A.D., 26th Raj\u00e1b, 1076 A.H., aged 76 lunar years 3 months and 17 days, and was buried in the T\u00e1j close to his wife's tomb. There were living at the time of his imprisonment, four of his sons and four daughters. Of the sons, the eldest was D\u00e1r\u00e1 Shikoh, the second Sultan Shuj\u00e1, the third 'Alamg\u00edr and the fourth Mur\u00e1d Baksh; but 'Alamg\u00edr, who succeeded his father, murdered two of his brothers, viz., D\u00e1r\u00e1 and Mur\u00e1d, and the third Sultan Shuj\u00e1 died in Arranum, or was murdered by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of that country. His daughters were Arjun\u00e1n 'Ar\u00e1, Geft\u00ed 'Ar\u00e1, Juh\u00e1n 'Ar\u00e1 and Dah\u00ed 'Ar\u00e1, (or Rosh\u00e1n 'Ar\u00e1).\n\nInscription on a gold coin of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n of enormous size and value struck in 1064 A.H.\n\nSh\u00e1h Karak, a celebrated Muhammadian saint who is buried at Kara, a city in the province of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and whose tomb is still held sacred by the Musalm\u00e1ns. It is mentioned by Firishta, that the day before the assassination of Sult\u00e1n Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn Firoz in 1296 A.D., Sult\u00e1n 'Ala-ud-d\u00edn visited this holy man, who rising from his pillows repeated the following extempore verses:\n\n\"He who cometh against thee, shall lose his head in the boat, and his body shall be thrown into the Ganges,\" which, they say, was explained a few hours after by the death of the unfortunate king, whose head fell into the boat upon this occasion. Sh\u00e1h Karak died between the years 1296 and 1316 A.D.\n\nSh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n Begam of Bhopal, succeeded to the principality of Bhopal on the death of her mother Sikandar Begam, on the 30th of October, 1868.

He died on the 20th December, 1434 A.D., 838 A.H., aged 124 years, and is buried at Mak\u00e1npur in Kanauj, where a great assembly is held every year at his tomb.

He was born at Sh\u00edr\u00e1h 1550 A.D., 957 A.H., came to L\u00e1h\u00f3r where he resided 60 years, and died there on Tuesday the 11th August, 1655 A.D., 7th Rab\u00ed' I, 1045 A.H., aged 88 lunar years. He is buried at a place called H\u00e1shimp\u00far near L\u00e1h\u00f3r. He had numerous disciples, one of whom was Mull\u00e1 Sh\u00e1h, the spiritual guide of the prince D\u00e1r\u00e1 Shikoh, the eldest son of the emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. He is the author of the work called \"Ziy\u00e1-ul-Ay\u00fan,\" or the Light of the Eyes, containing the rules for propriety of conduct through life.\n\nSh\u00e1h Mir, first Muhammadian king of Kashmir, The original inhabitants of Kashmir appear to have been the followers of Brah\u00e1. The period of the first establishment of the Muhammadian faith in that country took place during the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Seina D\u00e9va, about the year 1315 A.D., 715 A.H., when a person called Sh\u00e1h Mir, coming to Kashmir in the habit of a Dervish, was admitted into the service of that prince. Upon the death of the r\u00e1j\u00e1, he was appointed prime minister by his son and successor R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranjan. When this r\u00e1j\u00e1 died, Anand Dev, who succeeded him, also made Sh\u00e1h Mir his minister. The whole of this family not only gained great ascendancy over the r\u00e1j\u00e1 but also over the minds of the people, till the r\u00e1j\u00e1 becoming jealous of their power, forbade them the court. This exclusion drove Sh\u00e1h Mir into rebellion, when having occupied the valley of Kashmir with his troops, most of the officers of the r\u00e1j\u00e1's government also joined him. This insurrection soon brought the r\u00e1j\u00e1 to the grave, who died of a broken heart in the year 1327 A.D., 727 A.H., leaving his widow regent. Sh\u00e1h Mir after some years married a nobleman of the court of the emperor Akbar. He held the rank of 5,000, and was sent with prince Sult\u00e1n Salm\u00edn to Ajmeer accompanied by R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Singh, to chastise the Amirs under the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Udaipur in 1598 A.D., 1007 A.H. The emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr says in his Memoirs, that in the first year of his reign 1605 A.D., he gave the daughter of Mirz\u00e1 Hand\u00e1l, named Sult\u00e1n Begam, in marriage to Sh\u00e1h Kul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n Mahram, but his death is mentioned in another work, viz., \"M\u00e1sir-ul-Umra,\" to have taken place in the month of December, 1600 A.D., 18th Azar, 1009 A.H., at Agra.\nKaula Devi, the wife of the raja, who embraced the Muhammadan faith; an event which secured to him the country which he had before nearly usurped. It is related by another author, that when preparations for the marriage were commenced, the devoted princess despairing and indignant, surrounded by her train of maidens, advanced into the presence of the usurper, and upbraiding him for his ingratitude and treachery, stabbed herself before him. Thus perished by her own hand the last Hindu sovereign of Kashmir, and Shah Mir, who is considered the first Muhammadan king of that country, ascended the throne under the title of Sultan Shamsuddin, in the year 1341 A.D., 742 A.H. He died in 1344 or 1349 A.D., 746 or 750 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Jamshed.\n\nList of the Muhammadan Kings of Kashmir.\n\n1. Sultan Shams-uddin Shah Mir.\n2.

Mukarrak Shah, also called Nazuk and Barbak, son of Ibrahim, ascended the throne and after a reign of 3 months was expelled by the army of the emperor Humayun, who being defeated by Sheir Shah in 1541, had fled his country, and had retreated to Lahore, whence he sent an army under the command of Mirza Haidar Doghlat, who invading Kashmir, conquered that province, and reigned there 10 years.\n\nMirza Haidar Doghlat, after a reign of nearly 10 years, was killed in a night-attack in 1551 A.D., 958 A.H. After his death, the leading men divided the country into three principalities among themselves, though for form's sake, Nazuk, the son of Ibrahim, was again seated on the throne, and was again deposed the second time, by his brother.\n\nIbrahim II was placed on the throne by Danlat Chak, and after a short time was deposed and blinded, and his brother Ismail was raised to the throne in 1556.

Ghazi Chak declared himself king and assumed the title of Ghazi Shah, and reigned 4 years, when being attacked with a leprosy, abdicated the throne in 1563 A.D. Husain Shah, his brother mounted the throne, reigned 6 years and was compelled to abdicate in favour of his brother 'Ali Khan in 1569 A.D.\n\n'Ali Shah ascended the throne in 1569, and in the year 1572, Mullu Ishki and Kazi Sadruddin came as ambassadors from the court of Delhi, the result of which was that Akbar was proclaimed emperor of Kashmir in the public prayers; and 'Ali Shah at the request of Akbar, sent his niece the daughter of his brother Husain Shah to be married to the prince Salim.

Yakub was defeated and at last seized and sent to Delhi in 1588, where Akbar enrolled Yusuf Shah and his son Yakub among the nobles of his government. Each of them received estates in the province of Behar, and from that period the kingdom of Kashmir has been a province of Delhi.\n\nShah Muhammad, Khaliifa, author of the book called \"Insha'e Jama-ul-Kawani,\" commonly called \"Insha'e Khaliifa,\" containing forms of letters.\n\nShah Murad, vide Murad Mirza.\n\nShahnawaz Khan, son of Abdul Rahim Khan Khani Khanan.

But the author of the Masir-ul-Umra says that he was the son of Mirza Rustam Kandahari. He was appointed governor of Gujrat in the room of the prince Murad Bakhsh who was imprisoned by order of his brother Alamgir in July, 1658 A.D. When Dara Shikoh through various adventures, after his flight from Multan, came to Ahmadabad Gujrat, Shahnawaz Khan, his maternal uncle was then in that city, and his daughter the wife of Murad Bakhsh was in his palace. Her bitter supplications against Alamgir, the impending murderer of her husband, prevailed on him to join the cause of Dara, for whom he levied an army, and marched with him towards Ajmer where on their arrival a bloody battle ensued between the armies of Dara and Alamgir, on Sunday the 13th of March, 1659 A.D., June 2nd, 1659 A.H., which ended in the defeat and flight of Dara and death of Shahnawaz Khan, who fell by the lance of Dileir Khan. He was buried by the orders of Alamgir in the mausoleum of Khwaja Mo'inuddin Chishti at Ajmer.\n\nShahnawaz Khan, a nobleman of Shah Alam's court, author of the book called Miraat-e-Aftabnumai a work on the history of Modern Dehl.\n\nShahnawaz Khan, entitled Samsamuddaula. The original name of this nobleman was Abdul Razzaq; he was descended from the family of Sadat of Khurasaan, but his great-grand-\nfather Amir Kamaluddin left Khawas, and came to Hindustan in the reign of the emperor Akbar, when he was admitted amongst the nobles of the court of Delhi. Mirak Hussain, the son of Kamaluddin held a situation in the service of the state, in the reign of Jahangir. The son of Mirak Hussain, Mirak Mo'inuddin, commonly called Amnat Khan, was in great favour with Shah Jahangir, and rose to the first rank. He retained also the patronage of Alamgir, was appointed by him to various important governments as those of Lohar, Multan, Kabul and Kashmir. Amnat Khan was the ablest man in the court, and a great favourite of Alamgir. When the emperor resided in Upper India, he bestowed the Subedar of the Dakhin on Khan Jahangir Bahadur Kokaltash about the year 1670 A.D., 1081 A.H., and Amnat Khan was appointed Diwan of the Dakhin or Paymaster General, and Historiographer. He had four sons of eminent character; the first Abdul Kadir Dayanat Khan, was the keeper of the Privy Purse. The second Mir Hussain Amnat Khan, was the public treasurer and Governor of Surat; after his death the latter post was assigned to his elder brother. The third son was Mir Abdul Rahman Wizirat Khan who was promoted to the Diwan of Multan and Bijapur. He was an excellent poet and composed a Diwan under the poetical title of Birkum. The fourth son Kasim Khan was Diwan of Multan. Mir Hasan Ali the son of Kasim Khan was the father of Nawab Samsamuddaula Shahnawaz Khan. He was born on the 10th of March, 1700 A.D., 29th Ramazan, 1111 A.H. at Lohar, but repaired to Aurangabad at an early age, and took up his abode with his relations and kinsmen who resided there before him. He was engaged first by Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah under whom and his son Nasir Jung he served as Diwan of Berar for several years. In the time of Salabat Jung, he was raised to the rank of 7000 with the title of Samsamuddaula. On the 12th of May, 1758 A.D., 3rd Ramazan, 1171 A.H., the day on which Abdul Rahman Haidar Jung, the counsellor of Monsieur Bussy the French General, was assassinated by the instigation of Nizam Ali the brother of Salabat Jung, he also was murdered in the confusion together with his youngest son Mir Abdul Nabi Khan, but his two other sons, Mir Abdul Aziz and Mir Abdul Rai escaped. The remains of the father and son were interred in the tomb of their ancestor in the northern part of the city of Aurangabad. The chronogram of this event gives the following: \"We have been murdered by Abdul Rahman.\" Shahnawaz Khan is the author of the work called \"Masir-ul-Umra Taimuria\" containing the Memoirs of the nobility who served in Hindustan and the Dakhin under the house of Taimur. It was commenced by him, but he left it unfinished, and in the turbulent scenes which attended his death, the manuscript was scattered in various directions, and was considered as lost; some short time afterwards Mir Ghulam Ali Azad, a friend of his collected the greater portion of the missing leaves, and restored the work to its entire form with a few additions, amongst which was the life of the author: at a subsequent period again, his son Mir Abdul Hai Khan who had received the title of Samsamuddaula Samsam Jung after his father's death, completed the work in the form in which it now occurs, in the year 1779 A.D., and died on the 28th April, 1782 A.D., 15th Jumada I, 1196 A.H.\n\nShah Nur Ashhari, a famous poet who was a pupil of Zafaruddin Farzadi and flourished in the reign of Sultan Muhammad Khwairizm Shah son of Takash.

His father Razia Kulfi's mother Fatima Sultan Begum was the daughter of Shah Sultan Hussain Safvi. Shahrukh was raised to the throne some time after the death of his grandfather, but was soon after seized and deprived of sight. He proceeded to Mashhad, which province he was allowed to hold in his possession till the time of his death which happened at Damghan in 1796 A.D. His death was the consequence of the tortures that had been inflicted upon him by Akbar Muhammad, king of Persia, who by this act extorted from him many precious stones of great value which had once belonged to Nadir Shah.\n\nShahrukh, Mirza, \u0645\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0631\u062e, was the fourth son of Amir Taimur and held the government of Khurasan at his father's death which took place in February, 1495 A.D. After the imprisonment of Sultan Khalid his nephew, ruler of Samarqand, 1408 A.D., 811 A.H., he marched from Khurasan to take possession of his dominions. His authority was immediately acknowledged, not only in Samarqand, but over all Transoxiana. He was brave and generous, but not an ambitious prince; and during a reign of 42 years, we hear of no wars in which he was engaged, except with the Turkmun tribes of Asia Minor whose power Taimur had overcome, but not destroyed. Mirza Shahrukh was born at Samarqand on the 21st July, 1377 A.D., 14th Rabii I, 779 A.H., and died at Fishaward in the province of Rey, on the Persian new year's day, viz. Sunday, the 12th March, 1447 A.D., 25th Zil Hijja, 850 A.H., aged 71 lunar years. He reigned 42 years during which the conquests of his father in India seem to have remained in subjection to his authority. At his death he left 5 sons, viz. Mirza Ulugh Beg, Ibrahim Mirza, Mirza Baisangir, Sayyidghamsh and Muhammad Jugi. He was succeeded by his son Mirza Ulugh Beg.\n\nShahrukh Mirza, \u0645\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0631\u062e, a descendant of Amir Taimur, was the son of Ibrahim Mirza, the son of Mirza Sulaiman ruler of Badakhshan. His mother's name was Muhtaram Khanum. About the year 1575 A.D., 983 A.H., he forcibly took possession of Badakhshan from his grandfather and reigned there about 10 years, after which in 1585 A.D., 993 A.H., that province was conquered by Abdullah Khan Uzbek, and Shahrukh compelled to fly to India, where he was kindly received by the emperor Akbar, who gave to his daughter Shukran Niisa Begum in marriage in the year 1593 A.D., 1001 A.H., and raised him to the rank of an Amir of 5,000. In the time of Jahangir the rank of 7,000 was conferred on him. He died at Ujjain 1607 A.D., 1016 A.H., and was buried there.\n\nShahrukh Mirza or Mirza Shahrukh, \u0645\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0631\u062e, who had a Jagir in Gujrat, was murdered by his younger brothers in the year 1032 A.H.\n\nShahryar, \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0631, a king of Persia of the Sassanian race, who reigned in Persia a few months in 629 A.D., vide Sheiroya.\n\nShahryar, Sultan, \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0631, the youngest son of the emperor Jahangir, was married to a daughter of Nur Jahang Begum by her former husband Sher Afghani Khan. On the death of Jahangir in 1627 A.D., 1037 A.H., this prince who was then at Lohar, seized the royal treasure, bought over the troops, and forming a coalition\nwith the two sons of his uncle the late prince Dani\u00e1l, marched out to oppose 'Asaf Kh\u00e1n the waz\u00edr, who had released prince D\u00e1war Bakshh surnamed Bul\u00e1k\u00ed the son of Sult\u00e1n Khusro from prison and proclaimed him king. The battle ended in Sh\u00e1hr\u00fay\u00e1r's defeat, he fled but being given up by his adherents, was imprisoned and blinded. He was after three months put to death together with D\u00e1war Bakshh and the two sons of Dani\u00e1l, named Tahmur and Hoshang by order of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n who ascended the throne on the 4th February, 1628 A.D., 8th Jum\u00e1d\u00e1 II, 1037 A.H.\n\nShah Sadr, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0635\u062f\u0631, a Muhammadian saint whose tomb is situated at the foot of a large mountain of Siw\u00edst\u00e1n, at the distance of about 300 yards from the village of Lakki in Sindh which belongs to the Sayyads of that place. This famous saint, says Lutf-ullah in his Autography, originally came from Arabia, and brought thousands of infidels to the light of Isl\u00e1m from the darkness of idolatry in Sindh. The year of his death is not known, but his tomb was built here by order of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h, king of Persia, in 1155 A.H. Tradition states, that N\u00e1dir in a dream was invited by this saint to come to Am\u00e1rkote where he was to find a very large treasure. N\u00e1dir having acted upon the visionary command, discovered the treasure promised to him and received a very large amount, as a tribute from the Amirs of Sindh. N\u00e1dir then bestowed a large sum of money upon the Sayyads of the village, directed them to raise the edifice built over the remains of the saints. This they carried into execution, and the following inscription at the door of the shrine gives the date of its completion:\n\n\"I inquired of intellect the year of its date,\n\"Inspiration informed me, It is the Paradise of the members of the sacred house.\"\n1742 A.D., 1155 A.H.\n\nAll Sayyads of Sindh that are called Lakki Sayyads, are, I am informed (says Lutf-ullah) the descendants of this saint, whose parentage ascends up to the Im\u00e1m 'Ali N\u00e1ki. I am therefore inclined to think that the word Lakki is a corruption of N\u00e1ki, which is the name of the tenth Im\u00e1m.\n\nShah Sa'\u00ed, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0633\u0639\u06cc, grandson of Sh\u00e1h Abb\u00e1s the Great, king of Persia. His father's name was Saf\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 and his original name Bahr\u00e1n M\u00edrz\u00e1. He succeeded his grandfather in January, 1629 A.D., Jum\u00e1d\u00e1 I, 1038 A.H. and took the title of Sh\u00e1h Sa'\u00ed. He was a capricious tyrant; and every year of his rule presented the same horrid and disgusting scene of barbarous cruelty. All the princes of the blood royal, and almost every minister, or general of family or character, were either put to death, or deprived of their eyes, by command of this monarch. He reigned nearly 14 years, died in May, 1642 A.D., Safar, 1052 A.H., and was succeeded by his son, Abb\u00e1s II.\n\nShah Sharaf-uddin, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0634\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646, a Muhammadian saint who died in the year 1379 A.D., 781 A.H., and is buried in Beh\u00e1r, where his monument is still standing and is visited by the Muhammadians. There is an inscription in the K\u00e1f\u00ed character over the entrance to the dargah, which however time has rendered illegible with the exception of the date of the death of the saint, and of the erection of the tomb in 1569 A.D., 977 A.H. The dargah is held in great veneration by the Muhammadians who at the 'Urs or anniversary of the death of the saint, assemble from all parts of the country, it is said to the number of 50,000. He is also called Makh\u00e1d\u00edm-ul-Mulk Sh\u00e1h, Shar\u00edf-udd\u00edn and Shaikh Shar\u00edf.

He was sent to Kashmir by his brother Muhammad Sh\u00e1h and imprisoned in the fort of the Koh-i-Mar\u00e1n in 1812 A.D. from which place he was released in 1814 by Ranj\u00edt Singh and detained at L\u00e1h\u00f3r as a prisoner till his escape to the British territories. He was placed by the British Government on the throne of K\u00e1b\u00fal on the 8th May, 1839 A.D., and was murdered by his nephew, a son of Z\u00e1min Sh\u00e1h on the 2nd May, 1842 A.D. He is the author of a biographical sketch of his own life written at L\u00fadhiana in 1826-27. This work was translated by Lieut. Bennet, of the Artillery, and published in the Asiatic Journal, Vol.XXX, p.6, under Asiatic Intelligence.\n\nShah Shuj\u00e1', \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0634\u062c\u0627\u0639, Sult\u00e1n of the Muzaffarians whose capital was Sh\u00edr\u00e1z. It is said that this prince was in such a manner plagued by a malady called J\u00fan'l Bakar, or canine hunger, that he could not satisfy his hunger, neither on his journey, nor when he was at rest. He deprived his father Muhammad Muzaffar of his sight in 1359 A.D., and held the reins of government in his own hands. His brother Sh\u00e1h Mahm\u00fad of Isfah\u00e1n besieged Sh\u00edr\u00e1z in 1364, took possession of that country and died before his brother in 1375 A.D., 9th Shawwal, 776 A.H., after a reign of 16 years, Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1' died on Sunday the 9th of October, 1384 A.D., 21st Sh\u00e1b\u00e1n, 786 A.H. He was succeeded by his son Zain-ul-'Ab\u00edd\u00edn, who on the approach of Amir Taim\u00far to Sh\u00edr\u00e1z retired to T\u00edsh\u00e1r, where his uncle Sh\u00e1h Mans\u00far seized him and deprived him of his sight. Sh\u00edr\u00e1z was bestowed by Amir Taim\u00far on Sh\u00e1h Ah\u00eda the son of Muzaffar, but it was soon after taken by Sh\u00e1h Mans\u00far, in whose possession it remained till it was retaken by that conqueror in 1393 A.D., 795 A.H. There is a garden near Sh\u00edr\u00e1z called Haft-tan, which contains the remains of Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1', and has, on one side of it, a small building, ornamented with a variety of pictures.\n\nShah Suf\u00ed, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0635\u0648\u0641\u064a, a Muhammadian saint whose shrine is at a village called S\u00faff\u00edpur in the Pargana of F\u00edroz\u00e1b\u00e1d in Agra. It is related by the Kh\u00e1d\u00edms of the dargah that in the reign of the emperor Akbar, Sh\u00e1h Suf\u00ed a fak\u00edr of some celebrity wandered from Isfah\u00e1n to India, and took up his hermitage among the Jamna ravines near the city of Chandw\u00e1r, then the county town of the Pargana of the same name, and which from the remains which still cover the surrounding country for miles\u2014ruined mosques, dilapidated octagon mausolea, fallen entrance gates and such like works of costly strength, must have been an important post in a fiscal and military point of view. All the time from which the fable of Sh\u00e1h Suf\u00ed's miracles commence, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chandarsen was the lord of the fort of Chandw\u00e1r, and a troublesome tributary of the Delhi court. Non-compliance with the royal demands for payment of revenue brought upon the r\u00e1j\u00e1 the investment of his forces by the army of Akbar, who is said to have commenced his former invasion, and to have prosecuted his attack with no approach to success for a period, which the credulous or imposing Kh\u00e1d\u00edms of the establishment have exalted into a term of ten years. In the language of Oriental metaphor, the emperor is said to have planted a mango tree on the commencement of the siege, and to have eaten the fruit of it, ere his success was secured. This success he owed to the anchorate of the ravines Sh\u00e1h Suf\u00ed. During a severe land storm, the lamps of the entire camp were put out, and the light of the Sh\u00e1h's hut alone glimmered in the surrounding darkness. This extraordinary fact led to the Sh\u00e1h's being\nvisited by some of the courtiers. The miraculous character of the event being much commented on by the visitors, the Shah acknowledged himself to be under the special favour of Heaven\u2014and in the end the conversation turned upon the difficulties of the siege, and the grateful sense of the hermit's interference which the sovereign would entertain in the event of its being brought to a close by his holy means. The Shah promised the required aid, and declared that the fort should be captured by a fixed day. Thus much for the emperor. In respect to the raja, the Shah acted very effectually upon his superstitious fears\u2014told him that the fort was destined to fall, and proffered his own miraculous powers to secure for the raja, a safe and honourable retreat for himself, family and valuables. The whole were accordingly passed invisible through the besieging camps, and the raja quitted Hindust\u00e1n for the eastward. In return for this valuable service, the emperor bestowed half of an house of Chandra on the Shah. The place assumed the name of Safipur, and has since been inhabited by the descendants of the Shah. The decease of Shah Safi took place soon after the grant was made, and he was buried on the brow of a deep ravine, a handsome tomb being erected over his remains. The mausoleum is still in good order and forms a picturesque object in the midst of the desolation of the Jamna ravines in the vicinity of Chandw\u00e1r and Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d. Its pretty dome and minarets commanding as they do, the heights of the Jamna ravines, often lead the voyagers on the river to visit the shrine of the saint, and landwards the building is an object of interest and beauty, which (says Mr. Mansel, Collector of Agra in a letter to the Commissioner of Revenue at Agra 29th May, 1839 No. 125) all would regret to see lost to the country. There are several d\u00e1l\u00e1s, a handsome gate, and a small mosque comprised within the building, and the whole is kept in occasional good repair by the outlay of part of the funds of the grant.

In the contentions of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n's sons for the throne in 1658, he served with D\u00e1r\u00e1 Shik\u00f3h, whom he betrayed by giving intelligence and guides of Aurangzeb. He was appointed in July, 1659 A.D., governor of the Dakh\u00edn in the room of Muhammad Muazzam the son of the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr who was recalled to the presence, and in 1666 as governor of Bengal.

He is called Shamgir by Daulat Sh\u00e1h.\n\nShamru, Samru or Sombre. His real name was Walter Reinhard, a person of obscure parentage in the Electorate of Treves. He entered early as a common soldier the service of the French, taking for his Nom-de-Guerre, Sumner, which his comrades, from his saturnine complexion, turned into Sombre, and the Indians, by corruption, Samr\u00fa and Shamr\u00fa. At length he repaired to Bengal, and enlisted in one of the Swiss Companies then employed at Calcutta; but at the end of eighteen days deserted to the French at Chandernagar, where he became a Sergeant. Deserting this post, he fled into the Upper Provinces and was for some time a private trooper in the cavalry of Sarkar Jang, later to Shuj\u00e1-uddaula. This service he quitted, and led a vagabond life in different provinces; but in 1765 was with the rebel Faujdar of Purnia Kh\u00e1d\u00edm Husain Kh\u00e1n. Upon his being expelled from Bengal, Shamr\u00fa left him and entered into the service of Gregory, the Armenian, then in high favour with Naw\u00e1b K\u00e1s\u00edm \u2018Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n and distinguished with the title of G\u00f3rg\u00edn Kh\u00e1n. From him he had the command of a battalion of sepoys, and afterwards obtained from the naw\u00e1b the addition of another. In this station he massacred the English captives at Patna in 1765. Some time previous to the battle of Buxar, he treacherously deserted K\u00e1s\u00edm \u2018Al\u00ed with his corps, and embraced the service of the Naw\u00e1b Shuj\u00e1-uddaula, who had gained him over by bribes. Upon the naw\u00e1b\u2019s defeat at Buxar, he was entrusted with the protection of the Begams, and remained with the naw\u00e1b till he had made peace with the English; when, fearful of being delivered up to them, he retired to Agra, and entered into the pay of the J\u00e1t r\u00e1j\u00e1 Jaw\u00e1hir Singh; but quitted him for the service of the r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaipur, who soon dismissed him on a remonstrance from the English General. He then again served the J\u00e1tas; quitted them once more, and came to Delhi, from whence he followed the fortunes of Naw\u00e1b Najaf Kh\u00e1n, in whose service he died. Such are the outlines of the fortune of this man, who had some merit as a soldier, but wholly obscured by a treacherous and blood-thirsty disposition. His corps was continued after his death, in the name of his son and a favourite concubine, who received for their maintenance the sum of 65,000 rupees per month. He died or was murdered in the year 1778 A.D., 1192 A.H., at Agra, where his tomb is to be seen in the Roman Catholic Burial-ground with a Persian inscription in verse, mentioning the year of his death and his name. Vide next article.\n\nShamru Begam, the celebrated princess of Sardhana, whose original name is Zeib-un-Nisa, was the wife, or rather concubine of Shamr\u00fa or Sombre. She held an extensive jagir at Sardhana, and died on the 27th of January, 1836 A.D., 8th Shaww\u00e1l, 1251 A.H., aged 88 lunar years. She was buried in the church of Sardh\u00e1na of which she was the founder. She was one of the oldest and most sincere allies of the English. At her death she left upwards of six lakhs of rupees to various charitable and pious purposes, and gave instructions for founding a college for young men, to serve on the apostolic mission of Thibet and Hindust\u00e1n. Captain Mundy in his \u201cJournal of a Tour in India\u201d says that the history of her life, if properly known, would form a series of scenes, such as perhaps, no other female could have gone through.\n\nColonel Skinner had often, during his service with the Mahrattas, seen her, then a beautiful young woman, leading on her troops to the attack in person, and displaying in the midst of carnage, the greatest intrepidity and presence of mind. The Begam contracted a lawful marriage in 1793. Her first lord, Reinhardt, who bought her when a young and handsome dancing girl; married, and converted her to the Roman Catholic religion. Her second husband was a French adventurer, a soldier of fortune named Levassoult who commanded her small army. It is of this man that the following anecdote is related, which is wondrous strange, if it be true. Skinner used to say that her husband had become possessed of wealth, power, and a numerous army; of these his ambitious wife coveted the undivided possession, and she then accomplished her purpose. A mutinous disposition, on the subject of pay, having manifested itself among his body-guard, the Begam, then about twenty-five, exaggerated the danger to her husband, and got intelligence conveyed to him that the rebels had formed a plan to seize and confine him, and to dishonour his wife. They, consequently, arranged to escape together from the fury of the soldiery; and at night, started secretly from their palace, in palankeens. Towards morning the attendants, in great alarm, announced that they were pursued; and our heroine, in well-feigned despair, vowed that, if their escort was overcome, she would stab herself to the heart. The devoted husband, as she expected, swore he would not survive her. Soon after, the pretended rebels came up, and after a short skirmish drove back the attendants, and forced the bearers to put down the palankeens. At this instant he (Sombre) heard a scream and his wife\u2019s female slave rushed up to him, and exclaimed that her mistress had stabbed herself to death. The husband, true to his vow, instantly seized a pistol, and blew out his own brains. His tomb is at Sardhana.\n\nShamsheir Bahadur I, an illegitimate offspring of the Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1i R\u00e1o Marhatta by a Musal-m\u00e1n concubine named Mast\u00e1n\u00ed, who brought him up in the Muhammadan religion. He was severely wounded in that famous battle which took place between the Marhattas and Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Abd\u00e1l\u00ed in January, 1761 A.D., got to Dig where Sirajmal J\u00e1t had his wounds treated with the greatest care, but he died soon after, and was buried at Dig.\n\nShamsheir Bahadur II, Naw\u00e1b of Banda, was the eldest son of \u2018Al\u00ed Bah\u00e1dur, the son of Shamsheir Bah\u00e1dur I, the son of B\u00e1i R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1. He succeeded to the territories of his father in Bundelkhand about the year 1802 A.D., but subsequently a pension or stipend of four lacs of rupees annually was granted him in perpetuity by the British Government. He died on the 30th August, 1823 A.D., 24th Zil-Ka\u2019d\u00e1, 1238 A.H., and was succeeded by his brother Zulfiq\u00e1r \u2018Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n.\n\nShams Fakhri, a poet.\n\nShamsheir Khan, a nobleman at whose request a prose abridgement of the Sh\u00e1h\u00e1m\u00e1ma of Firduus\u00ed was made by Tawakkul Munshi in 1552 A.D., 1063 A.H.\n\nShams Shahab Afif, the son of Malik Sad-ul-Mulk who was Am\u00e1ld\u00e1r of \u00c1b\u00fahar and Dib\u00e1lpur in the reign of Sultan Ghay\u00e1s-udd\u00edn Tughlak. He was born the very day that Sultan Firoz Sh\u00e1h came into the world, i.e., in the year 1309 A.D., 709 A.H., and was the grandfather of Shams Sir\u00e1j Afif, the author of the Tar\u00edkh Firoz Sh\u00e1hi.\n\nShams Siraj Afif, the grandson of\nShams Shah\u00e1b Aff\u00edf, was an historian who flourished in the reign of Sult\u00e1n Firoz Sh\u00e1h B\u00e1rbak, king of Dehl\u00ed who reigned from 1351 to 1388 A.D. He is the author of the entire history of that monarch, called \"T\u00e1rikh Firoz Sh\u00e1hi,\" in which he relates that when that emperor built the city of Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d adjoining to that of (old) Dehl\u00ed in the year 1354 A.D., 755 A.H., he (the author) was then twelve years of age, and that the red stone pillar in the Koshak of Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d near the mosque or Jama Masjid, was brought by that emperor in the same year with great expense and labour from a place called Nauweira in the vicinity of Sitaura near Khirkih\u00e1ra, a city situated on the foot of a mountain, ninety fars distant from (old) Dehl\u00ed, where it then stood. The whole length of the pillar was thirty-six cubits, 32 gaz, 8 of which the king ordered to be buried in the earth or sunk in the building, and the remaining 24 to be above the surface. This pillar was called by the emperor, \"Minar Zarr\u00edn,\" i.e., the Golden Minar. The second pillar which the emperor set up within his hunting place, called Shikarg\u00e1h Firoz Sh\u00e1h, was brought from M\u00edr\u00e1th, and was somewhat smaller than the one just mentioned. This pillar is now called the L\u00e1th of Firoz Sh\u00e1h. These two pillars were even at that period, as they are now, believed by the Hind\u00fas to have been the hand sticks of a famous hero of antiquity named Bhim Sen. The character engraved round these two pillars, the most intelligent and learned men of all religions were not able to decipher. He also observes that the high Minar in the Jama Masjid called \"K\u00fawat-ul-Isl\u00e1m\" in (old) Dehl\u00ed was built by Sult\u00e1n Shams-udd\u00edn Alt\u00edmsh.

It was at his instigation that Karim Khan one of his confidants murdered Mr. W. Fraser the British Commissioner of Delhi, on the evening of the 22nd March, 1835 A.D., for which act Karim Khan was hanged on the 26th August following, and subsequently the nawab, who after a full investigation of the case, being found guilty, was executed on the 8th of October of the same year at Delhi. Nawab Shamsuddin was the Jagirdar of Firozpur, the town of a large district of the same name, situated at a distance of sixty miles to the south-west of Delhi. He enjoyed a revenue variously estimated at from three to ten lacs of rupees a year. The actual cause of his animosity towards Mr. Fraser, and the reason which induced him to instigate his murder, will perhaps ever remain a mystery. The supposition is, that Mr. Fraser had, in the faithful discharge of his duty, apportioned to Aminuddin and Ziyyuddin, the younger brothers of the nawab, a part or whole of Lohari, an extensive estate, to which the latter considered himself the best entitled.\n\nShams-uddin Khwaja, Khwaja, \u0634\u0645\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0629, the son of an Amir of Khawaf in Khurasan by name Khwaja 'Ala'uddin.

On the accession of Muhammad 'Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h to the throne in 1839 A.D., Maulv\u00ed Ah\u00eda was advanced to the post of prime-minister, vice H\u00e1kim Mahd\u00ed, deceased, and Sharaf-uddaula was appointed residency Wakil vice his uncle promoted. Maulv\u00ed Ah\u00eda dying soon after, Sharaf-uddaula succeeded him as prime-minister. He held the office up to the time of Muhammad 'Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h's death which took place in May, 1842 A.D., when Amj\u00e1d 'Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h succeeding to the throne, he nominated his favourite, Amin-uddaula to the premiership, obliging Sharaf-uddaula to retire. By the Resident personally the naw\u00e1b was so much esteemed that, after he lost office, he, the Resident, deemed him the fittest man in Lakhnau to manage the very responsible and important concerns of the Husam\u00e1b\u00e1d Im\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1rah, of which he induced the king to make him \"Was\u00edk\u00e1dar,\" or stipendary. Sharaf-uddaula was known by everyone to be the most sincerely attached friend the British had in Audh. He was, therefore, looked upon with much jealousy and rancour by all the courtiers, but especially by Naw\u00e1b 'Al\u00ed Nak\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, the father-in-law and prime-minister of W\u00e1j\u00edd 'Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h, the last king. Viewing him always as his rival, 'Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h often contemplated his ruin, and at one time in league with Naw\u00e1b Was\u00ed 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, one of the famous abominables of the court of Lakhnau, he would have compassed his end, as he had succeeded in getting the king to issue an order of banishment against Sharaf-ud-daula, with his whole family, but for the timely interference of the Resident who had the order revoked. During the early part of the rebellion (in 1857) the insurgents surrounded his house, insisting that he should become prime-minister of the rebel government. He refused and tried to excuse himself in every way, but they forcibly installed him in the office, which he knew he only nominally held, since Mamm\u00fa Kh\u00e1n was the ruling spirit with the Begam. On the arrival of General Havelock's force for the relief of the Lakhnau garrison, he was in the Keisar B\u00e1g\u00ed and received a bullet in the shoulder. When the final grand attack was made on the city by the Commander-in-Chief, which caused the Begam and her party to remove to the Mus\u00e1 B\u00e1g\u00ed, Sharaf-uddaula took advantage of the confusion and skulked behind, and endeavoured to steal out of the city, when he was recognised by some sepoys, who bound him with cords, took him to Maulv\u00ed Ahmad-ull\u00e1h Sh\u00e1h, who after starving him for four days had him put to death.\n\nSharif Jurjani, Mir or Sayyad, \u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u062c\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0623\u0648 \u0633\u064a\u062f, whose full name is Sayyad Shar\u00edf 'Al\u00ed bin-Muhammad, is the author of the \"H\u00e1sh\u00eda Kashsh\u00e1f\u00ed\" and \"Hash\u00eda Tafs\u00edr Anw\u00e1r-ut-Tauz\u00edl,\" also of an Arabic work on philosophy called \"Ad\u00e1h-ul-Shar\u00edf,\" and the marginal notes on the \"Sharah Matla-ul-Anw\u00e1r\" and on the \"Mawl\u00edk Azd\u00ed\" a work on Jurisprudence in Arabic.

The Greeks only describe her as a Roman by birth, a Christian by religion; but she is represented as the daughter of the emperor Maurice in\nthe Persian and Turkish romances, which celebrated the love of Khusro for Shirin, of Shirin for Farhad the most beautiful youth of the East. This celebrated beauty has been accused of giving those affections, which a monarch so anxiously sought, to the lowly Farhad, in whose breast her beauties kindled a flame, which deprived him of reason and life. We are told that the son of Khusro, after putting his father to death, sought the favours of his father's mistress; who appeared to consent, but desired to take one look at the remains of his father. The murdered body of her former lover was shown to her, and she immediately put an end to her existence by stabbing herself.

This book is of the highest authority on the law of inheritance amongst the Sunnis of India. It has been commented upon by a vast number of writers, upwards of forty being enumerated in the \"Kashif-uz-Zunnun\". The most celebrated of these Commentaries, and the one most generally employed to explain the text, is the \"Sharifa\" by Sayyad Sharif 'Ali bin-Muhammad-al-Jurjani. The original text of the \"Sirajia,\" together with that of the \"Sharifa,\" was published in Calcutta in 1829. A Persian translation of the Sirajia and Sharifa was made by Maulwi Muhammad Rashid by order of Warren Hastings, and published in Calcutta in 1812 A.D. The most celebrated Commentaries on the Sirajia next after the Sharifa, are, that by Shahabuddin Ahmad bin-Mahmud-as-Siwasi; one by Burhanuddin Haider bin-Muhammad-al-Hirwi; another by Shamsuddin bin-Hamza-al-Farahi; and lastly, a Persian Commentary entitled \"Al-Faroez-at-Tajifi Shurb Farnes-as-Siraj\" by 'Abdul Karim bin-Muhammad-al-Hamdani.\n\nSiraj-uddin Muhammad bin-'Umar Halabi, \u0633\u0631\u0627\u062c \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0644\u0628\u06cc, an author who died 1446 A.D., 850 A.H.\n\nSiraj-uddin Sawai, Maulana, \u0633\u0631\u0627\u062c \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0633\u0648\u0626\u06cc, one of the celebrated poets of Samauna a city in the province of Delhi. He is the author of the work\nSiraj-uddin called \"Khilji-nama.\" When Sultan Jalal-ud-din Firoz Khilji, before his accession to the throne, was governor of Samauna, the poet was ill-treated by some of his people, and as the Sultan took no notice of it then, he wrote the abovementioned book, in which he satirized the governor and the Khiljis. However the Sultan after his accession to the throne of Delhi in 1289 A.D. sent for the poet, and having tied a rope round his own neck presented himself like a criminal before the king, who embraced him and made him one of his principal confidants. The poet afterwards wrote several panegyrics in praise of the Sultan.\n\nSiraj-uddin Shaikh, \u0634\u06cc\u062e \u0633\u0631\u0627\u062c \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646\u060c a celebrated Muhammedan saint, whose relics are deposited in an island in the river Krishna near the town of Kurisi, in the district of Raebagh Bijapur, in southern Hindustan.\n\nSiraj-uddin 'Umar, \u0633\u0631\u0627\u062c \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631, who after the death of his brother Zain-ul-'Abidin Nujaim completed the work called \"Bahr-ar-Raek\" about the year 1562 A.D., 970 A.H., and wrote another but inferior commentary on the Kanz-ul-Dakai entitled the \"Nahr-ul-Faek.\"\n\nSiraj-uddaula Muhammad Ghaus Khan, \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u063a\u0648\u062b, nawab of Bengal, formerly named Mirza Mahmud, was the eldest son of Zain-ud-din Ahmad, styled Haibat Jang, the nephew and son-in-law of Alawardi Khan Mahabat Jang governor of Bengal. On the death of his grandfather Mahabat Jang, which happened on the 10th of April, 1756 A.D., 9th Rajab, 1169 A.H., he succeeded him in the government of that province, and immediately taking offence at the English, for their protection to a native officer, said to have escaped from Dacca with treasure, he attacked Calcutta, carried it on the 20th June the same year, and allowed his officers to shut up 146 European prisoners in a small military prison room called the \"Black Hole,\" in which 123 of the number, perished during the night. Mr. Drake the governor of Calcutta escaped on board a ship with a few Englishmen and retired to Madras. At that time Colonel Clive commanded the Company's forces in the province of Arcot. It was agreed by the government of Madras that he should appear with a force in Bengal and endeavour to regain the factory of Calcutta. Colonel Clive and Admiral Watson left Madras with 900 Europeans and 1500 sepoys. He reached Falta on the 20th December and re-took Calcutta on the 2nd January, 1757 A.D., 1170 A.H., and forced Siraj-uddaula into a treaty, offensive and defensive, on the 9th of February following. Clive, subsequently made a secret treaty with Mir Jafar, an officer of the Nawab, and advanced in June towards Murshidabad, the nawab's capital. On the 23rd of June, 1757 A.D., Clive fought the battle of Plassey against 18,000 horse and 50,000 infantry, and aided by the treachery of Mir Jafar, routed the Nawab's troops. Siraj-uddaula fled, but in a few days was seized and cruelly assassinated on the 4th July, 15th Shawwal, 1170 A.H., by order of Miran the son of Mir Jafar. Thus perished Siraj-uddaula in the 20th year of his age and the 15th month of his reign. On the 29th June Mir Jafar was raised to the masnad, and from that date, the influence of the British may be said to have become paramount in Bengal.

The names of Shori, Sayyad Ali, Lamai, Suriri and Shamai occur also as commentators on Hafiz; but Siddi excels all as an enlightened and accurate critic, not only on account of his eminent success in correcting the exuberances of this fanciful and extravagant mode of interpretation, but of the singular happiness with which he has illustrated the ambiguous and more obsolete allusions of the Poet.\n\nSufi, \u0635\u0648\u0641\u06cc, a sect among the Muhammedans. Kazi Nurullah of Shustar, a Persian author of very high reputation for his piety and judgment, has given an excellent account of the Sufis and their doctrine in the Majalis-ul-Mominin, a treatise on the Shia faith. \"The Sufis\" (he there says) \"are of two classes: those who desire human knowledge, and pursue it in the accustomed way, observing the common ordinances of religion, are called Mutakallam (advocates or observers); those who practise austerities and strive to purify their souls, are called Saffa.\" This word literally means, pure, clean. The celebrated Moulwi Rumi has the following play upon it in one of his lines. Sufi na Shadaw Saffi ta dar narasad jami. The Saffi will not be pure till he takes one cup. This is said to have a mystical meaning.\n\nSufi, Mulla Muhammad Sufi of Amol, \u0635\u0648\u0641\u06cc \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f, author of a \"Saki-nama,\" which he composed in the year 1592 A.D., 1000 A.H.\n\nSongsters, \u0633\u0646\u06af\u0633\u062a\u0631\u0647, celebrated Indian, vide Tansen.\n\nSurajmal Jat, \u062c\u0627\u062a \u0633\u0648\u0631\u062c \u0645\u062d\u0644, raja of Bharatpur, was the son of Badan Singh Jat whom he succeeded to the raja few years before 1750 A.D., 1163 A.H.

The mansab of 5,000 was conferred on him by the latter. He died in the Dakhin 1619 A.D., 1028 A.H., and Rajah Gaj Singh his son succeeded him; and as his father was uncle to the emperor Shah Jahangir on the mother's side, he was in a short time raised to the rank of 10,000. Gaj Singh died on the 3rd May, 1638 A.D., 2nd Moharram, 1048 A.H.

The satires of this poet are also numerous and admirable; but having created him many enemies, to avoid the consequences of their anger, he feigned himself insane, and took the poetical name of Soud\u0101 or madman, but he is frequently known by the appellation of \u201cMirz\u0101-ush-Shur\u0101,\u201d or king of poets.

He was captured in the jungles of Perone on the 7th, and hanged on the 18th of April, 1859. It is said that before his death he solemnly affirmed that he was the instigator of the Cawnpore massacre, and that the Nana who had sworn to protect the Europeans was angry with him for his conduct and never saw him afterwards. If true, this confession was made evidently with the view of saving the Nana, who could no longer injure himself. At his confession Tantia described himself as a Brahman of high caste, a native of Purna, which place he had left about 30 years before for Central India where he became an Artillery soldier (Topi). He next obtained employment in the Nana's establishment at Bithur in connection with the Treasury, and was so employed in 1857 when the mutiny broke out. He also said, that he commanded the rebel army of 8,000 men which attacked Colonel Greathed's column on the parade ground at Agra on the 10th October, 1857. He declared he was aware of the arrival of the column from Delhi before he opened fire on the encampment that morning, and did not suppose he had only the Agra brigade to deal with, as we imagined. He was deceived, however, after the action had commenced, by seeing a re-enforcement of European redcoats coming up (Greathed's men being dressed in Khaki) for whose appearance and apparent numbers (for they were reported to be 2,500 men) he could not account, but supposing them to be new arrivals from down-country, immediately retreated; otherwise he would have held his ground, and not have allowed Col. Greathed to win so easy a victory. Tantia also mentioned that the largest force he ever commanded was at the battle of Betwa when he had under him 22,000 fighting men, and 130 pieces of ordnance of various calibres.\n\nTapish, \u062a\u0627\u0628\u06cc\u0634, the poetical name of Munshi Ghulam Muhammad Khan editor of the Newspaper called \"Auda Akbar.\" He was living in 1871 A.D.\n\nTaqi Aghadi, \u062a\u0642\u06cc \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f\u06cc, a Persian poet who came to India and was living at Agra in 1614 A.D., 1023 A.H.

She was elevated on the throne of Persia some time after the death of her brother Shiroya 631 A.D. We are told by Persian historians that this queen restored the sacred cross, which had been borne away from Jerusalem by Khusro Parweiz; and by that act, acquired great power with the Roman emperor. But this is evidently erroneous; for there is no doubt that the emperor Heraclius, when he returned from Persia, carried that precious relic to Constantinople, which was deemed a more splendid trophy of victory, than all his spoils and conquests. Taurandukht ruled Persia only one year and four months. She was succeeded by her cousin and lover Shah Shamsan. He had reigned only one month when he was deposed, and Azarm or Arzamdukht, another daughter of Khusro Parweiz was raised to the throne 632 A.D. This princess, who was alike distinguished by her sense and beauty, resolved to take the whole management of the affairs of the kingdom into her hands. She would not even appoint a wazir. But the fatal passion of a Persian noble defeated all her designs. Farrukhuzay the governor of Khurasan fell violently in love with her, perished, with her dominion. He proceeded to court and made his love known to his royal mistress; she refused her hand, and he was soon after murdered through her instigation. As soon as his melancholy fate was known to his son Rustam, he collected a large army, and marched from Khurasan to Madain. The queen was unable to oppose him; and the young chief revenged his father by putting her to a cruel death. After her demise, Farrukhuzay the son of Khusro Parweiz by a female singer of Isfahan was raised to the throne, but before he had reigned a month, his days were terminated by poison. Such were the events which immediately preceded the reign of Yezdijard III, and the fall of the Persian monarchy.\n\nTauran Shah, surnamed Mulik-ul-Muzzam, was the brother of the famous Salah-uddin who had appointed him as his lieutenant in Damascus.

In 1790 he was defeated in Travancore, and yielding to the British arms he consented, in 1792, to make peace with Lord Cornwallis by delivering up his two sons as hostages, and paying, besides part of his dominion, above three millions sterling. His intrigues with the French, and his machinations to destroy the English power, renewed the war in 1799.

Tughrul Beg and his brother Jafar Beg Daud, were in the service of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni. After defeating Sultan Masoud I son of Sultan Mahmud in a battle fought in 1038 A.D., 429 A.H., he assumed the title and state of a sovereign at Naishapur. He subdued Trak, took Bagdad, and by his reduction became master of the person of the Khalif Al-Kadim Bilah, who invested him as Sultan of Khurasan, appointed him regent or vicar of the holy prophet, and the lord of all Muslims. He gave his sister in marriage to the Khalif and his nephew Alp Arsalan afterwards married the daughter of the Khalif Al-Muktadi. The Saljuk family divided into three branches and settled in Hamdan, Kirman and Rum or Anatolia. Tughrul Beg died after a reign of 25 lunar years 1063 A.D., 455 A.H., aged 70 lunar years, and as he had no issue, he was succeeded by his nephew Sultan Alp Arsalan the son of Abu Jafar Daud.

After the death of Sultan Sanjar, 1157 A.D., 552 A.H., Persia continued, for a period of forty years, to be distracted with the wars of different branches of the Saljukian dynasty. The last who exercised power was Tughrul III who succeeded his father Arsalan Shah in January, 1176 A.D., Jumada II, 571 A.H., and after a reign of ten years was seized and imprisoned by his uncle and wazir Kizal Arsalan, who resolved to usurp the throne, but fell by the hand of an assassin in 1191 A.D., 587 A.H., and the kingdom restored to Tughrul. He was, however, after some years defeated in a battle, taken prisoner and executed by Takash ruler of Khwarizm, 1194 A.D., 590 A.H., and his head sent to Nasir the Khalifa of Baghdad. With this prince terminated the Saljukian monarchs of Persia, who had governed that country, from the commencement of his reign of Tughrul I to the death of Tughrul III, 158 years.\n\nTughtazani, \u062a\u063a\u0644\u0642 \u062a\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0646\u06cc, vide Tuftazani.\n\nTokaji Holkar, \u062a\u063a\u0644\u0642 \u062d\u0627\u062c\u06cc \u062d\u06a9\u0631, vide Takaji.\n\nTuktamish Khan, \u062a\u063a\u0644\u0642 \u062e\u0627\u0646, ruler of Dasht Kapchak whom Amir Taimur defeated in 1395 A.D.\n\nTulshi Bai, \u062a\u063a\u0644\u0642 \u0628\u06cc, the widow of Jaswant Rao Holkar, vide Jaswant Rao Holkar.\n\nTulshi Das, \u062a\u063a\u0644\u0642 \u062f\u0627\u0633, a Brahman and a celebrated poet among the Hindus.

To give the greater weight to his pretensions, he also took the surname of Al-Mahdi, the director. According to some, also, he pretended to be descended in a right line from \u2018Ali the son of Ab\u00fa T\u00e1lib, and F\u00e1tima the daughter of Muhammad; for which reason, the Arabs called him and his descendants Fatimites. He likewise encouraged himself and his followers by a traditional prophecy of Muhammad, that at the end of 300 years the sun should rise out of the West. Having at length driven the Aghlabites into Egypt, where they became known by the name of Maghribians, he extended his dominions in Africa and Sicily, making Kairw\u00e1n the place of his residence. He sent several of his generals at different times to conquer Egypt, but they were always defeated and obliged to fly to Kairw\u00e1n.

He was raised to high rank, and Jodhpur his native country given him in jagir. He died 1594 A.D., 1002 A.H., and four of his wives burned themselves with his corpse.

He reigned at Samarqand for 40 years during the lifetime of his father whom he succeeded in March, 1447 A.D., 851 A.H. He was a prince who made peaceful studies the chief object of his life, and had entirely neglected the art of war. He assembled all the astronomers of his kingdom, and the celebrated libraries which were known by his name, viz., \"Z\u012bj Ul\u0101gh Beg,\" were the result of his labours. He is said to have had very large instruments for making his observations; particularly a quadrant as high as the church of Saint Sophia at Constantinople, which is 180 Roman feet. His fate was cruel; he was defeated, taken prisoner, and put to death by his son Mirz\u0101 'Abdul Lat\u012bf on the 27th of October, 1449 A.D., 853 A.H. It is a consolation to know that this unnatural prince enjoyed the power he had attained, by so monstrous a crime, only for the short space of six months: he was slain by his own soldiers. Ul\u0101gh Beg's Catalogue of fixed stars rectified for 1434 A.D., was published by Hyde at Oxford in 1665 in 4to. with learned notes.\n\n'Umar-al-Maksus, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u06a9\u0648\u0633, the favourite master of the khalif Mu'\u00e1wiya II, who after his father's death consulted him whether he ought, or not, to accept the khil\u0101fat. His master told him that if he thought himself able to administer justice duly in the Musalm\u0101n, he ought to accept it; but otherwise he ought not to charge himself with it. This khalif had scarcely reigned six weeks, when he found himself too weak to sustain the weight of the government, and resolved to lay it down. This he did, and had no sooner renounced the khil\u0101fat, but he shut himself up in a chamber from whence he never stirred till he died, not long after his abdication, of the plague, according to some, and according to others of poison. The family of Umayya was so greatly irritated at his proceedings, that they vented their resentment upon the person of 'Umar-al-Maksus, whom they buried alive, because they supposed that it was by his advice that Mu'\u00e1wiya deposed himself. This circumstance took place in the year 683 A.D., 64 A.H.\n\n'Umar bin-'Abdul Aziz, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632, grandson of Harw\u00e1n I, was the ninth khalif of the house of Umayya.

He succeeded Ab\u00fa Bakr Sadik as second khalif after Muhammed in August, 634 A.D., Jum\u0101da II, 13 A.H. He spread his conquests over Syria and Phoenicia, and took Jerusalem after an obstinate siege in 637 A.D., 16 A.H. His generals extended his conquests into Persia and Egypt, and ended the worshippers of Muhammed. The fall of Alexandria under his power was marked by the destruction of its celebrated library, but he restored the canal between the Nile and the Red Sea. During his reign the Muhammedans conquered 36,000 towns, destroyed, 4,000 Christian temples, and built 1,400 mosques. He was the first who was called \"Am\u012br-ul-Momin\u012bn\" or the Lord of the Believers, and this title was ever afterwards used by all succeeding khalifs. He was married seven times, and one of his wives was Umm Kuls\u016bm the daughter of 'Ali. He was stabbed on Wednesday the 3rd of November, 644 A.D., 25th Zilhijjah, 23 A.H., by a Persian slave named Firdaws whilst saying his morning prayers in a mosque, and died three days after, aged 63 lunar years. He reigned 10 years 6 months and 8 days, and was succeeded in the khil\u0101fat by 'Usm\u0101n the son of 'Af\u0101n. Waring in his \"Tour to Shir\u00e1z,\" mentions that while he was at Shir\u00e1z (1802 A.D.) the Persians (who are Shias) celebrated the death of the khalif 'Umar. \"They erected a large platform, on which they fixed an image, disfigured and deformed as much as possible. Addressing themselves to the image, they began to revile it for having supplanted 'Ali the lawful successor of Muhammed; at length having exhausted all their expressions of abuse, they suddenly attacked the image with stones and sticks, until they had shattered it into pieces. The inside was hollow, and full of sweetmeats, which were greedily devoured by the mob who attended the ceremony.\"\n\n'Umar Khan Khilji, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u062c\u064a, the youngest son of Sultan 'Al\u00e1-nudd\u00edn Khilji a boy of seven years of age, was raised to the throne of Delhi after the death of his father, by Malik K\u0101fur the eunuch, in December, 1316 A.D., Shaww\u0101l, 716 A.H. Malik K\u0101fur was assassinated after 35 days and soon after 'Umar Kh\u0101n was deposed by his brother Mubarak Kh\u0101n who ascended the throne in January, 1317 A.D., 716 A.H.\n\n'Umar Khayam, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062e\u06cc\u0627\u0645, He was originally a tent-maker and hence his takhallus of Khay\u00e1m. He is held to be one of the most remarkable of Persian poets, unprecedented in regard to the freedom of his religious opinion. The Voltaire of Persia, his works gave great offence to the priests, but are, nevertheless, highly esteemed by general readers, apparently with justice, as the animation and brilliancy of his style are unquestionable. His hatred of hypocrisy and the tricks of false devotees, appears his crime in the eyes of the supposed pious; his tolerance of the creed was looked upon with equal suspicion and dislike. He was born at V\u0101riz\u0101pur, and devoted much of his time to the study of astronomy, of which science he was a distinguished professor; but it is said that instead of his studies leading him to the acknowledgment of the Supreme Being, it prompted his disbelief. The result of his reflections on this important subject is given in a poem of his, much celebrated under the title of \"Rubiy\u00e1t 'Umar Khay\u00e1m.\" He was the friend of Hasan Sabkh, the founder of the sect of the Assassins, and, it has been conjectured, assisted him in the establishment of his diabolical doctrine and fellowship. Some allowance must, however, be made for the prejudices of his historians, who would, of course, neglect\nnothing calculated to cast odium on one so inimical to their superstitions. 'Umar Khay\u00e1m seems particularly to direct his satire against the mysticism of Maw\u00e1si, the most excellent poet of his time, though inferior in this extraordinary and incomprehensible style to the later followers of the same school, Att\u00e1r and the great Mulla. However reprehensible his mockery would be if really directed against religion in general, it certainly deserves the severity it met with when we consider that it was the abuses he attacked and the absurdities he ridiculed; and as for the incongruities introduced into his poems and his professed love of pleasure, he is only following or rather pointing out as absurd, the contradictions of the mystic poets, which are difficult enough to reconcile to the understanding, whether allegorical or not. The following will give an idea of the style of 'Umar Khay\u00e1m:\n\n\"Ah! ye who long that, in time's coming night\nYour names should shine in characters of light,\nLet not this duty ever be forgot;\u2014\nLove well your neighbour; do him no despite.\"\n\n\"Ah! strive your best no human heart to wring,\nLet no one feel your anger burn or sting;\nWould you be wrapped in everlasting joy,\nLearn how to suffer, and cause no suffering.\"\n\nSome English versions of the Quatrains by Mr. Edward Fitzgerald have been published by Quaritch of London. 'Umar Khay\u00e1m was contemporaneous with Hasan Sabbah, Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk waz\u00edr of Maliksh\u00e1h, and Maw\u00e1si the poet. Khushgo in his Tazkira recorded the year of 'Umar Khay\u00e1m's death 1123 A.D., 517 A.H., and this appears to be correct.

The dissensions which arose on the death of the Prophet, with regard to the succession to the Khilafat, were revived with renewed fury when, on the murder of 'Usm\u00e1n, the noble and unfortunate 'Al\u00ed succeeded to the dignity of Amir-ul-Mom\u00edn\u00edn; and they eventually caused the division of Islam into two great parties or sects, called respectively the Sunnis and the Shiites who differ materially in the interpretation of the Kor\u00e1n, and in admitting or rejecting various portions of the oral law. The hatred entertained between these rival sects has been the cause of constant religious wars and persecutions scarcely to be surpassed in the history of any nation or creed, and still separate the followers of Muhammad into two classes, by a barrier more insurmountable than that which divides the Roman Catholic from the Protestant.\n\n'Usman bin-Isa bin-Ibrahim Sadik, author of a collection of traditions in Arabic called \"Gh\u00e1\u00e9t-ut-Touzih.\"\n'Usman Mukhtari, \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc, a poet who flourished in the reign of Sultan Ibrahim of Ghazni and was a contemporary of Sheikh Sanai the poet.\n\n'Utba, \u0639\u062a\u0628\u0629, the son of Abu Lahab.

After he had made himself master of Persia, he turned his arms in the direction of Turkey; but his career of greatness was arrested by the superior genius of the Turkish emperor, Muhammad II, from whom he suffered a signal defeat, which terminated his schemes of ambition. He died after a reign of eleven years at the age of seventy on the 7th of December, 1477 A.D., 882 A.H. Catherine Comnenus, who is called by the Persians Carum Comnenus, was married to him.

Haidar Ali contrived in the middle of the last century, to get possession of Kurg by treachery; but in 1787 the young r\u00e1j\u00e1, Bir Rajindar, his prisoner, escaped from confinement through the aid of several of his subjects and succeeded in establishing himself in his dominions. At his death, in 1808, he left the succession to an infant daughter, to the exclusion of his brother, to whom of right it belonged according to ancient usages; but the young princess soon after abdicated in favor of her uncle, with the sanction of the British Government.\n\nThe Princess Victoria Gaurama was born in February 1841. The melancholy circumstance of the death of the mother, two days after the birth of the child, seems to have led to increased affection for his offspring on the part of the father, who from his own previous convictions in favor of Christianity, determined that his favorite daughter should be brought up in the principles of the Christian faith. From this period the ex-r\u00e1j\u00e1 entertained an anxious desire to visit Europe, in order that, when she had arrived at a suitable age, she might be introduced into European society; and thereby receive such impressions as would promote a feeling favourable to Christianity. Accordingly in the early part of 1852, the prince quitted India for England, leaving at the city of Benares the rest of his family, consisting of eleven children, with their mothers. On his arrival in England the object of his visit was made known to the Queen, who at once most kindly and graciously consented to become sponsor to the young princess. The baptismal ceremony was performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 3rd June, 1852, in the presence of Her Majesty, the Prince Consort, and numerous other members of the royal family; the princess received the prefix of \"Victoria\" to her Indian name of \"Gaurama,\" by which she had been called after one of the pagan divinities of her country.\n\nThe princess is said to have become a good scholar under the care of those charged with her education. Her personal appearance was exceedingly interesting and intelligent, and the complexion of her skin but little darker than that what Europeans call a deep brunette.

Z\u00fa died after he had conquered Fars, and was succeeded by his son Karsh\u00e1sp. This prince, who was soon set aside as incompetent by Z\u00e1l, is considered by Persian authors as the last of the first or Pish\u00e1d\u00ed\u00e1n dynasty; who according to their own computation, governed Persia 2,450 years. The names of twelve kings only of their race have been preserved.

There are various accounts of the descent of Zuh\u00e1k. Some say he was an Arabian, but descended from Kyomurs: others trace his descent to Shadd\u00e1d, and term him a Syrian; and it has even been conjectured that he was the Astyages of the Greeks. All agree in one fact, that he was of a cruel and sanguinary temper. He is described as having had two dreadful cancers on his shoulders, which the Persian fabulists have changed into snakes, whose hunger nothing could appease but the brains of human beings: two of his subjects were slain daily to furnish the horrible meal: till the manly indignation of K\u00e1wa or G\u00e1wa a blacksmith of Ish\u00e1h\u00edn, whose two sons were on the point of being sacrificed, relieved the empire from this tyrant, and raised Far\u00fad\u00fan, a prince of the Pish\u00e1d\u00ed\u00e1n dynasty to the throne. The fable perhaps indicates an ancient subjugation of Persia by a Median or Tartar tribe who used the serpent, a dragon, for their standard.

Zyd, who had been greatly obliged to Mu\u1e25ammad, was very desirous to gratify him, and offered to divorce his wife. Mu\u1e25ammad pretended to dissuade him from it, but Zyd easily perceiving how little he was in earnest, actually divorced her. Mu\u1e25ammad thereupon took her to wife, and celebrated the nuptials with extraordinary magnificence, keeping open house upon the occasion.

Mu\u1e25ammad then offered to set him at liberty on condition of his returning to him his daughter.
