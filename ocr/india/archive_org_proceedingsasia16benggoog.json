Report on 452 old coins forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Delhi, with his No. 242, dated 13th March, 1896.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner's letter only mentions 451 rupees, which are said to have been found in the village Khirki in the Delhi District: no further details are given. With these rupees, however, I found a copper coin, though how it got there, I do not know.\n\nAll the 451 silver coins are rupees of Moghul emperors, ranging from Akbar the Great down to Akbar II, of more exactly from the year 1599 A.D. (4th Ilahi year of Akbar I) to 1810 A.D. (or 1225 Hijrah). In this respect this hoard of coins is a curiosity.\n\nThe following is a detailed statement of the Rupees:\n\nI.

The exception is a coin of the Hind\u016b dynasty of K\u0101bul, of the Bull and Horseman type, with Bhima over the horseman, and Cri S\u0101manta D\u0113va over the bull.\n\nThe Ghaznavi coins belong to three different varieties:\n\n1. the common variety, figured in the British Mus. Cat., Vol. II, No. 453, on Plate V. Of this variety, there are specimens ... ... ... ... 719\n\n2. another variety, which differs from the common one only in substituting on the obverse the word *Subuktigin* for *al-Tay'allah*. On this variety, therefore, the word *Subuktigin* occurs on both sides. Of this variety there are specimens ... ... 13\n3, a third variety which agrees with the second variety in the reading of the obverse, but further substitutes al-Tay'allah for Subuktigjin on the reverse. On this variety, therefore, these two words occupy positions exactly the reverse of those on the first variety. Of this third variety there are specimens ... 8\n\nTotal ... 730\n\nVarieties 2 and 3 are extremely rare. So far as I can discover, they do not exist in the British Museum. The Lahore Museum possesses one specimen of the second variety; it is No. 11 in its Catalogue, Vol. II, page 24. On the other hand, the Indian Museum in Calcutta possesses one specimen of the third variety; it is No. 7847 in its Catalogue, Vol. IV, page 153. There is also one of this variety in the India Office, from Masson's collection, described by Thomas in the Journal R. A. S., Vol. IX, page 305. No others are known to me.\n\nThe coins are in very fair condition, so far as their circular areas are concerned. The margins, however, which give the mint and date, are in most cases wholly gone; and in the few exceptional cases, they are mere fragments and almost unreadable. In no case are either mint or date fully determinable.\n\nIII. Report on 10 Old Coins forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Gujranwala with his No. 392, dated 17th March, 1896.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner's letter contains no information as to the date and the locality of the find.\n\nThe coins are of mixed metal (copper with a little silver) and belong to the early period of the Muhammadan occupation of India. They imitate the well-known early Hindustani coinage of the Bull and Horseman class. They are all in a very indifferent condition, showing the merest fragments of their legends. The following is a detailed statement:\n\n(1) Coins of Saifuddin Hasan Qurlagh, about 625-640 H. = 1227-1242 A.D., see Thomas' Chronicles, No. 82 ... ... ... ... 8\n\n(2) Coin of Muizzuddin Bahr\u0101m Sh\u0101h, like Br. Mus. Cat., No. 70-72 ... ... ... ... 1\n\n(3) Coin undetermined; obv. Horseman with traces of hamirah; rev. recumbent bull with traces of a legend, of which only putha is legible. It is perhaps a coin of Prithi\u0101j of Delhi ... 1\n\nTotal ... 10\nIV. Report on 22 Silver Coins, forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Lohardaga with his No. 253 R, dated 1-4th July, 1896.\n\nThe coins are stated to have been found \"on the 26th September, 1895, by the M\u0101li of B\u0101b\u016b Kail\u0101sa Chandra Chatterjee, while digging a field in his garden where there was formerly a cowshed.\"\n\nThey are Rupees of the East India Company's coinage, of three different varieties, as follows:\n\n(1a) with oblique milling; 45th san, 1809\u20131819, mint Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d... ... ... ... 7\n\n(1b) with oblique milling; 19th san, 1793\u20131818, mint Murshid\u0101b\u0101d... ... ... ... 8\n\n(2a) with straight milling; 19th san, 1818\u20131832, mint Murshid\u0101b\u0101d... ... ... ... 2\n\n(2b) with straight milling; 45th san, 1819\u20131833, mint Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d... ... ... ... 3\n\n(3) with plain edge and plain rim; 45th san, 1833\u20131835, mint Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d... ... ... ... 2\n\nTotal ... 22\n\nV. Report on 49 Old Coins forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Kangr\u0101, with his No. 996, dated 13th June, 1896.\n\nOn the 13th May last, 770 copper and 3 silver coins were found buried in an earthen pot at Mach\u012bl\u012b, in village Mont\u0101, Tahsil Kangr\u0101 of the Kangr\u0101 district. The 3 silver coins and 46 specimens of the copper coins were forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the remainder of the copper coins not being worth acquiring by the Government.\n\nOf these coins, 28 belong to the S\u016bri dynasty, and 21 to Akbar. They are all in a rather indifferent condition. The following is a detailed statement:\n\nI. Coins of the S\u016bri Dynasty:\n\n(1) Sh\u012br Sh\u0101h, H. 947\u2013952 = A.D. 1540\u20131545.\n\n(a) Silver; type, square areas, like British Museum Catalogue, No. 530, date 952... 1\n\n(b) Copper; type, square areas, like Br.

Report on 19 old Silver Coins forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of the Firuzpur District with his No. 1676, dated 9th October, 1896, and No. 1571, dated 25th September, 1896.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner states that 23 coins were found by a zamindar while ploughing in a field in the village of Sarai Naugah in the Mukatsar Tahsil of the Firuzpur District. One specimen was sent in September 1896, and the balance of 22 coins was transmitted in October 1896. Of the latter number, only 18 were received by the Asiatic Society of Bengal, four coins having been lost in transit, owing to the cover enclosing the coins being of a very flimsy nature and tearing on the way; efforts to recover the missing coins were made by the Post Office, but unsuccessfully. The loss is of no consequence, the coins being of no particular numismatic value.\n\nThey are small silver coins of the size of 4 anna pieces, and belong to the so-called Indo-Sassanian Class. They have been numerously found in large quantities at various times; and their exact attribution is uncertain. They are commonly known as \"Gadhiya ka paisa,\" and are described and figured in Prinsep's Indian Antiquities (ed. Thomas), Vol. I, p. 341, Plate XXVII, figs. 13-16.\n\nVII. Report on 21 old Silver Coins forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Nagpur, with his No. 7707-656, dated 6th December, 1895.\n\nNo information is given with regard to the date and locality of the find.\nAll the coins are rupees of the Moghul emperors Farrukh Siyar and Ahmad Shah. Of the former there is only one rupee, dated H. 1125 = A.D. 1713, mint Elicpur ... 1\n\nThe remainder belong to Ahmad Shah, and are of the two mints Surat and Katak, of various regnal years, the Hijrah years are not legible ... ... ... 20\n\nTotal 21\n\nVIII. Report on 24 old Silver Coins forwarded by the Collector of Bhagalpur, with his 1070 G., dated 21st August, 1896.\n\nNo information is given referring to the date and locality of the find. The coins are rupees of the old British mintage of the East India Company, of the 19th san, and mint Murshidabad.\n\nThere are two varieties; (1) of the older issue, of 1793\u20131818, with oblique milling ... ... ... 10\n\n(2) of the later issue, of 1818\u20131832, with straight milling 14\n\nTotal ... 24\n\nIX. Report on 11 old Silver Coins, forwarded by the Collector of Kulna, with his No. 1486 G., dated 3rd October, 1896.\n\nThe Collector states that these coins were found in an earthen pot (bhar) by labourers while digging a tank at Bansghatia, Thana Satkhira.\n\nThey consist of rupees of Muhammad Shah, Ahmad Shah and Shah Alam.

A. Waddell, on the Rev. A. Sandberg's note to Mr. Gait's paper on Ahom coins.\n\nTo\n\nTHE SECRETARY OF THE ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL.\n\nSir,\n\nI have just received the June number of the Proceedings of the Society and find that it contains a note under the above heading by Mr. Sandberg dealing with what he is pleased to consider certain 'inaccuracies' of mine, and I take the earliest opportunity of correcting its misapprehensions and mistatements.\n\nIt is amusing to see such a peaceable person as myself accused of 'much maligning Huc' and of 'accusing him of errors,' especially as I have never lost an opportunity of expressing my admiration for Huc's marvellous accuracy of observation; and few, indeed, have contributed more than I have done towards rehabilitating Huc's reputation for veracity. And certainly no hostile spirit to Huc's work was expressed or implied by me in my reply to the editor's request to revise the spelling of the names in Huc's list in accordance, if possible, with the system adopted by the Society. A glance at Huc's Tibetan names at once showed that his list stood much in need of revision. In fact the majority of his names were mispelt almost beyond recognition, thus Cheng for Shij, Dchak for Chag and Tchon for Chhu\u2014for Huc's weakest point was the comparatively unimportant one of spelling.\n\nAs the editor was also good enough to ask me to test if possible, Huc's spelling of the Mongolian words, I obtained the list in question from the learned Mongolian Lama of the Bhotiya School at Darjiling who is Babu Sarat Chandra Das' chief source of inspiration on Tibetan matters; and had my accompanying note on its source and interpretation been also published, all ambiguity would have been saved.\n\nIn that note, of which unfortunately I kept no copy, I am under the impression that I clearly stated, firstly, that the Mongolian words were written down for me in Tibetan characters by the scholarly Mongol Lama Sherap Gyatsho, who is thoroughly proficient in Tibetan; and secondly, that all I had done was to transliterate these words into Roman characters by a slight modification of the system of Jaeschke, the authority on Tibetan orthography;\u00b9 and thirdly, that the words were pronounced according to the Tibetan style.\n\nI could not compare the words with the forms found in the dictionaries of European lexicographers as I had at that time no library at\n\n\u00b9 The system adopted is almost identical with that used by the Society except that the h in aspirates is expressed by a comma.\nhand for reference, nor had I visited Mongolia or studied that language. Now, however, I have looked up as far as I can the authorities quoted by Mr. Sandberg. The Society's library contains two out of the three dictionaries quoted by him. Of these, however, only Castr\u00e9n's is in Romanized characters, the other by Schmidt being in Mongolian and Russian type. And it is remarkable to find that although Mr. Sandberg says he writes \"in the interests of accuracy\" he is most inaccurate in his quotations. So much so that the alleged differences between the versions of his dictionaries and of the Mongol Lama have been much magnified. The few discrepancies which do exist are dialectic of a kind which are more apparent than real, as they consist mainly in the difference between the written and spoken forms of Tibetan, a fact which it is strange Mr. Sandberg did not perceive, as he has studied Tibetan.\n\nIn the following table I have arranged the various lists for comparison. The last two columns show how far the only available one of the three dictionaries quoted by Mr. Sandberg justifies his claim for accuracy. It will also be evident that, pace Mr. Sandberg, the Mongol Lama's list is quite as near the dictionary version as Huc's, or even still nearer to it; while it has the merit of giving at first hand by a learned Mongol an independent version of the spoken form of the words in question.\n\n| Mongolian Lama's List in Tibetan Characters | Huo's List | Castr\u00e9n and others, according to Mr. Sandberg | Castr\u00e9n's own spelling. |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| As pronounced.                              | As Spelled.|                                                 |                        |\n| Wood                                        | Mot        | Mod                                             | Moto                   |\n| Fire                                        | Kal        | Kal                                             | Gal                    |\n| Earth                                       | Sho-ra     | So'-ra                                          | Ch\u00e9-r\u00e9                 |\n| Iron                                        | T'u-mer    | T'u-mer                                         | T\u00e9-mur                 |\n| Water                                       | O-su       | O-su                                            | Onsson                 |\n| Mouse                                       | Hul-kan    | Hul-kan                                         | Khouloukhana           |\n|                                             |            |                                                 |                        |\n|                                             |            |                                                 |                        |\n\n1 His statement too that \"there is no letter 'p' in Mongol\" seems remarkable as his authority Castr\u00e9n frequently uses 'p' in transliterating Mongol words.\n2 Hazlitt's translation of Huc's Travels in Tartary, Tibet and China, II, 212.\n3 By a mistake this was printed T'uled.\n| Mongolian Lama's List in Tibetan Character | Huo's List | Castren and others, according to Mr. Sandberg | Castren's own spelling, S.\u2014Selengin dialect.

As regards the Tibetan list I have already instanced how much it stood in need of revision. With such uncouth words as spreu and lc'ags it is a wonder that printer's errors are not more numerous. The other word mentioned by Mr. Sandberg should certainly be Lug and not Luk as given by him.\n\nI would also notice here another article in this Journal which attributes to me statements that I never expressed. Mr. Beveridge in his paper on The site of Karna-Suvarna, which appeared in the Journal of the Society when I was absent in Europe, and which has only lately come to my notice, makes me assert the opinion that the long lost capital of king \u00c7a\u00e7\u0101\u1e45ka certainly lies near the city of Burdwan. While as a fact, I only recorded some local evidence in favor of this possibility. And his discovery that this site lay probably at Rangam\u0101\u1e6di near Mursh\u012b-d\u0101b\u0101d is no discovery at all, as it was specially mentioned by me in that very report which he notices.\n\nL.

Contact of protophytes with roots in the soil. Transpiration.\n\nGeneral conclusions.\n\nPRELIMINARY REMARKS.\n\nThe formation of antitoxins in animals leads me to believe that an analogous process may take place naturally in plants. I am not aware that an attempt has ever been made to produce these antitoxic substances artificially in plants. The attempt would undoubtedly be attended with great difficulty as the circulation of vegetable fluids is by no means so free as in the blood vessels of the higher animals.\n\nThe soil contains numberless protophytes doubtless as poisonous in many cases to the higher plants as they are to animals. That intense poisons do exist in the soil is shown particularly in malarious countries where freshly opened ground causes severe fevers among the labourers employed, especially if they are not natives of the locality.\n\nIt would appear that as in animals so in plants antitoxins play a very important part in survival or extinction of species. Among human beings it is known that those living in a certain locality are exempt from diseases the poisons of which exist in the ground or water: as an instance of this we observe the natives of the Gold Coast who suffer little from fever of a malarial character which attacks Europeans or inhabitants of a neighbouring part of the country. We may explain\nthis by saying that a substance toxic to the fever poison is produced in the tissues and that in the course of years, survival of those capable of producing this antitoxin led to the existence of a fever-resisting race. In a similar manner plants capable of producing a necessary antitoxic substance now grow and flourish while those not so capable have become extinct. I shall now endeavour to explain how I think the process may take place.\n\nSEC. I. EXPERIMENTS ON ABSORPTION OF PLANTS\u2014BACTERIA, ETC.\u2014SYMBIOSIS.\n\nWe must first consider the results of certain experiments made by scientists to test the powers of absorption by the roots of plants. The red colouring matter of Phytolacca was absorbed by white hyacinths when poured upon the soil on which they were grown: after two or three days the red colour disappeared from the flowers (Bion). The flowers of the tuberosa (Polyanthes tuberosa) and snapdragon were affected in a similar manner (Sarrabat). Cut flowers take up colouring matter with rapidity, as may be easily demonstrated. The injured cells at the surface of the section become infected with bacteria (H\u00f6hnel). The osmotic action by means of which water and substances dissolved therein pass into the roots does not preclude the possibility of the entrance of bacteria. Dead albuminous substances cannot pass through a colloid membrane: the relation between living cells is different and although the cells of the root hairs may be very capricious in their action, nevertheless, living bacteria or other protophytes might gain admission. Bacteria appear to be invariably unicellular and amongst the minutest organisms observed by the aid of the microscope varying from \\( \\frac{1}{100} \\) m.m. to \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\) m.m. (Kerner and Oliver, Nat. Hist. Plants, page 161).\n\nBesides the bacteria proper there are many protophytes which consist each of a very small cell without any differentiation into cell-wall and cell contents (Sachs, Text Book of Botany, page 248). Bacteria are also known to exist and float about in the air so that the possibility of their entrance by the stomata of leaves must also be considered. This entrance of the hyphae of Polypori is known to take place (Kerner, op. cit., page 163).\n\nA certain relation is known to exist between Fungi and the roots of plants, especially of those of the Natural Orders Ericaceae, Cupuliferae and Salicaceae. Here we have a symbiotic union between the fungus-mycelium and the roots of a green-leaved plant, (Kerner, op. cit., page 250). The hyphae insinuate themselves inside the walls of the epidermal cells of the root and the latter are permeated by an extremely fine meshed mycelial net (Kerner, op. cit., page 249).\nWe can imagine without difficulty the converse of this case; hostile organisms gaining admission and damaging the tissue by causing fermentations. The host plant then throws out an antitoxic fluid from its cells to save it from destruction.\n\nThe possibility of entrance of protophytes is made easier of belief when we also think that colouring matter can pass the epidermal cells of the root and get carried through the vascular system of the plant to the flowers.\n\nSEC. II. UNORGANISED FERMENTS\u2014COMPARISON BETWEEN PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE CELL.\n\nIn the next place we must consider the points of analogy in the physiological processes of the animal and vegetable cell.\n\nWe find that in the vegetable cell, starch is converted into glucose or cane-sugar. This change is said to be due to the action of an unorganized ferment and of this class of ferments several have been shown to occur, viz.\u2014Emulsin in almonds, diastase in barley, and myrosin in mustard seeds. A similar change of starch into sugar takes place in human saliva and by the action of pancreatic juice. Again a peptic ferment changes, in the vegetable cells, the reserve proteins into peptones (Sachs, op. cit., page 708). The leaves of Drosera produce an acid and a ferment which act on albuminous compounds like pepsin. This is also the case with the secretion of the leaves of butterwort (Pinguicula) which act in a manner similar to the gastric juice of animals, (Kerner, op. cit., pages 142 and 144). Asparagin which is a bye product in the oxidation of nitrogenous substances of the plant has been said to correspond physiologically with urea in animals (Sachs, op. cit., page 722).\n\nIn comparing circulatory systems of plants and animals, we find in the latter arteries, veins, lactiferous vessels, &c., for the conveyance of special nutritive fluids. In the former (plants) the circulation of sap takes place thus:\u2014In the parenchyma of the fundamental tissue which has an acid reaction, are conveyed carbo-hydrates and oil: by the soft bast the albuminoids which have an alkaline reaction. When there are lactiferous vessels they furnish an open communication between all the organs of the plant. These lactiferous vessels contain albuminoids, carbo-hydrates and oil as well as poisons and other secondary products of metastasis. Of the secondary products of metastasis such as colouring matters, acids, alkaloids, &c., many have no known physiological signification in the life of the plant (Sachs, op. cit., pages 706, 711\u2013712.)\n\nAgain some gases as sulphuretted hydrogen, carbon oxide, common\ncoal gas, &c., seem to have an influence on plants like that produced on animals by narcotic poisons: other gases as sulphurous and hydrochloric acid appear to resemble the action of irritants upon animals (Bentley, Manual of Botany, p. 806).\n\nSEC. III. ANTISEPTICS\u2014QUININE, ETC.\u2014CONSTITUTION OF PROTOPLASM IN DIFFERENT SPECIES.\n\nWe next pass to the consideration of antiseptics or substances which kill or check the growth of fermentative organisms: amongst these I mention salicylic acid, thymol, and eucalyptus-oil (essential principle).\n\nThe *Eucalyptus globulus* is well known as a purifier of the soil and it is probable that the essential principle of the oil is antitoxic. If it does not exist in the plant in its ordinary form, it is very speedily converted into this form on exposure to the air, probably by the action of a ferment, as takes place in the coagulation of blood in animals.\n\nWe now turn to *Cinchona* and *Ipecacuanha*. These two plants grow in localities where the diseases for which they are used as remedies prevail. The fact is remarkable even if the two poisons cannot be shown to produce the two diseases and remedies respectively in plants and animals. The quinine being antitoxic in the plant is capable of supplying, to a certain extent, the want of antitoxin in man. We know that plants growing side by side in the same soil produce different secretions. This shows us how the constitution of protoplasm varies in different species: from this we can see how one poison may produce many kinds of antitoxins in as many differently constituted plants.\n\nWe may infer that the poisonous principles of many plants such as *Nux-vomica*, *Conium*, *Digitalis*, &c., are antitoxic substances and not altogether as has been stated a protection for the foliage of the plant against its destruction by herbivorous animals.\n\nSEC. IV. ALTERATION IN CHARACTER OF SECRETIONS BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT.\n\nWe must next consider the alteration in the character of secretion caused by change of environment. *Oicuta virosa* and *Enanthe crocata* which are poisonous in most districts in England are harmless when grown near Edinburgh. The common mushroom (*Agaricus arvensis*) when grown in England is a comestible article, but in Italy and Hungary it is avoided on account of its possessing a poisonous principle (Bentley, Manual of Botany, pages 824 and 825). The toxic resin of *Cannabis sativa* when grown in England is very small or altogether absent: but the variety *indica*, which is considered by most authorities\nto be a variety of the same species, produces in Bengal a great quantity of the same resin.\n\nIf plants of warm or tropical regions be placed in our hot-houses, their secretions are either not formed at all or in diminished amount (Bentley, op. cit., p. 824). An almost corresponding difference in disease, poisons may be noted in different countries. We find ague present to a slight extent in England, the poison being of a mild character, while in India and Africa, in many localities, the poison is most intense. Similarly tetanus is said to be very common in Lower Bengal and in the West Indies, especially among horses. Many of these instances may be explained by saying that the heat and moisture facilitate the development of lower organisms, in the same way as the higher plants grow with a magnificent luxuriance unknown in temperate climates. The poisons of Asiatic cholera and dysentery are very capricious in their choice of habitats. From all these cases we may assume that organic poisons vary greatly in power in the soil with the country in which they occur and this plainly shows the multifarious influences to which the roots of plants must be constantly subjected. We know that certain organisms are harmless or otherwise to animals and the same can be said of plants on account of the similarity of their cell-action which has been explained.\n\nSEC. V. CONTACT OF PROTOPHYTES WITH ROOTS IN THE SOIL\u2014TRANSPERSION.\n\nLastly let us consider the probability of contact of these organisms with the roots. We know that a large amount of aqueous vapour is transpired from the leaves: in the case of the oak this amounts to eight and a half times the rainfall over the area covered by the foliage of the tree; in the *Eucalyptus globulus* it amounts to eleven times the rainfall. From these facts we clearly see that trees tend to dry the soil, and that the abstraction of water from the area penetrated by the roots, at first tends to dry it; but there would be a tendency for the water to percolate from the surrounding soil to the immediate vicinity of the roots when extraction was taking place and consequently the former area would be kept constantly moist. Bacteria require a moist or fluid medium for development and consequently we can imagine that the area of the roots would be infested with them on account of the moisture which exists there, and that they would be likely to cluster round the roots. In many cases this would probably be prevented by the exudation from the roots of toxic substances in order to help the epidermal cells of the root to resist the entrance of these organisms.\n\nThe action of light, heat and electricity are known to have an\nimportant bearing on the production and growth of plants, but their influence does not satisfactorily account for many of the facts mentioned in this paper.\n\nAntitoxins were obtained by Ehrlich of Berlin with some poisons not of bacterial origin but derived from the vegetable kingdom. (Presidential Address, British Association, 1896.)\n\nGENERAL CONCLUSIONS.\n\nSo far as I know a satisfactory explanation has never been given as to the origin or use in the plant of the majority of substances, chiefly of a toxic nature, produced as the result of the secondary processes of metastasis. That these poisons are lethal to the organisms in the soil and primarily produced by their irritation of the plant by entering it and causing fermentation, seems to me a simple explanation. I have mentioned how colouring matters may gain admission to the plant's vascular system, also that the cells exercised an absorptive or destructive influence in the case of the colouring matter absorbed by hyacinths. I have also mentioned the symbiosis which takes place between certain Fungi and the roots of green-leaved plants: from analogy we may conclude that there may be a similar relation between bacteria and the roots favourable or otherwise to the plants concerned. The possibility of entrance by the stomata has also been mentioned. We compared the fermentive processes of metastasis in plants and animals, and we saw that the protoplasm in each case acted similarly, so we may infer that under favourable conditions antitoxins may be formed in plants as in animals by any matter capable of stimulating the cells in the required manner.\n\nThe production of many antiseptic substances which we find in plants leads me to believe that they are produced in most cases as the result of irritation of the cells of the higher plant by the entrance of organisms causing fermentation of the juices of the plant.\n\nThat organisms could have every opportunity of doing so unchecked, and of multiplying in deciduous trees is evident, as the sap lies for a long time in the cells and vessels waiting for the young buds to develop and open. If it were not for a substance which could be supplied by the cells to neutralize the effect of, or kill the fermentative organisms, the plant must die.\n\nIn plants belonging to the Natural Orders Apocynace\u00e6, Euphorbiace\u00e6, &c., the white milky nutrient juice generally possesses an acrid or poisonous principle evidently to protect it against fermentation.\n\nThat every facility is given to protophytes to approach the roots of\ntrees, especially those in the process of transpiration, has been explained. To combat these organisms it is probable that the roots exude a part of the poisonous principle into the surrounding soil.\n\nChange of locality frequently alters the power of many organisms which cause disease in man, so we may infer that the absence or variation in quantity of secretion is due to the necessary organisms being absent altogether or present in small numbers.\n\nFrom a consideration of all the foregoing circumstances, it seems to me almost certain that organisms do gain admission to the vascular systems of plants. The irritation which they produce on the cells causes the formation of antitoxins and these antitoxins are many of the alkaloids and useful vegetable drugs which are constantly employed as medicinal remedies and for other purposes. These may exist in the plant in the form in which we know them or in a state, a very slight change from which by the action of a ferment, converts them into substances capable of protecting the cells or into their known condition. The peculiarities of protoplasm in different species have been noted and it seems possible for one kind of protophyte to produce toxins having different characters in different plants.\n\nIt is a noticeable fact that many toxic substances are obtained from the bark through the inner layers of which albuminoids are carried.\n\nConclusion \u2014 Fermentative parasites gain admission to the tissues of the plant; the irritation produced causes a reaction in the cells of the host; this reaction results in the formation of a protective substance, an antitoxin; and this latter causes the death of the parasite.\n\nIn connection with this paper Dr. Prain said:\n\nDr. Cummins' theory is a very interesting one, carefully thought out and clearly stated. It is at the same time more or less conjectural and some of the facts cited in support of certain of the steps in the reasoning may be said to be, if not contradictory, at all events not corroborative. Two of these may be mentioned as examples.\n\nIn the chapter on Antiseptics it is said that *Eucalyptus globulus* is well known as a purifier of the soil and it is probable that the essential principle of the oil is antitoxic. The statement is very well known and is perhaps often believed, but I most certainly do not think either that the case for the *Eucalyptus* has been made out or that the benefits derived from its culture are greater than would be attained if another tree were planted, which in Dr. Cummins' own words (in Sect. V.) is capable of transpiring moisture equal to eleven times the rainfall over the area covered by the foliage of the tree.\n\nIf the citation of *Cannabis sativa var. indica* be intended to imply that its secretion of resin in Bengal is at all a protective measure, I have\nto say that the matter is open to great doubt. The process of secretion is, if not intimately associated with the formation of seeds, at least one that varies with the seed-formation. If the flowers of the female plant in the plains of Bengal be permitted to become fertilized, so that the fruits and seeds form, there is no resin to be found filling the glandular hairs on the outside of the bracts. When however by destruction of the male plant fertilisation is made impossible the fruits do not fill and the glandular hairs in question are loaded with the narcotic substance of hemp.\n\nThe theory is not one that in the present state of our knowledge I am prepared to accept. At the same time, seeing that it has been advanced as an hypothesis to explain certain facts, the significance of which is admittedly obscure and has been stated so lucidly as Dr. Cummins has stated it, we may, I think, very well publish the short paper in extenso. This will enable those interested to see what the theory implies and to indicate what is necessary for its experimental refutation or confirmation.\n\n---\n\n**LIBRARY.**\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in December last:\n\n**TRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,**\n\n*presented by the respective Societies and Editors.*\n\nBaltimore.

W. A. Lee and M. H. Oung to be Scrutineers.\n\nThe Chairman then called upon the Secretary to read the Annual Report.\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1896.\n\nThe Council of the Asiatic Society have the honour to submit the following Report on the state and progress of the Society's affairs during the past year:\u2014\nMember List.\n\nDuring the year under review, 24 Ordinary Members were elected, 15 withdrew, 7 died, 5 were removed from the list under Rule 40, being more than three years absent from India. There was thus a net loss of 3 Ordinary Members during the year. The total number of Members at the close of 1896 being 294, against 297 for the preceding year; of these 105 were Residents, 119 Non-Residents, 11 Foreign, 23 Life, 35 Absent from India and 1 Special Non-Subscribing Member, as will be seen from the following table, which also shows the fluctuations in the numbers of Ordinary Members during the past six years:\n\n| Year | Paying | Non-Paying | Grand Total |\n|------|--------|------------|-------------|\n|      | Resident | Non-Resident | Foreign | Total | Life | Absent | Special Non-Subscribing | Total |\n| 1891 | 101     | 134        | 10       | 245   | 21    | 27     | 2               | 60    | 295 |\n| 1892 | 115     | 127        | 11       | 253   | 22    | 33     | 2               | 57    | 310 |\n| 1893 | 116     | 123        | 12       | 251   | 22    | 33     | 2               | 57    | 308 |\n| 1894 | 98      | 125        | 12       | 235   | 22    | 36     | 2               | 60    | 295 |\n| 1895 | 108     | 122        | 12       | 242   | 23    | 31     | 1               | 55    | 297 |\n| 1896 | 105     | 119        | 11       | 235   | 23    | 35     | 1               | 59    | 294 |\n\nThe seven Ordinary Members, the loss of whom by death during the year we have to regret, were Mr. O. G. Arthur, Mr. Diego Ernst, Mr. Manmohan Ghose, The Hon. Prince Sir Jahan Qudr Muhammad Wahid Ali Bahadur, B\u0101bu Balai Chand Sinha, Sir Sirdar Attar Singh Bahadur, and Mr. W. Swinhoe.\n\nThere was one death amongst the Honorary Members, viz.:\u2014Dr. Reinhold Rost. During the year, on the recommendation of the Council, the following gentlemen were elected as Honorary Members:\u2014Sir Joseph Lister, Professor Michael Foster, Professor F. Keilhorn, and Professor C. R. Lanman. Thus the number of Honorary Members stands at 24.\n\nThe lists of Special Honorary Members, Corresponding Members, and Associate Members, continue unaltered from last year, there having been no casualties; their numbers stand at 5, 4, and 10, respectively.\n\nNo Members compounded for their subscriptions during the year.\nIndian Museum.\n\nNo presentations were made over to the Indian Museum.\n\nThe Trustees on behalf of the Society were:\u2014\n\nDr. A. F. R. Hoernle.\nA. Pedler, Esq.\nDr. D. D. Cunningham.\nC. Little, Esq.\nDr. Mahendralal Sarkar.\n\nFinance.\n\nThe accounts of the Society are shown in statement No. 1, in the appendix, under the usual heads.\n\nStatement No. 8 contains the Balance Sheet of the Society and of the different Funds administered through it.\n\nThe Budget Estimate for 1896 was taken at the following figures:\u2014\nReceipts Rs. 16,420; Expenditure Rs. 16,042.\n\nThe actual results were found to be\u2014Receipts, Rs. 18,448-7-9; Expenditure, Rs. 11,992-12-8.\n\nThe receipts show an increase of Rs. 2,028-7-9, while the expenditure shows a decrease of Rs. 5,049-3-4 on the Budget Estimate.\n\nThere is an increase in Receipts under the heads of \u201cSubscriptions,\u201d \u201cInterest on Investments,\u201d \u201cRent of Rooms,\u201d and \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d \u201cSubscriptions\u201d were estimated at Rs. 7,000, while the actuals were Rs. 7,729, the excess being due to some of the arrear subscriptions from members having been realized. Owing to the unexpected sale of the Society\u2019s publications, \u201cSale of Publications\u201d shows an increase of Rs. 649-3-6. During the year temporary Investments were made and there is thus an increase of Rs. 327-8-0 under the head of \u201cInterest on Investments.\u201d \u201cRent of Rooms\u201d shows an increase of Rs. 100. This is due to an additional room with an adjoining small room being leased to the Photographic Society of India. \u201cMiscellaneous Receipts\u201d were estimated at Rs. 100, whilst the actual receipts were Rs. 322-12-3. The difference is explained by the fact that a donation of Rs 250 was received from His Highness the Maharaja Scindia, for the printing of certain plates in the Society\u2019s Journal, Part I.\n\nOn the Expenditure side the items of \u201cCommission,\u201d \u201cLighting,\u201d \u201cContingencies,\u201d \u201cBinding,\u201d and \u201cJournal, Part I\u201d show an increase. Owing to some of the arrear subscriptions having been realized, there is an increase of Rs. 48-5-6 under the head of \u201cCommission.\u201d \u201cLighting\u201d shows a very slight increase. The amount budgetted for under the head of Contingencies has been exceeded by Rs. 110-1-10. This is due to providing the Jamadar and the Durwan with new clothing for the\ncold weather, and for sundry repairs to the water connection. During the year, it was found necessary to bind many old books belonging to the English library, thus there is an increase of Rs. 281-4-0 under the head of \"Binding.\" There is a slight increase of Rs. 153-7-6 under the head of \"Journal, Part I.\" An expenditure of Rs. 564-5-0 only appears under the head of \"Books,\" in consequence of the non-receipt of Messrs. Luzac & Co.'s accounts, the books purchased through the London Agents amounting to \u00a399-16-3. Journal, Part II, and Proceedings show a decrease. This is due to non-presentation of Baptist Mission Press bills during the year.\n\nThere was one extraordinary item of expenditure during 1896, not provided for in the Budget. Rs. 581 was remitted to Mr. C. J. Rodgers in part payment for preparing the Society's Coin Catalogue.\n\nThe actual expenditure on the \"Journal\" and \"Proceedings\" was as follows:\n\n|                | Part I   | Rs.     |\n|----------------|----------|---------|\n| Journal        | ...      | 2,253   |\n|                |          | 7       |\n|                |          | 6       |\n|                | Part II  | 1,373   |\n|                |          | 13      |\n|                |          | 6       |\n|                | Part III | 457     |\n|                |          | 7       |\n|                |          | 9       |\n| Proceedings    |          | 790     |\n|                |          | 12      |\n|                |          | 6       |\n\nTotal Rs. 4,875 9 3\n\nThis is less than the Budget Estimate by Rs. 3,324-6-9, but all the bills for Journal, Part III, during the past year have not yet been submitted.\n\nThe Budget Estimate of probable ordinary Receipts and Expenditure for 1897 has been fixed as follows:\u2014Receipts Rs. 17,800; Expenditure Rs. 16,700.\n\nOn the Receipt side, the estimated incomes under the heads of \"Subscriptions,\" \"Sale of Publications,\" and \"Interest on Investments\" is based upon the actuals of the last year. \"Rent of Rooms\" has been increased owing to the increased rent paid by the Photographic Society of India for additional accommodation.\n\nOn the Expenditure side, the items of \"Commission,\" \"Lighting,\" and \"Printing Circulars\" have been slightly increased. \"Salaries\" and \"Stationery\" have been increased by Rs. 100, and Binding Rs. 250. There is a new item of Rs. 100 under the head of \"Petty Repairs.\" The other heads remain unaffected.\n\nBeyond the Auditor's fee, no other extraordinary expenditure is anticipated during 1897.\nThe details of Budget Estimates are as follows:\u2014\n\n### Receipts\n\n| Description               | Amount |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Subscriptions             | Rs. 7,200 0 0 |\n| Sale of Publications      | Rs. 600 0 0 |\n| Interest on Investments   | Rs. 5,700 0 0 |\n| Rent of Rooms             | Rs. 1,200 0 0 |\n| Government Allowances     | Rs. 3,000 0 0 |\n| Miscellaneous             | Rs. 100 0 0 |\n| **Total**                 | **Rs. 17,800 0 0** |\n\n### Expenditure\n\n| Description               | Amount |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Salaries                  | Rs. 3,500 0 0 |\n| Commission                | Rs. 450 0 0 |\n| Pension                   | Rs. 52 0 0 |\n| Stationery                | Rs. 200 0 0 |\n| Lighting                  | Rs. 48 0 0 |\n| Municipal Taxes           | Rs. 819 0 0 |\n| Postage                   | Rs. 600 0 0 |\n| Freight                   | Rs. 30 0 0 |\n| Meetings                  | Rs. 80 0 0 |\n| Contingencies             | Rs. 150 0 0 |\n| Petty Repairs             | Rs. 100 0 0 |\n| Books                     | Rs. 1,500 0 0 |\n| Local Periodicals         | Rs. 16 0 0 |\n| Binding                   | Rs. 750 0 0 |\n| Journal, Part I           | Rs. 2,100 0 0 |\n| \" II                      | Rs. 2,100 0 0 |\n| \" III                     | Rs. 3,000 0 0 |\n| Proceedings               | Rs. 1,000 0 0 |\n| Printing Circulars, &c.   | Rs. 200 0 0 |\n| Registration Fee          | Rs. 5 0 0 |\n| **Total**                 | **Rs. 16,700 0 0** |\n\n### London Agency\n\nThe number of copies of parts of the *Journal*, of the *Proceedings*, and of the *Bibliotheca Indica*, sent to Messrs.

Hoernle, President, in the chair.\n\nDr. Hoernle, on taking the chair, said:\n\n\"Gentlemen, before we proceed to the ordinary business of this meeting, I wish to tender you my warm acknowledgment of the honour which you have done me by electing me to the responsible position of President of this Society. It is with mixed feelings that, after long hesitation, I have decided to accept the post,\u2014feelings of diffidence in my power of doing justice to its requirements, and feelings of pride in\nbeing permitted, at the end of my Indian career, to preside over a Society which holds such a distinguished place in the learned world, of which I am now one of the oldest resident European members, and which I have had the honour and the pleasure of serving as Philological Secretary for a long term of years. For, looking back on the years passed, I may truly say that my labours for the Society have been a pleasure to me, a relief amidst the drudgery of the ordinary Indian life.\n\nA very distinguished member of the Society, Horace Hayman Wilson, once said with regard to his own labours for the Society that they had made many hours of leisure in this country slip happily away. To have many hours of leisure for scientific work is an experience which I fear is not given to any of us in these days of professional work under high pressure. To me that will always be one of the sad reminiscences of this \"land of regrets.\" However, it is a comfort to know that the prosperity of the Society depends not so much on its President, as on its Secretaries and other officers; and I feel sure, that I may rely on their extending to me the same measure of hearty co-operation with which they have supported my able predecessors during their terms of office. I would, therefore, now ask you to pass a cordial vote of thanks to the retiring President, the Vice-Presidents, the Secretaries and the Council, who, in the past year, have given so ungrudgingly their time and strength to the conduct of the affairs of the Society.\"\n\nThe vote of thanks was carried unanimously.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nFifty-three presentations were announced, details of which are given in the Library List appended.\n\nThe following gentlemen only proposed and seconded at the last Meeting of the Society were ballotted for and elected Ordinary Members:\n\nWalter Weber, Esq.\nDr. Th.

Ranking; No. 4 to Pandit Sad\u0101\u015biva Mi\u015bra, Head Pandit of the P\u016bri Zilla School; and Nos. 5 and 6 to Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dhy\u0101ya Candrak\u0101nta Tark\u0101lank\u0101ra. No. 1, is a well-known standard work of the Buddhist literature. Its publication has been already sanctioned on a previous occasion by the Society. No. 3, is an important Arabic work on the Topography of Muhammadan countries, in the fourth century of the Hijrah including Sindh, and parts of India. No. 4, is a standard work on Hindu Law and ritual in Orissa. Nos. 5 and 6 are two important works, one on the Soma-Sacrifice the other on Hindu Law and ritual. All these works satisfy the ordinary rule that three manuscripts should be available to the Editor. No. 2 is an exception to this rule. Only one manuscript of it exists, which has been lately discovered in P\u016bri. It is recommended, however, to be published, on account of its great interest and the exceeding improbability of another manuscript being found. Its author is Man\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra, the great opponent and, afterwards, convert of \u010c\u0101nkarak\u0101ra. The details of this work and its discovery are reported in the *Proceedings* for December, 1896.\n(4) The following recommendations of the Joint-Secretary are approved:\n\nCaturvarga-cint\u0101ma\u1e47i should not be continued, unless suitable MSS. are available.\n\nThe \u0100nand\u0101\u015brama Series have undertaken to publish Apar\u0101rka. It may therefore be struck off from the list.\n\nThe following work has been stopped for various reasons:\n\nLalita-vistara (English Translation).\n\nThe following list of works sanctioned and approved by the Council, but not taken in hand, has been drawn up in order of urgency:\n\n1.

G. Murray-Aynsley, and read the following note on them:\n\nTo\u2014The Philological Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nKashmir would seem to be a most interesting hunting ground in a direction which has hitherto apparently not been very much studied.\n\nNot only do we find in this country traces of Pre-historic worship, but quite recently only, it has come to my knowledge that the Mahomedan inhabitants of Kashmir and some adjacent districts, have employed both the Cross and the Svastika on some of their buildings whether as an ornament, or a symbol only, it is not easy to determine, and that they also adopt still, the Greek cross on their grave stones. Enclosed (Plate I) are some specimens of the latter from original drawings made on the spot by Dr. Arthur Neve (in West Kashmir and in Chilas) when on tour in September and October in this year (1896), Dr. A. Neve is one of the Medical Missionaries attached to the C. M. S. in Srinagar, and though he has lived there some eight years, had never discovered the Habbakhorten Mosque, situated about two miles\nNo. 1. Grave head-stone carved in shale, from village Khel, West Kashmir; also in Khagan, IN MANSDERA DISTRICT.\n\nNo. 2. Small wooden grave post, Khel. (The Cross is cut in high relief, or often perforated.)\n\nNo. 3. Grave Post at Khagan.\n\nNo. 4. A beautifully carved grave post near Balakhot, Khagan.\n\nNo. 5.\n\nCopies of drawings made on the spot by Dr. Arthur Neve, a Medical missionary of the C. M. S. in Srinagar, Kashmir.\n\nDr. Neve states that he has not drawn in detail the elaborate and beautiful patterns of carving he saw.\nThese four separate designs are copied from a band of carving which extends round three sides of the old wooden Habbakhorten mosque situated about one mile above Pandrethan, Kashmir. The Mahomedan boat people say that it was built in the time of the Emperor Jehanghir.\nfrom his house. I have recently been there myself, and also send four drawings (Plate II) taken from the band of carving on its exterior. It is interesting to find there the double triangle as well as the Cross and the Svastika, and I am in hopes that now attention has been called to this subject in the minds of some of the permanent employ\u00e9s and residents, more researches may give still further results as regards the former and the present practices and beliefs of the people of \"the Happy Valley.\" The conquests of Alexander and his armies, would seem to have left their impress on many of the countenances of the Mahomedan population of Kashmir, for we not unfrequently meet with a pure Greek type of features amongst these people; the way also, in which some of the peasants when driving their cows home or out to pasture drape themselves with their Shawl or Chuddar, in every particular recalls certain bas-reliefs in the Museums at Athens, illustrating the same occupation and scene.\n\nI remain dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSrinagar:\n\nNovember 10th, 1896.\n\nHarriet G. M.

Note on a find of Coins in the Wun District, Barar.\u2014By Captain Wolseley Haig, Officiating Deputy Commissioner of Barar.\n\nIn July 1896, a Gond was ploughing his field in the village of Kurali in the Kelapuri Ta'alluqa of the Wun District, and turned up...\nwith his plough forty small coins. Encouraged by his find he commenced a search, and turned up coins at the rate of a few daily, until he had found 177 coins in all. He tried to keep his discovery a secret, but it came to the ears of the Patil of the village, who recovered from the Gond 136 coins and three bangles, which the Gond had had made up for himself by the village Sonar out of the balance of the coins. The coins and bangles recovered by the Patil were duly sent by him to the Tahsildar of the Ta'alluqa, who forwarded them to me. I have examined the coins with the following results:\n\n1.

M. Moir.\nDr. D. D. Cunningham.\nThe President laid on the table the following communication:\n\nROYAL SOCIETY.\n\nBURLINGTON HOUSE,\nPICCADILLY,\nLONDON, W.,\nFebruary 22nd, 1897.\n\nSir,\u2014Upon the invitation of the President and Council of the Royal Society, the Presidents of scientific Societies in London met the President and Officers of the Society on February 9 to consider whether any, and, if so, what, steps should be taken on the part of men of science to commemorate the present 60th year of the reign of Her Gracious Majesty the Queen, a period so rich in scientific discoveries. At that meeting, which was a very representative one, it was unanimously resolved\u2014\n\nthat a Fund, to be called The Victoria Research Fund, be established, to be administered by representatives of the various scientific Societies, for the encouragement of research in all branches of science.\n\nTo raise a Fund of such a kind worthy of the occasion, the active cooperation of all the scientific Societies of the Empire is imperatively necessary; for the Fund, to be so worthy, must be a very large one.\n\nIt is not to be expected that scientific Societies would in general contribute out of their corporate funds, though some might be willing to do so; but rather that the several Societies should exert themselves to collect subscriptions to the Fund.\n\nNor is it to be expected that men of science would themselves furnish the required sum. It is to be hoped that they would contribute so far as each felt able. But the chief gifts are to be looked for from the public, from those who are not themselves engaged in scientific inquiry, and especially perhaps from those whose wealth has been the direct or indirect result of the scientific progress of the Victorian era.\n\nSo many demands are at the present moment being made in so many ways upon the purse for the purpose of commemorating the present year, that it may be worthwhile to point out that, the object of the proposed Victoria Fund being a lasting one, it is not necessary that the whole Fund should be raised at once. The Fund once established might be increased by subsequent additions, and contributions might be spread over many years, or might not be called in until some future time, so that the burden in the present year might be lightened.\nIt is proposed that the income of the Victoria Fund should be applied to the advancement of all branches of science in all parts of the British Empire. Should, therefore, the project of the Fund be approved, and the Fund established, its administration will necessitate an organization, the details of which will need most careful consideration in order that the Fund may be used in the best way in all future times; but such details may be left for the present.\n\nMeanwhile, the first step to be taken is to ascertain whether the proposal meets with such general acceptance among men of science as to justify the President and Council in proceeding further in the matter.\n\nI have therefore been requested by my Council to ask you to be so good as to bring the subject before your Society at your earliest convenience, in order to ascertain whether the proposal is approved or not, and at the same time to give the Royal Society the benefit of the advice of your Society upon the whole matter.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n(Signed) LISTER,\nPresident of the Royal Society.\n\nTo the President of the\nAsiatic Society of Bengal,\nCalcutta.\n\nThe President reported that the Council recommended the acceptance of the proposal.\n\nThe proposal was accordingly accepted.\n\nDr. Hoernle read reports on the following finds of Treasure Trove coins:\n\n(I) Report on 42 old coins forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Angul, Orissa, with his No. 1844G, dated 21st November, 1896, and with the Commissioner of Gauhati's No. 1429R, dated 28th September, 1896.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner of Angul, in his No. 1407G, dated 15th August, 1896, and addressed to the Commissioner of Orissa reports, that these coins, together with some gold and silver bars enclosed in a cup-shaped copper vessel, were found by a lad, while grazing cattle on some \"toitu\" land in Pargana Talmul, Mauzah Ara, in Aru, in Angul. The date of finding is not stated.\n\nOf the coins, 20 are of gold and 22 of silver. Most of them are of a rare kind, which gives the find a particular numismatic value.\nThe silver coins, resembling Rupees, belong to three different classes. Two of them belong to the coinage of the early imperial (so-called \"Pathan\") dynasty of Delhi, one to the later Independent Sultans of Bengal, and 18 to the Bahmani dynasty of the Deccan.\n\nThe following is a detailed statement:\n\nI. DELHI IMPERIAL COINAGE.\n   'Al\u0101u-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h, 695\u2013715 H = 1295\u20131315 A.D.\n   Type, square areas within circles, like Brit. Mus.

Chron., No. 18, dates 87*, 886, mint illegible ... ... ... 2\n\nTotal ... 22\nThe gold coins are small round pieces of gold, very thin, averaging only 8 grains, and about 3/8 of an inch in diameter. Eighteen of them have small gold loops attached to them, by which they were found threaded on a piece of string, forming probably a necklet. There are two kinds, consisting of two and eighteen pieces respectively.\n\nThe former are stamped on one side only, the back showing the hollows of the obverse stamp. One specimen shows the figure of the anthropoid Garuda, turned to the left, the other a rosette; both devices are enclosed by a marginal circle of dots. Possibly the two devices represent the obverse and reverse sides of a coin, and the two sides may have been stamped separately on two distinct pieces of gold to form ornaments.\n\nOf the other kind, 18 pieces, all show on the obverse the figure of a recumbent bull, with a variety of emblems, such as the conch-shell, svastika, etc. The reverse of one has the legend (above) pr\u012bgaga in old N\u0101gar\u012b characters, and (below) the number 44 between two strokes (\u096b\u096a). The remaining seventeen pieces, show (above) an irregular oblong quadrangle between two indistinct symbols, and (below) various numbers, viz., 4 (twice), 9 (thrice), 13 (once), 19 (once), 31 (six times), 33 (thrice), 34 (once). Two of these 18, again, show traces of a legend above the oblong, which appear to make up pr\u012b-gaga. The numbers would seem to point to a series of years; but whether of an era or of the reign of a king is unknown. No coins of this description appear to have been noticed or published hitherto. In the *International Numismata Orientalia*, Vol. I, \"Coins of Southern India,\" by Sir Walter Elliot, there is one coin, No. 93 on Plate III, which bears some resemblance to the present coins, but it is too imperfect for identification. It is ascribed by him to the old Hind\u016b kingdom of the K\u0101katiyas of Warangal, which was conquered by the Bahmani Sult\u0101ns, early in the 15th century, A.D.\n\n(II) Report on two gold coins forwarded by the Officiating Superintendent of the Tributary Mahals, Orissa, with his No. 1164 P.W., dated 16th November, and 10th December, 1896.\n\nThese two coins are stated to have been found \"on the banks of the river Br\u0101hm\u012bni in the Tributary State of Dhenkanal,\" and to be \"locally called Hoons.\"\n\nThey are coins of exactly the same type as those recently found in the Angul District of Orissa, and described in the preceding Report. They bear on their reverse the numbers 3 and 34 respectively, which may be the years of either a reign or an era.\nThe President announced that Mr. C. R. Wilson was proceeding on furlough at the end of the month and that Dr. A. R. S. Anderson would officiate.\n\nThe following papers were read:\u2014\n\n1. Statement of the dialects spoken in Baghelkhand.\u2014By Janardan Singh, Secretary to H. H. the Maharaja of Rewah. Communicated by Dr. G. A. Grierson.\n\nNo. 47 of 1897.\n\nFrom\n\nThe Secretary to\n\nHis Highness the Maharaja of Rewah,\n\nTo\n\nThe Political Agent, Baghelkhand.\n\nDated, Rewah Durbar, Camp via Rewah,\n\nThe 13th January, 1897.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your endorsement No. 2836, dated 16th November, 1896, forwarding a copy of letter, dated 28th September, 1896, from G. A. Grierson, Esq., C.I.E., Ph.D., regarding the Linguistic Survey of India, asking a revised statement of the dialects spoken in Baghelkhand, I have the honor to inform you that a revised statement has been prepared and is forwarded herewith.\n\n2. From the statement annexed herewith which is filled up according to the instructions, you will see that Bagheli or Baghelkhandi and Gondi or Gondani are the two dialects spoken in Rewah territory.\n\n3. I do not believe that \"Bagheli is nearly identical with Bundeli or Bundelkhandi\" as Dr. Grierson seems to think. Being spoken in conterminous countries and derived from the same parent stock, there is certainly a good deal of resemblance between the two. They are, however, different forms of speech. Most of the words in Bundeli and Bagheli have the same bases and roots, as is the case with almost all the dialects spoken in Northern and Central India, but a great difference is found in the postpositions and particulars and even the forms of bases of words before receiving the suffixes. This will be clear from the following sentences:\u2014\n| Different Postpositions | Different Verbal Endings | Changes in the Basis Before Receiving Particles |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Bagh\u0113li.                | Bund\u0113li.                 | Bagh\u0113li.                                      |\n| For him.                | He said.                 | Is coming?                                    |\n| \u092c\u094b\u0927\u0947 \u092c\u0940\u0924\u093e              | \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940               | \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940                                    |\n| He had written.         |                          | Is going?                                     |\n| \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940              |                          | \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940                                    |\n| Towards the river.      | Art thou not seeing.     | What do you say?                              |\n| \u0928\u0926\u0940 \u092c\u0947\u0924\u0932              | \u0928\u0926\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940               | \u0928\u0926\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940                                    |\n| I have no money with me.| They had already said.   | Are you giving?                               |\n| \u0928\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940          | \u0928\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940               | \u0928\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940                                    |\n| By me.                  | When I went.             |                                               |\n| \u092c\u094b\u0927\u0947 \u092c\u0940\u0924\u093e              | \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940               | \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940                                    |\n\n* N.B.\u2014\u092f (ya) is added to the bases in Bagh\u0113lkhand\u012b before the particles.\n\nThe intonation with which the Bund\u0113ls speak is also different and there are many new words in Bund\u0113li which are not known in Bagh\u0113li.\n\n4. The people of Bagh\u0113lkhand\u012b may be divided into several tribes or clans, inhabiting separate parts of the country, and giving distinct names to the tracts they inhabit. But these separate tribes do not speak separate dialects, though each has some peculiar words and expressions of its own. These variations are too few to justify us in giving them distinct names as dialects. There are variations in the pronunciation and forms of words in distances of every few miles. But these are very slight and may be found to change from village to village till they merge into the forms of speech of Allahabad or Mirzapur or other British districts that happen to be in the neighbourhood.\n\n5. It appears to be an orthodox belief that G\u014d\u1e47\u1e0di or G\u014d\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ni is derived from the Dravidian or some other non-Aryan\nlanguage. This might be the case with the G\u014dndi of the Central Provinces. But the dialect spoken by the Gonds of Rewah is not the non-Aryan dialect which their brethren use in the Central Provinces. They as well as other tribes, namely Kols, Baigas, &c., mostly of aboriginal descent, inhabiting the southern portion of Rewah, on the other side of the Kymore, speak what represents the widest deviation from the Bagh\u0113l dialect in the State. Herewith are enclosed a prose passage and some songs of the G\u014dndi dialect. These will show that the language they speak is mainly Bagh\u0113li corrupted and mispronounced with an admixture of some new words, the relics of their aboriginal tongue they once spoke.\n\nI have, &c.,\n(Sd.)

Hoernle.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n3. Note on the gait of the Cotton Teal, with exhibition of living specimens.\u2014By F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.\n\nAuthorities on Indian birds seem to be very unanimous in the opinion that the common little Cotton-Teal or Goose-Teal, *Nettopus coromandelianus*, is unable to stand and walk like other ducks.\nIn G. R. Gray's genera of Birds, Vol. III, the article being dated 1844, in the remarks on the genus *Nettapus* (as there spelt) Blyth is quoted as observing \"It is remarkable that the Indian species seems totally incapable of standing or walking upon the ground, but invariably flutters along it in a strange scuffling manner, like a wounded bird.\" Some years later, Blyth in his Catalogue of the Birds in the Museum, Asiatic Society, (1849), states in a foot-note to page 302, that the birds of this genus never stand up as represented in Mr. Gould's plates (Birds of Australia, *N. pulchellus* and *N. coromandelianus = albibennis*) but after walking a few steps, always squat.\n\nDr. Jerdon, in his Birds of India, Vol. II, Pt. ii, p. 788, observes that Blyth had noticed \"the peculiar shuffling gait of these ducks when on land\" and quotes the statement given above to the effect that the birds always squat after walking a short distance.\n\nIn Blyth's Commentary on Jerdon, (Ibis 1867, p. 175), the former author again says \"the published figures of the species of this group, representing them as standing on the ground like ordinary ducks, are erroneous. They squat, creep, and are only able to shuffle forward a few paces.\"\n\nFinally, Mr. Hume, in the \"Game-birds and Wildfowl of India, (1881), Vol. III, p. 104, says \"on land they seldom venture, though I have seen them occasionally feeding or resting on small grassy islands; but as Blyth long ago remarked, they cannot walk at all, they only waddle along, shuffling as if their bodies were too heavy for their legs, yet when on trees...........they stand firm enough, and betray no weakness in the lower extremities.\" Further on, p. 108, he says, apropos of the plate he gives of this species, that \"its only fault is, that neither on land nor in water do the birds ever stalk about with their legs visible below them.\"\n\nIt is on account of this consensus of authorities that I have brought for exhibition to-night living birds of this species, to confirm the remarks I am about to make concerning it.\n\nDuring more than a year past I have had many opportunities of seeing Cotton-Teal in confinement, and after watching the gait and ob-movements of numerous specimens, I can confidently assert that the inability to walk attributed to the species by the above excellent observers, is not in reality natural to it, but merely the result of fright, weakness, or injury. [The bird, when frightened, will squat where another duck would stand up.]\n\nCaptive birds, even though not perching, frequently stand up with their legs visible beneath them, in the attitude of any ordinary duck, and they also walk in this position, though they will often shuffle along a few steps without rising properly to their feet.\nBut when walking any greater distance than a few inches (and though prone to lie down frequently, they can on occasion walk for many yards) their gait, though laboured and awkward, is just like that of other ducks, as may be seen in the specimens now exhibited.*\n\nThe habit of walking is not an unnatural one acquired in captivity, as many birds can stand and walk when fresh from the Bazaar. Only the other day a fine male was brought in to me, which walked for several yards as soon as let out of the cage.\n\nMany, in fact the majority of Bazaar birds, however, are frightened or crippled to such an extent that they can only scuffle along as above described; so that I do not wonder that Blyth was misled into thinking that their powers of terrestrial progression were as limited as he says, especially since, judging from his remarks in the *Ibis* paper above cited, wildfowl were even worse treated in the Bazaar then than they are at present.\n\nI never saw my birds rest on one leg, and think Blyth may be right in saying that they cannot do so. (*Loc. cit.* Cat. Birds. Mus. As. Soc.).\n\nMr. Hume's observations, if he actually saw the birds, \"wabbling\" as he calls it, on the islands, would offer a greater difficulty; but from his language he may only have seen them feeding or resting there, and may also have drawn his conclusions as to their gait from Bazaar specimens. I have noticed however that specimens of my own at the edge of the Museum tank frequently lay down to feed on paddy given them there, though when walking their legs showed plainly enough. Among thick grass this might not be so easy to make out, and at the tank I purposely chose the spot in order to observe the birds better.\n\nMr. Hume therefore need find no fault with his artist in this particular.\n\nTo sum up, this bird, though its feet are strong enough for some purposes, as it is an excellent swimmer and diver, and can cling to and climb up wire netting in a remarkable manner, appears to be certainly weak in these members when they are applied to the purpose of walking, and hence is readily disabled. Moreover, it appears normally seldom to leave the water except to perch on trees or buildings.\n\nNevertheless, when circumstances require it, it is able to stand and to walk like the ordinary members of the family to which it belongs, though its activity appears limited, walking being a power which from the circumstances of its life it is seldom called upon to exercise.\n\n* Four birds were exhibited in a cage, and at this point let out on the table, where they walked about. These were captive specimens with clipped wings.\n4. Coins struck at N\u0101han.\u2014By C. J. Rodgers.\n\nSarm\u016br is a small native state, in the lower Himalayas, not far from Simla. At the present day it is famous for its iron works where sugar mills are made which are hired out to sugar-cane-growing farmers in the plains. The Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is an enlightened ruler and has in his employ a staff of English Engineers. N\u0101han, the chief town of the state is very prosperous and is lighted on European methods. But it is N\u0101han at the beginning of the present century I have to deal with. In 1814 it was in the hands of the Gurkhas, and was held by Ranjor Singh Th\u0101pa. On the 24th of December of that year, it was occupied by British troops, and Ranjor Singh retired to Jaithak, a strong fort a little to the north, which he did not evacuate till May 1815, when he was allowed to march out with the arms and accoutrements of his 200 men. This was at the end of the Nep\u0101l War. The Gurkhas had conquered the outer Himalayas as far as Kangra and had held possession of them for several years. There are coins in existence, struck by the Gurkhas during this occupation. I have seen small silver coins struck at Srinagar in Garhw\u0101l on which is the name of a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Nep\u0101l from which country the Gurkhas came. The coins I give below are of copper, the first was struck at N\u0101han during the occupation by the Gurkhas, the second one afterwards. The legends on the first coin I read as follows:\n\nObv.:\u2014\n\nRev.:\u2014\n\nNow, I have edited this coin in my Lahore Catalogue, Pt. IV, p. 64, and have there made some extraordinary mistakes. I could not read the last lines of the obverse as they were not on the coin. They are here plain:\u2014\u201c\u0633\u0631\u06cc \u0645\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u06af\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0648\u06c1\u0627 \u0628\u06a9\u0631\u0645 \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0628\u06a9\u0631\u0645\u201d. The top line I read \u201c\u0645\u0632\u0645\u201d and in my note I\nsaid Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h was the General of the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Nep\u0101l. From a study of the present coin which belongs to W. S. Talbot, Esq., C. S., Settlement Officer, Jhelum, I see I was wrong and hasten to correct my mistake. On the coins of the later Nep\u0101l Mah\u0101r\u0101jas the names and titles generally come, in N\u0101gar\u012b letters, thus:\u2014\u201cCri Cri so and so Vikrama \u015a\u0101ha Deva.\u201d On this copper coin, reading from the bottom we have;\u2014\n\nwhere we see some alterations:\u2014the insertion of \u201cMah\u0101r\u0101ja\u201d and the alteration of \u201cDeva\u201d to \u201cBah\u0101dur.\u201d \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c \u092f\u0941\u0935\u0930\u093e\u091c is changed to \u0917\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0928 \u091c\u092f \u0939\u0948\u0915\u0930. I do not recollect seeing the title \u201cMah\u0101r\u0101ja\u201d on any other coin of Nep\u0101l. It is common on the coins of Kangra, and the coins of Sikkim have \u091a\u0940 \u091a\u0940 \u091a\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u093f\u0924 \u092a\u0924\u093f \u092e\u093e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c on them, with the last word spelt \u092e\u093e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c, as a variant. \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c is also on the coins of Srinagar in Garhw\u0101l, struck by Pradip \u015a\u0101h, Lallat \u015a\u0101h and Parduman \u015a\u0101h. So this coin of N\u0101han follows the coins of Srinagar somewhat.\n\nOn the obverse the word I read \u0645\u06cc\u0645\u0646\u062a, I now read \u0635\u0639\u0628\u062a, although, the year 1227 is the Hijri year = 1812 A.D.\n\nThe only excuse I can offer for these mistakes is that I mistook \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0645 for \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0645 and then, having started a theory, I made \u0628\u06c1\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0634\u0627\u06c1 a person, whereas the three words \u0628\u06c1\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u062c\u092f \u0939\u0948\u0915\u0930 are the titles of Girv\u0101n Yuddh. I can only plead that, in my library, I possess no history of N\u0101han except the stray notices given of it, in the eleventh volume of the Gazetteer of the North-West Provinces. The Gazetteer of the Panjab takes up only the British possessions, so it was useless looking in that for anything about N\u0101han. The Panjab Government would be conferring a benefit on the public by getting out a Gazetteer of the Native States, in and around the country under immediate British rule.\n\nThe second coin I give, I take to be one of Fath \u015a\u0101h Bah\u0101dur Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, but I cannot make out all the legend on the obverse. He was Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Sarm\u016br. The year seems to be 1877 on the reverse and if this is Samvat, it is equal to 1820 A.D. There is no doubt about the mint N\u0101han.\n\nN\u0100HAN COINS\nBoth the coins in weight approximate that of the d\u0101m of Akbar. The d\u0101ms of Akbar abounded in some of the lower Hills some years ago. I have seen several specimens of each of these N\u0101han coins, but no others from that mint.\n\n5. Note on the breeding of various Birds (Herons and Cormorants) in a wild state in the Alipur Zoological Gardens.\u2014By Ram Brahma Sanyal, Superintendent. With a plate.\n\nThe picturesque island with its wealth of vegetation in the middle of the broadest part of the ornamental waters of the garden has, for many years past, been the favourite resort of various kinds of animals.\n\nBut the aspect of Nature on the island has, of late, considerably changed. The trees have gradually become more and more bare of leaves, and the ground denuded of vegetation. All this has been brought about by large flocks of Night-herons (*Nycticorax nycticorax*, (L.)), and latterly of Cormorants, having taken possession of the island. Early in the winter of 1892-93, a few Night-herons were observed among the large number of Pond-herons, or Paddy-birds, (*Ardeola grayi*, (Sykes)) that hitherto inhabited the island, but their movements were not particularly watched. With the exception of a few Pond-herons that remained to breed, they all left the place about the middle of February, 1893. At the beginning of the next cold weather the Night-herons began to reappear. As far as it is remembered, one forenoon about the beginning of November, 1893, a large number of these birds were observed hovering round over the lake as if undecided where to settle. In fact, it took them three or four days before they could finally make up their minds to settle down on the island; choosing, the meantime, some of the densely-foliaged trees of the garden, mostly around the lake, as their hiding places during the day. With the approach of the hot weather their number began to diminish, till they again deserted the island about the middle of March, 1894, to find fresh fields and pastures new. It is, however, believed that some of them must have remained with the Paddy-birds to nest and breed; but as their nests were not visited nothing can be said with certainty about their breeding in that year.\n\nIn the winter following a still larger number of them re-appeared and took so complete a possession of the island that the Paddy-birds were obliged to retire in their favour, until the time for migration came, and the majority of the Night-herons left the place, affording the Paddy-birds opportunity to retrieve their lost ground. But it was to a limited extent only, as a great many Night-herons remained behind for the purpose of breeding. About this time a few Cormorants (*Phalacrocorax pygmaeus*, Pall.) appeared on the scene, and became, as will\nappear later on, formidable rivals of the Night-herons as regards the possession of the island.\n\nIn point of the number of Night-herons the maximum was reached during the cold weather of 1896. From several observations made after sunset, when they would issue forth and wing their way, in parties of varying numbers, towards their feeding grounds, it was calculated that between thirteen and fifteen hundred Night-herons must have been living in the Island. The result of such a vast flock of birds congregating together within a small area and with comparatively few trees to give them shelter has been somewhat disastrous to the vegetation which, instead of being healthy and luxuriant, looks sickly and bare. For the birds, therefore, the place has lost much of its attraction. Not finding the same shelter and hiding places among the almost leafless branches of the trees, a great many of them have taken possession of other trees and shrubs bordering the waters.\n\nIt has been already remarked that a large number of Night-herons remained with the Paddy-birds during the summer of 1895, for the purpose of breeding. In the following summer (1896), the number of Night-herons that stayed for the same purpose was so great that the Paddy-birds were obliged to abandon the Island for some time. Night-herons seem to build everywhere; on trees, on shrubs and in tufts of reed-grass close to the ground. The nests are generally unsubstantial and clumsy. Eggs have been collected as early as the latter end of May, but they go on breeding till the end of July, or the middle of August.\n\nThe majority of Night-herons return long before sunrise from feeding excursions, and for some time, much fluttering and jostling goes on in the Island. Stragglers are frequently seen rapidly flying and uttering at intervals the characteristic call-note w\u0101k-w\u0101k, from which, as is well known, the species has derived its vernacular name. During the cold winter mornings, they are very fond of sunning themselves, and look very conspicuous as they occupy every sunny spot on the trees or shrubs. If the tree or the shrub happens to be thickly covered with leaves they are hardly seen during broad day-light.\n\nLatterly Cormorants have become as conspicuous, though not as interesting a feature of the Island as Night-herons. For some time before others came to live on the Island, a pair of them could, every now and then, be seen disporting themselves in the water around the large group of pandanus growing upon a smaller Island in the lake. It is not unlikely that they attracted others, which having found the place to their liking stayed on. The most interesting event, however, in connection with the occupation of the Island by Cormorants is the coming of a few Snake-birds (*Plotus melanogaster*, (Penn.)) with them.\nlast year. It is yet hoped that they will renew their visit and make up their minds to breed on the Island.*\n\n6. On some noteworthy Indian Birds, with exhibition of specimens.\u2014By F.

The Congress was formally opened on Monday, the 6th September, 1897, at a meeting held at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand at 9\u201330 A.M., under the presidency of the Ministre de l'Instruction et des Beaux-Arts. The Inaugural Address was delivered by M. Schefer, the President of the Congress. It has been printed, and I have the honour to submit herewith a copy. This was followed by an address of welcome delivered by the President of the Municipal Council of Paris, and by several short speeches of various delegates of Governments and Learned Societies. The meeting then adjourned to allow the different members to form themselves into sections. The following sections were constituted:\n\nI. Languages and Archaeology of Aryan Countries.\n   (a) Languages and Archaeology of India.\n   (b) Iran.\n   (c) Linguistics.\n\nII. Languages and Archaeology of the Far East.\n   (a) China and Japan.\n   (b) Indo-China, Malay, and Polynesia.\n\nIII. Musalman Languages and Archaeology.\n\nIV.

The East, Greece.\u2014Relations of Hellenism with the East.\u2014Byzantium.\n\nVII. Ethnography, Folklore of the East.\n\n3. I joined Section I (a). Languages and Archaeology of India. My report will therefore deal principally with that Section. The following gentlemen were appointed the officials of the section:\n\nPresident: Lord Reay.\n\nVice-Presidents: Hofrath G. Buehler, Professor Pischel, and Professor Kern.\n\nSecretaries: Dr. Formichi, Messrs. Stickney, and Grosset.\n\n4. The following is a summary of the proceedings of the Section:\n\nMonday, 6th September, Afternoon.\n\nProfessor H. Oldenberg, of Kiel, read a paper on Taine's Essay on Buddhism. He pointed out that this essay, which hitherto had been almost unknown was full of suggestion to those who were working now-a-days under more favourable conditions. Professor Rhys Davids, Dr. Buehler, M. Senart, and Lord Reay joined in the discussion which followed, and congratulated Dr. Oldenberg on his discovery of the forgotten Essay.\nM. Sylvain L\u00e9vi, on behalf of M. Barth, laid on the table an important index prepared by Mr. Bloomfield of Bergaigne's well-known \"Religion Vedique.\"\n\nM. Ballin read a communication on the two veterinary treatises of Jayadatta and Nakula.\n\nM. Speyer read a paper on Gambling in Ancient India.\n\nTuesday, 7th September, Morning.\n\nMr. R. Sewell read a paper entitled \"Some points in the Archaeology of Southern India,\" in which he summed up the progress made in Archaeological researches during past years, and indicated the directions in which research could most usefully be made in future. In a second communication he drew attention to the importance of Ancient Tamil Literature, and informed the meeting that Dr. Pope had prepared annotated translations of the \"Pura Nannurru\" or \"Four hundred War-Poems\" and of the \"Pura Porul Venba,\" which is a summary of the former, about two hundred years more modern. Want of funds had hitherto prevented the University of Oxford from publishing this important work. The section resolved that it was most desirable that Dr. Pope's interesting work should be published at an early date.\n\nM. Geiger read an interesting account of the Veddas of Ceylon and their language. A discussion followed, in which Messrs. Wickremasingha, Pischel, Ludwig, Rhys Davids, and Lord Reay took part.\n\nCount Pull\u00e9 described an ancient map of India, and urged the importance of the proposal made by M. L\u00e9vi at the Geneva Congress for the preparation of a Chartography of India. Messrs. L\u00e9vi, Buehler, and Count de Gubernatis addressed the section on the subject. The following resolution was then agreed to:\n\n\"Que le Congr\u00e8s des Orientalistes de 1897 adresses aux Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de G\u00e9ographie des diff\u00e9rents pays, et \u00e0 l'India Office la demande d'entreprendre le classement chronologique et la publication des cartes, qui, \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9poques, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trac\u00e9es sur les diff\u00e9rents pays d'Orient.\"\n\nAfternoon.\n\nM. Grosset laid on the table a copy of the first volume of his critical edition of the Bh\u0101ratiya-n\u0101\u1e6dya-c\u0101stra and gave a full account of the whole of this important work.\n\nProf. Hardy read a paper on the Legend of Kujjutar\u0101 and\nS\u0101mavat\u012b in Buddhagh\u014d\u1e63a's Manorathap\u016br\u1e47i. I was unfortunately not present when the paper was read. The Times report of the Congress says that he discussed various Indian parallels to the story which forms the principal incident in one of Schiller's legends. Professors Ludwig, Kuhn, and Leumann gave yet other instances of the clever way in which the legends make the heroine save the life of her lover who is himself carrying the letter which seems so innocent while it is really his death-warrant.\n\nWednesday, 8th September, Morning.\n\nAfter some remarks of Dr. Buehler on MSS. of the Jaiminiya Grhya-s\u016btra, and \u0100ra\u1e47ya-s\u016btra, which had been lately discovered by Dr. Hultzsch, and which were now deposited at Vienna, Dr. Waddell exhibited his fine collection of photographs of the newly excavated Greco-Buddhist Sculptures from the Sw\u0101t valley (Udy\u0101na), and read a paper on the subject. After some discussion, it was resolved to draw up a resolution urging upon the Government of India the importance of carrying on its researches into the antiquities of India. This resolution was drafted by a small sub-committee, and was passed at the next day's meeting. It will be recorded in due course.\n\nM. Cimmino read a paper on the Indian Theatre in Europe. He was followed by Dr. Winternitz who described the MSS. of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata in the Whish collection of the R.A.S. Some of the Southern MSS. showed remarkable variations from the hitherto accepted text. In the discussion which followed it was resolved that a critical edition of the great Epic should be undertaken in Europe, and that arrangements should be made for that purpose. Dr. Winternitz also laid on the table his edition of the \"Mantrap\u0101\u1e6dha or the prayer-book of the \u0100pastambins,\u2014Pt. I.\"\n\nAfternoon.\n\nCount de Gubernatis made a short communication regarding \"The God Brahman and the Goddess S\u0101vitr\u012b.\" He was followed by M. Formichi on \"The God Brhaspati in the Rg-Veda,\" who in his turn was succeeded by Professor Kirste on Inversion in the Direction of Writing.\n\nM. Foucher, who was at the time travelling in India, had sent to the Congress a paper entitled \"The Itinerary of Hiuen-Tsiang in Gandh\u0101ra.\" The paper being a long one had been entrusted to M. Finot for the preparation of an abstract. This\nhad now been done, and the abstract was laid before the meeting. In the discussion which followed, such competent authorities as Dr. Stein and Dr. Buehler took a part.\n\nA paper by Mr. Baynes on \"La Conception de la Voie ou du Chemin dans le Mysticisme oriental,\" was next laid upon the table, and the day's sitting concluded with a long and interesting paper by Mr. Macauliffe on \"The Religion and Sacred Books of the Sikha.\"\n\nThursday, September, 9th, Morning.\n\nThe Sitting opened with an important notice by M. Senart of an ancient birch-bark MS. containing a portion of the Dhammapada written in the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi character. It was discovered in Central Asia by Dutreuil de Rhins, and he proposed that it should be named after that intrepid explorer who had since succumbed a victim to his devotion to science. The MS. consisted merely of fragments, but there was sufficient to show that it was a recension of the Dhammapada differing somewhat from the version at present current. The language was a P\u0101li, but was more nearly allied to the P\u0101li of the A\u1e63\u1e6daka Inscriptions than to that of the classical books, and exactly agreed with no known variety of P\u0101li.\n\nM. Senart was succeeded by Professor S. von Oldenburg, who described fragments of the same MS. which had arrived simultaneously at St. Petersburg. There was no doubt that the Paris and the St Petersburg fragments both belonged to the same book. The character and language are the same, and both are fragments of the Dhammapada. The greatest interest was shown in the subject by the scholars present, and photographic facsimiles of this, the most ancient Indian MS. known to exist, were exhibited and distributed.\n\nProfessor Deussen next laid upon the table a copy of his latest work, \"Sechzig Upanishads des Veda,\" translated, with Introduction and Notes. He drew the attention of the members present to the importance of the ideas contained in these old philosophical treatises, and added some remarks as to the results at which he had arrived in studying the chronological order of the texts of the different upanishads.\n\nThe session concluded with a paper by Mr. G. Oppert \"On the Bharatas.\"\n\nHe concluded that the Bharatas mentioned in the Rg-Veda were not the same people as the Tritsus, but were rather a tribe of warriors of non-Aryan origin.\nAfternoon.\n\nThe sub-committee appointed to draft the resolutions regarding exploration in India submitted its recommendations. The resolutions were adopted unanimously. As they are long, I cannot do better than quote the excellent abstract given in the \"Athen\u00e6um.\"\n\n1. Thanks to the Government of India and to Sir C. Elliott, Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, \"present at the Congress,\" for measures already taken for preservation of art treasures in the Swat Valley and neighbourhood, with an urgent request for further precautions against irresponsible private collectors.\n\n2. Recognition of the eminent services to archaeology of Major Deane in this region.\n\n3. The establishment of an international society, with headquarters in London, for the furtherance of Archaeological explorations, to be called the \"India Exploration Fund,\" with a provisional committee consisting of Lord Reay, Sir A. Lyall, M. Senart (France), Hofrath Buehler (Austria), Professor Pischel (Germany), Professor von Oldenburg (Russia), and Count Pull\u00e9 (Italy).\n\n4 & 5. Thanks to the Government of India and to that of Nepal for help in the recent discoveries in the Tarai of the traditional birthplace of Buddha.\n\n6. Thanks to the Government of Bengal, especially to Sir C. Elliott, Lieutenant-Governor, for the recently established \"Asoka Gallery\" in the Indian Museum, in which casts of the oldest inscriptions are collected, and copies made available for other institutions.\n\nThe meeting broke up after passing a vote of regret at the absence of Professors Weber, Ascoli, Cowell, and Fausb\u00f6ll.\n\nFriday, 10th September, Morning.\n\nProfessor Bendall laid on the table a copy of his edition of the \u00c7ik\u1e63\u0101sanaucaya. This forms the first volume of a new series of works dealing with Buddhism, entitled the \"Bibliotheca Buddhica,\" and published at the expense of the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg. The Section begged Professor S. von Oldenburg to convey to the Academy its thanks for the light which it is throwing on Buddhist Literature by the publication of this important Series.\n\nM. Aymonier read a paper on the King Ya\u00e7ovarman of Cambodia. In the discussion which followed, Professor Pischel, Dr. Buehler, and M. Senart drew attention to the interest which\nattached to the inscriptions which had been discovered at Cambodia, and to the fresh light which they throw upon the character of the Ancient Hindus. They did not here appear as Dreamers and Preachers, but as a Nation of Conquerors. While it was true that the first inspiration of the Indian Propaganda in foreign countries was due to Buddhism, it was necessary to note that the most ancient of the Inscriptions of Cambodia were Brahmanical.\n\nThe President laid on the table a copy of Sir W. Hunter's life of Bryan Hodgson, regarding which Professor Bendall gave some interesting particulars. The President also announced that M. Cordier intended to publish a new edition of Col. Yule's translation of the Travels of Marco Polo.\n\nDr. Stein laid on the table a copy of the first volume of his translation of the R\u0101jatarangin\u012b, and explained the valuable maps which accompanied it. These maps will also appear in the Journal of this Society, and it is not necessary for me to dwell here on their excellence and importance. At the afternoon meeting the following resolution was carried unanimously regarding this work:\n\n\"The Section expresses its thanks to the Panjab University and to the Government of Kashmir for the valuable aid which, on the recommendation of the Oriental Congress held at Geneva, they have given to the labours of Dr. Stein, in enabling him to complete his translation of the R\u0101jatarangin\u012b and to carry out his topographical enquiries.\n\n\"At the same time, it expresses the hope that opportunities will be given to him to complete the work by adding an Historical Introduction.\"\n\nProfessor Leumann read a paper on the meaning of the two Jain terms \"avassiy\u0101\" and \"nisiciy\u0101.\" He proposed new derivations for these two words, and drew attention to the fact that the ceremonies which they indicate have close analogies in the Roman Catholic Service. It was resolved that \"the Section considers that it is of urgent importance to publish a critical edition of the sacred books of the Jains.\"\n\nAfternoon.\n\nMr. Sewell read a note on places in the Madras Presidency where there were Archaeological remains which required investigation. Resolved that the attention of the Madras Government should be drawn to the desirability of excavating these remains.\nI then had the honour of myself reading a short report on the progress of the Linguistic Survey of India, which had been first suggested by the Oriental Congress held at Vienna in 1886. A discussion followed in which Lord Reay, Prof. Pischel, Dr. Burgess, Prof. Kuhn, and Dr. Buehler joined. The following resolution was proposed by Prof. Kuhn, seconded by Dr. Buehler and carried unanimously:\n\n\"The Indian Section of the 11th International Congress of Orientalists expresses its grateful thanks to the Government of India for having adopted the Resolution passed at the Congress held at Vienna in 1886, recommending the undertaking of a Systematic Survey of the Languages of India. It again desires to place on record the services to Linguistic Science which will be rendered by the Scheme, when it has been brought to completion.\"\n\nBaron Textor de Ravisi read a paper on \"A mural Inscription in the Temple of Udaipur in Malwa.\" It was resolved that, \"Considering the historical importance of this inscription, and that there are two contradictory translations of it, viz., that of Kamala-kanta (for the Bengal Asiatic Society), and that of Father R. P. Burthey (of the Society of Jesus), the Asiatic Society of Bengal should be requested to take steps to obtain an accurate copy of this inscription, for comparison with that published by Prinsep and published in his Essays.\"\n\nDr. Lueders offered some remarks on King Nami, and endeavoured to prove that the prose of the J\u0101takas, which is certainly posterior to that of the G\u0101th\u0101s, was composed in Ceylon. M. Feer then read a paper on the J\u0101takas in the Works of Hiuen Tsiang. He was followed by Mr. Wickremasingha on the development of the Sinhalese Alphabet. A resolution was then passed thanking the Government of Ceylon for the publication of its Archaeological Reports and of the Mah\u0101vamsa. The Section expressed the hope that the work so happily commenced would not be abandoned.\n\nMr. Dharmapala read a paper \"On Thana.\" He was followed by Dr. Oertel on the Jaiminiya-br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The sitting concluded with a paper by M. Laval\u00e9e-Poussin on \"Une Pratique des Tantras.\" He described the various Buddhist Tantric Schools (anuttarayoga-tantras).\n\nThe Section before breaking up for the day passed the resolution regarding Dr. Stein's translation of the R\u0101jatarangini already referred to.\nSaturday, 11th September.\n\nThe last meeting of the Section took place on Saturday morning. Professor Rhys Davids commenced by discussing the alleged persecutions of Indian Buddhists by the Br\u0101hmans, and came to the conclusion that they were not proved. He incidentally discussed the meaning of the \"an\u0101gata-bhay\u0101ni\" of the Bhabra Edict of Asoka.\n\nM. Sylvain L\u00e9vi laid on the table papers by Mah\u0101mah\u014dpadhy\u0101ya Mah\u0113\u015bacandra Ny\u0101yaratna, Mr. P. C. Mukherjee, and Pandit Harapras\u0101d \u010c\u0101stri. They were accepted with a vote of thanks \"a ces collaborateurs l'ontains.\"\n\nM. Senart then laid on the table a paper by Dr. Hoernle, C.I.E., on ancient MSS. lately discovered in Central Asia. He laid stress on the importance of the MSS., and on the interesting character of the paper.*\n\nThere followed a vote of thanks to the University of Lyons for publishing the Bh\u0101rat\u012bya-n\u0101\u1e6dya-\u00e7\u0101stra in its \"Annales.\"\n\nThe Section then closed its sittings with a vote of thanks to the President.\n\n5. For the sake of completeness, I take the liberty of extracting the following notice of the principal papers read in the other Sections, of which I was not a member, from the excellent report given in the Athen\u00e6um:\n\n\"In Section Ib. (Iran) far less work was to be done. A paper of Mr. A. W. Jackson may be mentioned, following out Darmesteter's idea of the connexion between the Indian epics and the early Persian legends.\n\nIn Section IIa. (China, &c.), may be noticed M. D\u00e9v\u00e9ria's paper on the Manich\u00e6ans in China. M. Boell also made some notes on the Lolo script.\n\nIn Section IIb. (Indo-China) M. Aymonier's paper on King Ya\u00e7\u014d-varman and M. Feer's notes on illustrations of the J\u0101takas in Siam deserve mention.\n\nIn the far larger Section III. (langues musulmanes), presided over by Prof. de Goeje, the proceedings commenced by a paper proposing a new derivation of the word sendik from the Aramaic zadiq. The prominent feature of the section's sittings was, however, the announcement by Prof. Goldziher of a detailed project for the revival of the great encyclop\u00e6dia of Islam originally conceived by the late Professor Robertson Smith. The President communicated notes on two MSS. of\n\n* This paper is published in the Society's Journal, Part I, for 1897, No. 4.\nthe important work of the Arab historian Ibn-al-Mujawir. The communications of MM. Karabacek and Houdas, confirming the Indian origin of the Arabic numeral figures, were noteworthy. Mention was also made of recent works undertaken for the study of the mosques and of the basilicas existing in Tunisia.\n\nIn Section IVa. (Semitic), where Prof. Guidi presided, Dr. Ginsburg presented a fragment of a Hebrew MS. of Ecclesiasticus discovered by Mrs. Lewis and her sister. Later on M. Hal\u00e9vy called attention to the great importance of the discovery for the literary history of the Bible. A resolution was passed in furtherance of a critical edition of the Talmud. On the following day another resolution was passed in favour of a meeting in 1899 of Semitic scholars in Palestine. The communications of M. Schwab on the Meghillat Ta'ut and Dr. Haupt on the Hebrew pluralis majestatis also deserve mention.\n\nIn the small Section IVb. (Assyriology) the president was Dr. Tiele, with Messrs. Pinches, Hommel, and Haupt as vice-presidents. M. Scheil gave an account of his recent discoveries in the East, and Mr. Pinches spoke of his proposed series of texts from private collections. The thanks of the section were voted to Hamdi Bey, the Turkish director of excavations, for his services to archaeology.\n\nIn Section V. (Egypt and African Languages) M. Naville presided. Here the great event was the description (already foreshadowed at the general sitting on Monday) by Dr. Erman of his proposed Thesaurus, to be published by the German Government and directed by a committee of the academies of Berlin, Leipzig, G\u00f6ttingen, and Munich. It is to deal with words from hieroglyphic and hieratic texts, and its full publication will take some sixteen years. M. Sethe's paper on the alleged occurrence of the names of Ousaphais and Mibis on certain early vases excited considerable interest.\n\nThe sections of Gr\u00e8ce-Orient (VI.) and Ethnography (VII.) were presided over by M. Bikelas and Dr. Vamb\u00e9ry respectively.\"\n\n6. In connexion with Linguistics, I wish to draw prominent attention to the Laboratory of Experimental Phonetics in the Coll\u00e8ge de France. It is open to students of all nationalities. There is a machine there which should certainly be vigorously employed in India. It is the invention of the Abb\u00e9 Rousselot, and its object is the mechanical registration of all sounds, showing graphically the component parts of each. It may most easily be described as based on the principal of the Phonograph or of the Graphophone which have frequently been exhibited in Calcutta. We know that in these machines, a stylus set in motion by a diaphragm makes certain marks on a revolving cylinder. This is exactly what is done in the Abb\u00e9 Rousselot's machine, but the\nmarks are made on smoked paper, and the vibrations of the stylus are considerably magnified before impression. The actual forms of the marks are thus rendered visible through an ordinary magnifying glass. In this way it is seen that each vowel makes its own peculiar mark. There are separate styli for the lips, the throat, the nose, and so on, each of which is only thrown into action when the organ with which it is connected is used. A sound can thus be most accurately analysed out, both as regards consonantal and vocalic elements. There are other appliances subsidiary to the main machine, which I have not room to mention here. For instance, there is an artificial palate, which records the exact place of the palate which is touched by the tongue in uttering a palatal or cerebral sound. I strongly recommend that the Society should obtain one of these machines if possible, and carry on investigations into the sounds employed in the various Indian Languages.\n\n7. In this report, I have of necessity confined myself to the scientific side of the Congress, but it would ill become me if I did not refer to the gracious hospitality shown to us all by our Parisian hosts. Nothing could exceed the kindness shown to us, and, to me, personally, this was enhanced by frequent opportunities of renewing old acquaintances and of meeting old and valued friends.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour most obedient Servant,\n\nGeorge A. Grierson.\n\nCONGR\u00c8S INTERNATIONAL DES ORIENTALISTES\n\nXIME SESSION\u2014PARIS\u20141897.\n\nDiscours D'Ouverture\n\nde\n\nM. LE PR\u00c9SIDENT DE LA XIe SESSION.\n\nDu Congr\u00e8s International.\n\ndes Orientalistes.\n\nMes premi\u00e8res paroles, dans cette s\u00e9ance d'ouverture du onzi\u00e8me Congr\u00e8s international des Orientalistes, seront des paroles de remerciement pour les savants qui, de toutes les parties du monde, se sont rendus \u00e0 l'appel qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9.\n\nJe dois aussi, au nom du Comit\u00e9 d'organisation, faire agr\u00e9er les expressions de notre gratitude aux chefs d'\u00c9tats et aux princes qui ont bien voulu, par leur adh\u00e9sion, donner un t\u00e9moignage de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'ils portent aux progr\u00e8s de nos \u00e9tudes.\nM. le Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique s'est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le Protecteur de notre Congr\u00e8s. S. M. le roi de Su\u00e8de et Norv\u00e8ge, qui nous a, il y'a quelques ann\u00e9es, accord\u00e9 une si large et si gracieuse hospitalit\u00e9, S. M. le ch\u00e2h de Perse, S. A. R. Mgr le Prince de Galles, S. A. I. et R. l'archiduc Renier, dont le bienveillant accueil demeure grav\u00e9 dans tous les souvenirs, S. A. I. le grand-duca Constantin, qui porte \u00e0 toutes les branches des connaissances humaines un si puissant int\u00e9r\u00eat, S. A. I. le Prince Kan-In et S. A. le Kh\u00e9dive d'\u00c9gypte ont d\u00fb ignorer accepter le titre de Pr\u00e9sidents d'honneur. Il est de notre devoir de leur adresser en ce jour l'hommage de notre gratitude. Les ministres et les repr\u00e9sentants d'un grand nombre d'\u00c9tats figurent parmi les membres d'honneur, et les Universit\u00e9s et les corps savants du monde entier ont d\u00e9sign\u00e9 des d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s pour les repr\u00e9senter au Congr\u00e8s : nous ne saurions laisser \u00e9chapper l'occasion qui s'offre aujourd'hui \u00e0 nous de leur donner un t\u00e9moignage public de nos vives sympathies.\n\nL'id\u00e9e de r\u00e9unir, \u00e0 des \u00e9poques fixes \u00e0 l'avance, les savants qui font des langues, des croyances, de l'histoire et de la litt\u00e9rature des peuples de l'Orient, l'objet de leurs \u00e9tudes, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 Paris, il y a pr\u00e8s de vingt-cinq ans. Je ne vous rappellerai pas le nom du professeur qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'instigateur ; il est connu de vous tous et il est le t\u00e9moin du succ\u00e8s qui a couronn\u00e9 son initiative.\n\nLe premier Congr\u00e8s de Paris fut suivi, deux ans apr\u00e8s, par celui de Londres, et les mati\u00e8res qui y furent trait\u00e9es parurent pr\u00e9senter assez d'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour qu'\u00e0 la demande de feu M. Grigoriew, le Gouvernement russe propos\u00e2t aux diff\u00e9rents \u00c9tats de l'Europe d'accorder aux Congr\u00e8s internationaux d'Orientalistes un appui efficace et de s'y faire repr\u00e9senter. Cette proposition re\u00e7ut un assentiment g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et presque toutes les capitales de l'Europe ont successivement accord\u00e9 aux Orientalistes une cordiale et g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse hospitalit\u00e9.\n\nAujourd'hui, le Congr\u00e8s se r\u00e9unit dans son lieu d'origine et c'est avec une satisfaction sans m\u00e9lange que nous constatons les heureux r\u00e9sultats obtenus pendant une p\u00e9riode de pr\u00e8s de vingt-cinq ans.\n\nDes relations personnelles se sont \u00e9tablies entre les \u00e9rudits venus de diff\u00e9rents pays : elles se sont converties, pour la plupart, en solides amiti\u00e9s. Des documents scientifiques d'une grande valeur, des d\u00e9couvertes d'un haut int\u00e9r\u00eat ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9es et mis en lumi\u00e8re, enfin des id\u00e9es f\u00e9condes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises au sujet de publications qu'il \u00e9tait utile d'entreprendre.\n\nNous pouvons aujourd'hui constater, avec un vif plaisir, les progr\u00e8s accomplis dans les \u00e9tudes orientales pendant ce quart de si\u00e8cle et appr\u00e9cier l'importance des travaux dont elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet. Les langues s\u00e9mitiques ont \u00e9t\u00e9, comme par le pass\u00e9, le sujet de s\u00e9rieux\nouvrages. La publication du texte arabe d'un historien de premier ordre, celle des ouvrages g\u00e9ographiques que nous ont laiss\u00e9s des voyageurs des premiers si\u00e8cles de l'islamisme, nous permettent d'avoir maintenant une connaissance exacte de l'empire des khalifes Abbassides et des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui s'y sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s jusqu'aux premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es du IV\u1d49 si\u00e8cle de l'h\u00e9gire. D'autres ouvrages, d'une \u00e9tendue moins consid\u00e9rable, et relatifs \u00e0 l'histoire, \u00e0 la po\u00e9sie et \u00e0 la grammaire arabes, ont aussi vu le jour tout r\u00e9cemment et de nombreux m\u00e9moires de numismatique et d'\u00e9pigraphie ont permis de fixer quelques dates d'une mani\u00e8re certaine et de rectifier des inexactitudes. Les langues, la g\u00e9ographie, l'histoire et l'arch\u00e9ologie de l'Afrique du Nord ont donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 leur c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie de publications qui ont attir\u00e9, sur cette r\u00e9gion, l'attention des savants.\n\nL'\u00e9tude du persan n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9glig\u00e9e, ni sous le rapport de l'histoire ni sous celui de la po\u00e9sie, et diff\u00e9rents dialectes persans ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois le sujet de travaux s\u00e9rieux : je dois, au sujet de la langue turque, signaler l'importance des d\u00e9couvertes \u00e9pigraphiques faites dans le cours de ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, dans la r\u00e9gion des sources de l'Orkhon et dans la Mongolie ; elles ont fourni la mati\u00e8re de dissertations tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressantes et elles ont jet\u00e9 de vives lumi\u00e8res sur le dialecte des Turcs Toukion\u00e9, dont les origines et l'histoire n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retrac\u00e9es que d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s confuse par les \u00e9crivains chinois.\n\nLes \u00e9tudes indiennes brillent d'un nouvel \u00e9clat : la langue classique, les diff\u00e9rentes dialectes, l'organisation sociale des peuples divers fix\u00e9s sur le sol de l'Inde, l'arch\u00e9ologie, l'\u00e9pigraphie et l'\u00e9tude des doctrines religieuses ont provoqu\u00e9 des travaux dont on ne saurait trop louer le m\u00e9rite. Enfin, la langue et l'histoire des pays malais ont \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet de recherches approfondies.\n\nJ'ai cru devoir mentionner d'abord les langues sur l'\u00e9tude desquelles se sont concentr\u00e9s les efforts de nos pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs ; mais, vous pourrez reconna\u00eetre, Messieurs, par le nombre et la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des communications qui vous seront faites, combien sont consid\u00e9rables les progr\u00e8s r\u00e9alis\u00e9s dans l'\u00c9gyptologie depuis Champollion, de Roug\u00e9 et Mariette. L'importance des faits r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par l'assyriologie au point de vue de la chronologie, de l'histoire et des conditions sociales de l'Assyrie et de la Chald\u00e9e, fixeront l'attention du Congr\u00e8s, ainsi que les monuments de l'Asie Mineure \u00e9tudi\u00e9s depuis peu.\n\nLes travaux relatifs aux contr\u00e9es de l'Extr\u00eame-Orient n'ont point \u00e9t\u00e9 moins importants ni leurs r\u00e9sultats moins fructueux. Un jeune \u00e9rudit a entrepris la traduction d'un historien qui jouit en Chine de la plus grande r\u00e9putation. Nous faisons les v\u0153ux les plus ardents pour qu'il puisse reprendre bient\u00f4t un travail qu'il a interrompu \u00e0 regret.\nDes inscriptions chinoises ont \u00e9clairci certains points curieux d'arch\u00e9ologie, et un recueil \u00e9pigraphique, publi\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la munificence \u00e9clair\u00e9e d'un des membres d'honneur du Congr\u00e8s, offre un nouveau champ d'investigations \u00e0 la perspicacit\u00e9 des sinologues.\n\nLa litt\u00e9rature de la Cor\u00e9e vient aussi de nous \u00eatre r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la publication d'un ouvrage consid\u00e9rable, fruit de longues et patientes recherches. Il me faut enfin, en terminant ce tr\u00e8s rapide expos\u00e9, signaler les excellents travaux dus aux recherches des agents europ\u00e9ens en Indo-Chine.\n\nIl me reste \u00e0 rendre hommage \u00e0 l'esprit qui a caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 les dix premiers Congr\u00e8s des Orientalistes. On s'est fait une loi, toujours observ\u00e9e, de professer la tol\u00e9rance la plus large et le respect le plus absolu pour les opinions et les id\u00e9es de chacun des membres. Les croyances sont diverses, mais toutes ont droit \u00e0 nos justes \u00e9gards. Nous ne nous \u00e9carterons pas des sages principes de concorde et de paix, et tous nos efforts tendront \u00e0 ce que la courte hospitalit\u00e9 que nous vous offrons, vous soit douce et laisse un souvenir durable dans vos esprits.\n\nC'est en formant ce v\u0153u que je d\u00e9clare ouverte la onzi\u00e8me session du Congr\u00e8s international des Orientalistes.\n\nCH. SCHEFER,\n\nMembre de l'Institut, Pr\u00e9sident.\n\nThe President exhibited a silver coin forwarded by the Revenue Secretary to the Government of Burma and read the following note on it.\n\nThis coin is one of several which were found a few months ago in the Shwebo District. Two others, of two different sizes, have been presented by the Burmese Government to the Indian Museum. They belong to the class of so-called symbolical coins. These coins have been described, and figured by Captain Latter in the Journal Asiatic Society, Bengal, Vol XV, page 238, and more largely by Sir Arthur Phayre in the International Numismata Orientalia. The peculiar interest of these coins is that no symbolic coin of quite the same type has previously been discovered or (at least) noticed. They represent a new type, and accordingly are of considerable Numismatic value.\n\nThe Philological Secretary read the following communications concerning the date of an Inscription of Narasimha D\u0113va II., published by Babu N. N. Vasu in Journal, Vol. LXV, 1896, Part I, page 229 ff.):\n\nProfessor F. Kielhorn, Ph.D., LL.D., C.I.E., G\u00f6ttingen writes:\u2014\n\nThe K\u0101ndup\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101 plates of the Ganga King Narasimha II., for an edition of which we are indebted to Mr. N\u0101gendra-N\u0101tha Vasu, are\ndated in the \u00c7aka year 1217, on Monday, the 6th tithi of the bright half of the month of Simha. According to the editor of the inscription (ibid. p. 230), this date corresponds to Monday, the 19th September A.D. 1295. May I venture to state that this is incorrect? In A.D. 1295 the month of Simha lasted from the 30th July to the 29th August, and the tithi which ended on the 19th September, 1295, was the 10th, not the 6th, of the bright half.\n\nIn reality, the original date would be wrong for \u00c7aka 1217, both current and expired, and there can be no doubt that the year 1217 has been wrongly quoted in the plates instead of 1218 expired, and that the intended date is Monday, the 6th August A.D. 1296. We find the same mistake in the Puri plates of Narasimha IV. (Journal, Vol. LXIV, Part I, p. 151), where the \u00c7aka year 1316 has been wrongly quoted instead of 1317, and I have given numerous similar dates in my paper on the \u00c7aka era in the Indian Antiquary.\n\nBabu M. M. Chakravartti writes:\n\nThe date of this inscription does not appear to me correctly calculated. It is put down as 19th September, 1295 A.D. (p. 230), but on what grounds is not clear. On the other hand Jacobi's tables give a different date. The date of our inscription is Simha \u00e7ukla 6, Monday. In 1295 A.D. this tithi fell on 17th August, which was Wednesday and not Monday, consequently 1295 A.D. could not have been the date. But in 1296 A.D. Simha \u00e7ukla 6 fell exactly on Monday, the 6th August. Hence if 1217 be taken as an expired \u00c7aka year, the correct date is\n\n6th August, 1296 A.D.\n\nAgain the ayka has been translated as year, but in the note to my article on the Uriy\u0101 inscriptions of 14th and 15th centuries, I have pointed out what an ayka really means in Orissa. It is a curious kind of regnal year in which certain figures such as 1, 6, 16, 20, &c., are omitted.\n\nThe prose portion of the grant contains several words which are distinctly Uriy\u0101, and these words differ little from the modern Uriy\u0101 words, e.g., nabar (palace), nala (reed which was the standard of measurement), b\u0101tik\u0101 (mod. b\u0101ti=20 acres nearly), m\u0101na (=an acre nearly), guntha (\u00bcth of a m\u0101na), h\u016bda (ridge of fields), g\u014dhari (mod. gohori or low waste land used as path), da\u1e47\u1e0da (high waste land used as path), k\u014dmati (mod. kumti, a Telugu caste), and so forth. So far as these words go, the Uriy\u0101 language must have been fully developed by that time. Several of the Uriy\u0101 words have proved stumbling blocks to N\u0101gendra Babu in his translation.\n\nIt is curious to find so many of the names Telugu, for instance K\u014dmati, Amnai, Uadai, Talang-gr\u0101m, N\u0101di, &c. This fact clearly indi-\ncates that Telingana and Orissa were under the same rule, and that many of the officers happened to be Telugu. Presumably Orissa was considered as an appendage to Kalinga.\n\nOf the C\u0101\u1e6devara inscription noticed in p. 234, I secured a transcript and have made a decipherment. But as Nagendra Babu promises to edit it in this Journal, and as I have no leisure, I leave the task to him. He ascribes the inscription to the reign of Ananga Bhima II., and probably rightly, but he will have to get over the difficulty presented by Stanza 8, lines 6-7, in which Ananga Bhima is described as the son of C\u014d\u1e0daganga. \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0923 usually means son. But Ananga Bhima II. is not the son but great-grandson of C\u014d\u1e0daganga. Possibly \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0923 may be taken to mean a descendant. Another difficulty will be found in the dates. According to the inscriptions Ananga Bhima II., ruled from 1219 to 1242 or 43 A.D. But the raid to Lakhnauti and the first battle with Tughril-i-Tugh\u0101n Kh\u0101n took place in 642 H. or 1244 A.D., consequently neither Ananga Bhima II. nor any of his ministers could have made the invasion recorded by the Minh\u0101j-i-sir\u0101j, unless either of these dates be found wrong.\n\nThe present inscription does not clear the discrepancy I pointed out in my article regarding the years of reigns. Taking K\u0101m\u0101r\u1e47ava to begin his reign in 1064 \u010caka or 1142 A.D. (stanza 37), the total of the years of reign (152) makes the accession of Narasimha D\u0113va II. at (1142 + 152 or) 1294 A.D. But this is absurd, as 1296 was his 21st \u0100nka or 17th year of reign. I trust Nagendra Babu will be able in his next article to find out a solution of this apparent absurdity. The early Mussulman historians rarely mention the names of Hindu kings, and until the dates are established, no reliable connection can be laid down between Hindu chronicles and Mussulman histories.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. *The Nongong Copper-plate grant of Bala Varman of Pr\u0101gy\u014dti\u1e63a in \u0100s\u0101m.* With 3 Plates.\u2014By Dr. A.

The papers will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n4. *The Jering fruit* (Pithecolobium lobatum Benth.)\u2014By H. N. Ridley, Esq., Director of the Botanic Gardens, Singapore. Communicated by Surg.-Maj. D. Prain.\n\nIn the last number of the *Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula* (Journal, Part II; Vol. lxvi, p. 267) several questions are proposed\nby Dr. Prain concerning this fruit, and what part of it is eaten by the Natives. I have some doubts as to the tree being wild here; it is very common in and round villages, and the squirrels often carry the seed in their mouths to some distance and dropping it only partly nibbled disperse the plant everywhere, but I have never seen it far in the jungles. There is no pulp or arillus on the seed, nor is the pod eaten at all. The ripe seeds are boiled with wood ashes two or three times on successive days, before being eaten. Many Malays are very fond of it, although it exhales a foetid odour, which is communicated to the eater, and especially to his urine. The smell is so nauseous that in camp we always forbade the Malays to bring this fruit or the pods of *Parkia speciosa* Hassk., which produce the same effect, into camp. If not properly prepared the Jering produces diarrhoea and sickness, and if too much is eaten stricture, for which *Alchornea villosa*, M\u00fcll. is considered an antidote. It is always diuretic, and often causes the urine to have a milky colour. Many Malays are unable to eat it at all as it always makes them ill, and indeed it seems always to require some practice, as persons unaccustomed to it suffer. The Malays say that it tastes like chestnuts, and it is curious that they should be so fond of such a detestable food, if it is no more attractive than this. The more aristocratic Malays will not eat it, and I am told it is forbidden to Hadjis.\n\nThe pods of *Parkia speciosa* are more popular, and a more expensive dish. They are cut up and cooked with curry stuffs. Though they cause the eater to exhale a very similar nauseous odour, they are said not to be so diuretic, nor to produce sickness like the Jering, though in excess they cause diarrhoea. They are called \"Petai.\" The tree is certainly wild here, and not very often cultivated, but wild trees are often enclosed or claimed by some Malay who makes an orchard round them.\n\nDr. Prain, who is unable to be present at this meeting communicates the following remarks on Mr. Ridley's extremely interesting note:\n\nThe questions proposed by me were:\u2014\"Is it the succulent pod\" (as Jack's account seems to imply), \"a fleshy pulp\" (as has usually been stated), \"or the seed itself of Jiring\" (as said by Koorders and Valeton) \"that is eaten? And has Jiring any pulp at all? If so, is this pulp an arillus?\"\n\nMr. Ridley's reply is clear. The seeds are eaten cooked, as Koorders and Valeton say, and \"there is no pulp or arillus.\" The character of the seed of *Pithecolobium lobatum*, given by Bentham and copied by\nMiguel, must be altered. I have already pointed out that, in Herbarium specimens, there is at no stage of the fruit any pulp visible, and Mr. Ridley now shows that Hasskarl's explanation of this absence of pulp from ripe pods is not only insufficient but inexact. The pulp does not disappear, it never was there.\n\nWe are thus left to face the question:\u2014What is *Mimosa Koeringa*, the tree that Roxburgh describes as having the seed enveloped in an edible fleshy aril? Those best acquainted with Roxburgh's work are precisely those who are least likely to doubt that such a tree was known to Roxburgh, for if the description of the tree itself be brief, the statement regarding the seed is sufficiently precise. If that description be accurate, then certainly the tree which Roxburgh knew as *Koeringa* cannot well be the *Jiring*, which moreover Roxburgh appears to have known since, though he did not describe it, he named it *Mimosa Djiringa*. We must therefore appeal once more for help to Mr. Ridley and our other botanical colleagues in Malaya.\n\n---\n\n**LIBRARY.**\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in August last.\n\n**TRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,** presented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\n**Batavia.** Bataviasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen,\u2014Notulen, Deel XXXV, Aflevering 1 und 2.\n\n**Berlin.** K\u00f6nigl.

F. R. Hoernle, C.I.E., President, in the chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\u2014\nDr. A. Alcock, H. K. W. Arnold, Esq., Dr. T. Bloch, F. Finn, Esq.,\nThe Rev. H. B. Hyde, C. Little, Esq., L. de Nic\u00e9ville, Esq., R. D. Oldham, Esq., A. T. Pringle, Esq., F. J. Rowe, Esq., Pandit Haraprasad \u010c\u0101stri, Pandit Mahendra N\u0101th Vidy\u0101nidhi.\n\nVisitor:\u2014Professor S. L\u00e9vi of Paris.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nSeventy-one presentations, were announced, details of which are given in the Library List appended.\n\nThe following gentlemen duly proposed and seconded at the last meeting of the Society were ballotted for and elected Ordinary Members:\u2014\n\nCaptain Stuart H. Godfrey.\nMesrovb S. Seth, Esq.\nW. A. Talbot, Esq.\n\nThe following gentlemen are candidates for election at the next meeting:\u2014\n\nCaptain P. R. T. Gurdon, Deputy Commissioner, Gauhati, proposed by E. A. Gait, Esq., seconded by Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle.\nW. K. Dods, Esq., Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, proposed by F. Finn, Esq., seconded by Dr. A. Alcock.\nThe Secretary reported the death of the following members:\u2014\n\nS. E. Peal, Esq.\nCaptain E. Y. Watson, F.Z.S.\n\nThe President laid on the table a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Donnelly, giving probable dates of sailing of the \"Orotava\" in connection with the observation of the forthcoming total Solar Eclipse.\n\nThe President announced that Mr. F. Finn had resumed charge of his duties as Natural History Secretary from Mr. L. de Nic\u00e9ville.\n\nPandit Haraprasad \u010c\u0101stri exhibited some ancient Burmese Inscribed Pottery.\n\nThe Reverend Dr. K. S. Macdonald obtained these three bricks or rather inscribed pottery in Upper Burma. The large broken one was obtained at Tagoung on the river Irrawaddy half way between Mandalay and Bhamo where any number of the same kind may any day be found. The large unbroken brick was picked up by his son along with others at Pagan, the old Capital of Burma. He had a number of these at his house in Myingyan. The third smaller one was picked up by the Doctor himself from among these. There is no inscription on the smaller one. There are five figures of Buddha sitting in what is known as the bh\u016bmispar\u015ba-mudr\u0101 the earth touching pose or witness attitude calling the earth to bear witness to his devotion. The putting together of five sacred objects of the same kind is known among the Jains as Pancatirtha. This is perhaps the first time that we find a Pancatirtha among the Buddhists. The others contain inscriptions which consist only of the well-known formula of Buddhist faith, 'ye dhamma, &c.,' written in the character which was common in Eastern India during the reign of the P\u0101la kings. The peculiarity of the figure in the large unbroken brick is that Buddha is sitting with his legs hanging from his Simhasana and resting on a foot-stool. Both the Simhasana and the foot stool have the decoration of lotus leaves. This is rather an unusual position for Buddha. But we have in the Indian Museum in the Magadha Section of the Archaeological gallery no less than three statues of Buddha seated in the European fashion. Dr. Waddell in page 336 of his work entitled, 'Buddhism in Tibet,' says that this is the pose of Maitreya the coming Buddha. The position of the hands indicates as if he was explaining something to his hearers with emphasis. The palm of his left hand is turned towards himself, while that of his right hand is turned towards his hearers with two fingers of the one resting on the two fingers of the other. I at first thought this to be one of the mudr\u0101s. But the explaining attitude accounts for the position of the hands better.\nBut the nature of the characters indicates that these bricks are not of Burmese manufacture. The cut of the faces of Buddha is Indian and not Burmese. It appears that these were taken away by Burmese pilgrims from Magadha and treasured up as holy souvenirs of their distant pilgrimage. I beg to draw the attention of the Society to these not so much for their intrinsic worth as for the prospect they hold out of finding things interesting to Indian antiquarians in such distant places as Pagan and Tagoung.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1.
