Lydekker, Member of the Council and Natural History Secretary in the place of Mr. Wood-Mason.\nThe Chair was then taken by the President, the Hon. Sir E. C. Bayley, K. C. S. I., C. I. E.\n\nMr. W. T. Blanford exhibited the Geological map of Sind recently completed, and gave the following account of the Geology of the Province, which had been mapped in the course of the last three years by Mr. Fedden and himself.\n\nThe greater portion of Sind, including all the richer and more populous parts of the province, consists of the alluvial flat of the Indus, and is a portion of the great Indo-Gangetic plain of northern India. But to the west of the river, at a variable distance, barren rocky hills arise, in upper Sind consisting chiefly of a great north and south range, known as the Khirthar, which separates Sind from the Kelat territory, (or Baluchistan,) and in lower Sind, south of Sehw\u00e1n, of several minor ranges, having a general north and south direction. All these ranges, if of any height, consist chiefly of nummulitic limestone, and the ridges in Lower Sind are for the most part anticlinal rolls, higher beds occupying the intervening valleys. The Geology of the province is singularly simple, faults being rare, whilst the disturbance of the rocks is just sufficient to afford good sections, without rendering the relations of the beds so complicated as to be difficult to trace.\n\nUntil recently the Geology was chiefly known from the researches of Captain Vicary published no less than thirty years ago,* and these researches were limited to a very small portion of the province. The fossils collected by Captain Vicary and others were described and elaborately figured by MM. d'Archiac and Haime\u2020 in 1853, the whole of the marine fauna being supposed to be eocene. It was however subsequently shewn by Professor Martin Duncan\u2021 and by Mr. Jenkins\u00a7 that there was a mixture of later tertiary forms amongst the supposed eocene fossils, and it was noticed by Captain Vicary that above the marine beds were conglomerates and sandstones containing fossil bones.\n\nSuch was, in brief, the information available when the Survey was commenced, and the result of a more thorough investigation has naturally added much without depriving the earlier information of its value. Indeed the beautiful figures of d'Archiac and Haime's work have been of the greatest service in the field, by enabling us at once to identify many of the fossils found. The results of the first year's work have been briefly described on the Records of the Geological Survey,|| but much additional\n\n* Quart. Journ. Geol.

The beds of Sind are now classified thus in descending order.\n\n| Name       | Subdivisions | Approximate thickness | Supposed geological age | Remarks                                      |\n|------------|--------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 1.

On the eastern flank of the range, the Nari, G\u00e1j, and Manchhar beds are seen successively dipping towards the Indus plain, whilst west of the range, in Kelat, lower beds come in, but these have hitherto only been examined very hurriedly in one spot, on the G\u00e1j river, which traverses the main range by an impassable gorge. Some 10,000 feet of these lower beds are exposed, no base being seen, but nummulitic and other fossils were only found in the higher beds, the lower 5000 or 6000 feet being unfossiliferous.\nThe only other place in Sind where beds inferior to the nummulitic limestone were found to be exposed is in the nameless range of hills running south from Sehw\u00e1n. This range is sometimes spoken of as the Laki range, from the village of Laki, near the northern extremity. It appears to be part of the H\u00e1la range of Vicary and others, but the H\u00e1la range of the old maps included the Khirthar and several other ranges, and no distinct chain of hills is known by any such name in the country. There is however an unimportant pass in the Laki range known as H\u00e1la Lak (Lak = pass). Each separate peak of this range has its own name, no general term being applied to the whole. In this Laki range, however, beneath the nummulitic limestone, the lower eocene and cretaceous beds just noticed are well exposed.\n\nIn the south-western portion of the province the well-marked breaks between the different subdivisions of the tertiary series can no longer be traced. The massive nummulitic limestone, so conspicuous to the northward, becomes broken up into thinner beds intercalated with clays and sands, and finally disappears, and the higher tertiary groups all tend to pass into each other.\n\nThe lowest bed seen in the province, the Hippuritic Limestone, has only been found in one spot, and there the outcrop does not occupy much more than about half a mile in length. The only recognizable fossil found was a Hippurite. It is probable that this limestone is identical with the cretaceous limestone, which occupies a large area in Persia, and which has been traced at intervals from south-east of Karm\u00e1n to the neighbourhood of Tehr\u00e1n. If so, this is the first time that the formation has been recognized in India, except in the Himalayas. The bed consists of pale-coloured hard limestone, very gritty and sandy above, purer beneath.\n\nAbove the limestone there is a considerable thickness of dark-coloured sandstones, often of a purplish tint and frequently rather calcareous. These beds are not very fossiliferous, but towards the top they contain oysters and a few bones, apparently reptilian.\n\nThe next beds in ascending order consist of olive clays, shales and sandstone, frequently abounding in fossils, the most important being a peculiarly globose Cardita, C. Beaumonti, two or three species of Nautili and corals. The Cardita is allied to cretaceous species, and so is one, at least, of the Nautili.\n\nThe thin band of basaltic trap resting upon the Cardita Beaumonti clays, although less than 100 feet thick, is almost certainly identical with the great Deccan and Malwa trap formation, which covers so enormous an area in Western India, and which extends from Western Chutia N\u00e1gpur as far as Kachh. The belt in Sind has been traced for about 22 miles, always occupying the same position above the olive clays and beneath the\nlowest tertiary beds. This trap is therefore clearly contemporaneous and not intrusive, and its geological position at the base of the very lowest eocene rocks, and immediately above cretaceous strata, corresponds exactly with the place in the series already assigned to the formation where far more fully developed in M\u00e1lwa and Guzerat.\n\nThe R\u00e1nikot group consists of variegated sandstones and shales, with some bands of highly fossiliferous brown limestone in the upper strata. In the lower portion of the group only imperfect plant remains are found, a few dicotyledonous leaves being the only recognizable impressions, but the limestone abounds in *Mollusca*, *Echinodermata*, and *Foraminifera*. Nummulites are much less common than in the next group, the only abundant species being *N. Leymeriei*, but this, like several other R\u00e1nikot fossils, is found in the Khirthar beds also. A few forms with cretaceous affinities, *e.g.* a *Salenia* and some peculiar *Nautili* occur in the brown limestones, but the great majority of the species are eocene.\n\nThe beds hitherto noticed are confined to lower Sind, all except the R\u00e1nikot group being restricted to the Laki range, whilst the latter covers a considerable tract of country near Kotri and Tatta. The R\u00e1nikot beds in this part of the country are succeeded immediately in ascending order by the Khirthar Nummulitic limestone, which is locally unconformable, but generally appears to pass down into the underlying group. To the west of the Khirthar range however, on the Upper G\u00e1j, as already mentioned, a succession of argillaceous limestones, shales and sandstones, resting upon unfossiliferous dark shales with limestone bands, is found, and the latter beds appear to be identical with the supposed nummulitic group, which occupies so large an area in Makr\u00e1n, and which I once traversed throughout the greater part of the country between Gw\u00e1dar and J\u00e1lk. This same lower Khirthar group, with its characteristic unfossiliferous shales and bands of limestone, is also found on the Habb river, west of lower Sind.\n\nThe nummulitic limestone of the Khirthar group is about 1200 feet thick at the G\u00e1j, but apparently thicker to the northward, whilst in lower Sind it gradually thins out, becomes mixed with shales and clays, and towards the Habb river entirely disappears. Where best developed the Khirthar group is by far the most conspicuous formation in the province, and consists of very massive whitish and grey limestone, abounding in nummulites of several kinds and other foraminifera, corals and mollusca also occurring. The commonest species are *Nummulites granulosa*, *N. Biaritzensis*, *N. Leymeriei*, *N. spira*, *N. Ramondi*, *N. obtusa*, *Alveolina ovoidea*, *Orbitoides dispansus*, and *Nerita Schmedeliana*. The nummulitic limestone not only forms the crest of the Khirthar, but it is the most conspicuous rock in many of the minor ranges, and fragments derived from it are found in most of the recent and sub-recent gravels.\nAbove the white or grey nummulitic limestone, there are generally found some bands of brown limestone, also containing *Nummulites* and *Orbitoides*, but of different species, none of the forms so common in the Khirthar beds being found, but being replaced by an abundance of *Nummulites Garansensis*, *N. subl\u00e6vigata* and *Orbitoides papyracea*. The latter is very characteristic, being very thin and often of large size, a diameter of two to three inches being not uncommon. *Nummulites subl\u00e6vigata* is unknown in Europe. *N. Garansensis* there, as in Sind, belongs to the highest beds containing nummulites, and extends into the formations of the lower miocene period. With the brown limestones dark shales are associated, and these gradually pass up into a great thickness of unfossiliferous sandstones, forming the upper Nari group.\n\nIn the Khirthar range there is a sharp change from the Nari sandstones to the limestones of the G\u00e1j group, but further south the passage is more gradual, bands of limestone with marine fossils being found here and there in the upper Nari beds. The G\u00e1j group is highly fossiliferous, but no nummulites have been detected in it: an *Orbitoides*, apparently *O. papyracea*, is however found. Corals, echinoderms and mollusca abound in places and are exquisitely preserved; the most typical fossils are *Ostrea multicotata* and *Breynia carinata*, but *Clypeaster*, *Echinodiscus*, *Echinolampas Jacquemontii*, *Kuphus rectus*, *Venus granosa*, *Pecten Favrei*, *Turritella angulata* and *Balanus subl\u00e6vis* are all common.\n\nThe highest tertiary group, to which the name of Manchhar has been given, is of immense thickness, in places approaching 10,000 feet from top to bottom. The lower subdivision consists of grey sandstones, with brown, grey and red clays, and a few conglomeratic beds containing fragmentary mammalian bones; the upper portion is chiefly composed of clays with subordinate beds of sandstone (though there is much variation in the relative development of argillaceous and sandy beds) and some conglomerates containing pebbles of nummulitic limestone, which have not been observed in the lower portion of the group. Capping the whole is a considerable thickness of coarse conglomerate. Bones are of very rare occurrence in the upper portion of the group. As a whole this important formation probably represents the Sevaliks of northern India, and some of the mammalia, identified by Mr. Lydekker, appear identical, but the genera represented are as a rule older, forms like *Dinotherium* and *Merycopotamus* prevailing and the only common living genus being *Rhinoceros*. This appearance of greater age is doubtless due to the lower horizon at which the fossils occur in Sind, where the ossiferous beds are near the base of the whole group, close to the miocene G\u00e1j beds, into which there is a complete passage from the lower Manchhars, the passage beds containing estuarine mollusca, whilst in the typical Sivalik area the fossiliferous beds are near the top of the series.\nThe whole of the beds hitherto described have been disturbed and upheaved, shewing that great changes in the surface of the country, and in all probability in the distribution of land and water, have taken place since the close of the Tertiary period in Sind, as in the Himalayas.\n\nMr. Lydekker remarked that the investigation of the Sind Sivalik rocks was gradually bringing to light the remains of a very interesting mammalian fauna which once inhabited that area. The most interesting among these mammals, were a number of Pig-like animals,\u2014some with complex and others with simple teeth,\u2014which mostly belonged to a group which had now completely disappeared from the earth. Some of these animals belonged to genera which had been previously known from the eocene and miocene of Europe and America, while others belonged to new genera, which would subsequently be described by the speaker in the \"Palaeontologia Indica.\"\n\nDr. Rajendralala Mitra submitted the following remarks on the early life of Asoka. He said\u2014Of all the ancient Indian monarchs whose monuments have come down to us, the Emperor Asoka was the greatest. His sway extended from Kapurdegiri in the Eusafzai country to Dhauli in Cuttack, and from north Tirhut to the Peninsula of Guzerat. His anxiety for the good of his subjects was great, and his edicts show the intelligent interest he took in their welfare. He was, however, the least known by the people in the present day. As a renegade from the religion of his ancestors he was detested by the Hindus, and nowhere noticed in their ancient records; and the Buddhists, whose ranks he joined, having been expelled the country, could not keep his name alive in India. To the Hon'ble Mr. Turnour of Ceylon belongs the credit of first bringing his name to the notice of European Orientalists; and the identification by our James Prinsep of the name with the Piyadasi of the Lat inscriptions, laid the groundwork of the historical chronology of ancient India. Next to the identification, made by the founder of this Society, of Chandragupta with the Sandrocottus of the Greeks, it was of the highest importance. The next important event in connexion with the history of Asoka was the discovery of the Sanskrit Buddhist Literature of Nepal. For it too are European scholars indebted to one of our most distinguished associates\u2014distinguished alike for his literary and scientific researches\u2014who first unlocked the storehouse of Nepalese Buddhism. Mr. B. H. Hodgson, to whom the speaker referred, collected three sets of MSS. of this literature, one of which he presented to this Society, another to the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain, and the third to the Asiatic Society of Paris. The first of these remains yet untouched; the second has the benefit of only a nominal catalogue; but the third fell into the hands of that profound scholar,\nEug\u00e8ne Burnouf, who drew from it the materials of his invaluable *Histoire du Buddhisme Indien*. In that work the learned savant notices three MSS. bearing on the life of Asoka. One of them is named *Avad\u0101na Sataka*, but of it he gives no analysis. According to its name it should contain a hundred legends, but the MS. of it in the Society's Library comprises only ninety tales; and these do not refer to the history of Asoka. The second work is the *Divya Avad\u0101na*. It is a prose work, devoted entirely to the life of Asoka, and Burnouf has supplied a complete translation of it; but the Library of the Society does not possess a MS. of it. The last is the *Asoka Avad\u0101na*, and of it the following is a brief abstract. It extends to 276 folia, and comprises about ten thousand anushtup verses. Its author's name is not given; but it professes to have been related by one Jaya\u015bri to his disciples at the Kukkuta Vih\u0101ra, in a garden named Upakanthik\u0101r\u0101ma, on the right bank of the Ganges near P\u0101taliputra. The authority quoted is that of a saint named Upa Gupta, the spiritual guide of the king. The first hundred and five folia of the work are devoted to the life of Asoka, and the rest is made up of tales and anecdotes said to have been related by the saint for the edification of his royal pupil, and to illustrate the morality of the Buddha religion.\n\nThe work opens with the genealogy of Asoka from Bimbis\u0101ra, king of R\u0101jag\u1e5bha, who was a contemporary of Sakya.

In the absence of necessary MSS. it is impossible to ascertain how far these differences are due to copyist's errors. Apparently they are. The lists given in the P\u0101li annals and in the Vish\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a are more seriously discrepant. They stand thus:\n\n**Vish\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a**, Vol. IV, pp. 180-186.\n\n1. \u015ai\u1e63un\u0101ga.\n2. K\u0101kavarna.\n3. Kshemadharmar.\n4. Kshattraiyas.\n5.

Vindus\u0101ra.\n\nThe other Pur\u0101\u1e47as give many different versions of the names above noted, (see Mr. Hall's Notes in loco cit.). The P\u0101li names are obviously not so authentic as the Buddhist ones from Nep\u00e1l. The latter were very early translated into the Chinese, and have therefore better claim to confidence. At the same time it should be observed that the omission of the name of Chandragupta from the latter is significant. Coupled with the fact mentioned by the Nepalese writer that Vindus\u0101ra came to P\u0101\u1e6daliputra from R\u0101jagriha, it suggests the idea that Chundragupta was the sole king of his race, and that the Mauriya line commenced and ended with him. The P\u0101li annals make Vindus\u0101ra the son of Chandragupta. If so, he could not have come from R\u0101jagriha to take possession of his ancestral capital of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra. This is, however, not the place to enter into a discussion on the subject.\n\nAccording to the work under notice, Vindus\u0101ra of R\u0101jagriha became the king of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, and his eldest son was Su\u015b\u012bma. When Vindus\u0101ra was reigning at P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a of Ch\u0101mp\u0101puri presented him a daughter named Subhadr\u0101\u1e45gi. The damsel was extraordinarily beautiful, and, a soothsayer having foretold that she would be the wife of a great king and mother of a universal monarch, the father made the present with a view to help the prophecy. The immediate fruit of this presentation did not, however, prove satisfactory to Subhadr\u0101\u1e45gi. Immured in the palace, she was, through the jealousy of the princesses of the zenana, doomed to menial service. Among other low occupations she was ordered to acquire the art of a barber, whereby, she was told, she would gain the goodwill of the king. When well proficient in the art, she was ordered by the princesses to go and shave the king. She did so, and acquitted herself so well that the king offered to grant her any boon she wished. She prayed for his society; but the king denounced her on account of her being of the low caste of a barber. She explained that she was only acting the part of a barber by order of the princesses of the palace, but that she was a Br\u0101hma\u1e47i by birth, and had been presented to the king expressly with a view to his marrying her. The king, thus reminded of her history, granted her wish, and made her the chief queen of the palace. A\u015boka was the first fruit of this union. He was so named because the mother emancipated herself from her sufferings by his birth, the word meaning \"griefless.\" The lady had a second son named V\u012bta\u015boka or Vigata\u015boka, which word has a similar\nmeaning. Asoka was uncomely in his person, and that was the cause of his not winning the affection of his father. His conduct too was repulsive. He was so very unruly and troublesome, that he got the nick-name of Chand\u0101 or 'the violent.' His father made him over for training to an astrologer, named Pingalavatsa, who foretold, after casting various kinds of lots, that the boy would succeed his father on the throne of P\u0101taliputra.\n\nWhen the prince had attained his majority, his character did not mend; he was found so troublesome, that it was deemed advisable to get rid of him by deputing him to quell a mutiny which had broken out at Taksha\u015bil\u0101, at a great distance from the seat of the empire. His efforts, seconded, according to the text, by a divine declaration resounding in the air and certain celestial arms dropped therefrom for his use, proved successful, and he was well received by the people of that place. In the meantime his elder brother Sus\u012bma created disturbances at P\u0101taliputra, and offended the chief minister, through whose intrigue he too was sent to Taksha\u015bil\u0101, and Asoka was recalled therefrom.\n\nSoon after, the king fell ill, appointed Asoka, through the instigation of the minister but much against his own will, regent during the absence of his eldest son Sus\u012bma, and died. Asoka was immediately after anointed and placed on the throne. Sus\u012bma, on his return, disappointed of his patrimony, rose against his younger brother, and attacked P\u0101taliputra; but Asoka, through his able minister R\u0101dha Gupta, overpowered him, and, to prevent future disturbances, ordered his ministers \"to lop off the heads of all the trees in the royal garden with their flowers and fruits,\" in the same sense in which Tarquin the Proud lopped off the heads of the \"tallest poppies\" in his garden, to instruct his son as to what he should do. The ministers demurred, and so he himself struck off their heads, and, retiring to a garden with the ladies of the palace, enjoyed for a time the pleasures of life to the utmost.\n\nNoticing one day that some of the ladies had broken the branches of an Asoka tree, (Jonesia Asoka) he was very much annoyed, and directed a wicked man named Chandagirika, \"the fierce mountaineer,\" to burn them to ashes on a large fire, and this was immediately done. The mountaineer, however, soon after met his deserts. S\u0101rthav\u0101ha, a rich merchant, had proceeded to sea in the company of a hundred other merchants, and there had a son born unto him, who was named Samudra. On his way home, after twelve years, falling into the hands of pirates, he was deprived of his effects, and murdered along with all his companions. His son Samudra alone escaped, and led the life of a Buddhist beggar. Once he came to the house of the mountaineer to beg alms, and was set upon, but could not by any means be murdered. Surprised at it, the mountaineer reported the circumstance to Asoka. The king came to see the strange beggar, heard everything from him, and then cut off the head of the mountaineer.\nThe miracle wrought by the beggar worked on the mind of the king; and he became attached to the religion of Buddha. By the advice of a Yati named Ya\u015bas, he caused a chaitya to be erected at the Kukkuta garden, and deposited in it some relics of Buddha. He then caused a chaitya and other religious edifices to be erected at Ramagr\u0101ma. Coming thence to the river Ganges, he was requested by the Nagas to go to their country, and there he caused religious edifices to be erected. At the request of the people of Taksha\u015bil\u0101, he caused 3,510,000,000 stupas to be erected for the deposit of relics. By his order the Yakshas erected, on the shores of the sea, ten million stupas for the same purpose. These religious acts endeared him to the people, who dropped the use of the old nick-name of Chanda, and called him Dharm\u0101soka or \"A\u015boka the virtuous.\"\n\nAfter this a son was born unto him named Kun\u0101la alias Dharmavardhana, who soon distinguished himself in all that was taught him, and was carefully brought up as a follower of the Buddhist religion.\n\nSubsequently, on one occasion A\u015boka went to a Yati, at the Kukku\u1e6da garden, to study the true religion, and, at the suggestion of that recluse, sent for, from the Urumunda Hill, a Yati named Upa Gupta, to whom he assigned the monastery of Venuvana, or the \"Bamboo Grove.\" This saint was the son of one Gupta, a rich man of Mathur\u0101, who had been converted by one \u015aonav\u0101si, a mendicant who resided on the Urumunda Hill, and had presented his three sons, As'va Gupta, Dhana Gupta and Upa Gupta, to his tutor. A prophecy of Buddha is quoted, according to which the birth of Upa Gupta was to take place a hundred years after his demise (mama nirvitim\u0101rabhya s'atavarshagate upaguptan\u00e1ma bhikshurutpatsyati. Fol. 23-24). This chronology, however, does not accord with the statement that A\u015boka was the thirteenth from Bimbis\u0101ra, a contemporary of Buddha. A contemporary of A\u015boka could scarcely be born within a hundred years of the reformer's death. Such a prophecy, however, was needed to exalt the rank of the great teacher who became the spiritual guide of so mighty a sovereign as A\u015boka. Having studied Buddhism under this tutor, A\u015boka, under his guidance, went on a pilgrimage to all the principal holy places, visiting the tree under which, in the Lumbini garden, Buddha was born, the places sanctified by the saint's youthful sports, and the tree under the shade of which he performed his long protracted penance. This last tree is named Jambu briksha, (*Eugenia jambulana*) and not, as is usually believed and elsewhere described, an Asvatha. At all these places A\u015boka caused a Ma\u1e6dha or monastery to be established for the adoration of the \"Three jewels.\"\n\nWhen the teacher retired to his own hermitage, A\u015boka caused a proclamation to be issued, declaring Buddhism to be the religion of his country; and devoted all his wealth to the propagation and glory of his new religion,\nand particularly in the embellishment of the Bodhi Tree, or the Tree of Knowledge, at Buddha Gay\u00e1; but the name of the place is not given in the text. His chief queen Pavishyarakshit\u00e1 was, however, annoyed at his forsaking the old family religion, and, finding that she was neglected, employed a secret agent, a Chand\u00e1li named M\u00e1ta\u1e45g\u00ed, to destroy the sacred tree. The woman employed her sorcery and medicines to bear on the task, and the tree soon withered up. News of this sad occurrence was brought to A\u015boka, and he was deeply grieved. The queen tried her utmost to cheer him, but he was inconsolable. At last she employed her secret agent to revive the tree by her magic arts, and this was soon effected. Thereafter the king devoted five years to the society of the Buddhist congregation. He deputed Supin\u1e0dola Bharadv\u0101ja, a Yati from the M\u00e1nd\u00e1r Hill, to preach the true religion everywhere over his empire, and celebrated, with great pomp, the quinquennial humiliation and conference, giving a great profusion of wealth, raiment and food to the clergy.\n\nAbout this time he also celebrated the marriage of his son Kun\u00e1la with a maiden named K\u00e1nchanam\u00e1l\u00e1, and soon after deputed the son to quell an insurrection in Taksha\u015bil\u00e1, a distant province, which seems to have been ill at ease under the house of Bimbis\u00e1ra. Kunjarakarna, the chief of the rebels, succumbed to the powerful army which followed the prince, and peace was soon restored. The insurrection, however, would appear to be a feint, and the real reason, as in the case of Sus\u00edma and A\u015boka himself, was the removal of a troublesome prince from near the throne. It is stated, apparently by way of euphemism, that soon after the deputation, the king saw, in a dream, the prince\u2019s face all pale, haggard, and dried up, and, being informed by astrologers that that portended one of three things, viz. loss of life, retirement from the world as a hermit, or loss of sight, was greatly grieved, and neglected all his regal duties. One of his queens named Ti\u015byarakshit\u00e1, who was a step-mother of the prince, heard of this, and thinking it a good opportunity for her, undertook the superintendence of all business of the court, issuing orders and herself signing and sealing all despatches. She caused a letter to be written to Kunjarakarna and impressed it with the royal signet, directing Kunjarakarna to deprive the prince of his eyesight, as the least of the three evils. Kunjarakarna was at a loss how to carry out the order. The prince heard of the mandate, and had it duly carried out through the instrumentality of a Chand\u00e1la\u2014the task having been held as too cruel to be executed by any person of a higher caste. He then assumed the garb of a beggar, and secretly left Taksha\u015bil\u00e1 to roam about the country. In the course of his peregrinations he came to P\u00e1\u1e6daliputra, and one night took shelter in the royal elephant stables, where at midnight he amused himself by playing on a flute. The king, from his chamber, heard the music, and was charmed\nby it. Next morning he sent for the musician, and recognised in him, his only son. Explanations followed, and the king, in a fit of anger, took up his sword to behead the wicked queen; but the youth interceded in the name of Buddha, and pacified him. This act of mercy for an enemy brought on a miraculous restoration of his sight.\n\nSubsequently, seeing the earnest devotion of the king for the diffusion of Buddhism in his kingdom, certain T\u012brthikas urged on V\u012btasoka, the king's brother, to refuse to accept the new religion. The king had tried his utmost to induce his brother, but failed. The king's minister then set about the task, and by offering him the kingdom made him a convert, and installed him king. A\u015boka was greatly annoyed at this, and ordered the usurper to be immediately beheaded; but, through the intercession of the minister, a respite was granted for seven days, after which the prince flew to the shelter of Upa Gupta, and afterwards accepted from Gun\u0101kara, a disciple of that teacher, consecration as a houseless hermit. This renunciation of the world did not, however, enable him to escape with his life. It so happened that at this time a professor of the Nirgrantha school, who reviled the religion of Buddha, had got a picture painted, representing himself with the likeness of Buddha lying at his feet, and this he had circulated widely in the province of Pundravardhana, and A\u015boka, hearing of it, had proclaimed a price (some dinars) on his head. A cowherd (\u0100bhira) had heard of this, and one night taking V\u012btasoka, with his long beard, matted hair, and unkempt nails, to be the Nirgrantha, cut off his head, and presented it to the king with a view to obtain the promised reward. The sight of the head deeply grieved the king; and he sought from Upa Gupta, his spiritual guide, religious consolation for his many acts of cruelty. It is scarcely necessary to observe that this story contains the germ of a fratricidal war in which V\u012btasoka had been set up by the conservatists of the time to oppose the Buddhist reforms of A\u015boka, and which, after a few days, terminated in the overthrow of the malcontents.\n\nThe history of A\u015boka is concluded here, and the rest of the work is made up of moral tales related by Upa Gupta for the edification of the king. Nothing positive is anywhere said in it as to what was the religion of A\u015boka before he accepted Buddhism. The belief, however, had until lately been general that he was a Hindu, and it was supported by the P\u0101li annals of Ceylon, which describe him to have followed the doctrine of the Br\u0101hmans. An essay, however, has appeared in which Mr. Thomas demurs to this conclusion, and marshals, in dense array, a large mass of evidence to show that he was a Jain. As the work of a profound scholar, facile princeps in the department of Indian numismatology, and thoroughly conversant with the antiquity and history of India, the essay deserves the highest consideration; and the ability and tact with which the evidence has been set forth leave no\nroom to doubt that in this country Jainism was a prevailing religion in the time of \u00c1soka and for some time before it. But it must be added that there has not been a single fact adduced which could directly bear upon the early religion of the author of the rock and the L\u0101\u1e6d edicts. It is abundantly evident from the edicts that \u00c1soka did forsake one religion and accept another; but what it was he forsook, the edicts do not say. There is one passage in these edicts, however, which affords circumstantial evidence of great importance. Mr. Thomas has carefully analysed the whole of the edicts, and described at great length their scope and purpose, but the particular passage to which the speaker referred had been somehow all but entirely overlooked. The passage referred was the last paragraph of the first Tablet, and in adverting to it, Mr. Thomas simply quotes these words: \"This is the edict of the beloved of the gods R\u00e1j\u00e1 Piyadasi\u2014the putting to death of animals is to be entirely discontinued.\" Now the passage, as rendered by Prinsep, runs thus\u2014\"Formerly in the great refectory and temple of the heaven-beloved king Piyadasi daily were many hundred thousand animals sacrificed for the sake of meat food. So even at this day, while this religious edict is under promulgation, from the sacrifice of animals for the sake of food, some two are killed, or one is killed;\u2014but now the joyful chorus resounds again and again\u2014that from henceforward not a single animal shall be put to death.\"* In the revised version of Professor Wilson, this passage runs as follows: \"There is but one assembly, indeed, which is approved of by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 Piyadasi, the beloved of the gods, which is that of the great kitchen of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Piyadasi, the beloved of the gods; every day hundreds of thousands of animals have been slaughtered for virtuous purposes, but now, although this pious edict is proclaimed that animals may be killed for good purposes and such is the practice is not determined, these presents are proclaimed that hereafter they shall not be killed.\"\u2020\n\nDr. Mitra was not satisfied with the second version, as it made the king declare \"that the only assembly he approved of was 'his' own great kitchen.\" The worst of gourmands would have scarcely said so in a royal edict. It was, however, not necessary to discuss the question; it was enough for the purposes of the speaker that both versions admitted that hundreds of thousands of animals were at one time sacrificed for human food in the kitchen of \u00c1soka; and this fact, he held, was sufficient to show that that monarch at the time could not have been a Jain. The philosophical character of Jainism allied it very closely to Ved\u00e1ntism, and in that respect it could well pass for a Hindu form of faith. Its belief in the Tirthankaras, or incarnations of the Godhead for the redemption of sinners and the spread of the true religion, also brought it into close relationship.\n\n* Journal As. Soc. VII, p. 257. \u2020 Jour. Roy. As. Soc. XII, p. 164.\nwith the religion of the Br\u0101hmans. But it set itself in antagonism to Hinduism, the old faith of the country, by denouncing the Vedas as false, and the sacrifices enjoined in them as mischievous and sinful. A hypertrophy of the feeling of mercy for animated creatures, forms its cardinal point. It might be that originally this feeling was not carried to the absurd extent which resulted, to quote the vivid language of Mr. Thomas, in \"devices of Hospitals for the suffering members of the brute creation, and ultimately, in after times, progressing into the absurdity of the wearing of respirators and the perpetual waving of fans, to avoid the destruction of minute insect life. An infatuation, which eventually led to the surrendering of thrones and kingdoms, to avoid a chance step which should crush a worm, or anything that crept upon the face of the earth; and more detrimental still, a regal interference with the every-day life of the people at large, and the subjecting of human labour to an enforced three months' cessation in the year, in order that a moth should not approach a lighted lamp, and the revolving wheel should not crush a living atom in the mill.\"* But it is impossible to conceive a form of Jainism which tolerated the daily sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of animals for meat food or religious worship. From its very conception Jainism, like Buddhism, was a protest against the sacrifices of the Vedas. At a time when the Vedic ordinances enjoined hecatombs of cattle as the means of salvation, and the cruel practice of driving wooden spikes into the hearts of the victims as the orthodox mode of slaughter, such a protest was not only needed, but could not but most effectually appeal to the feeling of the public, and ally it on its behalf. This protest apart, there would be no raison d'\u00eatre for Jainism; and to suppose therefore that A\u015boka, as a Jain, could, for purposes of puja and food, daily sacrifice hundreds of thousands of animals, would be to assume a gross inconsistency. As a Hindu, following the canons of the Kalpa S\u016btras, he could do all that and more most appropriately; and the presumption therefore would be strong, that he was a Hindu following the Hindu faith when he indulged in those sacrifices, and became a Jain, or a Buddhist, when, in the 10th or 12th year of his reign, he prohibited those sacrifices. This would be a much more reasonable solution of the question, than the supposition that, notwithstanding his Jainism, he had, from the heedlessness of youth, or the love of \"cake and ale,\" indulged in transgressions of the rules of his ancestral faith.\n\nSuch a solution would, likewise, be in keeping with the accounts of the P\u0101li annals of Ceylon, which in a case of this kind, was more reliable than deductions founded upon monograms and mystic symbols of doubtful significance, and of such extensive currency that their\n\n* Journal Roy. As. Soc., IX, p. 189.\ntestimony could not be of any use in settling the question. The most important of these symbols was the svastika. It was unquestionably held in great veneration by the Jains; but, as shewn elsewhere (Proceedings for June 1877), it was held in equal esteem by the Hindus, and was well known to, and used by, the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Assyrians and other nations of antiquity. Mr. Thomas is of opinion that the P\u00e1li annalists of the 5th century, living years after the event, could not be expected to afford the best evidence on the subject. \"Under any circumstances,\" he observes, \"their testimony would not carry much weight in the argument about other lands and other times, and it is moreover, a crucial question as to how much they knew about Br\u00e1hmanism itself, and whether the use of the word Br\u00e1hmanism does not imply merely, in this sense, a non-Buddhist or any religion opposed to their own.\"* This assumption of the ignorance of the Sinhalese annalists as to the true nature of Br\u00e1hmanism is, however, gratuitous. There is nothing to justify it: on the contrary much in their writings to show that they were perfectly familiar with it. Their intercourse with the people of the Coromandel Coast gave them ample opportunities to know the nature of Br\u00e1hmanism; and Br\u00e1hmanism in the South did not, in the 5th century, differ much, if at all, from that of the North.\n\nAs a collateral evidence of much weight in the case, Dr. Mitra read from the \u00c1s\u00f3ka Avad\u00e1na, an extract in which are described the means which certain T\u00edrthikas are said to have adopted for checking the progress of Buddhism, and persuading V\u00edt\u00e1soka, the younger brother of \u00c1s\u00f3ka, not to adopt the religion of Buddha which his brother was promulgating, and to rise in rebellion against him. It runs thus\u2014\n\n\"Beholding this (the attention paid by \u00c1s\u00f3ka to the dissemination of the Buddhist creed), these arrogant T\u00edrthikas, oppressed by the fire of envy, collected together, and said to each other: 'Should this king \u00c1s\u00f3ka continue a worshipper of Buddha, all other persons, encouraged by him, would likewise become followers of Buddha. None among the people will be devout; none of the good Sr\u00e1vakas will listen to us with respect. We should therefore, for the promotion of honor and fame, always adopt such means as will make us fully trusted.' Excited by this speech, the arrogant T\u00edrthikas came to the resolution of adopting immediate action. Then these T\u00edrthis went from house to house of well-disposed people, and, blessing them, thus addressed them: 'Honorable sirs, listen to us if you wish for your own good. Should you wish for a blessed hereafter, devote yourself to the true religion. Ours is the true religion, and therefore attend to it with all respect. The religion of the Baudhas is not the true one, for it provides no salvation (moksha).' Hearing these words some were convinced, others vacillated, and some would not believe them at all. Thus those\n\n* Journal Roy. As. Soc. IX, p. 181.\nT\u012brthikas, wishing for honors daily seduced credulous people. Then those arrogant ones, longing for fame and respect, proceeded to visit V\u012btasoka, the brother of A\u015boka. Appearing before V\u012btasoka, the son of Vindus\u0101ra, they blessed him, and stood in front of him. V\u012btasoka, seeing them in front of him, saluted them, and enquired the object of their visit. 'Reverend sirs, what has brought you so anxious to this place? You are always welcome to relate whatever you wish.' Thus encouraged those arrogant T\u012brthikas, looking at each other, thus addressed the prince: 'May success always attend you, great king (Mah\u0101r\u0101ja); may you always prosper; may you be free from all fear. Since we have come to advise you for your good, it is meet that we should tell you all. Should you wish for a blessed hereafter, listen to our advice. Ours is the true religion, alike salutary here and hereafter. Those who know best declare it to be the best of all systems of religion. Therefore, O learned king, believe in it, listen to our religion, and follow it with ardour. Then every thing will prosper about you; and, overcoming all your enemies you will become a universal monarch, (Chakravarti). The religion of the Bauddhas is not true, for it offers no salvation (moksha). Therefore that religion should never be listened to. Since those shaven-pated, vile destroyers of their family preach a false religion, overthrowing all caste and all duty\u2014men, devoid of the religion of the Vedas, un-Br\u0101hmanical in their conduct, and vilely passionate\u2014they should, O king, on no account be respected by you. No Bauddha should be revered, nor seen, nor touched, nor worshipped, nor spoken to, nor dwelt with in the same house, nor visited by any one. You should on no account eat with them, nor present anything to a Buddhist sanctuary. Even when by mistake men listen to the doctrines of the Bauddhas with regard, they suffer from various calamities, and at last repair to hell. Hence, O king, should you wish for a blessed hereafter, never listen to the doctrines of the Bauddhas with respect. Should by delusion, one, looking at the merits of their religion, accept it, he, fallen here, will be translated to hell hereafter. For these reasons, O great king, accept not the doctrine of Buddha, but, abiding by our canons, follow the true religion with devotion. By so doing you will here and hereafter enjoy great blessings. No evil shall ever befall you, and you will proceed on by the true path. Listening to our words, weigh well, which is good and which is evil, and for your own advantage follow the path of duty.' V\u012btasoka heard this address of the T\u012brthikas, but remained unconvinced of their truth. The T\u012brthikas addressed him again and again, and at last brought him convinced, under their control.\"*\nNow, this extract is from one of the works, which, according to Mr. Thomas, are \"data, contributed from the very nidus of Buddhism in Magadha, whose passage into the ready refuge of the valley of Nepal, would prim\u00e2 facie have received an unadulterated version of the ancient formulae, and have supplied a crucial test for the comparison of the southern developments.\"\nas contrasted with the northern expansions and assimilations of the faith.\"*\n\nThe work itself professes to have been compiled by a disciple of the great teacher who converted \u00c1soka to the faith of Buddha, and in so far may claim to be all but contemporary authority. It is probably, however, of a much later origin; but one redaction of it was translated into the Chinese in the reign of the Western Tsin dynasty (circa 265-313),\u2020 and consequently the work must be admitted to be considerably older than the date of that version, and it leaves no room to doubt that at least one of the prevailing religions of the time of \u00c1soka was that of the Tirthikas or of the Br\u00e1hmanic followers of the Vedas. It was those Tirthis who felt most anxious about the perversion of \u00c1soka to the faith of Buddha, and not the Jains. They too put themselves most forward to check the evil; they everywhere denounced Buddhism as false; and kept numbers of the people attached to Hinduism. They again deterred the brother of \u00c1soka from becoming a Buddha, and set up the fratricidal war which terminated so disastrously against their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and his ancestral religion. And if V\u00edtasoka was a Hindu, it would be too much to say that his elder brother in his youth was a Jain, and that he had got it from his ancestors. The two uterine brothers could not but have been brought up in the same religion; and since V\u00edtasoka was a Hindu according to data admittedly \"contributed by the very nidus of Buddhism,\" the conclusion becomes all but inevitable that his brother likewise was one until he became a Baudha.\n\nThe President said that he had not been able to read the whole of Mr. Thomas's paper although that gentleman had kindly sent him a portion of the proof. He was therefore hardly competent to discuss the question raised by Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra.\n\nAt the same time more and more materials were daily accumulating and it was perhaps premature to form any very positive theory as to the exact nature of \u00c1soka's earlier faith. Even since Mr. Thomas's article was sent to press translations had appeared in the 'Indian Antiquary' by Dr. B\u00fchl\u00e9r of General Cunningham's singular dated inscriptions ascribed to \u00c1soka, and if these were correctly ascribed, as it seemed scarcely possible to doubt they were, then a new light had been shed on \u00c1soka's religious feelings, for in these inscriptions, recorded at the close of his long reign, he recorded that though he had held the true faith\u2021 for many years, he admitted that he had held it in a lukewarm fashion, and that it was only for the preceding twelve months that he had taken such measures as effectually to put a stop to the worship of the gods formerly held in reverence.\n\n* Journal Roy. As. Soc. IX. p. 171.\n\u2020 Beal's Chinese Tripitaka, pp. 88, 89.\n\u2021 That by this was meant Buddhism there can hardly now be any reasonable doubt.\nMoreover Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la's arguments turned a great deal on the interpretation of a particular passage in one of \u00c1s\u00f3ka's edicts. The President was glad to inform the Society that a complete collection of all the edicts of \u00c1s\u00f3ka, carefully revised by General Cunningham, with corrected translations, was just ready for publication; it might be wise to wait till that appeared before trusting too much to the presumed interpretation of a single passage.\n\nAnother part of Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra's argument turned on the character of Jainism; but was it certain that the Jainism of to-day was the Jainism of Asoka's day, or in what respect that differed from Buddhism? The President might announce to the meeting that he had received from Dr. B\u00fchler information that he had, in conjunction with Dr. Jacobi, discovered almost conclusive evidence that Buddha Sakya Muni or Gautama was actually contemporary with Mahavira, the latest Tirthankra of the Jains. This coincided with Colebrooke's conjecture, adopted by Cunningham, that Gautama was at one time a disciple of Mahavira's. The Jain books recorded the fact that Mahavira had a disciple named Gautama, but beyond that fact little was said of him, and this would quite coincide with the supposition of his having at a later date left the school of Mahavira and set up one of his own.\n\nMr. Edgar called attention to the fact that in some of the Buddhist writings the name of \"Mahavira\" was given to Buddha also.\n\nThe President replied that he was aware of the fact but had not mentioned it, as it bore rather on another phase of the question. Raja Sivaprasad had based on this undoubted fact the very probable conclusion that \"Mahavira\" was a mere honorific title, and indeed had gone further and had endeavoured to identify the Mahavira of the Jains with the Kasyapa of the Buddhist legends, but so far this was little but conjecture, if indeed it was quite consistent with the legends of Buddhism.\n\nCaptain Waterhouse read translations of extracts from letters from M. Ch. Ujfalvy and the Abb\u00e9 Desgodins, descriptive of recent geographical researches in Turkistan and Thibet\u2014published in the October number of the Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie.\n\nThe following interesting account of Farghana (or Khokand)* is given by M. Ch. de Ujfalvy in a letter to the General Secretary of the French Geographical Society, dated T\u00fas, 19th August 1877.\n\n\"Having left Tashkend six weeks ago, I proceeded first to Khokand with post-horses. After leaving Khokand, I made a tour on horseback, in order to see more closely the character of the country and to be able to\n\n* The spelling of the names has been given as in Col. Walker's map of Turkestan. (J. W.)\nstudy its inhabitants and monuments quite at my ease. In this manner I travelled 655 kilometres, passing through Marghil\u00e1n, Wadil, Sh\u00e1h-i-Mard\u00e1n (lake K\u00fat\u00e1n K\u00fal), Uch-K\u00farg\u00e1n, Naukat, Osh, Andij\u00e1n, Namang\u00e1n, Kass\u00e1n and T\u00fas (called by the Russians Tch\u00fast).\n\n\"As regards ethnology, I have succeeded in measuring more than 200 individuals; and have studied the manners, customs, creeds and languages of the different races inhabiting Farghanah. I have collected specimens of the flora and fauna of the country, with fragments of its minerals, and have made enquiries as to the productive powers of the soil and the products of national industry. I have purchased all objects which appeared to me to give a fairly correct idea of this industry. Finally I have made a collection of Greek, Bactrian, Arab and other coins, and have studied the archaeological remains of the country. A few details of the results of these studies will acquaint you at once with my researches.\n\n\"Fargh\u00e1na is with the district of Zar\u00e1fsh\u00e1n the only fertile tract in Russian Central Asia which appears to have a future more or less close at hand from the point of view of the political economist. The country appears to be an oblong valley, of elliptical form, shut in on nearly all sides. The nucleus of this valley is surrounded with a triple ring of mountains of a diverse character. The centre also shows three zones entirely unlike one another.\n\n\"Let us run rapidly through these six zones, starting from the centre, that is to say from the banks of the Sir Daria.\n\n\"The first zone, about the banks of the Sir Daria, the Narin and the Kara Daria, is nearly everywhere sandy, rarely grassy; here and there, an oasis of verdure appears, the ephemeral existence of which is often dependent on storms and moving sands. A few Usbegs and some poor Kara-Kalpaks nomadise about these inhospitable tracts.\n\n\"The second zone, fortunately more extensive than the first, is the most fertile in the country. It is a succession of gardens, fields of wheat, maize, jugara, cotton, vineyards and meadows. In the same way as oases are rare in the first zone, parts covered with sands or moorland are unfrequent in the second. It is the garden of Farghana, and the tract situated between Andij\u00e1n and Namang\u00e1n, called Eki-su-arasi, is particularly distinguished by its incomparable fertility. In this zone the great commercial centres of the country are to be found, such as Khokand (as a Sart town much above Tashkend in every way), Marghil\u00e1n (the new Russian capital), Osh, Andij\u00e1n and Namang\u00e1n. The most numerous inhabitants of this tract are the Sarts (a mixture of Tajiks, Usbegs and occasionally of Kirghiz), the Usbegs and the Kipchaks, Tajiks, T\u00farusks, Kashgarians, Kara Kalpaks, Jews, Louli gypsies, Mazang gypsies, Kara Kirghiz, Hindustanis and Afghans are also to be found there.\n\"The third zone, of less extent than the preceding, is generally stony and sometimes covered with moorland and even with sand. Here and there attempts have been made to reclaim by cultivation some of the land from its primitive barrenness, and these attempts have succeeded fairly well, seeing that the soil is everywhere fit for ploughing. Usbegs and Kipchaks are the few inhabitants of this tract.\n\n\"The fourth zone, situated on the most fertile slopes of the mountains, is, to my mind, the most beautiful part of Farghana, enjoying all the advantages of a warm climate, while scarcely suffering any of its inconveniences.\n\n\"It is the tract that would be most suited for an European colony. It is inhabited almost exclusively by Tajiks who have often entirely preserved the purity of their race. Usbegs and Kipchaks are to be found in small numbers and the Karakirghiz occasionally settle down there. Isfara, Wadil, Uch-Kurgh\u00e1n, and Naukat to the south; Ka\u0161\u00e1n and T\u00fas to the north are its principal agricultural and commercial centres.\n\n\"The fifth zone, that of the valleys, mountains, hill slopes and plateaux, often presents a somewhat barren appearance, especially when the burning sun of these parts has burnt up the vegetation, but vast grassy steppes are also frequently to be found, which offer excellent sustenance to the flocks of the Karakirghiz, and neighbouring races of Usbegs and Tajiks. It is the home of the Karakirghiz who move about there in all liberty.\n\n\"The sixth zone, finally, is the most elevated and the most picturesque, but at the same time the most desolate. In this zone are situated the numerous routes, passes and defiles which lead into Semiretch\u00e9, Kashgaria, Karatigin, and the government of the Syr-Daria. It is, however, specially interesting from a commercial and strategical point of view. Lapis-lazuli amethyst, rock-crystal, naphtha, salt, coal and mineral springs are to be found there. When at some early future time, all the resources of the country are laid under contribution, this region will equally be called upon to render notable services to the national industry.\n\n\"I have already given the Anthropological Society numerous details regarding the inhabitants of Farghana, and I reserve bringing this question before the Geographical Society until I shall be able to present to them the little ethnographical map of these regions I am now compiling.\n\n\"As regards archaeology there is little to be said considering the extent of the country. I have, however, succeeded in finding some places which appeared rather interesting. I excavated a Kurg\u00e1n (tumulus) in the environs of Marghil\u00e1n, but unsuccessfully, only finding some fragments of pottery, glass beads, &c., and bones of no value whatever.\n\n\"The Takht-i-Sulim\u00e1n at Osh is more interesting for its picturesqueness than for its archaeology, and the numerous mosques and madrasahs of\nKhokand and Osh, generally of a rather agreeable construction, are all more or less modern. At Namang\u00e1n, however, there are two old mosques called Hojamn\u00e9 Kabri and Aziz Halfa, the first of which is an architectural chef-d'\u0153uvre. I have brought back some of the inscriptions I was able to copy. Near Kas\u00e1n, the oldest town in Farghana, is a cemetery called Sadpir, which contains nearly 70 tombs, all with inscriptions. This cemetery dates from upwards of 600 years ago, when the Calmucks invaded and pillaged the country and slaughtered its richest and most notable inhabitants. I have taken impressions of more than 20 inscriptions, and shall take back three stones to Tashkend. The Tajiks of Kas\u00e1n say that they came into the country before the introduction of Islam. At 16 kilometres from Kas\u00e1n there is another rather curious tomb, called Safed Boul\u00e1n. Unfortunately there are no inscriptions about it. Finally, near T\u00fas, not far from the little village of H\u00e1uva, is another cemetery named Mazar; there are in it five stones with inscriptions. I have taken impressions of three of these stones which appeared to me the finest, and which the mullahs of the place could not decipher. I go back to Tashkend and hope to return to Europe by Siberia.\"\n\nExtract from a letter by the Abb\u00e9 Desgodins to his brother, dated 28th March 1877, containing Notes on Thibet.\n\n\"The following is some new information which should confirm the identity of the Yar-Kiu-tsang-po river of Thibet with the Brahmaputra. An old Llama related to me yesterday that in his youth he had travelled a great deal and had visited nearly the whole of Thibet. He had followed the great river from its source in or near the lakes of Tso-ma-pang (Manasarowar), which are situated in the western part of the province of Ngar\u00e9, the most western province of Thibet, and while making his pilgrimages of devotion, he had arrived as far as the frontiers of the savage tribe of Lhopas. He said that at a distance of some days' march from Lhassa, the river turns towards the south and making a long bend passes through the Tibetan district of Hia-yul governed by the Kalun Doring of Lhassa, a very populous and rich district which is situated just to the north of the Lhopas. The river enters the country occupied by this wild tribe and passes through perpendicular rocks, precipitous and bare, without paths, and over which the only passage is by means of bad ladders made of the stems of climbing plants. After a certain course through the Lhopas country, the river falls perpendicularly from the top of a rock into a valley the name of which he did not know. The height of the fall is so great that it makes one giddy. At this spot, he said, the stream is almost as considerable as the Kin-cha-Kiang at Bat-hang and the Lan-tsang-kiang at the Salt Lakes. The details he gave me regarding these Lhopas removes all doubt. They are the same as those\nspoken of by the slave, now a Christian, of whom I spoke in a former paper and called Abors by the English and M. Krick. All this information perfectly confirms the information I gave in my letter of the 14th June 1874, but here is something further in favour of it.\n\n\"Every one in Assam knows the fall of Brahmakund, whither the heathen resort as pilgrims. M. Bernard has often spoken to me of it as a fall remarkable for its height, the force of its volume of water, and the hollow it scoops out in falling. The southerly position attributed by my confr\u00e8re to this vast fall, and the northerly position given to it yesterday by the Llama, induce me to believe that the fall at Brahmakund must be precisely the fall of the Yar-Kiu-tsang-po which then becomes the Brahmaputra, the latter being navigable almost immediately after this addition.\n\n\"My interlocutor assured me over and over again that the Yar-kiu-tsang-po did not reach so far as the Nahong (Mishmi) country, but that it disappeared more to the west among the Lhopas (Abors).*\n\n\"I give this information just as I received it, but I must confess I consider it very probable because it perfectly confirms the information I had previously received.\n\n\"This good Llama has also given me other geographical information. I shall only now mention those points which appear to me certain and confirmatory of the information I had already received and checked some time ago.\n\n\"In going from Cha-mu-to on the Lan-tsang-kiang, to Lhassa by the official highway, after having passed the Lon-tse-kiang, the principal posts of Lo-rong-dzong, Chu-pan-to (Tibetan, Ch\u00fap\u00e9ado) Lali (Tibetan, Larego) and Kiam da (Tibetan, Kong-bon-Kiam-da) are reached. To the south of Chou-pan-to and Lali, at about two days march, the independent principality of Po-yul (Chinese Pomi) is passed on the left hand (looking south). This principality recognises the emperor of China and is governed directly by the third ambassador of Lhassa who bears the title of I-tsin. It does not recognise in any way the Tibetan king of Lhassa. It is divided between four native chiefs, who are almost quite independent in their respective territories and only consult together on the affairs common to the tribe. One of them calls himself Don-ya-peun, or chief of Don-ya to the southeast. I do not know the names of the rest. This country is said to be fairly rich, of difficult access, surrounded as it is on all sides by high pre-\n\n* From a conversation with the 'Pandit,' Nain Singh, I learnt that the name of Lhope is given by the Tibetans to the Daphla tribes. This fact taken in connection with the Llama's account seems to favour Lieut.-Col. Godwin-Austen's belief, founded on observations made during the Daphla Campaign, that the Subansiri is the continuation of the Sanpo. As shown on the map, however, these tribes are a good deal to the west of the Subansiri. (J. W.)\ncipitous mountains. The red lamas are very numerous there, robbers still more so, and they often make expeditions beyond their own boundaries. Leprosy is said to be very common. Po-yul has as a neighbour on the west the Tibetan tribe known under the name of Kong-ba, of which Kiamda is the principal town or city. This country stretches almost as far as Lhassa, it is said to be very populous and fairly rich, but the inhabitants are very much stricken with leprosy. Another rather singular peculiarity of this country is that the proportion of girls is very much larger than that of boys in the statistics of births.\n\n\"The country of Po-yul (Po-mi) does not touch, to the south, the chain of the Himalayas and the country of the wild tribes, from which it is separated by a band of country governed by Lhassa.\n\n\"The names of the different Tibetan districts of this zone going from east to west are as follows. Hia-yul, to the north of the Lhopas (Abors), Tse-tang, Sang-ye, Meun-pa, these, I believe, are situated to the north of Sikkim and Bhutan, but for these last names I must get further information. I only mention them with all reserve.\n\n\"The eastern limit of Po-yul is the western slope of the chain of mountains which comes down from north to south on the right bank of the Lute-kiang. When I passed along to Ponda and Zo-gong on the Du-kio, in 1862, every one pointed out to me the west, beyond the chain I have just mentioned, as being the true position of Poyul.\"\n\nMajor-General Thuillier said:\u2014The extracts we have just heard read from the French Geographical Society's Journal were of particular interest at the present moment, as to the identity of the great Tibetan river Sanpu, or Yaru, and its connection with the Brahmaputra in Upper Assam, because that still pending problem was receiving great attention by the officers of the Great Trigonometrical and Topographical Surveys, Lieuts. Harman and Woodthorpe, R. E., who were just now exploring the course of the Subansiri river in north Lakhimpur, and endeavouring to push up beyond the course as laid down by Major Godwin-Austen, when employed with the Daphla military expedition in 1874-5, to see if there was any possibility of the Sanpu breaking through the high range of mountains in that direction and so falling, through the Subansiri, into the Brahmaputra about the meridian of 94\u00b0 E. Longitude, or near Lakhimpur in Assam. It may be remembered that the Trigonometrical Survey native explorer \"Nain Sing\" came down from Lhassa, through Butan due south, and entered Assam at a place called Udalguri almost on the meridian of Gauhati. He traced the Sanpu, and it is recorded in the latest map of Assam published at the Surveyor General's Office, down to the parallel of about 29\u00b0 Latitude, which, it will be observed from the map on the table, is in close proximity to the supposed continuation of the course of the Subansiri, as seen by Godwin-Austen from the highest elevation from which he observed in the Daphla country.\nThe volume of water down the Subansiri is said to favour the idea of its junction with the Sanp\u00fa, and further careful observations are now being made by Lieuts. Harman and Woodthorpe, R. E., to ascertain whether the Subansiri exceeds the capacity of the Dihong or of the Dibong, the former of which has long been held by English geographers to be the real outlet for the Sanp\u00fa into the Brahmaputra, near Sadiya.\n\nIt was unfortunate that the journey taken by the explorer Nain Sing, below or south of Lhassa, was too far west to solve this interesting and long pending doubt, but the statement made by the author of the paper now read, certainly favoured the assumption regarding the probability of the Subansiri theory. The question, however, was altogether conjectural at present, and must remain so until more conclusive evidence is produced as to the real course of the Dibong as well as of the Subansiri upwards, or other native explorers can penetrate downwards from Lhassa to the head of the Assam valley through the Abor and Miri tribes inhabiting that remarkably unknown and untrodden region.\n\nIf at the time of the Daphla Military expedition Major Godwin-Austen and Lieut. Harman, then employed on the Survey, had been permitted to extend their explorations after the political and military objects of the expedition had been gained, and as so strongly urged by the late Commander-in-Chief, Lord Napier of Magdala, it is possible that a large extent of country in the direction of the northern branch of the Subansiri, as well as east of it, in the neighbourhood of the Abors and Miris, towards the Dibong, might have been laid down, but all that tract north-east of Lakhimpur still remains to be reconnoitred and it is hoped that by the strenuous exertions of the talented engineer officers now engaged in prosecuting the work as far as permitted by the Government of India, something may soon be achieved towards the satisfactory elucidation of this interesting and important geographical problem\u2014and also towards a better knowledge of all the extreme N. E. Frontier round Sadiya and the head of the Brahmaputra, beyond or north of Brahmakund, so necessary for a due and proper construction of the map of the Assam Province and of British Indian limits in that direction.\n\nThe following paper was read\u2014\n\n1. *Pali Studies, No. 2, Vuttodaya.* By Major G.

Bayley, K.C.S.I., C.I.E., President, in the Chair.\n\nAccording to the Bye-laws of the Society, the President ordered the voting papers to be distributed for the election of Officers and Members of Council for 1878, and appointed Messrs. R. B. Shaw and H. H. Locke, Scrutineers.\n\nThe President then called upon the Secretary to read the Annual Report.\n\n**Annual Report for 1877.**\n\nThe Council of the Asiatic Society, in submitting their usual Annual Report exhibiting the state of the Society's affairs during the year 1877, are glad to be able to state that the position of the Society is on the whole satisfactory, both as regards the state of its finances and the extent and variety of its publications.\n\nDuring the year 1877 there has been an accession to the Society of 26 ordinary Members, while the losses by death (5), retirement (17), and removal (6) amount to 28. The number of ordinary Members at the close of the year was therefore 345, against 347 in 1876. Of the ordinary Members on the roll, 46 are absent from India, leaving 113 Resident, 163 non-Resident, 14 Foreign, and 9 Life Members, on the effective list.\n\nThe annexed Tabular Statement shews the fluctuations in the number of the ordinary Members during the last five years.\nDuring the year 4 members have compounded for their subscriptions, and the compounding fees and entrance fees, amounting altogether to Rs. 1,650, have been duly funded in the Permanent Reserve Fund.\n\nDr. John Muir was elected an Honorary Member of the Society.\n\nOf the deceased members whose loss the Society has to regret, the Hon'ble Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1h Ramanath Tagore, C. S. I., had been a Member of the Society for 40 years, during which period he served twice on the Council. His patriotic and enlightened efforts for the improvement of his countrymen will be long remembered.\n\nMr. J. Geoghegan had been 18 years a member of the Society, and had served 3 years on the Council, as well as having been a member of various Committees; the Council have to deplore that a career which gave so much promise of great usefulness, has been cut short so prematurely.\n\nThe other names in the Obituary are Colonel D. G. Robinson, R. E. Kumar Giris Chandra Si\u00f1ha, and Babu Vrindavanachandra Mandala of Balasor.\n\nMr. Robert Swinhoe, F. R. S., the author of many valuable contributions relating to the mammals and birds of China, who died on the 20th October, had been a Corresponding Member of the Society since 1860.\n\nIndian Museum.\n\nDuring the past year the Council have received no presentations requiring to be transferred to the Indian Museum under the provisions of Act XXII of 1876.\n\nIn accordance with the provision of the above Act which, allots an additional Trustee to represent the interests of the Society, the Council appointed Mr. T. S. Isaac a Trustee on behalf of the Society.\n\nThe Hon'ble Sir E. C. Bayley, K. C., S. I. (President), Dr. T. R. Lewis, Captain J. Waterhouse and Mr. H. Blochmann have continued to act as Trustees on behalf of the Society throughout the year.\nFinance.\n\nThe Council have to observe that though the actual financial condition of the Society is perfectly sound and prosperous, the income of the past year shows a falling off owing to the reduction of subscriptions, and was less than the expenditure, by Rs. 854-15-11.\n\nThe circumstances of the year were rather exceptional, but the Council believe that with care the reduced income will be found sufficient to meet the ordinary expenses of the Society, and their anxious attention will be given to this object during the current year.\n\nIt is somewhat difficult, however, to ascertain the exact financial position of the Society at present, because during the past year a great deal of extraordinary expense was incurred on account of Repairs to the Building and Furniture, &c., and it is not always easy to estimate the amounts to be charged against ordinary or extraordinary expenditure.\n\nAfter all liabilities on account of the repairs &c. had been met, there remained Government Securities amounting to Rs. 1,36,000. Of this sum Rs. 1,26,700 have been transferred to the Permanent Reserve Fund, under Rule 67, and will yield an income of Rs. 6,836-8 annually till the expiry of the 5\u00bd per cent. loan.\n\nThe balance, amounting to Rs. 9,300, has been kept in the Temporary Reserve Fund, and is available to meet any extraordinary expenses beyond the limits of the regular annual income, though care must be taken in regulating such expenditure out of the capital of the Society. The interest accruing from this part of the Society's vested Funds will amount to Rs. 511 annually, and, allowing for the probable sale of Rs. 2000 during the year, on account of the publication of Mr. Moore's papers and the preparation and publication of the new Library Catalogue, the total income derivable from these funds for the year may be set down at Rs. 7,200, or Rs. 600 a month.\n\nThe gross receipts of the Society during the year amount, as shewn in the table below, to Rs. 41,846-11-1 and the gross expenditure to Rs. 38,651-18-10.\n\nThis latter sum includes the following items of extraordinary expenditure: under Publications, Rs. 571-6-10, remitted to England in advance for the publication of Mr. Moore's papers on Indian Lepidoptera; under Library, Rs. 935-3-1, for the new Catalogues and MSS; under \"Refund of Loan,\" Rs. 2,000 repaid to the O. P. and Conservation of Sanskrit MSS. Funds; under Furniture and Building, Rs. 15,695-12-0. The total of these items amounts to Rs. 19,202-5-11, which was partly met by the sale of Government Securities for Rs. 17,000.\n\nThe income of the Society shows a falling off during the past year, chiefly in the receipts from subscriptions, which amount to Rs. 7,200\nagainst Rs. 9,009 for the previous year; this, however, was to be expected in consequence of the reduction of the quarterly subscriptions of resident members from Rs. 12 to 9: the actual loss on this head amounts to Rs. 1,272.\n\nThe receipts from admission and compounding fees were Rs. 880 and Rs. 770 respectively, but as these sums are funded they cannot be considered part of the income of the Society, and have consequently been omitted from the table showing the net income of the Society. These items were included in the estimate of 'income' for 1877.\n\nThe outstandings due to the Society for admission-fees, subscriptions, and sale of publications have, the Council regret to report, increased during the year from Rs. 6,270 to Rs. 7,074-5-5, the greater portion of which is irrecoverable, and will have to be written off to profit and loss. The arrears for subscriptions from Members only, are Rs. 5,874-14, upon which a reduction of Rs. 400 has been effected during the year.\n\nThe following is a Statement of the Cash Assets of the Society at the close of 1877.\n\n| Description                  | Amount       |\n|------------------------------|--------------|\n| Permanent Vested Fund        | Rs. 1,26,700 |\n| Temporary do.                 | Rs. 9,300    |\n| Balance in Bank of Bengal    | Rs. 2,968    |\n| Cash in hand                 | Rs. 156      |\n\nTotal Rs. ... 1,39,125\n\nThe following tables will show the Gross Receipts and Expenditure of the Society as compared with the previous year, and also the Net Income and Ordinary Expenditure.\n\n**GROSS RECEIPTS.**\n\n| Description                  | 1876          | 1877          |\n|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Balance of 1875,             | Rs. 3,206     | Rs. 3,432     |\n| Admission Fees,              | Rs. 800       | Rs. 880       |\n| Subscriptions,               | Rs. 9,009     | Rs. 7,200     |\n| Publications,                | Rs. 1,535     | Rs. 1,633     |\n| Library,                     | Rs. 312       | Rs. 227       |\n| Fines, &c.,                  | Rs. 60        | Rs. 47        |\n| Received from Government,    | Rs. 1,50,000  | Rs. 0         |\n| Sale of Government Securities| Rs. 5,102     | Rs. 17,501    |\n| Interest on do.,             | Rs. 8,573     | Rs. 7,583     |\n| Rent from Government,        | Rs. 1,920     | Rs. 0         |\n\nCarried over, Rs. 1,80,520\n### Annual Report\n\n#### 1876\n\n| Description                          | Rs.     |\n|--------------------------------------|---------|\n| Brought over, Rs.                    | 1,80,520|\n| Coin Fund                            |         |\n| Loan from Fund a/c                   | 1,040   |\n| Do.

Tr\u00fcbner and Co.'s half yearly statement of accounts with the Society (1st July 1876 to 1st January 1877) shewed a balance of \u00a3118-2-10\u00bd d. due from the Society, which on subsequent examination was reduced to \u00a3108-16 and duly remitted to Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co.\n\nAccording to Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co.'s statement, the sale of the Society's publications from 1st July 1876 to 1st January 1877, amounted to Rs. 246 and that of the Bibliotheca Indica publications to Rs. 78-12-0. This sum, representing \u00a326-8, was placed to the credit of the Society and O. P. Fund respectively.\n\nTen Invoices, consisting of publications of scientific Societies, presented to and subscribed for by the Society, books purchased and books on inspection, were received from Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. during 1877. The money value of these consignments amounted to \u00a3167-18-9, from which the sum of \u00a38-11 has to be deducted for the value of books returned, leaving a balance of \u00a3159-7-9. 156 copies of both parts of the Journal, and 192 copies of the Proceedings were despatched to Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. for sale; representing respectively a money value of \u00a328-12 and \u00a310-8. Of the Bibliotheca Indica publications 864 copies, valued at Rs. 771-0 were sent for sale.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe additions to the Library during the year comprise in all 1,235 vols. and parts of vols. Of these 658 were received as presentations from Government, from Authors and by exchange, and 577 were added by purchase, which is considerably in excess of the additions made in the same way to the Library in past years.\n\nAs it was found that the Catalogue of the Library prepared by the\nlate Assistant Secretary was very imperfect, steps were taken to prepare an entirely new one, and for this purpose the Council sanctioned the employment of Mr. S. D'Cruze, who, with the Assistant Secretary, under Mr. Blochmann's close supervision, has made great progress in cataloguing and arranging the Library, and it is hoped that the new Catalogue may be ready for publication during the current year, and this long-felt want supplied.\n\nReference was made in the last report to the progress made in preparing an analytical Catalogue of the Sanskrit MSS. in the Society's Library. Owing to the repairs of the house, much interruption was caused to this work during the past year, and the Pundit employed on it could examine and catalogue only 200 MSS. The Pundit has also compiled Indices of works in the following branches of Sanskrit Literature, to be appended to Catalogues hereafter to be published:\u2014Kosha, K\u00e1vya, Ch'hando, Alank\u00e1ra, Jyotisha, Vaidyaka. In the meanwhile Dr. R. Mitra carried through the Press the first part of the work, comprising detailed notices of all the works on Sanskrit Grammar available in the Library. Annexed to this volume is a list of all works on the subject known to exist.\n\nThe Council are glad to announce that considerable progress has also been made in the printing of Dr. Mitra's analysis of the valuable collection of Sanskrit Buddhist MSS. presented to the Society by Mr. B. H. Hodgson.\n\nThe Books and Book-cases in the Library have been properly arranged and numbered.\n\nThe Photographic collection has received the following additions, both presented by the Home Department of the Government of India.\n\n1. A set of Photographs of the paintings at the Ajanta Caves.\n2. A set of Photographs of the Kantanagar Temple in Din\u00e1jpur.\n\nPublications.\n\nThe Publications of the Society issued during the year compare favourably with those of former years, and comprise 10 numbers of the Proceedings consisting of 274 pages of text, with 3 plates. The Meteorological Observations, hitherto issued from the Surveyor General's Office, have been discontinued from March, and do not therefore appear in the Proceedings from that month.\n\nFour numbers of the Journal, Part I, have been issued, containing 468 pages of text, illustrated by 13 Plates. Of Journal Part II, 3 numbers have also been issued, consisting of 314 pages of text illustrated by 1 plate. The fourth number is in preparation and will be issued soon.\n\nThe Council have made arrangements for publishing the descriptions by Messrs. Moore and Hewitson of the new species of Indian Lepidoptera in the collections of the late Mr. W. S. Atkinson. They will be in three parts, quarto form, similar to the transactions of the Zoological Society.\nand will be illustrated by 9 plates. Orders have been given for printing 525 copies, of which 200 will have coloured plates. It is proposed to give each member of the Society a copy of the work with plain plates, but those members who wish to have copies with the plates coloured will be able to obtain them by paying the additional cost of colouring, estimated at about Rs. 10 per copy.\n\nBuilding.\n\nThe amount spent up to 31st December 1876 on account of \"Repairs and Alterations\" and for \"Furniture and Fittings,\" was Rs. 11,561-14. During 1877, a further sum of Rs. 7,569-13-6 was paid to Messrs. Mackintosh, Burn and Co. in full of their bill for repairs and alterations, and Rs. 8,125-15-6 was expended in purchasing furniture for the Society's public rooms, book-cases for the Library, and for restoring the pictures and picture frames of the Society's collection of paintings. The total amount, therefore, spent during 1876-77 in the improvement of the Society's property amounts to Rs. 27,257-11. It is anticipated that no further outlay on these heads will be required for some time to come.\n\nWith reference to the new railing it was intended to erect along the Park Street front of the premises, the Council have to report that nothing has as yet been decided upon. During the year negotiations were opened with the Municipality, who were desirous of obtaining a portion of the Society's ground to improve the approach to Park Street, in return for which they were to share the expense of erecting a handsome railing. The negotiations, however, fell through. A statement of the case was submitted to the Society by the Council, at the December meeting.\n\nCoin Cabinet.\n\nTo the Coin Cabinet of the Society have been added during the year, 7 gold coins, acquired by purchase, and 12 copper coins presented to the Society by Babu Jogesh Chunder Dutt.\n\nSecretary's Office.\n\nMr. Blochmann, the Philological Secretary, has throughout the year retained charge of Part I of the Journal. Mr. Wood-Mason retained the Natural History Secretaryship till July, when he proceeded to England. For the remainder of the year Mr. W. T. Blanford and Captain Waterhouse have superintended the publication of Part II of the Journal.\n\nThe duties of the General Secretaryship and editing of the Proceedings were performed by Capt. Waterhouse, except for the month of January when Mr. Blochmann took temporary charge. Mr. H. B. Medlicott has retained charge of the Treasurership throughout the year.\nThe Asst. Secretary, Mr. Leonard, has continued to give satisfaction by the diligent and zealous discharge of his duties. The Asst. Librarian, Maulaw\u00ed Ghul\u00e1m Akbar, was dismissed for incompetence and Mr. Andrews was engaged in his place. Mr. Andrews has given satisfaction. B\u00e1b\u00fas Kedarnath Bysack, Cashier, Ramjibun Mookerjea, Asst.-Cashier, and Jadu Bindo Bysack, Storekeeper, have continued to perform their duties diligently.\n\nBibliotheca Indica.\n\nA. Arabic and Persian Series.\n\nIn the Arabic and Persian Series, eleven fasciculi were issued during the year, viz., 2 Arabic, and 9 Persian.\n\nOf the Iq\u00e1b\u00e1n, or 'Biographical Dictionary of Muhammad,' by Ibn Hajar 'As\u1e33al\u00e1n\u00ed, Maulaw\u00ed 'Abdul-\u1e24ai, Head-Professor of the Calcutta Madrasah, has issued two fasciculi.\n\nMr. Blochmann has issued three quarto fasciculi of the Persian text of the A\u00edn-i-Akbar\u00ed. The work, which was commenced in 1868, is now complete. It consists of two volumes of nearly 1100 quarto pages, two geographical indexes, an index of Hind\u00ed scientific terms, a biography of Abul-Fazl, and a Preface containing the necessary information regarding the 15 MSS. from which Mr. Blochmann collated the text, and the style and the writings of the author. The Government of India, with its usual liberality, had made a special grant of Rs. 5000 towards the cost of printing.\n\nMaulaw\u00ed 'Abdur-Rah\u00edm, of the Calcutta Madrasah, issued during 1877 six fasciculi of Abul-Fazl's Akbarn\u00e1ma\u1e25. The text of the first volume of this work, which contains the history of Akbar's predecessors, is now finished. Of the second volume, two more fasciculi have been printed, which bring the history of Akbar's reign to 970 (A.D. 1563). An index to Vol. I, of names of persons and of geographical places, is in course of preparation, and will be issued during the present year.\n\nB. Sanskrit Series.\n\nIn the Sanskrit series altogether twenty fasciculi were issued during the past year. With a view to complete without delay some of the larger works on hand, no new work was undertaken. Of the largest work on hand, the S\u00e1ma Veda Sa\u00f1hit\u00e1, six fasciculi have been published, completing the fourth volume. Another volume, it is expected, will bring this elaborate and important work to a close. This work, supplemented by the Br\u00e1hmanas, so critically edited by Dr. Burnell of Madras, will place the whole of the S\u00e1ma Veda, held by the Hindus as the most ancient and most sacred text of their scriptures, within easy reach of oriental scholars.\nThe Agni Pur\u0101\u1e47a which forms a sort of Cyclop\u00e6dia of Sanskrit learning, is also in a forward state, and two fasciculi more will complete the work. Three Nos. were brought out by the editor, Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra, during the past year. This will be followed by an edition of the V\u00e1yu Pur\u0101\u1e47a simultaneously with an English translation by the same editor. The translation will appear under the auspices of the Oxford University authorities.\n\nPandit Bharatachandra \u015airom\u0101\u1e47i has brought out six fasciculi of his edition of the Vrata Kha\u1e47\u1e0da of Hem\u00e1dri. The work is a digest of all rules and ordinances of ancient Hindu sages regarding fasts and penances. The quotations given in it are numerous, and of great interest with reference to the dates of the writers quoted.\n\nV\u00e1chaspati Mi\u015bra\u2019s gloss on the Ved\u00e1nta S\u00fatras of Vy\u00e1sa, which was undertaken two years ago by Professor B\u00e1la S\u00e1str\u00ed of Benares, has advanced by two Nos., and the M\u00edm\u00e1\u1e41s\u00e1 Aphorisms by one. Both these works will require some time yet before they are completed.\n\nThe progress made in the printing of Gobhila\u2019s Aphorisms on the domestic rites enjoined in the S\u00e1ma Veda, has also been slow, only one fasciculus having appeared during the past year. But that task has nearly been completed, and will be brought to a close in course of the current year. By way of appendices to the text, the editor proposes to print the Supplementary Aphorisms by the son of Gobhila, as also the Sn\u00e1na and the Sandhy\u00e1 S\u00fatras. The whole of these will not take up more than one fasciculus.\n\nThe Council have great satisfaction in announcing that Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra has at last completed his edition of the Lalita Vistara. The work was undertaken several years ago, and five fasciculi were published; but after that, owing to one cause or another, it had to be set aside from time to time. Annexed to the last fasciculus is an Introduction in which the editor has given a detailed account of the language, history, date and contents of the work, which will not fail to prove interesting to oriental scholars.\n\nThe following is a detailed list of the Bibliotheca Indica Publications issued during 1877\u2014\n\nA.

The recommendation was sanctioned.\n\nThere was some delay in taking the votes for the election of officers and members of the Council for 1878, owing to a misapprehension caused by the note on the papers circulated to Resident members in the usual way.\nbefore the meeting, and to an objection raised by Dr. Waldie, to the officers being elected collectively, as usual, and not in due sequence, as laid down in rule 44. The Scrutineers finally reported the result of the election as follows:\n\nW. T. Blanford, Esq., F. R. S.,\nDr. Rajendralala Mitra, Rai Bahadur, C. I. E.,\nH. B. Medlicott, Esq.,\nT. S. Isaac, Esq.,\nH. Blochmann, Esq., M. A.,\nCapt. J. Waterhouse,\nR. Lydekker, Esq.,\nE. Gay, Esq.,\nW. T. Blanford, Esq., F. R. S.,\nDr. Rajendralala Mitra, Rai Bahadur, C. I. E.,\nH. B. Medlicott, Esq., M. A.,\nT. S. Isaac, Esq.,\nH. Blochmann, Esq., M. A.,\nCapt. J. Waterhouse,\nDr. T. R. Lewis,\nJ. O'Kincahy, Esq., C. S.,\nBabu Prannath Pandit,\nDr. J. Anderson,\nR. Lydekker, Esq.,\nCol. J. T. Walker, C. B., R. E., F. R. S.,\nH. F. Blanford, Esq.,\nE. Gay, Esq., M. A.,\nA. W. Croft, Esq., M. A.\n\nMessrs. D. Waldie and J. Blackburn, were elected to audit the Annual Accounts.\n\nThe President said\u2014That he regretted that his approaching departure from India and the pressure of business which it involved, prevented him from preparing any address on the occurrences of the past, such as was sometimes laid before them. So far as the affairs of the Society were concerned he could only refer the meeting to the report which had just been read and which he thought he might justly call satisfactory. His duty was now to vacate the chair in favour of Mr. Blanford. In doing so, he begged to express to the Society his sense of the high honor which they had done him in so often more than once electing him to office as President and as a Member of their Council. The duties of those offices he had\nfulfilled to the best of his ability with much pleasure, and he could only regret that long periodical absences from Calcutta and the pressure of official duties had prevented his doing so more energetically. As it was, he could only express his sense of the kindness with which they had made allowance for his shortcomings. It was to himself a matter of pain to cease from personal action in the affairs of the Society, in which he took that deep interest which they so thoroughly deserved. It was possible indeed that greater leisure in the future might enable him to give more attention to various branches of the enquiries to which the Society devoted itself, and if he was able to do so and to make any observations which he thought of interest, he would gladly from time to time place them at the disposal of the Society of which he hoped always to remain a member.\n\nThere was one last motion which he would ask permission to make before leaving the chair. General Thuillier, who had so long and so usefully been connected with the Society, and to whom they were indebted, not only for his labours as their President and on the Council, but for much aid which his official capacity enabled him to render, was quitting India tomorrow morning. He would ask the Society to pass a vote of thanks to General Thuillier and an expression of regret at losing his active assistance. If this motion was carried it would, of course, be formally transmitted in due course by the Secretary, but there was no time for this to be done while General Thuillier was in the country. He begged therefore to be allowed to communicate the vote to General Thuillier personally, as he hoped to see him before his departure.\n\nThe vote was put and carried. The President then said that he begged now to vacate the chair to Mr. Blanford, whom, he felt confident, the Society would find worthy of the high honor they had conferred on him.\n\nThe Meeting was then resolved into the Ordinary Monthly General Meeting.\n\nW. T. Blanford, Esq., F. R. S., President, in the Chair.\n\nThe minutes of the last Meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThe following presentations were announced\u2014\n\nFrom Commander R.

Brandis announced to the Meeting that news had been received of the death at Penang of the late Mr. S. Kurz, Curator of the Herbarium, Botanic Gardens, Calcutta, and read the following sketch of his life:\nSulpiz Kurz, Curator of the Herbarium at the Botanic Gardens, Calcutta, was born at Augsburg, in Bavaria, on the 5th May 1834. His father died early, and the boy attended school at Munich where his mother had settled. At an early age he commenced collecting objects of natural history, especially insects. After leaving school he attended lectures at the University of Munich, and chiefly devoted himself to the study of Botany, Mineralogy and Chemistry. In 1854 misfortunes in his family compelled him to abandon his studies, and he went to Holland where he worked as an apothecary and, after mastering the Dutch language, enlisted in the subordinate Medical Service of the Dutch Colonial Army. He landed at Batavia in September 1856, and was sent to Banka in March 1857, where he remained two years. During that time his work was light, and he was able to explore the island and to make botanical collections. In 1859 he was recalled to Batavia and joined the Military expedition to Bori in Celebes.\n\nIn September 1859 Kurz returned to Batavia, and was appointed as an Assistant on the Staff of the Botanic Garden at Buytenzoorg. Here for the first time in his life he had the advantage of working under the guidance of other botanists, and with the assistance of a large library and a rich herbarium. He devoted himself principally to Ferns, Bamboos, Musaceae, Pandanaceae and other difficult groups. A few years later Dr. Thomas Anderson, the Superintendent of the Botanical Gardens, Calcutta, came to Java in order to study the system of Cinchona cultivation which had then for some time been established by the Dutch authorities. He induced Kurz, with the permission of the Dutch Government, to accept the appointment which he held at the Herbarium of the Calcutta Botanical Gardens until his death. In October 1863 Kurz left Java, and joined his new appointment at the Gardens early in 1864.\n\nBefore his transfer to Calcutta he had not published much, a few papers only on the vegetation of Banka and other matters had been printed in the \"Naturkundige Tydschrift voor Nederlandsch Indie.\" In Calcutta, however, he commenced a series of important botanical publications, which appeared in English and Continental Periodicals, chiefly in the London Journal of Botany, the Proceedings of the Linnean Society, in Miquel's Annales, the Flora of Regensburg and the Botanische Zeitung. But his later and most important papers were published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society, of which he became a member in 1869.\n\nIn 1866, Kurz was deputed by the Government of India to Port Blair, in order to study the vegetation of the Andaman islands. He spent the months of April and May on that duty, and the results of his explorations were recorded in a most valuable Report which was published by Government in 1870. While engaged in examining the interior of South Andaman, he was seized by the Burman convicts, whom the Superin-\ntendent of Port Blair had given to assist him in his work, and was left tied hand and foot in the jungles on the ground. These and subsequent circumstances, which prevented the more extensive excursions which he had projected through the islands, obliged Kurz to return to Calcutta sooner than he had intended.\n\nIn 1867, the Government of India decided to employ him on the preparation of a hand-book, intended chiefly for the use of forest officers, of the trees, shrubs and climbers growing in the forests of British Burma. To this new task, Kurz devoted himself with his usual ardour and enthusiasm, and his researches regarding the Flora of Burma may justly be regarded as the most important work of his life. From December 1867 to June 1868, Kurz explored the forests in the province of Pegu and part of those in Martaban. But when after his return to Calcutta he examined and arranged the rich materials collected by him, he found that many doubtful points remained, and he was accordingly deputed on a second tour to the same districts, which lasted from December 1870 until May 1871.\n\nBesides the materials collected by himself, Kurz had the advantage of consulting large collections made by others in Burma, and he was thus enabled to describe numerous new genera and species. A number of Burmese plants collected by him are described by other Botanists and deservedly bear his name. Between 1872 and 1877 he contributed two series of valuable papers to the Journal of the Asiatic Society. One series he called \"New Burmese plants,\" and the other, \"Contributions towards the knowledge of the Burmese Flora.\" A general account of his researches was embodied in a quarto volume published by Government in 1875, under the title \"Preliminary Report on the Forest and other vegetation of Pegu.\" This work contains an admirable account of the vegetation in all parts of that province, as well as a most useful list of vernacular (Burmese) names of plants with their systematic names.\n\nThe chief results of his labours in regard to the Burma Flora, however, were embodied in his Forest Flora of British Burma, a work, regarding which it is not too much to say, that it has placed the name of Kurz in the first rank of Indian Botanists. This work was published towards the close of last year in two volumes, by order of the Government of India. It contains full and clear descriptions of 2,000 species, and will for a long time to come remain a standard work of reference for all interested in the vegetation of British Burma and the adjacent countries.\n\nIn 1875, Kurz took three months' leave and devoted it to a botanical exploration of the Nicobars, but exposure and fatigue in the unhealthy climate of those islands brought on a severe attack of fever which much weakened his constitution. In 1876, he contributed to the Journal of the Asiatic Society a paper on the Vegetation of the Nicobars, based chiefly\nupon the collections made by the Austrian Naturalists, attached to the Novara expedition. These collections had been sent to him for publication by the Director of the Imperial Museum at Vienna.\n\nOn the 12th November 1877, shortly after his Forest Flora had been published, Kurz left Calcutta on leave to visit the Straits Settlements. He reached Penang on the 12th December, but was taken ill and died at that place on the 15th January 1878, at the age of 43 years. An uninterrupted residence in the tropics of 21 years and constant exposure on his botanical explorations had undermined his constitution. His ardour in the pursuit of Botany was irrepressible, and he rarely thought of health or comfort on his expeditions.\n\nHe was Member of several learned Societies; his fellow Botanists in England, the Continent of Europe and in India will mourn his loss, and by many of his friends outside the circle of those interested in science, he will long be remembered by his enthusiastic and single-minded devotion to the science, which from early youth was the aim and object of his life.\n\nMr. Blochmann read an extract from a letter from Mr. Grierson on the Rangp\u00fari Genitive.\n\n\"I find I was wrong when I said that the Rangp\u00fari \"\u0906\u092a\u0928\u0915\u093e\u0930\" is a double genitive. It is no such thing. I have traced it up here in colloquial \u0906\u092a\u0928\u0915\u0947, which is evidently Pr\u00e1krit \u0915\u093e \u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923 and Sansk. \u0905\u0928\u0941\u092e\u0924\u093f.

I think this fact is worth preserving, though hardly worth making a separate paper about.\"\n\nMr. Blochmann exhibited a unique gold coin struck by Jal\u00e1l-udd\u00edn Fir\u00faz Sh\u00e1h (II) of Dihl\u00ed. He said\u2014\"The coin which I now exhibit belongs to Mr. Jos. T. Tripe, of Dynechupra, Tirhut. Mr. Tripe, on his last visit to Calcutta, shewed me about sixty or seventy gold coins belonging to him. They were mostly gold-muhurs struck by the Emperor Akbar, in splendid preservation, the specimens belonging to the years between 970 and 987 H. There were also several gold-muhurs struck by Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n, a gold t\u00e1nkah of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h Tughluq, and the Fir\u00faz Sh\u00e1hi now exhibited. The remarks made by Mr. Thomas in his 'Chronicles of the Pathan kings,' p. 144, lead me to believe that Mr. Tripe's coin is unique.'\n\n'Mr. Tripe has also since sent me a large collection of silver coins struck by Sher Sh\u00e1h, Isl\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, &c., containing several new types, which I hope to lay before the next meeting.

During the eighth century of the Hijrah, Indian kings applied to, and received from, the Fatimid Sultans of Egypt, sanads of investiture; and we see from the poems of Badr-i-Ch\u00e1h, the poet-laureate of Ghiyas-uddin Tughluq how great a value the Muhammadans attached to such sanads. Mubarak Shah (vide Thomas, l.c., p. 255) appears to have been the first king of Delhi who assumed the title of Khalifah. After him the title becomes quite common, the phrase used on the coins being \u062e\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0643\u0627\u062a, 'the Representative (Khalifah) of God by proof and evidence'. Akbar also used it in that peculiar sense which the establishment of his 'Divine Faith' gave it; but I have not seen it on the coins of his successors, though it often occurs applied to them in the prefaces of Muhammadan works. Now-a-days, the grand title of Khalifah has sunk so low as to be applied to master tailors, cooks, and other menial servants. The Sultans of Turkey appear to claim it as having descended to them from the Egyptian Khalifahs; but from the preceding examples, it is clear that any Muhammadan king may assume the title and the exercise of the spiritual functions which the title is supposed to imply.\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. *Aberrant Dentition of Felis Tigris.*\u2014By R. Lydekker, B. A.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe author exhibited the lower jaw of a Tiger from Burma, which had the peculiarity of bearing on one side an additional promolar tooth in advance of the two normal teeth. The presence of this additional tooth can only be explained on the hypothesis of a \"reversion\" to the extinct Miocene and Pliocene genus *Pseudolurus* in which three lower premolars were normally developed.\n\nThe paper will be published in full, with plate, in Journal Part II.\n\n2. *Figure of Buddha recently found at Sarn\u00e1th.*\u2014By H. Rivett-Carnac, C. I. E., M. R. A. S., &c.\n\nIn the account of the Buddhist remains at Sarnath, near Benares, published in the Journal, Asiatic Society, Vol. XXXII, General Cunningham noticed the desirability of clearing away the rubbish at the foot of the great *Stupa* called *Dhameh*, as he was of opinion that possibly some of the statues of Buddha which once occupied the eight niches of the tower might be found among the debris. It may, therefore, be of interest to the Asiatic Society to learn that during a visit paid to Sarn\u00e1th last Christmas by my wife and myself, in company with the Rev. J. C. and Mrs. Murray-Aynsley, who are travelling through India, a stone figure of Buddha was discovered amongst the ruins, in as nearly as possible the exact position indicated by General Cunningham. Whether this figure once occupied one of the eight niches of the tower, or belonged to some other portion of the building, may perhaps be determined with the help of the sketch now sent, together with a brief notice of the figure and a statement of the position in which it was found.\n\nThe figure was discovered by Mrs. Murray-Aynsley, whose attention was attracted by the pattern of a necklace carved on a piece of sandstone, which she found embedded in the debris on the south side of the trench cut by General Cunningham, many years ago, leading to the passage on the east side of the *stupa*. The rain has apparently washed away the soil from the sides of the trench and had left this fragment exposed, at a depth of about two feet from the level of the top of the rubbish by which the tower is now surrounded. At first it was thought that the sculptured necklace was a small fragment only, but on trying to extricate it, it was found necessary to remove the stones and bricks at the top and sides, and by degrees the figure, of which a drawing is annexed, (Plate I) was with some little difficulty extricated.\nThe block is of red Chunar sandstone, of the same character as that employed in the well-known tracery which still ornaments the stupa. The sketch has been drawn to scale, and it will be seen that the stone, in its present state, is 2 feet, 4 inches in height by 1 foot, 8 inches in breadth, and consists of a carved base 6 inches in height surrounded by a further leaf-shaped base 5 inches in height, on which is a seated figure of Buddha. The block has been much broken, but in the centre of the lower base the lotus, \"wheel-ornament\" or \"disc,\" so often seen on Buddhist carving, is intact. The remains of what would appear to have been a pedestal, or support to the disc, similar to those which support the discs on the summit of the Northern Gateway of Sanchi (see frontispiece, Fergusson's Tree and Serpent Worship) can still be distinguished. On either side of the disc are the remains of three figures. These figures have been much defaced, but it would appear that, when intact, each figure had an arm placed on the shoulder of its neighbour, an arrangement similar to what I recently noticed on some old Buddhist pillars at Benares.\n\nThe legs of the seated figures of Buddha are in fair preservation. They are crossed in the conventional attitude. The soles of the feet are turned up, and in the centre of each is carved a small flower (?). The arms have been broken off, but the thumb of the right hand is in good preservation, and the remains of the finger of the left hand are discernible, suggesting that the figure was in the conventional form of \"Buddha the teacher\" as described by General Cunningham. The necklace which first attracted Mrs. Murray-Aynsley's attention, is delicately carved and is in good preservation. The head has been broken off, and, as with it the upper portion of the block has been carried away, it is impossible to say whether the head was ever surmounted by an aureole or not.\n\nAt the back of the figure, the carved tracery which forms a panel on each side of the seated Buddha, is preserved, and on the left hand side is found the lower portion of a small carved figure, standing on a bracket carved out of and forming part of the original block. Our time was limited, but some search was made in the hope of finding fragments of the head aureole, or of other parts of the carving. Nothing was found. Careful and more extended search would, however, doubtless bring many other interesting remnants to light, and possibly the missing head of the figure.\n\nOn the sketch will be found, drawn in blue; the outline of the niche, and pedestal of one of the eight niches of the stupa, each niche being, according to General Cunningham, 5\u00bd feet in length, and the same in breadth. The stone pedestals, which are still in situ in most of the niches, are a little more than 1 foot in height and nearly 4 feet in length. The outlines of niche and pedestal have been drawn to scale, below and around the sketch.\nof the seated figure, so as to assist in determining whether this is one of the missing figures belonging to the niches.\n\nAt first sight the figure will, doubtless, be pronounced somewhat small, and it will suggest itself that, as each niche was provided with a large pedestal, the carved base below the figure, as shewn in the drawing, would be unnecessary. Then, too, it will suggest itself that the figures on the lower pedestal are small for a piece of sculpture to be placed on a niche at a height of 24 feet from the ground.\n\nGeneral Cunningham, as the following extract will shew, expected that the figures of the niches would be of life size. He wrote in the Volume of the Society's Journal above quoted.\n\n\"The lower part of the monument has 8 projecting faces, each 21 feet, 6 inches in width, with intervals of 15 feet between them. In each of the faces, at a height of 24 feet above the ground, there is a semi-circular headed niche, 5\u00bd feet in width and the same in height. In each of the niches there is a pedestal, one foot in height, and slightly hollowed on the top, to receive the base of a statue, but the statues themselves have long disappeared, and I did not find a fragment. There can be little doubt, however, that all the 8 statues represented Buddha the preacher in the usual form, with his hands raised before his breast, and the thumb and forefinger of the right hand placed on the little finger of the left hand, for the purpose of enforcing his argument. Judging by the dimensions of the niches the statues must have been of life size.\"\n\nAlthough the figure now found is smaller than might be expected, still the following points are in favour of its having once occupied one of the niches. It was found in the position indicated by General Cunningham, i.e., amongst the debris at the base of the stupa almost immediately below a niche, and in just the position in which one might expect to find a figure which had been thrown down from the niche and broken by Mahomedan iconoclasts, or hostile Brahmins.\n\nThe stone is of the same description as that with which the other portions of the structure are ornamented. Although the carving on the head and base of the figure is somewhat minute for an ornament to be placed at a height of 24 feet from the ground, still, equally delicate treatment of detail is sometimes met with in similar positions on Buddhist buildings. Again it is not improbable that the head was surrounded by an aureole, which would bring the total height of the carving up to 3\u00bd feet. This added to another foot, the height of the pedestal, (which is still to be seen in position) would bring the sculpture within 1 foot of the top of the niche. At the same time it must be admitted, that the breadth of the figure is hardly in proportion to the size of the niche.\nThe subject is, however, one on which it is hoped that Members of the Society will be able to form an opinion from the information now placed before them.\n\nThe figure has been taken into Benares, and made over to Captain Boileau, R. E., who has been good enough to take charge of it, until the wishes of General Cunningham as to its disposal are known.\n\nIt appears desirable to take advantage of the present opportunity to bring to the notice of the Society, that, unless steps are promptly taken to preserve the outer stone carving of the Dhameh stupa, this unique specimen of ancient Indian art will soon be seriously damaged. When we were at Sarnath, some of the large stones of the well known beautiful tracery appeared to be on the point of falling out.\n\nThe expenditure necessary for saving this portion of the building from ruin would be inconsiderable now. If the stones are once allowed to fall to the ground, the expense, and difficulty of restoration will become enormous.\n\n3. A few Magnetic Elements for Northern India.\u2014By R. S.

S.\n\nPRIONODON MACULOSUS, sp. nov.\n\nAllied to *P. gracilis*, but much larger, and much darker in coloration, the upper parts being blackish brown, broken up into large spots and bands by greyish white lines, whereas in *P. gracilis* the upper parts are pale with black patches. In the latter too the pale rings on the tail are broader than the dark rings, and there is a long white tip, longer than the last dark ring, whereas in *P. maculosus* the reverse is the case, the dark rings being nearly twice as broad as the light. The only other species, *P. pardicolor* of the Himalayas, is much smaller than *P. maculosus*, it has more numerous rings on the tail, and the upper parts are marked with more or less rounded spots.\n\nIn *P. maculosus* there are two broad dark stripes down the back of the neck, divided by a narrow white band, with a faint mesial streak, which becomes a double line of elongate spots between the shoulders. The two dark bands pass into the dark patches of the back; on each side of these bands is a white, rather wavy stripe, commencing at the ear and continued along the neck, over the shoulder, and down the side to the thigh, becoming more irregular behind, beneath this again is a dark band somewhat broken up into spots in front and on the sides. The back is crossed by six transverse white bands, the first five equidistant, the first joining the central neck streak, the hinder all connected with the lateral white band. There are small dark spots on the fore neck forming an imperfect gorget, also spots on the lower portion of the sides and outside of the limbs. On the tail are seven white rings and a very short white tip. Nose and crown dark brown, forehead between the eyes and cheeks light brown, a dark ring round the orbit, with a streak running back to below the eye and another passing up to the crown. Ears rounded, blackish brown outside and near the margin inside, a few long pale hairs on the inner surface of the ear conch; whiskers long, extending to behind the ear, the upper brown, the lower entirely white. Soles, except the pads, covered with fine hair.\n\nFur soft and short, not more than half an inch long on the back, ash grey at the base, black or white at the tip on the upper parts, white throughout below. The following dimensions were taken on an adult male preserved in spirit:\n\n| Description                                      | Inches |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Length from nose to rump over curve of back      | 18\u00b725  |\n| Ditto of tail without the hairs at the end       | 16     |\n| Ditto of hairs at end                            | 0\u00b775   |\n| **Total**                                        | **35** |\nLength of ear from orifice, ......................... 1\u00b705\nDitto of hind foot and tarsus, ....................... 2\u00b78\nDitto of skull, ...................................... 3\u00b7\nBreadth of do. across zygomatic arches, ............ 1\u00b75\n\nTwo specimens have been examined; one a very beautiful skin belonging to Mr. Hume, and collected by Mr. W. Davison at Bankasun in Southern Tenasserim, the other a perfect male in spirit obtained by Mr. Limborg west of Moulmain. Both appear fully adult.\n\n**Sciurus rufigenis**, sp. nov.\n\nThis squirrel is of medium size, the body being nearly equal in length to *S. caniceps* and *S. atridorsalis*, but the tail is much shorter, its length, without including the hairs at the end, being considerably less than that of the head and body. Fur soft throughout, hairs on the tail distinctly distichous.\n\nUpper parts dark olive, grizzled or punctulated, cheeks ferruginous, whiskers black, ears thinly clad, not tufted, a small patch of silky white hairs behind each ear, often concealed by the ear conch, lower parts white, tail hoary above, chestnut below, the hairs above being black with a white ring near the base and a white tip, and ferruginous below, tipped black and white. Throat and chin sometimes slightly marked with rufous. Nose to insertion of tail 8, tail without terminal hairs 6, hind foot 1\u00b78, ear from orifice 0\u00b78. The dimensions were taken by Mr. Davison before skinning.\n\nThe skull, which has a peculiarly elongate nose, much longer and narrower than in the other Tenasserim squirrels, is 2\u00b707 inches long and 1\u00b72 broad across the zygomatic arches.\n\nThis species has only been obtained on the slopes of Mulcyit, a lofty mountain about 60 miles west of Moulmain. Four skins were collected by Mr. Davison and one by Mr. Limborg. All were procured in dense forest, at an elevation of above 5000 feet.\n\nThe reading of the following papers was postponed.\n\n*Notes on the Erratics of the Upper Punjab.\u2014By A. B.

BLANFORD, Esq., F.R.S., President, in the Chair.\n\nThe Minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThe following presentations were announced\u2014\n\n1. From Major-General F. S. Roberts, C.B., V.C., Quarter Master General in India, copies of \"Routes in the Bengal Presidency,\" and \"Routes in Asia, Section I,\" compiled under his directions.\n\n2. From J. W. McCrindle, Esq., M.A., a copy of his work entitled, \"Ancient India, as described by Megasthenes and Arrian; being a translation of the fragments of the Indika of Megasthenes collected by Dr. Schwanbeck, and of the first part of the Indika of Arrian.\"\n\n3. From the Rev. C. H. A. Dall, M.A., \"The Nomenclature in Zoology and Botany,\" by W. H. Dall.\n\n4. From Capt. C. J. F. Forbes, three copies of his pamphlet on the \"Affinities of the Dialects of the Chepang and Kusundah Tribes of Nipal with those of the Hill Tribes of Arracan.\"\n\nThe following gentlemen duly proposed and seconded at the last Meeting were elected Ordinary Members\u2014\n\nW.

Hoey, Esq., C.S.\nBabu Adhar Lal Sen.\n\nThe following are candidates for ballot at the next Meeting\u2014\n\n1. F. R. Mallet, Esq., Assistant Superintendent Geological Survey of India, proposed by W. T. Blanford, Esq., seconded by H. B. Medlicott, Esq.\n2. Alfred Simson, Esq., Calcutta, proposed by Capt. J. Waterhouse, seconded by Dr. D. D. Cunningham.\n\nThe President, in proposing on the part of the Council, a vote of thanks to Sir E. C. Bayley for his long and valuable services to the Society, explained that the reason for this proposition not having been made at the last meeting, was that the Council had hoped Sir E. C. Bayley would be able to retain the chair of the Society until his departure for Europe. It was scarcely necessary, Mr. Blanford said, for him to remind the members of the Asiatic Society of their obligations to their late President. During the period of between 18 and 19 years, since he was elected a member of the Society in 1859, Sir E. C. Bayley had been on the Council for no less than 14 years, he had held the office of President five times, besides being Vice-President for upwards of 3 years, and he has at all times been a most energetic and valuable member of the Society's Council, aiding in its labours, and assisting the other officers with advice, even when absent from Calcutta with the Government. Sir E. C. Bayley's contributions to the Society's publications date back to 1852; since that time notes by him on various numismatical and archaeological subjects have frequently appeared in the Journal and Proceedings, and from his extensive knowledge of early Indian history and his readiness to assist all who were studying the ancient coins, sculptures, and traditions of the country, his share in the researches of the Society has been far greater than would be supposed from a list of his published papers. He has also energetically assisted as a member of the Government of India, in utilizing for the purposes of geographical and biological research the various expeditions sent by the Government into neighbouring little known countries in the course of the last few years. The Society are also greatly indebted to Sir E. C. Bayley for the prominent part he has taken in establishing the Indian Museum, of which he has been a Trustee from the commencement, originally on the part of Government, subsequently as President of the Society, but in both capacities he has been an earnest supporter of the interests both of the Society and of science in India, whilst no one has been a warmer advocate of the Society's claims upon the Government, or has contributed more to the recent improvement in the Society's financial position.\n\nHe would therefore propose the following resolution for adoption by the meeting\u2014\n\n\"Resolved that the Society record their grateful recognition of the eminent services rendered by their late President, the Hon. Sir E. C. Bayley, K. C. S. I., C. I. E., during the long period of his membership of the Society.\"\n\nThe resolution was carried unanimously.\nThe President also stated that the Council recommended that as a mark of the high sense they felt of the services rendered to the Society by Sir Edward Bayley and General Thuillier, those gentlemen should continue to receive the Journals of the Society free of expense.\n\nThe Council further proposed to obtain enlarged permanent photographs of Sir Edward Bayley and General Thuillier, to be placed in the Society's Rooms, and had already taken steps to obtain the negatives for this purpose.\n\nThe President announced that Mr. D. Waldie had been appointed a Member of Council in place of Mr. R. Lydekker, who had unexpectedly been obliged to proceed to England on leave.\n\nThe Secretary read the names of the following gentlemen, appointed by the Council to serve on the several Committees during the ensuing year\u2014\n\n**Sub-Committee of Finance.**\n\nDr. T.

The chief features of the scheme were as follows:\n\n(1.) \"To print uniformly all procurable unprinted lists of the Sanscrit manuscripts in Indian libraries, and to send them to the various learned societies of Europe and to individual scholars in Europe and India, with an intimation that the Government will carefully attend to their suggestions as to which of the manuscripts therein mentioned should be examined, purchased or transcribed;\"\n(2.) \"To institute searches for manuscripts, and to this end to prepare lists of desirable codices, to distribute these lists among scholars and other persons willing to assist in the search, with a request that they will report their discoveries to such officer as may from time to time be appointed by the Government of India, and to depute competent scholars on tours through the several Presidencies and Provinces to examine the manuscripts reported upon, to seek new manuscripts, to purchase manuscripts procurable at reasonable rates, and to have copies made of such manuscripts as are unique or otherwise desirable, but which the possessors refuse to part with;\" and\n\n(3.) \"to grant to the Asiatic Society of Bengal an additional allowance for the publication of Sanscrit works hitherto unprinted.\"\n\nThe statement given in the margin shews the financial result of the scheme, i.e., how the Rs. 24,000 sanctioned as the annual expense for carrying it out are distributed.\n\nThis Resolution was communicated to the several Local Governments and Administrations with instructions as to how to carry out the scheme.\n\nThe instructions were that all procurable unprinted lists of Sanscrit manuscripts in the Native libraries situate within the territories under the respective Local Governments and Administrations should be printed uniformly in octavo in the Nagri character and under the superintendence of a competent editor, such as Babu R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra in Bengal, Mr. Burnell in Madras, and Dr. B\u00fchler in Bombay.\n\nCompetent scholars should, it was said, be sent annually on tours to examine the manuscripts named in the Native catalogues so printed, to seek new manuscripts, to explain to Native scholars at the different\n\n| Tour expense of competent scholar | Purchase of manuscripts | Transcription of manuscripts | Total |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|-------|\n| Rs.                               | Rs.                     | Rs.                        | Rs.   |\n| Bengal, ......................... | 1,000                   | 1,000                      | 3,200 |\n| Bombay, ......................... | 1,000                   | 1,000                      | 3,200 |\n| Madras and Mysore, .............. | 1,000                   | 1,000                      | 3,200 |\n| North-Western Provinces, ....... | 500                     | 500                        | 1,600 |\n| Punjab, ......................... | 500                     | 500                        | 1,600 |\n| Oudh, .......................... | 500                     | 500                        | 1,600 |\n| Central Provinces, ............. | 500                     | 500                        | 1,600 |\n| Rajputana, ...................... | 1,000                   | 1,000                      | 3,200 |\n| Printing Native catalogues of desirable manuscripts, .......... | ..                      | ..                         | 1,000 |\n| Additional grant to Asiatic Society, ...... | ..                      | ..                         | 3,000 |\n| Sundries, ....................... | ..                      | ..                         | 800   |\n|                                  | 6,000                   | 6,000                      | 19,200 |\n|                                  | 24,000                  |                            |       |\nplaces visited the objects and importance of the mission, to purchase such manuscripts as the possessors were willing to sell at a reasonable rate, and to employ copyists to transcribe codices which were unique, extremely old or otherwise desirable, but which the possessors might refuse to part with. The gentlemen sent on tours were to make reports to their respective Local Governments, and such reports to be transmitted to the Government of India in the Home Department; scholars, both in India and in Europe, to be invited to transmit lists of desiderata; those in Europe to be requested to communicate with the Government of India through the Secretary of State, those in India through the Local Governments. From the suggestions so received general lists of desiderata were to be prepared and circulated annually, and the notice of Local Governments and Administrations would be drawn to entries in the catalogues received from them which seemed to refer to any work in the lists of desiderata.\n\nQuarterly lists* of the manuscripts found during the previous quarter were directed to be submitted in the prescribed form to the Government of India in the Home Department.\n\nLocal Governments and Administrations were to use their discretion in purchasing or having copies made of the manuscripts existing within their jurisdiction. Local Governments were however reminded of the desirability of bearing in mind the subjects which European scholars should deem most valuable, and that manuscripts of the Vedas and Ved\u0101ngas and of their commentaries, law books, grammars, vocabularies and philosophical treatises should be regarded as of primary importance. When transcripts were made, these should be in the modern Devan\u0101gari character. Copies of the Sanscrit manuscripts existing in Southern India, if made in the Telugu or other Dravidian character, would be of little use to European Sanscritists and to the large majority of Native scholars.\n\nThese instructions have been carried out as follows:\n\n**Bengal.**\n\nIn Bengal the task of collecting the lists and purchasing and transcribing manuscripts was entrusted to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. Dr. R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra, aided by two Pundits or Sanscrit scholars, has been engaged by the Asiatic Society in carrying out the scheme.\n\nHe has already published twelve pamphlets containing notices of Sanscrit manuscripts extant in Bengal.\n\nHis report dated 15th February 1875, on the operations carried on by him to the close of 1874 for collecting information regarding Sanscrit manuscripts in Native libraries, is very interesting.\n\n* These lists are now annually prepared.\nRAJPUTANA.\n\nThe Governor-General's Agent at Rajputana has not reported what progress had been made in acquiring Sanscrit manuscripts in the Native States under him up to the end of 1875. He simply submitted copy of a memorandum by Dr. G. B\u00fchler, Educational Inspector in the Bombay Presidency, on the catalogue of Sanscrit manuscripts in the library of the Maharajah of Bikaneer, compiled by Hurrish Chunder Shastri, which had been bought for Rs. 1,000.\n\nThe Governor-General's Agent stated that the materials collected by the Shastri might be sent to Calcutta, where a competent person could be found to abstract and arrange them under supervision. He suggested that Mr. C. Tawney might be willing to receive charge of the documents and to direct their arrangement.\n\nDr. B\u00fchler stated that he had examined both the library and the Shastri's work, and expressed his opinion that the latter might be used as a basis for a really useful catalogue fit for publication. He observed that the library of the Maharajah contained in all about 1,400 manuscripts. Hurrish Chunder had prepared a large voluminous compilation giving a catalogue with abstract of contents of 1,200 works. He added that to print this compilation would be very expensive and nearly useless. He suggested that a short abstract of it be made in which the books should be arranged under each Shastra in alphabetical order. The Shastri was prevented by death from preparing abstracts of the remaining 200 works.\n\nThe Government of Bengal was asked whether they could recommend any one else who would undertake to bring out the work within a reasonable time and on what terms, it being understood that Mr. Tawney was then in Europe.\n\nOn 17th August 1876, the Government of Bengal replied that either Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra or the Reverend Dr. K. M. Banerjea might be relied on as being competent to perform the work in a thoroughly efficient manner. Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra roughly estimated the cost of bringing out the catalogue at about Rs. 5,000. Dr. K. M. Banerjea observed that he could not himself give an opinion as to the amount of remuneration till he saw the materials he had to deal with.\n\nThe Governor-General in Council has been pleased to entrust the work to Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra.\n\nDr. B\u00fchler, it appears, was engaged in exploring Sanscrit manuscripts in Jeypur and Ujjain. The Governor-General's Agent does not report the result of the investigations carried on by Dr. B\u00fchler in those places.\n\nNo report has yet been received from the Punjab.\nThe Governor-General in Council expresses his highest satisfaction at what has already been effected, especially by Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra in Bengal, by Drs. B\u00fchler and Kielhorn in Bombay, and by Mr. Griffith in the North-Western Provinces. His Excellency in Council regrets that no report has yet been received of what has been done in the Punjab, where there would appear to be an unusually good field for research with such places as Amritsar, Thanesar, to which may be added Rajaor, Kashmir and Jamu. There can be little doubt that valuable results would be gained, and the Government of India trust that His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor will succeed in finding some person at Lahore or elsewhere who is competent and willing to undertake the work.\n\nThe general results which have been obtained are, in the opinion of the Government of India, such as to warrant the prosecution of the search, but the reports received from the several Local Governments and Administrations appear to His Excellency in Council to point to the desirability of re-distributing the work; and in this view the following arrangements have been suggested as appropriate:\n\n(a) that Rajputana, Central India and the Central Provinces should be attached to the Bombay Circle;\n(b) that Mysore and Coorg should be attached to the Madras Circle; and\n(c) that the North-Western Provinces and Oudh should be amalgamated into one circle, and that the work should be entrusted to one officer, or in the event of its being impossible to find such an officer that both the North-Western Provinces and Oudh should be joined to the Bengal Circle, the grant for that circle being proportionately raised.\n\nThe Governor-General in Council desires to be furnished with the opinion of the several Local Governments and Administrations as to the suitability of the re-distribution thus proposed, and to suggest that the existing list of Sanscrit manuscripts should be re-examined by some one competent, and asks, with the view of ascertaining how far it may be worth while to acquire by purchase, where possible, or to secure copies of manuscripts known to exist, that steps be taken accordingly.\n\nHis Excellency in Council further desires that the Resolution may be circulated as widely as possible, and that Sanscrit scholars may be invited to make suggestions to indicate desiderata for which it may be deemed expedient to make special search.\n\nThe Secretary reported that the Society had been invited by the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences to send a representative to be present at the celebration of the first centenary anniversary of that Society to take place on the 24th April next.\nThe Council regretted that they were unable to send a member of their body to represent the Society, but had expressed their thanks and congratulations.\n\nThe President read the following extract from a letter which he had received from Lieutenant F. W. Jarrad, R. N., regarding future deep-sea dredging operations:\n\n\"Have you heard officially of the successful issue of the Asiatic Society's application to Government regarding deep-sea sounding &c.?\n\n\"While I was in England, I drew up a Memorandum on the subject, and after consulting with several of the staff of the 'Challenger,' sent to the India Office a complete list of the sounding and dredging gear required, and also pointed out those which could be obtained from the Admiralty. The Hydrographer of the Admiralty had informed me that he would be able to let us have single specimens of most of the special appliances used, so that the Society's suggestion that these should be obtained to be used as patterns from which others might be made in India, has been carried out.\n\n\"Sir Wyville Thomson also kindly showed me all the 'Challenger' collection and explained his mode of treating them, as also the best conditions under which good results were to be obtained, and gave me a mass of information on the subject which will be most useful when we start work. He also drew up a memorandum pointing out the sections which in his opinion would be most usefully carried from several points in the Indian Ocean, and the value of such an examination, in detail, as we should be able to carry out. Besides this he has drawn up some instructions for the use of the Naturalist, and has given us the benefit of all the experience he gained during the 'Challenger's' cruise.\n\n\"Our vessel is now ordered to be built in Bombay, and I think there will be no further delay. I have just received orders to go to Bombay whenever I think it necessary, to supervise her construction, and I should think we are certain to have her ready for sea by March or April 1879.\n\n\"Before that date, will you call a meeting at the Society's Rooms, of the Natural History Committee, to consider the subject and draw up some definite plan both as regards the work to be done, the order in which it should be done and the method of dealing with the specimens, (that is by whom should they be worked up). I think this is necessary, or perhaps there will be some misunderstanding afterwards. Of course the specimens should be deposited in the Museum at Calcutta, after they have been described. Preliminary papers might be written after every working season, giving a general description of what had been done, for I presume it would take a considerable time to work up thoroughly each season's specimens.\"\n\"I should consider the serial temperature observations my particular work. What a chance we have in the Indian Ocean to work out the question of Ocean circulation; being closed to the north it offers exceptional advantages for the study of this subject, and in it I take the greatest interest.\n\n\"I think the views of the Society on the method of carrying on these investigations should be submitted to Government and orders passed on them.\"\n\nThe Secretary announced that Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra had prepared an Index to the Sanscrit works named in Rev. S. Beale's Buddhist Tripi-taka, and that copies were available for distribution to Members.\n\nDr. Brandis exhibited a series of specimens of timbers from different provinces of India, and explained that large collections had been made for the Paris Exhibition, which had been despatched some time ago, and that from the material which had been brought together for that purpose, a number of sets of specimens had been prepared for institutions in England, in America, on the Continent of Europe and in India.\n\nHe drew attention to the great variety of trees and shrubs found in India, the number of which he estimated at 4,000 species, one-half of which are trees. Assuming the number of Phanerogamous plants in India to be 12,000, this would give $33\\frac{1}{3}$ per cent. of woody to Phanerogamous plants. In Great Britain the indigenous trees and shrubs number 163, on a total of phanerogamous plants of 1784, or 9 per cent. In the northern part of the United States the woody plants form 16 and in Japan 25 per cent. of the entire phanerogamous vegetation. In purely tropical countries, the proportion of woody among phanerogamous plants varies from 50 to 70 per cent.\n\nOne half of India is outside the tropics, a large area on the Himalaya belongs to the temperate zone, and besides this there are extensive forests which consist of one or a few species of gregarious trees; for instance the forests of Sal (Shorea robusta), the extensive and nearly useless forests of S\u00e1li (Boswellia thurifera) on the trap hills of the Satpura range, the forests of Anjun (Hardwickia binata) which are common on certain classes of soil in many parts of the Dekkan and Central India, the Babool (Acacia arabica) forests of Sind and the Dekkan, the Prosopis forests on the high ground between the Punjab rivers, and the Dipterocarpus forests of Burma. All these gregarious forests contribute to reduce the proportion of species among trees and shrubs in the tropical and sub-tropical parts of India.\nNevertheless, even with only 33 per cent. of woody plants, the variety of trees is very great, many are not yet known even to botanists, and it is remarkable how small the number of trees is, the timber of which is an article of trade in and beyond India, and of general consumption. The number of these scarcely exceeds one hundred.\n\nThe useful timbers of India may be arranged in three great classes. The first class comprises those timbers which are durable, which season well, which are strong and handsome, and yet are not too heavy or too hard. To these belong Teak, Sis\u00fa, Blackwood, Deodar, Padouk, and others. It will be readily understood that the woods of this class are the most valuable. It is not likely that any important additions will be made to the woods of this class.\n\nTo the second class belong S\u00e1l, S\u00fandri, Pynkadoe, Kusum, the Oaks, and many others. These woods are mostly durable, many of them are very handsome, but they are all exceedingly hard and heavy, they are difficult to work and their carriage is expensive. The number of the woods which may be placed under this class is very large, and if there were a demand for them, their number might be increased indefinitely, but there is no demand and it is not likely to spring up.\n\nThe third class consists of light woods, which are not hard and are easy to work. They are not as a rule durable, or strong, but many of them are handsome and useful furniture woods. Toon (Cedrela Toona) Gambhar (Gmelina arborea), Mulberry, Walnut are representatives of this class which is capable of indefinite extension. A Burmese wood, Thitka (Pentace burmanica), now a regular article of trade, was unknown before 1860. A number of woods of this class have of late years come into notice as useful for tea-boxes, and many valuable furniture woods may be added to it.\n\nBesides these three chief classes, there are woods valuable for special purposes, such as Sandal, Box-wood and Ebony. The Indian supply of Box-wood is small, and much attention has been paid to the discovery of a substitute. Some species of Gardenia, particularly Gardenia latifolia, may perhaps eventually take the place of Box-wood, but none has as yet been taken up by the trade.\n\nSome remarks regarding the structure of timbers, closed the communication.\n\nThe President said that the Members of the Society present at the Meeting were greatly indebted to Dr. Brandis for the opportunity he had afforded them of seeing the superb collection of specimens illustrative of the various kinds of wood obtained in Indian forests, and for the interesting remarks they had just heard. Nothing could better illustrate the\nimportance of the Forest Department in India, or the wealth of the country in natural products.\n\nIn the absence of Mr. Blochmann, Capt. Waterhouse exhibited a Persian MS. and read the following note by Mr. Blochmann regarding it.\n\n\"The MS. contains the poetical works of a Dihli poet of the name of M\u00edr Qamar-uddin, poetically styled 'Minnat.' Warren Hastings conferred on him the title of 'Poet laureate.'\n\n\"Minnat died at Calcutta in 1793 A.D. He left numerous poems and several works on general literature. Among the poems are several well-known odes; one in praise of the Niz\u00e1m of Haid\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1d, for which he received a present of Rs. 5,000; and two odes on Warren Hastings and Mr. Richard Johnson. The MS. exhibited belonged to Amjad Ali, King of Lucknow, whose stamp it bears, and may be some 80 years old. Among the illuminations are two portraits, one of Warren Hastings and the other of Richard Johnson. Although the portraits are not very excellent specimens of native painting, the likeness of Warren Hastings is very good.\"\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. Stray Aryans in Tibet.\u2014By R. B. Shaw, Esq., C. I. E.\n   Political Agent.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper describes a small tribe of Aryan race, which is wedged in among the Tibetan populations of the Upper Indus, presenting to the student of early institutions the interesting sight of pure Aryans isolated in the semi-barbarous stage and practically unaffected by any of the great religions. Their origin is traced back to D\u00e1rdist\u00e1n (the ancient Bolor) which they must have left before the mass of the D\u00e1rd became Musalmans. Their religion is local-demon worship; their domestic institutions are polyandrous; they are divided into three castes: priests, husbandmen, and artisans; and they preserve themselves strictly from intermarriage with the neighbouring races. They carry to an excess the D\u00e1rd peculiarity of abhorrence of the cow, so unlike the feelings of their Hindu brethren.\n\nThe paper will be published in Part I of the Journal.\n\nThe President said that the paper just read raised several points of extreme interest; one, with which he had been especially struck, was the extraordinary disproportion of the sexes in this curious tribe, and it was difficult to understand why there should be so much fewer women than men. It would be very desirable to ascertain some statistics of the births, and as the people appeared willing to communicate particulars concerning themselves, this might possibly be ascertained.\n2. Remarks regarding the H\u00e6matozoa found in the Stomach of Culex Mosquito.\u2014By T. R. Lewis, M. B.\n\nThe paragraphs which have latterly appeared in Indian newspapers to the effect that it had been definitely ascertained that the cause of 'Elephantiasis' is communicated to man by means of the Mosquito have been very generally commented upon, and it has been suggested to me that a few words as to what is definitely known of the circumstances upon which the statement is based might prove of interest to the Society. Indirectly I am perhaps to some extent responsible for there having been grounds for such a view being advanced at all, as some five years ago, I drew attention to the circumstance that the blood of persons suffering from certain classes of disease in this country was infected by numerous minute nematoid parasites, each about one-hundredth of an inch in length and about the width of a red blood-corpuscle; and that all that was necessary for the demonstration of their existence in the circulation of persons so affected was to prick any part of the body with a needle, and to transfer the drop of blood thus obtained to the stage of a microscope.\n\nOne of the diseases with which these h\u00e6matozoa were found to be associated was a form of Elephantiasis, not, however, necessarily associated with what is known as 'elephant leg', though both forms were frequently combined in the same person\u2014a circumstance which has given rise to some confusion in pathological discussions.*\n\nThese parasites, or at least a very closely allied species, have now been detected in the blood of persons in various parts of the world\u2014notably by Dr. Sonsino in Egypt, by Dr. Bancroft in Australia, and by Dr. Patrick Manson in China. Dr. Manson has, moreover, made the extremely interesting discovery that embryo-h\u00e6matozoa may be detected in the stomachs of mosquitoes which have been caught preying on the bodies of persons in whose circulation these parasites exist. I had repeatedly examined, in a cursory fashion, these and other suctorial insects, but had not observed any parasites suggestive of these embryo-h\u00e6matozoa, hence, when, on receipt of a communication from Dr. Manson a couple of months ago, a renewed search was made, I was surprised to find that four out of eight mosquitoes, captured at random in one of the servants' houses, harboured specimens of h\u00e6matozoa to all appearances identical with those found in man in this country. After this, however, several days elapsed before any mosquitoes could be obtained which contained these embryo-nematoids, and the\n\n* As this is purely a matter of professional interest it need not be specially referred to here: the disease in question has been carefully described by Dr. Vandyke Carter, Sir Joseph Fayrer, Dr. Kenneth McLeod and other writers, and has received various designations, e.g., Elephantiasis lymphangiectodes, Naivoid elephantiasis; Lymph-scrotum; Varix lymphaticus, &c.\nspecimens obtained on the next occasion were devoid of the enveloping sheath, which appears to characterise the kind found in man out here, and apparently, according to Dr. Manson, in China also.\n\nDr. Spencer Cobbold, F. R. S., the well known helminthologist, has drawn prominent attention to Dr. Manson's observations in a recent number of the 'Lancet' [12th January], and states his conviction that the Culex mosquito is the intermediary host of the *Filaria sanguinis-hominis*\u2014the name by which the h\u00e6matozoon affecting man is known\u2014and that residence in this insect is necessary for the completion of the filaria life-cycle; hence the association of the mosquito with elephantoid forms of disease. These circumstances made it therefore a matter of some interest to endeavour to learn whether enquiries of a like kind in India would prove equally conclusive in showing that one of the commonest of tropical and sub-tropical insects acted as a disseminator of blood parasites in man, and steps were taken to ascertain whether it could be shown definitely in this country also that the particular worms in question underwent undoubted developmental changes in the stomach of the mosquito.\n\nOn a future occasion I hope to give a detailed account of these observations; but, perhaps, it may be deemed sufficient on the present occasion to give in a few words the general results of the experiments so far as they have been proceeded with. Notes have not been made of all the insects examined, but out of 140 female mosquitoes [as is well known, it is the female and not male which preys on our capillary circulation] regarding the examination of which record has been kept, 20 were found to contain h\u00e6matozoa mixed with the ingesta in the alimentary tube\u2014i.e., equal to about 14 per cent. The method adopted has been to collect groups of insects daily and to set them aside for subsequent observation, a few living specimens of each group being examined at stated intervals. The alimentary canal with its contents was removed from the other tissues and the examinations conducted separately so as to avoid, as far as possible, the risk of confounding any developmental changes which might occur in the blood parasites with other parasites which might also be harboured by the insect, for mosquitoes like other insects occasionally harbour different kinds\u2014three or four, what appear to me to be different varieties, have been met with in the course of these examinations. It is of prime importance in enquiries of this kind to be guarded in concluding that because two or more parasites may be associated they are genetically connected; on the other hand it must not be forgotten that it has often happened that parasites have been classified as distinct which should have been described as different stages in the development of the same animalcule.\n\nWhen the insect is caught shortly after feeding and the contents of its stomach examined microscopically, the h\u00e6matozoa, if present, will be\nobserved to manifest very active movements which may possibly continue for several hours on the slide. If the insect be kept for 24 hours before examination it is probable that the movements of the parasites will be more sluggish, and their form probably altered owing to irregular contractions and dilatations of their substance\u2014changes which may also occasionally be observed when embryo-haematozoa are preserved on a glass slide, and they may sometimes be kept alive thus, if in suitable media, for two or three days. When the insect is not examined till the third day, the contained parasites will probably manifest marked signs of disintegration\u2014and possibly every indication of life will have disappeared from many of the specimens.\n\nAfter the third or fourth day I have not seen any active specimens of these entozoa in the stomach or in any part of the alimentary canal of the mosquito, those which remain have undergone more or less fatty degeneration, are readily stained with eosin, which, as far as my experience goes, is not the case so long as they are alive and active. After the fourth or fifth day it is very rare that traces of any haematozoa-like objects can be detected at all, so that it must be inferred either that they have succumbed to the digestive action of the insect's stomach,* or been disposed of along with the excreta. It will of course be understood that these remarks refer solely to the results of personal observations which have up to the present time been made in India\u2014it is quite possible that a more extended knowledge of the subject may modify the conclusions which at present it seems natural to draw. In the meantime I cannot say as a result of direct observation that the mosquito serves as the intermediary host to the development of the *Filaria sanguinis-hominis* or other nematoid haematozoon.\n\nIt may further be remarked that it would seem that in this country the mosquito obtains its haematozoa in great part from pariah dogs; the blood of fully one-third of which, as I had occasion to point out a few years ago, is infested with microscopic parasites closely resembling those found in man.\n\n[Addendum:\u2014A few days after the Meeting an incident occurred which materially aided in elucidating this matter. It was observed that nearly all the mosquitoes captured in one of the servants' houses contained haematozoa, so that the supply of suitable insects in all the stages of their growth became amply sufficient for all requirements. The result of the\n\n---\n\n* Leuckart mentions that a similar result was observed by Fedschenko to follow the ingestion of dracunculus-embryos in the stomach of the Cyclops. The latter is believed to serve as an intermediary host for the development of the Guinea-worm\u2014the embryos, however, gain access to the body of the Cyclops by piercing the cuticle. When the embryos are swallowed they are digested.\nexaminations under these favourable conditions has shown that although the stomach digests a great number of the ingested h\u00e6matozoa, as mentioned above, nevertheless others actually perforate the walls of the insect's stomach, pass out, and then undergo developmental stages in its thoracic and abdominal tissues. Although I cannot say as a result of actual observation that the links connecting the various earlier phases of the development are complete, nevertheless they appear so near to being so that it may, I think, be confidently anticipated that observers in this country will soon be able conclusively to satisfy themselves that, in most particulars at least, Dr. Manson's valuable observations apply to India as well as to China.\n\nWith regard, however, to the inference that the mosquito is the particular intermediary host of nematoid h\u00e6matozoa, it cannot be said that even these later observations are sufficiently conclusive to warrant a positive statement being made at present, for, though assuming that of the various parasitic forms which have been seen, several are actually transitional stages in the development of one and the same entozoon, it is to be noted that even the most advanced stage hitherto observed is still a very immature one\u2014no trace of reproductive organs, for example, being distinguishable; and every attempt hitherto made by myself to obtain a more advanced condition has proved unsuccessful. Further observation, however, may overcome or explain this want of success.\n\nIt should be added that the blood of one of the five persons who were in the habit of sleeping in the house in which these particular insects were captured, was found to contain h\u00e6matozoa in considerable numbers. T.R.L.]\n\nDr. McLeod observed that the subject of Dr. Lewis's paper was one of very deep interest, inasmuch as the diseases attributed to, or associated with the presence of, immature filariae in the blood are very serious, and, if the mosquito is the agent of their dissemination, everybody living in countries infested by mosquitos, is more or less liable to them. The theory of the mosquito being an intermediary agent of the development of Filaria sanguinis-hominis has been laid down in very plain and positive terms. It is satisfactory to find that, so far as observations made in India have hitherto gone, instead of undergoing development in the mosquito's stomach, these h\u00e6matozoa undergo digestion. The only weak point which occurred to him in Dr. Lewis's observations was that the animals were kept for observation in more or less artificial conditions, and not allowed access to water, which is alleged to be an important medium of the development of these filariae.\n\nThere is no question now that these animals exist in the mature state in the human tissues and in the immature state in human blood. How they gain access to the body originally is unknown. Given the mature\nworm in the tissues, there is no difficulty in accounting for the immature progeny in the blood, but whence comes the parent? This remains to be discovered. The subject is still very obscure. It is, for example, by no means certain that h\u00e6matozoa exist or have existed in every case of elephantiasis, or that there is a causal relation between the two phenomena, at any rate as regards the most common form of elephantiasis. Dr. Lewis, who has already done such good original work in this field, will no doubt add much to our information on the subject.\n\n3. On some Mammals from Tenasserim.\u2014By W. T. Blanford, F. R. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe animals noticed in the present paper are from two collections, one made by Mr. W. Davison for Mr. Hume, to whom the writer is indebted for a very valuable series of skins, the other made by Mr. Limborg.\n\nThe localities, sexes, and, in many cases, the measurements taken on the animal when freshly killed have been carefully recorded. The following mammals, not previously known to occur in British territory, have been added to the Tenasserim fauna, Gymnura Rafflesii, the Malayan form of Martes flavigula and Tragulus napu. It is shewn that the first named, however, differs from the descriptions hitherto given in having non-retractile claws, and this may indicate that the Tenasserim animal is distinct, but it agrees in all other respects so well with the Malayan form, that a difference of this importance is improbable. Some peculiar imbricate scales below the tail are also noticed, and a few details of the animal's habits from Mr. Davison's notes.\n\nBesides the species mentioned full descriptions are given of Prionodon maculatus and Sciurus rufifrons, already described at the February meeting, and notes are added upon Tupaiia Peguana, Sciurus atridorsalis, S. Phayrei, S. coniceps, S. Mouhoti, shewn to be possibly distinct from S. Berdmorei, or if not distinct a very marked variety, not previously recorded from Tenasserim, S. Barbei, Pteromys cineraceus. A variety of Rhizomys castaneus, and Mus robustulus.\n\nThe paper will be published in Part II of the Journal.\n\n4. On a Copper-plate Grant from Banda.\u2014By Dr. Rajendralala Mitra, Rai Bahadur, C. I. E.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe deed of grant was originally inscribed on two copper-plates, one of which is lost. The one remaining comprises the whole of the deed except a few imprecatory verses. It is dated Samvat 1191 = A.D. 1135, and records the grant of \"ten ploughs\" of land to a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a by\nMadanavarma Deva of the K\u00e1linjer dynasty. The author of the paper, when he noticed the Khajraha Inscription of Dh\u00e1nga in 1866, calculated the date of Madanavarma to be 1150, but then he had to deal with a name\u2014that of Sallakshnavarma\u2014which stood in the place of the grandfather of Madanavarma, and assigning him an average reign of 16 years, he had to remove the last prince by the same number of years. This name, however, now appears to be an alias of Kirtivarma, the real grandfather, and omitting the period assigned to him, the chronology is now established on a sure foundation. As far as is yet discovered, the dynasty comprises fifteen generations, of which the dates of three have been taken from dated inscriptions, and the rest inferred by casting averages.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n5. On the representation of Foreigners in the Ajant\u00e1 Frescoes.\u2014By Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra, R\u00e1\u00ed Bah\u00e1dur, C. I. E.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nAfter pointing out the history of the enquiries made from time to time into the archaeology of the Caves of Ajant\u00e1, the author dwells upon six fresco paintings in Cave No. I. One of these, representing a court scene, he points out, shows several figures of ancient Persians. The complexion, the features, the long sugar-loaf hats, and the long coats of these figures are, he thinks, characteristic of the Persians, and could not be attributed to any other nationality of ancient times. In four other plates, there are representations of stout, burly, square-faced people of fair complexion and very peculiar turbans or hats, very like the Kilpaks of the modern Central Asiatics. These can be either Afghans or Bactrians, the author is disposed to take them for the latter. Two peculiarities in the dress of these are specially noticed; one is the use of striped stockings, and the other of patch-work embroidery. The Afghans and the Jews in the present day excel in the art of patch-work embroidery, but the cast of the face is so unlike that of the Jews, that the figure wearing such decorations cannot be assigned to the Hebrew race, and the alternative is therefore left between Afghans and Bactrians. For historical reasons the author doubts their being Scythians. In another plate is noticed the use of a short jacket of flowered muslin, very like the mirjai of the modern Indians. Mention is, likewise, made of some figures which have the characteristic thick lips and chubby nose of the Negroes.\n\nThe paper will be published in Part I of the Journal.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in February last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS, AND JOURNALS,\npresented by their respective Societies or Editors.\n\nBombay.

They belong to the same group which Capt. Latter described as the \"Symbolical Coins of Arracan.\" (Journal, A. S. B., Vol. XV, p. 238), and Capt. Fryer as of the Vaisali dynasty of Arracan (Journal, A. S. B., Vol. XLI, p. 203). Captain Fryer's coin, however, has the Sivite emblem of the Bull, whereas the new ones bear the Vaishnavite Conch-shell. The symbols, however, are not very decisive indications of the faith of those who struck them. The Conch-shell is as largely used by the Buddhists as the Vaishnavas, and the most prominent mark on the foot-prints of Buddha is a Conch-shell. The Bull is seen on many old Buddhist coins. Capt. Latter's coins have inscriptions, but those received from Mr. Hardinge have none, and this want prevents me from attributing them to their owners. This much, however, may be unhesita-\"\ntingly said that the coins belong to the mintage of the Arracan kings, and they were all Buddhists. Of the three names given by Fryer the last (c) has been incorrectly read by B\u00e1bu Prat\u00e1pa Chandra Ghosha. It is unmistakeably Sri Vijaya, and not Sri Vikrama. None of the names, however, occur in Mr. Paton's list of Arracan kings published in the sixteenth volume of the Researches.\n\nMr. Blochmann also read the following extract from a letter from Dr. Mitra announcing the discovery of a new Era:\n\n\"I have made a grand discovery, nothing less than a new era\u2014that of Lakshmana Sena. It is still current among the Pandits of Tih\u00fat. My travelling pandit, now at Darbhanga, is collecting information on the subject. It will settle the age of the Senas beyond all cavil, upsetting at the same time Cunningham's date of the P\u00e1la kings of Bengal.\"\n\nMr. H. F. Blanford exhibited two autographic records of recent Nor'-Wester storms which occurred on March 8th and 14th; the one accompanied by a slight fall of rain, the other without rain. The records consisted of the photographic traces of the barograph, and the dry and wet bulb thermometers; the direction and movement of the wind, registered by a Beckley's anemograph; and the trace of Beckley's hyetograph showing the rainfall. As all the traces are continuous they shew all the changes that took place during the storms and afford the means of correlating these with each other.\n\nThe two sets of traces agreed in many points. In both the evenly-waved line which marked the diurnal barometric tides, was suddenly interrupted just before the storm by an abrupt rise of pressure. This was followed in both by a rapid veering of the wind from S. S. W. to West in one case, and through West and North to East in the other, and a considerable increase in its velocity; and in both storms also by an abrupt fall of the wet-bulb thermometer through several degrees (16\u00b0 in the rainless, and 9\u00b0 in the rainy storm). But, whereas in the rainy storm the dry-bulb thermometer also fell through 8\u00b0, in the rainless storm it rose as abruptly through 4\u00bd\u00b0, this change, be it observed, occurring at 10 p.m. At the temperatures observed these changes in the rainless storm of the 14th March, indicate a fall in the humidity of the air from 83 to 34 per cent., the whole of which was accomplished in half an hour, the greater part indeed within about 10 minutes.\n\nThe rise of temperature in a storm which is accompanied by little or no rain, though rare, is not now recorded for the first time. A similar occurrence took place at Calcutta on the 20th May 1870, between 7 and 10 p.m., and was described by Col. Tennant in the Proceedings of the London\nMeteorological Society, Vol. V, p. 213. On this latter occasion some rain fell in the earlier part of the storm, and before it had quite cooled was accompanied by a distinctly hot and dry wind, which lasted, however, only for a short time, and was followed, as is usual in Nor'-Westers, by a calm.\n\nMr. Blanford said that having regard to all the circumstances of these storms, he could not regard the rise of temperature as due to the influx of a hot surface-wind, but considered it more probable that it was a case of dynamic heating. As Mr. Phear had pointed out at a former meeting of the Society, the strong gusty wind of a Nor'-Wester is probably a portion of the upper Westerly current that strikes down to the earth. Such a mass of air in descending must, according to thermo-dynamic laws, develop $1^\\circ$ of temperature for each 183 feet through which it descends. In rainy storms this heat is probably used up in great part in the evaporation of the accompanying rain, but in storms in which little or no rain occurs during the descent, a part of this heat is retained and causes a rise of the thermometer and a great fall in the humidity of the air.\n\nMr. H. F. Blanford also exhibited a series of the charts now drawn up in the Meteorological Office, which show the distribution of pressure and temperature, the wind direction and the rainfall at 10 p.m. daily for the whole of India. The two former elements are shown by blue and red lines which respectively represent the isobars for each twentieth of an inch and the isotherms for each $5^\\circ$ of temperature. The series began with October last, and as yet it would be premature to attempt to generalize on the facts they exhibit, but he drew attention to one or two cases of rainfall during the cold weather months, and contrasted them with the charts exhibited on a former occasion, which had been specially drawn up to show the state of things that accompanied the rainfall of the S.W. monsoon. These latter showed that during the S.W. monsoon, barometric minima or cyclones (not of a violent character) were successively formed either in the N.W. corner of Bengal, or over Orissa and the country to the westward, and, in 1875, moved northward or north-westward, carrying the rain with them to the Gangetic valley and the Central and Upper Provinces. During the season of 1877 they had not followed this latter course, but in many cases had moved towards the north-east, whence the almost entire failure of the rainfall in the N.W. Provinces.\n\nIn the cold weather months, again, the state of things was different. There was a constant tendency to a high pressure in the lower Indus valley; but to a frequent recurrence of low-pressure areas in the Punjab, where it appeared that the rain first fell. This fall was followed by a strong cool current from the North-West, and the rainfall area then receded down the Gangetic valley and in some cases reached Lower Bengal.\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. **A Legend regarding the origin of the name Chh\u00e1y\u00e1pati or \"Lord of the Shadows,\" a small T\u00e1lug in Pargana Hogl\u00e1, Zil\u00e1 Jessore.\u2014By H. James Rainey.**\n\nTo any one acquainted with the vernacular language of Lower Bengal, the designation Chh\u00e1y\u00e1pati is sufficiently striking to awaken curiosity regarding its origin, as it signifies \"Lord of the Shadow,\" from chh\u00e1y\u00e1 (\u091b\u093e\u092f\u093e), \"Shadow,\" and pati (\u092a\u0924\u093f), \"Lord.\" Finding it among the names of one of the minor t\u00e1lugs in my family zamindaris situate in Pargan\u00e1 Hogl\u00e1, I naturally enquired about it, but for some time was unable to obtain any specific information regarding it. At last the following precise account of the derivation was narrated to me by an aged Br\u00e1hman, and, I think, it may be fairly presumed to be substantially correct.\n\nAn ancestor of the present owners of the t\u00e1lug, a high caste Br\u00e1hman famed for his piety, became a defaulter of rent of his holding, and the zamin-d\u00e1r being unable to realize it, despatched him with others in a like position, as usual in such cases, to the Court of the Naw\u00e1b, then held in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d. The defaulters being brought before the Naw\u00e1b, various punishments, more or less severe, were imposed on them, to compel them, if possible, to discharge the arrears of rent due by them. That allotted to the Br\u00e1hman, was, that his head should be shaved, well smeared with oil, and exposed to the full blaze of the sun. The Naw\u00e1b looked calmly on as the unfortunate Br\u00e1hman was placed in the centre of the Court-yard, when, suddenly, a dense cloud passed over the face of the sun, and it was thoroughly obscured, leaving him perfectly in the shade. The reputation acquired by the aged Br\u00e1hman for austere devotion and sanctity being well known to the assembly, the by-standers exclaimed \"a miracle! a miracle!\" The Naw\u00e1b immediately ordered the release of the Br\u00e1hman, and granted to him his holding at a nominal rental. And, in order to commemorate what he deemed to be nothing less than a miraculous event, he changed the name of the tenure to Chh\u00e1y\u00e1-pati, which it has retained ever since. The former name of the place is not known.\n\nThe event here related is said to have occurred some time before the British assumed the Government of the country, about a century and a half ago.\n\n2. **An Account of the Tidal Observations in the Gulf of Cutch conducted by the Great Trigonometrical Survey under the superintendence of Colonel J. T. Walker, C. B., R. E., during the years 1873-74-75. Compiled from the G. T. Survey Reports by Captain J. Waterhouse, Assistant Surveyor General.**\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper contains an account of the operations connected with, and the final results of, the first series of Tidal observations made, in seasons 1873-74 and 1874-75, by a party of the Great Trigonometrical Survey under Capt. A. W. Baird, R. E., with the primary object of determining the existing relations between the level of the land and the sea at certain points on the coasts of the Gulf of Cutch, as a first step towards investigating the question whether progressive changes are taking place in the level of the land at the head of the Gulf, as has long been supposed to be the case.\n\nThe paper will be published in full in the Journal, Part II.\n\nColonel Walker observed that the reduction of tidal observations is a very laborious matter, but that when once the values of the two constants\u2014the amplitude and the epoch\u2014have been determined for each of the several hypothetical tides and their sub-tides, the varying height of the surface of the ocean, from hour to hour and from day to day, may be graphically represented, with great facility and rapidity, by an instrument recently invented by Sir William Thomson, which is at present in the collection of scientific instruments at South Kensington.\n\nHe showed that any one of the constituent tides might be graphically represented by the action on a rotating cylinder\u2014such as the barrel of an ordinary self-registering instrument\u2014of a pencil connected with a point in the circumference of a revolving wheel. When the wheel is suspended vertically and the pencil is held in a vertical groove, so as to be free to move up and down against the barrel, the pencil is made by its connection with the point on the wheel to travel backwards and forwards through a distance equal to the diameter of the wheel, and it thus describes, on the surface of the rotating barrel, a curve of which the ordinates are equal to the height of the point above the centre of the wheel at any moment, while the absciss\u00e6 denote the times corresponding to the heights. Just as a single tide can thus be graphically delineated, so may the resultant of a large number of tides be represented. In Sir Wm. Thomson's machine, as many wheels as there are tides are constructed, the radius of each wheel being made to correspond with the amplitude of the tide it has to represent; the wheels are centered to a vertical frame, half of them above and the other half below an axle by which each wheel is driven and caused to revolve on its axis with a velocity corresponding to that of its tide. To the circumference of each wheel a stud is attached at a point corresponding to the epoch of the tide. A silk-en thread is fastened to the stud of the wheel most distant from the pencil in the upper row, it is then brought down and passed round the stud of the wheel immediately below, then carried up to and over that of the next wheel above, and so on until, eventually, after having been passed round\nthe stud of each wheel in succession, it is fastened to the recording pencil. The curve traced by the pencil now represents the aggregate result of all the component tides corresponding to the several wheels, that is to say, it represents the momentarily varying level of the surface of the ocean at the station where the observations were taken. Though the ordinary motion of the pencil is up and down, there is an arrangement by which the pencil is slightly jerked to one side after a certain number of revolutions of the driving axle; this is done to mark the successive hours on the curves. At spring tides the range between high and low water is considerable and the hour-marks are far apart; while at neap tides the range is much less and the hour-marks are correspondingly closer.\n\nOne of the great advantages of this instrument is that with its aid the sea-surface curves for an entire year can be drawn in about three hours; while a skilful computer would probably take a month to obtain the same results by calculation. A new instrument of this kind is now being constructed in England with all Sir William Thomson's latest improvements, for the use of the Survey Department, and it will be of great value and assistance in the preparation of Tidal Tables for the several Indian ports, a duty which the Government have lately imposed on that Department.\n\nMr. H. F. Blanford asked Colonel Walker whether the discussion of the barometric and anemometric data in conjunction with those of the tidal registers of the Gulf of Cutch would throw any light on the respective influence of pressure and wind-friction in piling up the surface of the ocean. The storm wave that accompanies cyclones is an instance of the combined action of these two agents, and it would be interesting to know in what measure they were severally effective.\n\nColonel Walker replied that at one of the tidal stations, Hanstal, the changes of wind and pressure were so nearly synchronous that it was impossible to separate the effect of the wind from that of the pressure. At another station, Okha, very fairly reliable measures of the same effect of each were obtained. They are given at the end of the analysis of the observations.\n\n3. Recent Trans-Frontier Explorations. Communicated by Colonel J. T. Walker, C. B., R. E., Surveyor General of India.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis communication consists of an extract from the last Annual Report of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, giving an account of the explorations made by one of the G. T. Survey explorers, called the 'Mullah,' during the year 1876, up the course of the Indus from the point where it enters the plains above Attock to the point where it is joined by the river of Gilgit, which had up to the present time remained a blank on the maps.\nThe paper will be published, with map, in the Journal, Part I.\n\nAfter reading the account of these explorations, Col. Walker remarked that wherever the Mullah struck on routes which had been surveyed by the lamented Lieut. Hayward there was a very satisfactory accordance between the results of the two explorers, which was the more satisfactory in that they were obtained quite independently. He also stated that very remarkable testimony to the accuracy of Lieut. Hayward's work had been afforded by the circumstance that several peaks on an important range of hills between the Karambar and the Nagar valleys to the North-West and North of Gilgit, of which the positions had been determined by Lieut. Hayward, have recently been found to have been fixed by the operations of the Trigonometrical Survey, without his knowledge; and the accordance between the Trigonometrical results and his is sufficiently close to show how careful and accurate that portion of his work must have been.\n\nDr. Cayley said\u2014When stationed in Tibet I often heard the native merchants, especially those from Swat and Bajaur, describe their route through Bajaur and then by Wakhan and the Pamir to Yarkand. This was indeed a regular well-known trade route, though the country was but little known to us, and until the recent explorations just described, only very roughly marked in our maps.\n\nI frequently met Hayward during his travels in Tibet, and was always much struck with his untiring energy and enthusiasm and his little regard for his personal safety and comfort when surveying and exploring.\n\nI met him in Kashmir just after his return from his first visit to Yasin, and it is very gratifying to know that the observations that he took and the survey operations he carried on under such great difficulties and when so jealously watched, were so carefully and accurately done, as confirmed by the recent observations of Col. Walker's native surveyor.\n\n4. Sixth List of Birds from the N. E. Frontier of India.\u2014By Lieut.-Colonel H. H.

O'Kinealy,\nOffg. Secretary to the Govt. of India.\nCapt. Waterhouse exhibited a photograph of part of the sun's disc, obtained by M. Janssen at the Observatory of Meudon, near Paris. He said: The photograph I have the pleasure of exhibiting is one published in the Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes, Paris, for 1878, and represents a small portion of the solar disc enlarged from one of M. Janssen's negatives taken on the 10th October 1877, at 9h. 36m. On M. Janssen's negative the diameter of the sun's disc was 305 mm., or about 12 inches, and it has been enlarged three times, consequently the full diameter of the disc as represented in part in the photograph is 0m.\u00b792, or about 36\u00bd inches.\n\nThe photograph is accompanied by an explanatory note by M. Janssen, in which he lays down the principles that have guided him in making these photographs, and the following is a brief abstract of it.\n\nUp to the present time photography, considered as a means of describing the surface of the sun, has remained much inferior to eye observations with large instruments.\n\nPhotographs on which the sun's image is not more than 4 or 5 inches in diameter cannot show the structure of the photosphere, but this is indispensable towards making any progress in solar knowledge.\n\nThe study of the solar spots, which for the last two centuries and a half has furnished almost the only data on the constitution of the photosphere, seems now almost worked out, or, at least, it ought to be supplemented henceforth by the study of the photosphere itself.\n\nThe study of the photosphere by eye observations is attended with great difficulties, the chief of which is the impossibility of clearly recognizing the form of the granulations in the midst of the flaming photosphere, or to measure them and, still less, to identify them in order to follow their changes.\n\nConsequently it would be an immense advance in solar knowledge if photography could give us images of the sun's surface, showing the details sufficiently clearly to permit this study; it would also be a foundation of future progress and discoveries.\n\nThe solution of this problem has occupied M. Janssen from the time that he commenced these solar photographic observations.\n\nOn considering the conditions under which solar photographs had hitherto been taken, M. Janssen found that the principal cause which prevented the details of the solar surface from appearing on the photographs was photographic irradiation, by which the images of bright objects are enlarged; and it is therefore evident that if the details of the granulation of the solar surface are smaller than the amount of this irradiation, it will be impossible to obtain them with any sharpness.\n\nM. Janssen considered that the solution of the difficulty was in enlarging the image, combined with a diminution in the time of exposure.\nThere is thus a triple chance of success. First, because the irradiation diminishes rapidly with the increase in diameter of the images, especially if the exposure is lessened at the same time; secondly, because the dimensions of the details are enlarged, and therefore the details ought to be more easily obtained; finally, the defects of the sensitive surface are of less relative importance.\n\nThere is another circumstance which, in this case, is particularly favourable for obtaining very well defined images. In short exposures, the photographic spectrum is reduced to a very narrow band and the rays which act belong to a little group almost monochromatic.\n\nThe optical spectrum is on the contrary very extended, and therefore photography may be expected to yield much better defined images than can be obtained by eye observation.\n\nIt is true that the photographic difficulties increase with the size of the image, but these difficulties can be overcome by care and perseverance.\n\nM. Janssen has, therefore, since the commencement of these studies in 1874, constantly endeavoured to obtain the solar images larger and larger, advancing from between 4 and 5 to 12 inches in diameter.\n\nAt the same time as the dimensions were increased, the composition of the sensitive surface and the mode of development were improved. The development of the image ought to be very gradual, commencing with iron and finishing with pyrogallic acid and silver.\n\nThe greatest care must be taken in the focussing and in giving an even exposure all over the plate.\n\nThe length of exposure is very short. In summer it is between $\\frac{1}{3600}$ and $\\frac{1}{3000}$ of a second for the images of 12 inches diameter.\n\nIn consequence of the very short exposure the development is slow, but then the image appears in all its details, free from irradiation, and shows the phenomena we have now to consider.\n\nThe photographs show the solar surface covered with a fine general granulation, the form, dimensions and arrangement of the granular elements being very variable. In size they vary from some tenths of a second to 3 or 4 seconds. The forms are circular or more or less elongated ellipses, but often these regular forms are altered.\n\nThe granulation is visible everywhere and does not seem to possess a different composition towards the poles of the sun. The luminous power of the granular elements considered separately is very variable. They appear to be situated at different depths in the photospheric layer.\n\nThe most luminous granulations only occupy a small portion of the surface of the sun.\n\nBut the most remarkable result, and which is due entirely to the aid of photography, is the discovery of the photographic net-work.\nIn fact, an attentive examination of these photographs shows that the photosphere is not of uniform constitution all over, but that it is divided into a series of figures more or less distant one from the other, and showing a distinct constitution. The outlines of these figures are generally rounded, but often nearly rectilinear and resembling polygons.\n\nThe dimensions of the figures are very variable. They sometimes attain a diameter of one minute or more. Whilst in the intervals between the figures, the grains are distinct and well-defined, although of variable size, in the interior, they are half-effaced, drawn out and confused; generally they have disappeared to give place to streams of matter which replace the granulation. Every thing indicates that in these spaces, the photospheric matter is undergoing violent movements which have confused the granular elements.\n\nAnother very important fact, shewn in a very certain manner by the photographs, is, that numerous very dark points show themselves in the parts where the granulation is regular, and indicate that the photospheric layer must have a very slight thickness.\n\nCapt. Waterhouse remarked that some of the small photographs that were now being taken at the Surveyor-General's Office with the photo-heliograph, frequently showed a mottling and figures of various shapes that appeared to correspond with what M. Janssen called the photographic net-work. These photographs were taken by Capt. Abney's beer-albumen process, with alkaline development. Some photographs taken by Colonel Tennant with the same instrument after the Transit of Venus showed these figures very clearly indeed; they were taken by the ordinary wet-collodion process, but were very carefully exposed and developed with pyrogallic acid instead of iron.\n\nThese photographs, on which the disc of the sun is only four inches, are too small, and the definition of the instrument is not sufficiently good, to permit of the details being enlarged, so as to make useful observations of the daily state of the photosphere as M. Janssen was doing. For this purpose, a much more powerful optical arrangement was necessary.\n\nThe Rev. Fr. Lafont asked to what the distinct difference existing between the various parts of the photograph exhibited was due, some parts being very sharp in outline, others very ill-defined, as if out of focus. It could not be that the tops of the flames in the chromosphere are sufficiently distant from it to produce a difference of focus; might it be that even in the short duration of the exposure, these flames or some of them, displace themselves enough to destroy the sharpness of their outlines? or is it due to some vibration of our own atmosphere? He could hardly believe that the movement of the protuberances is such as to sensibly displace them upon the sensitive plate in the $\\frac{1}{3000}$ of a second.\nCapt. Waterhouse replied that the want of sharpness was not particularly referred to by M. Janssen in his note, unless it was part of the very phenomenon described by him as occurring in the intervals between the figures of the photographic net-work. He had seen it stated in some of the English journals, that the want of sharpness was not due to any defect of focus or photographing, but was actually the representation of solar phenomena.\n\nCapt. Waterhouse said that his attention had been drawn by General Gowan to a photograph of a sculptured group in the Garalmandal Temple at Path\u00e1ri, near Saugor, in Central India, taken by himself in the year 1862, with reference to a translation by Miss Tweedie of a paper by Prof. Weber, on the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-janm\u0101\u015b\u1e6dami or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's birth-festival, published in the 'Indian Antiquary' for December 1877.\n\nThe piece of sculpture, of which he exhibited a photograph to the meeting, represented a female figure nearly the size of life lying down on a couch, with the left hand partly supporting her head and a little child lying by her side. Behind the couch there are five smaller female figures, standing apparently in attendance. Some of these hold chauris and one holds a sort of bag or purse. The couch is covered with a flowered cloth, and has embroidered cushions. It is supported on carved legs by two couchant lions and a seated human figure. The face and other parts of the principal figure have unfortunately been very much damaged.\n\nFrom the nimbus round the head of the recumbent female figure, she is evidently a person of sanctity, but whether the sculpture is intended to represent Devak\u00ed with the infant K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or M\u0101y\u0101 with the infant Buddha, it was difficult for him to say, though he had always taken it to be the latter. Capt. J. D. Cunningham, who described the ruins of Path\u00e1ri in the Society's Journal, No. 189, for April 1848, says, that tradition declares the figure to be that of the Garerun who built the temple, and adds that the shepherd missing his wife one day, was told that her heart's desire had been accomplished; a copious spring had overflowed and formed a lake close to her temple, and that she herself having done with the world, had been metamorphosed into stone, and had become the guardian of the fane of her own erection.\n\nThe only point of interest in the sculpture, is the beauty and artistic grace it possesses, and the fact that the child is represented as lying quietly by the side of its mother, with its hands up, while in most of the instances quoted by Prof. Weber in the paper referred to by General Gowan, the infant K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is represented as at the breast of his mother.\n\nCapt. Waterhouse said, he was not competent to offer an opinion on the subject himself, but General Gowan had thought it might be of interest\nto the Society. An outline sketch would be published in the Proceedings, (see Plate III). Unfortunately the original negative from which the photograph was printed, was in England, and many details are wanting in the only copy that remained, owing to the fact that half the sculpture was in very strong shadow inside the temple.\n\nAddendum;\u2014Since the meeting I have shown the sketch to Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra who has kindly favoured me with the following information.\n\nJ.

The birth took place in a dark rainy night when the warders had fallen asleep, and the father, to save his new-born babe from the doom which awaited it at the hands of R\u00e1ja Ka\u00f1sa, the Indian Herod, secretly carried it away, crossed the Yamun\u00e1 on foot, and finding Yasod\u00e1, a cowherdess, asleep by the side of her little daughter born an hour or two before, quietly left his son by her side, and carried the baby to the prison.\n\nIf we accept the picture to be a representation of the birth of Krishna we must assume the scene to be either of the prison cell, or of the dwelling of the cowherdess, and in neither place would the attendants be consistent. I am disposed, therefore, to believe that it is intended for the birth of Buddha. It is true that Buddha is said to have been born in a garden while his mother was leaning against a tree, but she was at the time surrounded by a large retinue of maids, and soon after the birth she was placed on a couch, and this incident is what we see in the picture.\n\nThe counterpart of this scene occurs in the Amar\u00e1vat\u00ed stone now in the Indian Museum, and in it are to be found the couch, the reclining figure, and the attendants all but exactly the same, the only material difference being that in the one we have a young elephant, the form in which Buddha descended on the earth, and in the other a little child, the form which he assumed immediately after birth.\n\nThe semicircular arch you refer to is not a nimbus, but the back-frame of the bedstead. (See my 'Antiquities of Orissa,' p. 103, woodcut No. 30.) I may add that lions are rarely shown in Vaishnavite sculpture, but seldom omitted in Buddhist scenes. They are the emblems of the title Si\u00f1ha, which Buddhists are so fond of assigning to the founder of their religion.\n\nIt might be said that the temple from which the picture has been brought is a Hindu one, and a priori we have a right to expect a Hindu scene in it. But a reference to Capt. J. D. Cunningham's paper on the Temple of Path\u00e1ri, will show that the Hindu origin of the fane cannot be satisfactorily established. Capt. C. says \"the general impression left upon the mind by an examination of this temple, is that while it is religiously a\nBr\u0101hmanical edifice, it is architecturally and sculpturally an adaptation from Buddhism, and serves to show how old material forms are preserved amid mental changes and the revolutions of sentiments,\u201d (J. A. S. B. XVII, p. 310.) In short, it is a Buddhist fane, converted to Hindu worship.* A drawing of the Amar\u0101vati stone is to be found in Foucaux\u2019s life of Buddha.\u201d\n\nMr. H. B. Medlicott exhibited a copy of the new Geological Map of India and said:\n\nThe map which I have the honour to lay before the Society, might perhaps be more fittingly handed round for inspection, than hung up in the general view. It is on the tiny scale of 64 miles to an inch, being in fact only an index-map to a Manual on the Geology of India, embodying the results up to date of the labours of the Geological Survey. This work is now well advanced towards publication; and it will, however imperfectly, supply a demand that has long pressed upon us. The map has been very neatly printed in colours at the office of the Surveyor General of India, and through the kindness of Captain Riddell, R. E., in charge of the Lithographic branch of that office, I have obtained some early impressions; one has been sent to the Exhibition at Paris and one to Dr. Oldham. This present is the first occasion on which a copy has been seen in India. On the part of my colleagues of the Geological Survey I now present to our colleagues of the Asiatic Society of Bengal this latest produce of our combined labours. In this room, before the busts of Stoliczka and of Dr. Oldham, and in the presence of our President, Mr. William Blanford, we might be tempted to forget the share of this work that is due to unprofessional explorers. To show how erroneous this would be, how broadly the foundations of geology had been laid in India by private hands before an official Survey had any existence, I have also placed before the meeting Mr. Greenough\u2019s Geological Map, compiled a quarter of a century ago, by a man who had never set foot in the country, from the observations of early explorers, most of whom were members of this Society. A comparison of the two maps will show a very decided general agreement. It would not be just to push the comparison further. In size and apparent completeness the older map has the advantage, where some considerable blank spaces occur in the recent map, for it was decided that we should put some limit to guess-work. Lines have been put in freely from rapid sketch-surveys, or even from borrowed information; but we have preferred to leave blank, where the connecting points were too distant and uncertain. As regards details, the minuteness of the map forbids any notice whatever of many points of interest that will be found explained in the Manual, and we have had to\n\n* The country about Path\u0101ri is strewed with remains of undoubtedly Buddhist origin. J. W.\nclub together formations that have long since been distinguished; as for\nthe great Gondw\u00e1na rock-system, of which on such a map, we can only show\nan upper and lower division; or for the Vindhyan formation, the many\nsub-divisions of which have all to appear under one colour. But, as I have\nstated, this map is only an index; and for many important areas, special\nmaps have already been published.\n\nMr. V. Ball exhibited two stone implements from Parisn\u00e1th Hill\n(District Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh) and said:\u2014\n\nThe two stone implements which I exhibit were received by me from\nMr. I. J. Whitty, of Giridi. They are reported to have been found during\nthe clearance of the primeval forest on the northern slopes of Parisn\u00e1th\nHill, where a tea garden has recently been opened out.\n\nDiffering from those which I exhibited from Singhbh\u00fam* and which\nwere interesting as being of the specialised Burmese type, the present speci-\nmens (and particularly the larger one) conform to more ordinary types of\npolished celts, examples of which have been met with in most of the coun-\ntries of Europe and elsewhere.\n\nAs is not unfrequently the case with polished celts, the material of\nwhich these are formed is a volcanic (trappian) rock. The large specimen\nwas probably a battle-axe, while the small one, with its carefully ground\nedge, was no doubt used as a scraper for dressing skins of wild animals.\n\nI hope to hear soon whether any further examples have been obtained\nfrom the same locality. In the meantime it is desirable to place on record\nthis new locality.\n\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1. Note on certain peculiarities observed in Hailstones which fell at\nKhuln\u00e1, Jessore, on the 31st March, 1878.\u2014By H. James Rainey.\n\nOn the above date there was an extraordinarily heavy fall of hailstones\nof rather considerable size, some being as large as a goose\u2019s egg. Of\ncourse these latter were not single stones, but compound ones, as none of\nthe former are known to attain a larger bulk than that of a pigeon\u2019s egg.\n\nAs regards the majority of these large stones, their form and structure\nwere rather peculiar. They appeared to be of a discoid form, and their\nsurface was extremely irregular and jagged. From a more or less transpa-\nrent nucleus about the centre, issued concentric rings of different degrees\nof opacity, which were very clearly discernible. These peculiarities I have,\nhowever, observed before, and I need not describe them more closely, as\nthey are doubtless known to others.\n\n* P. A. S. B. June 1875, p. 118, and June 1876.\nWhat struck me as being especially remarkable about these stones was that when melted they left a sedimentary deposit of a yellowish-brown substance. I found this to be the case at first on placing these stones in a glass of water. Thinking, however, that this powdery substance may have been contained in the water in which I put the stones, or that some earthy matter had adhered to the stones on their falling on the ground, I carefully washed some more stones in clear and pure water, and placed them in a clean glass, and again there was a similar deposit. I then drained off the water, and kept the substance there, with the intention of the next day drying and preserving it, in view of having it eventually analyzed; but, unfortunately, it was thrown away by accident, and has therefore been lost. I have never previously observed this peculiarity in hail-stones; and as it may not be generally known, I have thought it worth while noting down the fact.\n\nIt would be interesting to know, if hailstones have been regularly analyzed before, what are their constituent parts,* and whether they vary at different times and places, or not? They appear to have a chemical effect on vegetables, particularly on banana and plantain trees (*Musa sapalientum* et *M. paradisiaca,* ) as they become yellow and seared soon after a fall of hailstones. Even grass on which hailstones have fallen becomes affected in the same way, and contrary to what a shower of rain produces. However, all these changes may be due simply to the low temperature of hailstones. But it cannot in any way account for the sedimentary deposit, which is deserving notice and attention.\n\nThe President said, it was unfortunate that the deposit from the hailstones had not been examined microscopically. Atmospheric dust had proved in various cases to contain rather singular constituents, such as diatoms, and recently some blackish powder obtained from melting snow in Sweden had been found to contain iron and a percentage of nickel, and was probably of meteoric origin.\n\n2. The Application of Photography to the Reproduction of Maps, Plans &c., by the Photo-mechanical and other processes.\u2014By Capt. J. Waterhouse, B. S. C., Assistant Surveyor General of India.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper opens with an introduction in which a short account is given of the rise and progress of the system of reproducing maps and plans by photography in the Ordnance Survey Office, Southampton, and in India, and of the objects and advantages to be gained by it. The preparation of the original and the production of the negatives is next considered, and then follows a general review of the various photographic processes employed for\n\n* Rain-water is known to certain carbonate of ammonia.

I. E., seconded by W. T. Blanford, Esq.\n\nThe Secretary announced that Major H. C. Marsh and Capt. E. A. Fraser had intimated their desire to withdraw from the Society.\n\nThe President announced that news had been received, since the last meeting of the Society, of the death of Dr. T. Thomson, one of the Honorary members of the Society. He said\u2014\n\nWe have to regret the loss of one of the most eminent of Indian naturalists, one who, although prevented by failing health from carrying out the work to which he had devoted his life, the completion of a Flora Indica worthy of the country, has nevertheless, by his collections and labours, done much to facilitate the completion of the work by others.\n\nDr. Thomas Thomson was born in Glasgow in 1817, and was the son of the well-known Professor of Chemistry in the University of his native town. He was a fellow student of Sir Joseph Hooker, his intimate friend.\nand associate throughout life. After completing his studies at the Glasgow University and taking the degree of Doctor of Medicine, Dr. Thomson entered the medical service of the East India Company in 1839. Very soon after his arrival in India, he was attached to a part of the army in Cabul, and in 1842 he was taken prisoner by the Afghans at Ghazni, whilst serving with the 27th N. I. After the close of the Afghan war and the delivery of the prisoners, Dr. Thomson was engaged for many years in the North West Provinces and the Punjab, and he was attached to the army in both the Sikh wars. In 1847, he was sent by the Governor-General, Lord Hardinge, with Major Cunningham and Captain Henry Strachey on a mission to the Upper Indus valley in Tibet. This journey lasted from August 1847 to October 1848, in the course of which time Dr. Thomson penetrated to the Karakorum Pass, and traversed a large area of country now well-known, admirably mapped, and the yearly resort of tourists and sportsmen, but then difficult of access and scarcely indicated on the existing maps. Large botanical collections and a series of valuable and interesting physical and geological observations were the result of this journey. Almost immediately after returning, Dr. Thomson went to Darjiling and arrived there in time to welcome his friend Dr. Hooker, when the latter with Dr. Campbell were released from captivity in native Sikkim. With Dr. Hooker, Dr. Thomson then visited the Kh\u00e1si Hills, and shortly after returned to England, where he spent some years on furlough.\n\nFrom 1855 to 1861 Dr. Thomson was superintendent of the Botanical Gardens, Calcutta, and must be still remembered by many of the members of this Society. Besides numerous other undertakings he was busily engaged on the Flora Indica, which he commenced in association with Dr. Hooker. He joined this Society in 1855 and was six times elected to the Council, three times as Vice-President. His health, however, had suffered greatly, and when he retired and returned to Europe in 1861, it was for a long time doubtful whether he would live many months. His health ever since has been most precarious.\n\nDr. Thomson\u2019s principal works are his \u201cWestern Himalaya and Tibet,\u201d an account of his journeys in Cashmere, Ladak &c., and the introduction to the Flora Indica, which he wrote conjointly with Dr. Hooker, and which is well-known as one of the most masterly botanical essays ever written. By these his work in India will long be preserved in memory, but to all who had the advantage of knowing him personally, he will be ever better remembered for his kindly nature. Few residents in Calcutta had a wider circle of friends, none were more generally esteemed and beloved than Dr. Thomson.\n\nThe Secretary reported that Mr. W. E. Bateman\u2019s appointment as Assistant Secretary had been confirmed by the Council.\nThe Council reported that the following rules had been drawn up for the management of the Society's Library.\n\nRules for the Library, Asiatic Society.\n\n1. The Librarian shall keep a register of books belonging to the Library, showing their registered number, title, name of author, date of receipt, whence obtained, price if purchased, edition, size, number of volumes, number of plates, place and date of publication.\n\n2. All books, pamphlets and periodicals received for the Library, shall immediately on receipt, be entered in the Library Register, and stamped with the Library stamp, the registered number and date of receipt being written in the centre of the stamp. The Librarian shall see that each plate and map in books received for the Library is carefully stamped on the reverse side with the Library stamp. New books received shall be stamped on the cover with the words 'Asiatic Society of Bengal.'\n\n3. A book shall be kept, in which shall be entered the title of every work lent out, the number of plates, if any, it contains at the time of being lent, the name of the member borrowing the same, and the date on which it is lent. A member applying in person for a work shall sign a receipt for the book and plates it may contain, at the time of borrowing. A member not applying in person shall send a written request for the books he requires, and this request shall be filed in the Library, as a voucher, the Librarian duly noting on it the books actually lent out. The Librarian shall send with each packet of books, a form of receipt, to be signed and returned by the borrower. Should any member prefer to keep a private register of books borrowed from the Library, it shall be the duty of the Librarian to enter in such register the names of all books issued and to initial their receipt when returned.\n\n4. On return of any book to the Library, the Librarian, after satisfying himself that the book is in the same condition as it was when lent out, shall insert opposite to the entry, in the loan register, the date on which the book has been returned, and return to the borrower the receipt, or other voucher given by him, duly cancelled. And if on the return of any book the Librarian shall perceive that it has sustained any damage, since it was taken from the Library, he shall make a note of the particulars and report the same to the Secretary.\n\n5. No member shall remove any book, pamphlet, periodical, or any other article, the property of the Society, from the Library or Reading-rooms without giving the Librarian a receipt for the same.\n\n6. No Book, Pamphlet, Journal, or Periodical &c. shall be lent out before the expiration of one month after its receipt in the Library.\n\n7. Periodicals and unbound Journals in numbers shall be returned after the expiration of one week.\n8. A list of the Books, Periodicals and Works of Reference which must not be taken out of the Library without special permission of the Council, shall be placed in a conspicuous position in the Library, and such books shall be marked with a star in the Catalogue.\n\n9. Non-resident members are entitled to take out books, plates, drawings and manuscripts from the Library under the provisions of Rule 14c of the Society's Byelaws, viz.: on making special application to the Council, and signing an obligation to defray the expense of carriage and to make compensation for any book, plate, manuscript, &c., which may be lost or damaged.\n\n10. No member shall be permitted to have more than 10 sets of books from the Library in his possession at any one time without the special permission of the Secretary.\n\n11. Not more than two MSS. shall be lent out at any one time, to the same person, except with the sanction of the Council.\n\n12. Except with the special sanction of the Council, Members shall not be permitted to keep books, &c., borrowed from the Library for more than three months.\n\n13. All books except in the case stated below shall be returned to the Library before the 1st January in each year. Early in December, the Librarian, having previously ascertained that the books are actually absent from the Library, shall forward to all members who have books belonging to the Society in their possession, a letter requesting that such books be returned before the end of the month. Non-resident members who, on the 1st January, have had books &c., from the Library for less than 3 months may send a detailed list of such books instead of returning them.\n\nThe Librarian shall report to the Council each year at their meeting in January, the names of all books not returned, and of the members by whom they were borrowed, and the Council may, if they think proper, suspend the names of such members in the Reading-room.\n\n14. If application be made to the Librarian for a book already taken out from the Library, he shall issue a notice to the borrower, requiring him to return it, free of expense, within one week from the receipt of such notice, if a resident member, and within 15 days, if a non-resident member.\n\n15. If any book borrowed from the Library be lost or damaged, the borrower shall be held responsible for such loss or damage, and if the book belong to a set, he shall be held liable to make good the set to the satisfaction of the Council, or pay its value.\n\n16. No book &c. shall be issued from the Library to any member while he retains any property of the Society in contravention of the above rules.\n\n17. A book shall be kept in the Library in which members may write the names of any books, &c., they may recommend to be purchased for the Library.\n18. No person who is not a member of the Society shall be permitted to take away any book from the Library without special authority from the Council, or to have access to the Library without permission of the President or of one of the Secretaries.\n\n19. In no case shall any member be allowed to take out of India (as defined in rule 32) any Book, Manuscript, Pamphlet, Periodical &c. belonging to the Society.\n\n20. The Librarian shall have under his charge all Manuscripts, Rubbings of inscriptions, Photographs, Drawings, Maps, and Copper-plate grants belonging to the Society, and shall keep a separate register of each.\n\n21. The Librarian shall be held personally responsible for the safety of the Books, Manuscripts, Photographs, and other articles belonging to the Society\u2019s Library under his charge, and that these rules are properly carried out, as far as lies in his power.\n\nThe Secretary announced that a letter had been received from the Schwann Memorial Committee, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, asking for the co-operation of the Asiatic Society at an anniversary festival to be held in honour of Schwann, the discoverer of the analogy of the structure of animals and plants.\n\nThe Secretary announced that a letter had been received from the Geographical Society of Lyons, giving an account of a large Geographical Globe, constructed in 1701, by Henri Marchand, and asking the assistance of the Asiatic Society in forwarding geographical information, to enable the Society to publish an account of the early geographical researches during the 10th century.\n\nMr. W. T. Blanford exhibited two skins of adult wild swans, shot by Mr. H. E. Watson at Bah\u00e1walpur, near Sehwan, in Sind, on the 12th February last, and clearly belonging to the mute swan, *Cygnus olor*, the same as the tame swan of England. Mr. Blanford pointed out that this was the first time that the occurrence of this bird had been recorded so far to the southward or that the adult had been shot in India. Mr. Watson saw wild swans on two occasions during the past cold season, once on the Manchhar lake near Sehwan, in January, and the second time at Bah\u00e1walpur, in the Sehwan district, on February 12th, on this latter occasion he succeeded in shooting three.\n\nThe only other cases in which swans had been previously procured in India were noticed by Mr. Brooks in the Proceedings of the Society for April, 1872, p. 63. So far as Mr. Blanford was aware, no subsequent notice of the occurrence of swans in India had appeared. The only previously recorded instance in which *C. olor* had been obtained was in the extreme\nnorth-west of the Punjab, where two immature specimens were obtained in 1871 by Captain Unwin and described by Mr. Hume (Ibis, 1871, p. 412.).\n\nThe occurrence of these birds in Sind must be very unusual, for they were, Mr. Watson says, quite unknown to the fishermen, all of whom are fowlers and know every water-bird in the country well.\n\nMr. Blanford also called attention to a third skin of a wild swan exhibited by Dr. J. Anderson, who was unable to attend the meeting. This bird was shot at Attock, in the upper Punjab, on the 17th January last by Lieutenant G. P. Hill, of the Rifle Brigade, and presented to the Indian Museum. It proved also to be a specimen of *C. olor*, but rather younger than the two specimens from Sind, the tubercle on the bill not being developed.\n\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1.\u2014*On the Antiquities of (Bagur\u00e1) Bogra.*\u2014By H. Beveridge, C. S. Rangpur.\n\nThis paper will appear in No. I of the Journal, Part I, for this year.\n\n2.\u2014*Note on the absence of a Horn in the Female of the Sundarban Rhinoceros and Javanese Rhinoceros (Rh. Javanicus, Cuv.)*\u2014By H. J. Rainey.\n\nHaving read with great attention Mr. O. L. Fraser's graphic \"Note on a partially ossified Nasal Septum in *Rhinoceros Sondaicus*,\" which appeared, accompanied with a plate clearly illustrating it, in J. A. S. B., 1875, pp. 10-12, I found a fact mentioned, which, as far as I am aware, has never been before noticed, namely, the absence of a horn in the female of the Sundarban Rhinoceros. As regards this point, Mr. Fraser stated: \"* * what is very peculiar, the female has no horn whatsoever.\" This induced me to endeavour to ascertain if the female of the Javanese Rhinoceros, which is considered to be of identical species with the Sundarban animal, possesses a horn or not, for if the former did not, it would clearly be a distinct and new species. I accordingly applied to Dr. G\u00fcnther, keeper of the British Museum, Zoological Department, for information on the subject, and that gentleman was good enough to forward to me answers to more than a score of questions on that and other points. But, as his answers were based on an examination of a single specimen of \"a skeleton obtained from Java of a Dutch dealer,\"* the sex of which was \"unknown,\" the information was of course inadequate, as Dr. G\u00fcnther himself remarked: \"I am afraid the data thus obtained will not be sufficient to settle the distinctness of the Java and Sundarban\n\n* The only one of the kind, I believe, in the British Museum, at least then. H. J. R.\none-horned Rhinoceros, which, however, I consider very probable.\" The animal was described, in answer to one of the questions, as \"not quite full grown, the last molar not quite grown to the head of the stem.\" The length of horn was given as $8\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, and the circumference at the base 19 inches. In reply to the question, whether the female had a horn or not, the answer was \"not known.\"\n\nAs the above answers did not at all dispose of the question raised, I addressed a letter to Mein herr W. P. Groenveldt, Secretary of the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences, in the early part of the current year, asking to be informed positively, whether the single-horned Rhinoceros of Java (Rh. Sondaicus, M\u00fcller,) is provided with a horn or not. I also asked, whether that species possessed a partially ossified septum narium or not. His letter,* in reply to mine, I have just been favoured with, and as it is concise and directly to the point, I may as well quote it at length. It runs as follows:\n\n\"Before replying to the question contained in your letter of January 4th, I have consulted two of my friends, Dr. Ploem and Dr. de Gavere, both experienced zoologists, and as their opinion quite agrees with my own experience, I think the following information may be regarded as positive.\n\n\"The female of the Rhinoceros Sondaicus (we prefer calling it Rh. Javanicus, following the older name by Cuvier) is not provided with a horn, but has only a slight rugged protuberance on the skull bone, which is just visible on the skin too.\u2020 The natives say that the female also has a horn sometimes, but I suspect this to be nothing more than a greater development of the protuberance in aged specimens.\n\n\"The septum narium is always partially ossified, but never to such a degree as in the fossil remains of the Rh. tichorinus. In very aged specimens the nasal septum may be quite ossified, but I have never seen any, and, as far as I know, the ossification agrees with that of the other known species.\"\n\nThere can now be hardly any doubt that, the one-horned Javanese Rhinoceros and Sundarban Rhinoceros are of identical species, as asserted by Blyth and other well known zoologists.\n\nThe President said\u2014that the question of the specific distinctions between the different kinds of Rhinoceros had lately been investigated by Professor Flower, in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society for 1876,\n\n* Bearing date the 20th April, 1878. H. J. R.\n\u2020 In a photograph of a young female Sundarban Rhinoceros now before me, I observe a prominence there, also. H. J. R.\np. 443, and all the known species except the white African Rhinoceros, *R. simus*, had been beautifully figured by Mr. Wolf to illustrate a paper by Dr. Sclater in the Transactions of the Zoological Society (Vol. IX, Part II.) The general consensus of opinion, founded on various characters, was that the Javanese and Sandarban Rhinoceroses were identical. In Plate XCVI of the Transactions just mentioned, the *Rhinoceros* from Java is represented and the figure can be compared with the Sundarban animal.\n\n3.\u2014Notes on Reptilia from the Himalayas and Assam.\u2014By W. T. Blanford, F. R. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe following species are described as new:\n\n*Draco major*; the largest form of the genus known, allied to *D. dussumieri* and *D. quinquefasciatus*; nostrils directed upwards, tympanum naked, a small tubercle behind the orbit, no nuchal crest, the hind-leg falls short of the armpit when laid forward; gular appendage long, covered with large smooth scales, each fully twice as long and broad as an abdominal scale.

S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe founder of the family, Naw\u00e1b Muhammad Kh\u00e1n Ghazanfar-Jang was born, between 1665 and 1670, at Mau-Rash\u00edd\u00e1b\u00e1d, near K\u00e1imganj, twenty-one miles west of Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d. He was the second son of Malik Zain Kh\u00e1n, a K\u00e1ghzai Kaol\u00e1n\u00ed Path\u00e1n of the Bangash tribe, who settled in that town in the reign of Aurangz\u00e9b-Alamg\u00edr (1658-1707). His early years were passed as a commander of free-lances in Bundelkhand. In 1713, he joined the standard of Farrukhsiyar and fought in the van at the battle of Samogar. After the victory he was made a Commander of Four Thousand and received j\u00e1g\u00edrs in Bundelkhand. In 1714, he founded K\u00e1imganj, Muhammad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, having obtained a grant of the parganahs of Shamsh\u00e1b\u00e1d and Bhojp\u00far. After the murder of Husain 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1rha, again espousing the winning side, he fought under Muhammad Sh\u00e1h in the battle of November 1720, where 'Abdullah Kh\u00e1n Kutb-ul-Mulk was defeated and captured, Muhammad Kh\u00e1n was advanced to be a Panj-Haz\u00e1ri and subsequently to the rank of Haft-Haz\u00e1ri. He was governor of All\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d (1722-1730), of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 (1731), and again of All\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d (1735). He died at an advanced age on the 9th December 1743, and was buried in the Hay\u00e1t B\u00e1gh, outside the Mau gate of Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d. He had twenty-two sons.\n\nThe eldest son, K\u00e1im Kh\u00e1n, succeeded and ruled for five years. At the instigation of Safdar-Jang, wazir of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, he invaded Rohilkhand, and on the 23rd November, 1748, he was killed, with most of his chief men, in the battle fought at Dauri-Ras\u00falpur, a few miles south-east of Bad\u00e1on. Im\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, a younger brother, succeeded, but six months afterwards he was made a prisoner by the wazir and sent to All\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, where his life with that of four brothers was taken. The territory was resumed by the waz\u00edr and made over to his deputy, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Naval R\u00e1e, K\u00e1yath. Not long afterwards the Path\u00e1ns rose and on the 1st August 1750, headed by Ahmad Kh\u00e1n, second son of Naw\u00e1b Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, they defeated Naval R\u00e1e on the banks of the K\u00e1li river near Khud\u00e1ganj, seventeen miles south-east of Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d. Naval R\u00e1e was shot in the head. Meanwhile the waz\u00edr in person was approaching from Dilh\u00ed. The decisive battle was fought on the 13th September, 1750, at a place called R\u00e1m.\nChatauni, half way between Patiali and Sahawar, in the Et\u00e1 district. The wazir received a graze from a spent shot, and his troops believing him to be dead gave way. A signal victory was obtained by the Pathans. Instead, however, of advancing on Dilhi, Ahmad Khan turned eastwards and occupied the whole of the Audh and Allahabad territories. The fort of Allahabad alone resisted, and after having wasted several months in an unsuccessful siege, the nawab was recalled in haste to defend his inherited domains. The wazir with the aid of the Mahrattas had already expelled his troops from the parganahs to the west of Farrukhabad. In April 1751, Nawab Ahmad Khan was invested in the fort of Fathgarh, and a month and some days had elapsed, when Sa'dullah Khan Rohela, who was marching to his relief, having been defeated on the other side of the river, Ahmad Khan made his escape with some difficulty to Anwala, the Rohela headquarters. After the rains the wazir and the Mahrattas crossed the Ganges. The Bangash and Rohela forces then retreated to Chilkya at the foot of the hills, where they entrenched themselves. After some months of desultory fighting a peace was made. To meet the pay due to the Mahrattas by Safdar Jang, about one half of the Bangash territory was made over to them. The country left to the nawab, known as the sixteen and a half mahals, consisted of nearly the whole of the Et\u00e1 and Farrukhabad districts, and about half of the present district of Mainpuri. In the great battle of Panipat in January 1761, Ahmad Khan fought with destruction on the right wing of Ahmad Shah Durani's army. Ahmad Khan died on the 12th July, 1771, the day that Shah Alam entered Farrukhabad on his way from Allahabad to Dilhi.\n\nAhmad Khan's eldest surviving son, Diler Himmat Khan, succeeded under the title of Muzaffar Jang. In 1774, this nawab became tributary to Shuj\u00e1'ud-daula, nawab-wazir of Audh, paying to him four and a half lakhs of rupees annually. About the year 1786 this tribute was made over to the English in part payment of the subsidiary force stationed at Fathgarh. On the 23rd October, 1796, Muzaffar Jang died suddenly from poison, supposed to have been administered at the instigation of his eldest son Rustam 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n. This eldest son was deported to Lakhnau by Asafud-daula, and the second son Imdad Husain Khan, N\u00e1sir Jang, succeeded. In this nawab's time was negociated the treaty of the 24th June, 1802, (Aitchison VII, 36,) making over the Farrukhabad territory in return for an annual payment. N\u00e1sir Jang died of hard drinking on the 1st February, 1813. He was succeeded by his minor son Kh\u00e1dim Husain Khan, Shaukat Jang. He died at Dilhi on the 24th July, 1823, of small-pox. Tajammul Husain Khan, his son, succeeded. On his death in November 1846, he was followed by his cousin Tafazzul Husain Khan. This nawab joined the rebels in the Mutiny, but his life having been promised at his surrender,\nhe was not executed. He now lives at Mecca, and gains a living, it is said, by copying Kur\u00e1ns and painting small pictures of the holy places. His son Asghar Husain Kh\u00e1n, now about twenty-two years of age, lives in Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nContents of Part I. Nawab Muhammad Khan, origin of the family. Muhammad Khan's early years.

S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper comprises such information regarding the above earthquake as the author was able to collect from the different stations in the northern part of the Punjab which were affected by it.\n\nIt will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\nThe President said that it was extremely desirable that careful records should be obtained of the various earthquake shocks so frequent in India.\nHe would venture to point out how much more prevalent such shocks were in the neighbourhood of the great river plains than elsewhere. Assam, the Himalayas, Sind and Cutch were far more subject to earthquakes than the peninsula, that is to say, the countries which had at a geologically recent date undergone great disturbance were far more affected than those which had remained comparatively undisturbed. He suggested that the elevation of the Himalayas, of the Sulem\u00e1n and other ranges west of the Indus, and of the mountains of Assam might perhaps still be in progress from compression, whilst the disturbing cause might be the constantly increasing pressure of the great areas of deposition in the deltas of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Indus, and the subsidence due to such pressure.

Laurie, Medical College, Calcutta, proposed by Dr. Partridge, seconded by Capt. Waterhouse.\n\nThe Council reported that Mr. Medlicott had undertaken the duties of General Secretary during the absence of Capt. J. Waterhouse on leave.\n\nThe Rev. Fr. Lafont exhibited two microphones and explained their construction and working. He said\u2014The Microphone of Prof. Hughes consists essentially in the introduction of an imperfect contact at a point of an electric circuit comprising a telephone. Two pieces of carbon loosely connected by a third piece and supported by a thin board on a sounding-box, form a very delicate transmitter of sounds. The vibrations communicated to the loose piece of carbon, produce variations in the points of contact and this causes similar variations in the current passing through the telephone thus reproducing in the latter instrument the original sonorous vibrations.\n\nIn its present crude state the microphone may be extremely useful in any case where a monotonous or periodical sound is to be sent to a distant station. It might for instance be used for placing any station in direct communication with the chronometer of an Observatory and thus facilitate astronomical operations in the determination of Longitudes.\n\nThe microphone when reduced in sensitiveness and rendered more manageable by the addition of two very delicate springs to the loose piece of carbon, could be employed for articulated speech, and produced these sounds very much louder than the Telephone. A person standing some 15 or 20 feet from the microphone and speaking towards it, was distinctly heard in the distant Telephone.\n\nTwo different kinds of Microphones were then circulated, and afterwards used to convey the ticking of a watch from one of the rooms to another, distant about 40 yards: one of the instruments had a vertical piece of graphite between two carbon blocks; the other consisted of five small pieces of carbon enclosed in a glass tube and mounted on a sounding-box.\n\nThe President said that considering the very short period\u2014only a month\u2014that had elapsed since news of the discovery of the microphone had been received from Europe, the meeting was greatly indebted to Father Lafont for an opportunity of examining this remarkable addition to the series of interesting inventions of which the telephone had been the origin.\n\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1. Notes on a Map of the Mughal Empire.\u2014By H. G. Keene, C. S., Agra.\n\nThe accompanying map* is an attempt to show the arrangement of the various Provinces at some central period, say in the early years of Aurangzib;\n\n* The Council do not think it necessary to reproduce the map. Ed.\nafter all claims to Kandah\u00e1r and other northern Provinces had been abandoned, and before the Mahratta confederacy had begun to dispute the Mughal supremacy in the south.\n\nOriginally, the Empire as described by Abul Fazl in the 40th year of Akbar consisted of twelve subahs besides later-acquired territory which had not at that time been completely organised with the Imperial Cosmos. In later times, the number of these provinces averaged twenty; for, though there are as many as twenty-seven named in some lists, yet they are either produced by splitting lesser provinces or such as were never held all at one period. The land revenue of the twelve subahs is stated by Abul Fazl to have aggregated over nine krors of Rupees, a sum which in his detailed lists, with the addition of land and sea-customs and income derived from the inorganised provinces of Sindh and Kashmir, he brings to nearly one kror more, or say Rs. 99,613,850. A large but unascertained contribution must also be allowed in the services of the Bumi (or \"landwehr\") a large irregular militia of horse, foot, and artillery assessed on the various districts independent of the levies maintained by the Mansabdars and the standing army of the Crown.\n\nIt would be indecorous to omit the mention of Mr. E. Thomas, F. R. S. in this connection. That distinguished scholar and numismatist has on various occasions (see his Prinsep, Vol. II., his Chronicles, and Revenue Resources) made efforts to bring the figures of the Ain into harmony with estimates elsewhere derived. Finding, for example, that an accountant of Akbar's estimated the total revenue at 640,000,000 tankas, Mr. Thomas concludes that this equals \u00a332,000,000 sterling, and hence concludes that Abul Fazl has meant to state double the figures that he has stated, and that this must be doubled again by the addition of what in modern Anglo-Indian parlance is called \"Separate Revenue.\" Four times ten however would not yield thirty-two, but forty\u2014even if the exchange value of ten Rupees to one pound English could be proved to have obtained in Akbar's time, of which there is no proof. Moreover, the proposed emendation of the text (from \"three\" to \"six\" arbs of d\u00e3ms) does violence to all known versions of the Ain Akbari.\n\nThe following is a strict translation of the important words, taken from Professor Blochmann, Calcutta, text III, 386;\u2014\n\n\"In the 40th year of his reign the Emperor Akbar had a decennial settlement of his dominions at the annual revenue of three arbs, sixty-two krors, ninety-seven lakhs, fifty-five thousand, one hundred and forty-six d\u00e3ms, or Rs. 90,749,881-2-5.\"\n\nThis tallies with other texts including the Lakhnau lithograph of Munshi Nawal Kishor, which is highly esteemed by native scholars.\n\nFour other provinces are mentioned by Abul Fazl; namely, those of\nMult\u00e1n and Tattah, forming the modern Commissionership of Sindh and part of the Punjab; and Kashmir with K\u00e1b\u00fal, a mountainous region, assessed chiefly in kind, and chiefly valued for purposes of sport and luxury.\n\nThe following specification of each province is abstracted from the same work; I have not thought it necessary to add the figures from the separate Taksim Jamas or detailed rent-rolls which, though not prepared apparently quite at the same moment as the descriptive parts, do not exceed the estimates there given very seriously, seeing that they contain some further items of separate revenue. Each province was in area about equal to an average European kingdom. Of these provinces the most eastern was Bengal forming with Orissa a vast and fertile tract assessed at about one and a half krores of Rupees. The capital was at Gaur or Lakhnauti. Bahar (often united with Bengal under the general title of \"the Eastern Subahs\") was the very finest part of the Gangetic valley, both in climate and natural advantages. It had both on the north and south fine mountain ranges for limits; abundant streams watered the soil. The name of the capital is not given in the Ain, it was probably at Patna. The land revenue was over forty-three lakhs.\n\nAllahabad and Audh, often held by the same Subahd\u00e1r, resembled Bahar in size, character and conformation. The capital of the one was at Pray\u00e1g, and derived from Akbar the name it communicated to the entire district. The capital of the other\u2014Audh or Ajudhia\u2014was near the site of the modern Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. The aggregate land revenue was about a kror and a third.\n\nAgra (formerly Bi\u00e1na) was a compact division extending from Kalpi to Rew\u00e1ri, and from Aligarh to the southern boundary of Narwar. Besides the metropolis it contained Gw\u00e1l\u00edar and other walled towns, cities and fortresses; the land-revenue was over a quarter of a million.\n\nM\u00e1lwa, a large province formed out of a conquered kingdom\u2014stretched from the borders of Allahabad to those of Gujar\u00e1t, and was famous for its woods, waters, wild flowers and fine scenery. The climate was much-esteemed and its fertility proverbial. M\u00e1ndu was regarded as the capital; the land revenue exceeded sixty lakhs of Rupees.\n\nKh\u00e1ndes (named D\u00e1ndes by Akbar in honour of his son D\u00e1ny\u00e1l) was a small but pleasant province between the Narbada and Tapti rivers, intersected by the Satpura hills, and having for capital the ancient fortified city of Burh\u00e1npur so often mentioned in the history of mediaeval India. The land revenue was about seven lakhs and a half. The local governor in troubled times occupied the neighbouring fort of Aserg\u00e1h, regarded as one of the strongest places in the empire.\n\nGujarat, another old Musalm\u00e1n kingdom, was of great extent and\nyielded a revenue\u2014inclusive of customs\u2014which exceeded a kror of Rupees. This province was largely washed by the sea; and, besides the native capital Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, contained Baroda and other large towns. The Portu-\nguese had a settlement at Surat and made encroachments, towards the end of Akbar's reign, over the neighbouring districts.\n\nThe so-called Subah of Ajm\u00edr was one of the largest provinces, answering nearly to the modern Rajput\u00e1na. It was divided into three principal chiefships, Mewar, Marwar and Harauti\u2014corresponding to the modern Rajadoms of Udaipur, Jodhpur and Kota-Bundi. Other prinici-\npalities, such as Dhundar (Jaipur) were not apparently thought of much importance by Abul Fazl, as they are not named in his list. The country was fine, the climate healthy, and the population hardy; but the revenue was nothing more than a tribute estimated by Abul Fazl at Rs. 5,71,000 and paid (when payment could be compelled) by the Hindu chiefs who had been there before the Mughals came, and who very likely will be there after the British are gone. The Emperors were fond of the town of Ajmir, where a famous stock of Persian darvishes or hermits (the Chisties) had taken root. They also intermarried with the houses of Jaipur and Jodhpur; but the province can only be reckoned nominally among Subahs.\n\nDihli was a province of average size, with a capital of the same name, and a revenue of one and a half kror from land.\n\nLahor was a rather larger one, with a capital of the same name and a revenue of nearly the same amount as Dihli.\n\nMult\u00e1n was a long strip of sandy country lying along the left bank of the Indus. Capital Mult\u00e1n: revenue, nearly forty lakhs.\n\nTattah was the rest of the Indus Valley; the revenue only about one lakh and sixty thousand Rupees.\n\nKashmir, \"the happy valley,\" and the scarcely less beautiful hills and dales of Kabul, were the Piedmont of the Asian Italy, valued for their climate, sport, and scenery. The revenue given by Abul Fazl is esti-\nmated in sheep and rice, with the exception of that of K\u00e1b\u00fal Sircar which is stated at twenty lakhs. Thomas estimates the total yield at no less than 80 lakhs. The aggregate of these items amounts to a little below 10 krors; but they include some S\u00e1yar items, though how much cannot be deter-\nmined. In one or two instances in which these are stated separately, they are from 2 to 4 per cent.\n\nSuch was the territorial constitution of the Chaghtai territory till the conquests of Aurangz\u00e9b. In 1694, Sr. Manucci made a fresh list of the provinces as they existed in his time; it is abstracted below, and the num-\nbering has been brought into correspondence with the annexed sketch-map.\n\n1.\u2014Bengal, without Orissa, was assessed at over four krors (which is three times more than in the other lists).\n2.\u2014BAHAR, ...........................................

But such, just a century after the completion of Abul Fazl\u2019s record, were the collections according to a European residing at the Imperial Court in a position of trust. Mr. Thomas calls Manucci \u201ca competent witness at head-quarters.\u201d He does not name the Subahs always as they are named in other lists that have come down to us; and he gives some names (such as \u201cBakar\u201d and \u201cUjain\u201d that are not found elsewhere. And he estimates the returns of some higher and those of other lower than they are usually reckoned. But it must be admitted that his aggregate tallies pretty closely\nwith the totals of other lists. Of these the mean is about three and a half krons, while his total, as we see, is nearly thirty-two; and there can be little doubt that this is near the correct figure. It is not, however, so clear what it represents in the modern figures. It is true that the Rupee of those days contained about the same quantity of silver as does that of our own days: but we have the positive testimony of Manucci that the exchange value of the Rupee in the European currency of his day was \"trente sols,\" or fifteen pence. In this he is confirmed by Tavernier, who says that fourteen Rupees were worth twenty-one livres tournois. Manucci's total therefore would be nearly worth twenty millions sterling.\n\nIt is a farther question, whether the separate revenue was equal in amount, or nearly so? The answer seems to be that the separate revenue was derived from sources too vague and fluctuating to be so estimated. It chiefly came from escheats and fines\u2014to speak according to European usage\u2014and the amount must have depended upon the character of the sovereign, the longevity of incumbents, and similar things, to an extent which would make it impossible to make an approximation for any one year.\n\nLastly, it is to be noted that, besides the provinces named above, the Empire had, for a few years of Aurangzib's reign, a claim\u2014more or less practically exercised\u2014to parts of the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, and the Malabar and Coromandel Coasts. But these were never made into regularly organised Subahs, nor did they appear upon the rolls, and they soon became totally independent.\n\n2. Land and Fresh-water Shells of Kashmir.\u2014By W. THEOBALD.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nEnumerates 53 species of shells noticed by the author and 11 recorded species, in all 64; of these two are new species, Hemiplecta Jamuensis and Pisidium Hydaspicola, and a variety of Helicarion Flemingii, Pf. var. altivagus, Theob. which may possibly be entitled to specific rank when more specimens have been examined.\n\nThe PRESIDENT called attention to the importance of local lists like the present. Kashmir is a country on the borders of two great zoological regions, the Pal\u00e6arctic and the Oriental, and like similar countries elsewhere, it possesses a fauna in which the distinctive forms of the two regions are blended in a very curious way. In the upper Indus valley the fauna is purely Pal\u00e6arctic, but in Kashmir itself there is an admixture of Pal\u00e6arctic forms with Oriental types allied for the most part to animals inhabiting the Himalayas.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in July last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by their respective Societies or Editors.\n\nBerlin.

Medlicott, Esq.\n\nThe Secretary announced that Capt. C. H. Cowan had intimated his desire to withdraw from the Society.\n\nThe President announced the death of Mr. Henry Blochmann, Philological Secretary to the Society, and said\u2014\n\nWe miss from amongst our number to-night, one who has for so long been a most prominent and valuable member, one to whom we have so often listened with pleasure, and who has added so greatly to the welfare of the Society, that it will be long before we shall be able to reconcile ourselves to the loss we have sustained.\n\nIt would be impossible for me to express adequately all that we have lost in Mr. Blochmann; there is no member who has worked more earnestly, more energetically, or more constantly for our Society, no one who has equal experience as an officer, no one whose death could have inflicted a greater blow to the progress of the work in which we are all interested. In every department of the Society's affairs; in the editing of our publications, in the conduct of our correspondence, in the supervision of our finances, in the arrangement of our Library, a foremost part, and very frequently the principal labour, was cheerfully taken by our late Philological Secretary, and his death has left us simply unable to replace him. Apart from his high merits as an Oriental Scholar and his energetic participation in the Society's affairs, he was beloved and esteemed by all who knew him, for his kindly manner and his willingness on all occasions to undertake any task that was necessary. Heartily good-natured, thoroughly independent, and with true German love of hard work, he could equally be depended upon for an honest original opinion on any subject that came before us; and for any labour that might be necessary for the Society.\n\nIt has been said very often, and the fact cannot be repeated too frequently, that the well-being and usefulness of this Society depend chiefly upon its Secretaries. Very few indeed have held the post so long as Mr.\nBlochmann, who has been Philological Secretary of the Society for nearly 11 years. It is unnecessary that I should give you any detailed account of the work he has done in the meantime, nor should I be competent to do so if it were necessary; I must leave the task to those who are more conversant with Oriental literature. The Journal and Proceedings of the Society, crowded with Mr. Blochmann's contributions, answer for him, and it is impossible that any member needs to be reminded of the value of our late Secretary's labours. Mr. Blochmann's studies, as you are all doubtless aware, embraced a wide circle of Arabic and Persian literature, but his especial study, the subject on which he had probably acquired more knowledge than has ever been attained by any other European, or perhaps even by any native of India, was the History of India under the Muhammadan rule. On all subjects relating to Muhammadan India the extent and accuracy of his knowledge was something wonderful; and he spared no effort to obtain fresh information. Manuscripts, inscriptions, coins,\u2014all records of the times,\u2014have been noticed by him frequently and fully in the Journals and Proceedings of the Society. His death in the midst of his career and in the prime of life has deprived the world of a mass of information as to the history of this country, information which is not likely to be again attained for a long time to come by any single individual. His most important work, the translation of the Ain-i-Akbari, has unfortunately been left incomplete.\n\nAll these writings are before the world, but a large amount of work falls upon our Secretaries, and is entirely unrecorded; indeed it is as a rule only known to members of the Council. I will mention but one instance of Mr. Blochmann's labours. For the last ten or twelve years a catalogue of the Society's Library has been a most urgent want. Attempt after attempt has been made to prepare one, but all have failed, because no officer of the Society, who possessed the requisite knowledge, could afford the time, and was willing to give the very large amount of supervision necessary. The difficulty is due to the great number of languages represented, and the wide range of subjects treated in the books contained in the Society's Library. At length last year the task was undertaken by Mr. Blochmann, and under his superintendence, and in a very great measure by his personal labour, a complete list of the books has at length been made, and if, as I hope, something like an accurate Catalogue is published in the course of the next few months, the members of this Society will be indebted to Mr. Blochmann alone for the boon they will obtain.\n\nThe following is a brief sketch of our late friend's career. He was born at Dresden on the 7th January, 1838, and was first educated at\nthe Kreuz-Schule of that city. From 1855 to about September 1857, he studied Hebrew and Oriental languages at the University of Leipzig under Professor Fleischer. He afterwards studied for a short time in Paris, and in 1858 he left Europe for India, being chiefly induced to this step by his love for oriental studies, and he landed in Calcutta, nearly 20 years ago, in September, 1858. At first he appears, for want of employment, to have been reduced to great straits, and he at one time enlisted in the army, but he soon found a friend in Captain Nassau Lees, then Principal of the Calcutta Madrassa, by whose assistance Mr. Blochmann was appointed to a subordinate post in the Madrassa College in 1860. He left this post in the beginning of 1862 to become Professor of Mathematics at the Doveton College, a post he held for about three years. He studied meantime energetically, and in 1865 took the degree of Master of Arts in the Calcutta University, having chosen Hebrew as the subject for his examination. It is related that when, after some difficulty, examiners were found competent to decide upon his proficiency, they found the student was far better acquainted with the language than they were themselves. In the same year Mr. Blochmann rejoined the Madrassa as Assistant Professor, Captain Nassau Lees remaining as the Principal until 1869, when he retired, and at first no successor was appointed, but a committee exercised supervision, whilst Mr. Blochmann was placed in charge of the College, retaining his title of Professor. He was appointed to officiate as Principal in 1870 and was made Principal in 1875. How, in the course of the time that he has held the office, he has endeared himself to the Students of the College and to the whole Muhammadan community, is shewn by the general sorrow for his death and by the Muhammadan meeting of last week to do honour to his memory.\n\nMr. Blochmann joined the Society in 1864 and entered the Council, when he became Secretary in succession to Mr. Heeley, in 1868. He retained the office until his death. He had been ailing slightly for about a month, and although, as all may remember, the most regular of attendants at our monthly Meetings, he was absent on the last occasion in July. Still no danger was suspected, he was supposed to be suffering from a slight attack of fever, and he had made arrangements to leave Calcutta for a short time and go to Dalhousie.\n\nOnly three or four days before his death, was there any suspicion of the real cause of his illness, renal disease, and even then no acute symptoms presented themselves. On the very day when he had proposed to leave Calcutta his illness increased, and the next morning he was found\nto be suffering from severe ur\u00e6mic poisoning. He fell into an unconscious state about midday, and died three hours afterwards.\n\nThe Council of the Society desire to preserve some Memorial of our late Secretary, in recognition of the valuable services rendered by him, for so many years, to the Society and to Oriental Literature. A Committee has been appointed to consider the best means of carrying out this project, and it has been determined to apply to the Members of the Society and to Mr. Blochmann's other friends for subscription towards a memorial bust or portrait.\n\nI have only to add in conclusion, that I propose, with the consent of the Members present, as a tribute of respect to our late Secretary, to close the present meeting and to take as read such papers as remain for consideration. I would also suggest that an expression of our sorrow, and sympathy with their loss, should be sent to Mr. Blochmann's widow and family.\n\nThe President announced, in consequence of the death of Mr. Blochmann, that Mr. C. H. Tawney had been appointed Member of Council and Philological Secretary.\n\nThe President announced that Mr. E. Gay had resigned his office as Member of Council and Treasurer to the Society in consequence of his departure from Calcutta, and that Mr. H. Beverley had been appointed in his place.\n\n---\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in July last.\n\nTransactions, Proceedings and Journals,\n\npresented by the respective Societies or Editors.\n\nBaltimore.

Elliott, had intimated their desire to withdraw from the Society.\n\nThe Secretary announced that the Rev. Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle had been appointed Philological Secretary, in the room of Mr. C. H. Tawney, who had conducted the duties temporarily.\n\nThe Secretary read a notice of a prospectus received from Dr. Barth, of a new Chart of the Moon, to be published in 25 Sections, by W. G. Lohrmann.\n\nMr. Joh. Ambr. Barth of Leipzig has sent the prospectus of a new chart of the moon, by W. G. Lohrmann. The chart consists of 25 Sections with two tables of explanations. There is added to it a descriptive text by Dr. J. F. Julius Schmidt, Director of the Observatory in Athens. The price is \u00a32 10s.\n\nThe chart was begun by Lohrmann in 1821. The first part was published in 1824. In 1840 Lohrmann died, and for some years the work remained in abeyance. But in 1851 Dr. J. Schmidt was prevailed upon by the publisher, W. A. Barth, and after his death, his son F. A. Barth, to continue it with the assistance of W. Opelt of Dresden, and after his death (1863) of his son, Lieut. Opelt. At last the work was finished in 1874. To the chart will be added a text, describing its method; also a catalogue of all selenographic positions calculated by Opelt. There will be a brief explanation of each section, in which the more important differences of height will be noted, and all remarkable points noticed. The principal merit of the work lies in Lohrmann's drawing, which closely resembles that of Maedler's famous chart. His object was, to represent as faithfully as possible the mountains and the colour of the moon, and to execute the measurements and drawings according to methods approved of by science. Accordingly he chose the orthographic projection of the visible hemisphere of the moon and the mean libration, drew the mountains according to Lehmann's method, and without indications of their varying illumination. Owing to the long delay in the execution of the work, there is a noticeable want of uniformity in the colouring of the plates. Maedler's chart is much more satisfactory in this respect.\n\nMr. Mallet exhibited a Meteorite, forwarded to the Indian Museum by Hugh Fraser, Esq., from Gorakhpur.\nThe two meteoric stones now exhibited fell near Dandapur (Lat. 26\u00b0, 56' N., Long. 83\u00b0, 58' E.), a village 5 miles W. N. W. of the town of Pudrownan, in the Gorakhpur district, on the evening of the 5th of September last, and were forwarded to the Indian Museum by Mr. Hugh Fraser, Assistant Magistrate of Gorakhpur, with all the information he could procure respecting the occurrence, which is as follows: \"About 5 p.m. some people in the villages of Barchua and Dandapur saw what they describe as a wedge-shaped cloud coming up from the north-east. It advanced from that direction, and seemed to descend, and then there was a noise like thunder. They say their eyes closed, but it is not clear from the wording whether on account of a flash, or on account of fear. The fragments fell\u2014one through the house of Salamdari; one in a field on the boundaries of the neighbouring village Sirsa, about 300 paces distant from the first, and another, not yet recovered, in a tank. In the two first places a hole was made in the ground about a span in depth and a cubit in diameter; there was some delay in digging out, and when taken out, the stones were not warm.\"\n\nAccording to the above account, the fragments fell at a distance of some 300 paces from each other. It will be observed, notwithstanding, that on the fractured faces they fit each other exactly, the two forming the halves of a single stone, which prior to its fracture was covered entirely by the usual brownish-black crust. The larger fragment weighs about 6 lbs. 9 oz., and the smaller about 5 lbs. 14 oz., the two together forming an irregular, somewhat wedge-shaped mass, measuring about 7 inches by 7, with an average thickness of about 3 inches, but thinning off considerably towards one side. The specific gravity of the larger piece was found to be 3\u00b729.\n\nOn a fresh fracture, the meteorite is seen to consist of a minutely crystalline white mass, composed of translucent grains of one or more silicates, through which specks with metallic lustre are plentifully distributed. Most of these are small, so that they are distinctly visible only under the lens, but others are of larger dimensions, one or two being about an eighth of an inch in diameter. The greater number of these are troilite or pyrrhotite, but a considerable proportion are of nickeliferous iron. The occurrence of phosphorus, also, seems to indicate the presence of schreibersite. On the faces of original fracture the meteorite presents an ochry mottling due to the oxidation of the iron; but there is no sign of the crust that covers all the rest of the surface. In this connection it will be interesting to notice whether the third piece, if it can be recovered, should appear to have been originally united to these.\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1. Some further notes on K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa.\u2014By G. A. Grierson. B. C. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper contains some legendary traditions current in Beh\u00e1r, concerning the famous poet K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa, who was born at D\u00e1modarpur, a village near the town of Achait in Tirhut. They are all chiefly illustrative of his great powers of improvisation. The first legend narrates a story of his youth; how being at first little better than an idiot, he afterwards came to be possessed of his unrivalled power over the Sanskrit language by the special interposition of the goddess Durg\u00e1. The second legend is an amusing story about K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa at the court of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sibhai Singh. This R\u00e1j\u00e1 was a great patron of pandits; but he was wont to regulate his patronage not by their learning, but by their weight. K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa being a small lean man, persuaded a fat and unwieldy shepherd to accompany him and personate his guru, promising that he would do all the talking, while the shepherd should never utter a word. The ruse succeeded. The shepherd was installed as chief pandit at the R\u00e1j\u00e1's court, and K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa as his disciple. One day, however, the shepherd forgot himself and spoke a word in his vulgar idiom in the presence of the king and his court. K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa, with great presence of mind, composed a verse on the spur of the moment, in which he made an ingenious defence of his guru's blunder. This, of course, did not save the shepherd, but made K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa famous throughout the three worlds. The third legend relates to the manner in which K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa procured his admission to the court of king Bhoja, by first simulating gross ignorance and afterwards confounding the king's chief pandit by a sudden display of his remarkable power in composing extempore verses in Sanskrit. The fourth legend relates an incident at king Bhoja's court; how K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa by means of some ingeniously worded verses outwitted three pandits, who through their great powers of memory had hitherto confounded all claimants to the king's favour. The fifth legend relates how in the early years of his ignorance K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa conciliated his wife, who was a learned woman and acted to him the part of a Xanthippe, by his miraculously acquired knowledge. The sixth legend tells of a narrow escape of K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa from the clutches of a man-devouring pis\u00e1cha by his gift of improvising verses. The next two legends relate two other incidents at the court of king Bhoja, which also illustrate the ready power of K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa of composing Sanskrit verse on the spur of the moment. Then follows a legend, showing how K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa used to do his marketing in improvised Sanskrit verse. The series concludes with a legend, giving a conversation between K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa and his wife in extempore verses during a morning walk by the side of a tank covered with lotuses.\nA few, hitherto apparently unknown, Sanskrit verses in praise of contentment are added, which are universally attributed to K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa in that part of the country.\n\nIn conclusion, Mr. Grierson promises to communicate at some future time similar legendary accounts of other famous heroes and heroines of Mithil\u00e1.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n2. Description of a new Lepidopterous Insect belonging to the Genus Thaumantis.\u2014By J. Wood-Mason.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper contains additional remarks on the fine butterfly collected by Mr. Ossian Limborg in the Taoo mountains of Tenasserim and described in the 'Proceedings' for July, 1877, p. 163. In the collection made by Mr. Limborg were 225 other species of Lepidoptera, from fifty to sixty of which are undescribed.\n\nBoth the specimens of the new species, Thaumantis Louisa, are males, and each is furnished with a tuft of erectile hairs on the hind wing. It is suggested that these may be odoriferous organs, like similar tufts on the different parts of the body in the males of some Brazilian butterflies.\n\nThe paper is accompanied by a plate from a characteristic coloured drawing by Professor Westwood.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\n3. On the Diurnal Variations of Rainfall-frequency at Calcutta.\u2014By H. F. Blanford, F. G. S., F. Z. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nA table is given of the occurrence of rain at each hour of the day in each month of the year, merely the fact of occurrence and not the amount of rainfall being noted. It is shewn that the proportion of rain falling at different hours of the day varies with the season. In the summer monsoon the smallest rainfall is at midnight, the greatest about 2 p.m., the time of maximum temperature. In the dry and hot season, February to May, the maximum rainfall is between 6 and 8 p.m. owing to the evening storms. In October and November the rainfall appears to have a similar distribution to that prevailing in the rains. In December, the recorded falls are too few in number to lead to any conclusion, but in January, the period of the winter rains, the maximum rainfall appears to coincide with the period of minimum temperature in the early morning.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n4. Snow-fall of 1878, in Kashmir.\u2014By R. Lydekker.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis was a short paper on the unusual snow-fall of the past winter in the Kashmir Himalayas; the author mentioned that many of the passes were still blocked with snow in the late summer, and also referred to the great destruction of animal life caused by this unusual quantity of snow.\n\nMr. Blanford said that the excessive snow-fall referred to by Mr. Lydekker, seemed to have prevailed throughout the outer Himalayas, and suggested that this might have been the cause of the comparatively low temperature observed in India during the last hot season.\n\nDr. Cayley observed that there was a great variability at the time of the autumn snow-fall; he had crossed the Zogi-la in December, when it was still free from snow, while in other years it was thickly covered at a much earlier period.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\n5. A New Pr\u00e1krit Grammar by Chanda.\u2014By Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle.\n\nThe Pr\u00e1krit Grammar which I have the pleasure to exhibit to the Society to-night, was given to me a few months ago by my friend, Pandit R\u00e1m Misra of Banaras. It came originally from some place in the State of Alwar. There is at present, I believe, only one other copy of this work known. It is in the possession of Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1l\u00e1 Mitra, and is, as I am informed by him, not complete. I have not seen it myself. The copy, in my possession, has every appearance of being a complete one; for it contains rules on all the various forms of Pr\u00e1krit (including the Apabhram\u015ba) which are usually treated of in Pr\u00e1krit Grammars.\n\nMy MS. closes with the usual formula, containing the name of the work and of its author. The name of the latter is simply Chanda (\u091a\u0902\u0926\u093e). That of the former is variously given. At the end of the whole work, and of the first chapter it is simply lak\u1e63ha\u1e47a, \"characteristic\" or \"mark\"; at the end of the second chapter it is pr\u00e1krita lak\u1e63ha\u1e47a \"Pr\u00e1krit characteristics\"; at the end of the third chapter it is pr\u00e1krita prak\u0101\u015ba \"elucidation of the Pr\u00e1krit\"; the latter being the same name, which also Vararuchi's well-known Pr\u00e1krit Grammar bears.\n\nThe work is perhaps the shortest that I have met with on Pr\u00e1krit Grammar. The whole of it is contained on 19 leaves. It is divided into four chapters. The first chapter is on declension (vibhaktividh\u00e1nam). It contains 45 rules, and treats of the declension of nouns, pronouns and numerals. Most of the rules throughout the Grammar have a short com-\nmentary, and all of them have typical examples added. The second chapter is called svaravidh\u0101nam. Accordingly it ought to treat of the changes of vowels; but more than half of it consists of rules on other subjects. First there are 14 rules on vowel changes; then follow rules on the interchange of cases, on peculiar Pr\u00e1krit suffixes and particles, and, finally, even one on the change of the consonant n to d. Altogether there are 45 rules. The third chapter treats of the changes of consonants, both single and conjunct (rya\u00f1janavidh\u0101nam). It contains 41 rules. The fourth chapter treats of the secondary Pr\u00e1krit dialects in the following orders\u2014the Apabhram\u1e63a, the Pais\u00e1chi, the Magadh\u00ed or, as it is called in this Grammar, M\u00e1gadhik\u00e1, lastly, the \u015aaurasen\u00ed. To each of these dialects only one rule is devoted. In conclusion, one more rule is added. It contains a \u015bloka, enumerating six languages (bh\u0101sh\u0101s) as well known ones, viz., Sanskrit, Pr\u00e1krit, Apabhram\u1e63a, Pais\u00e1chi, Magadh\u00ed, \u015aaurasen\u00ed. The whole chapter therefore, consists only of 5 rules.\n\nThis Grammar has some very striking peculiarities in which it differs, I believe, from all other Pr\u00e1krit grammars. One is, that it commences with the rules on declension, while all others begin with those on vowel-changes. Again the rules on the particles, which are here added on to the chapter on vowels, are in the grammar of Hema Chandra and others which follow his arrangement, appended to the chapter on consonants, while in Vararuchi and the grammars of his class they have a separate chapter allotted to them. Again the order of the subordinate Pr\u00e1krit dialects is here reversed, the Apabhram\u1e63a preceding the others, while in the other grammars (Hema Chandra, e.g.) it comes last. Barring the Apabhram\u1e63a, however, Chanda follows the order of Vararuchi who has Pais\u00e1chi, Magadh\u00ed, Saurasen\u00ed, not that of Hema Chandra, who takes them in the reversed order, Saurasen\u00ed, Magadh\u00ed, Pais\u00e1chi. Again it is remarkable that Chanda has no separate rules on conjugation. So far as he adverts to conjugational forms at all, they are explained under the rules treating of changes, vowels and consonants. Again the most curious peculiarity, perhaps, is that the famous rule of the Pais\u00e1chi dialect, which substitutes hard for soft consonants (e.g., r\u00e1ch\u00e1 for r\u00e1j\u00e1 king), is given by Chanda (3, ii) as an ordinary rule of the principal Pr\u00e1krit dialect (the so-called Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtr\u00ed). This fact, by the way, will explain the apparent meagreness of Chanda's chapter on the subordinate dialects, as compared with other grammars. This meagreness, I do not think can be taken as an indication of incompleteness of the MS. For though only one rule is devoted to each dialect, yet that rule relates to the most striking peculiarity of each. The omission of the other rules, therefore, appears to have been original and intentional. There are, besides, a great number of minor peculiarities. It would take too long, however, to mention them here.\nAs regards the relation of Chanda to other Prakrit grammarians, chronologically and otherwise, I have not met with any certain indications. A more thorough investigation may, perhaps, bring to light some. Two rules I have discovered (Chanda 2, 3, 4) which are almost identical with two rules of Hema Chandra (1, 8, 6); but while in the latter they are in their proper order, they do not appear to be so in the former, (where they ought to be 2, 4, 3). This fact seems to indicate, that Chanda was acquainted with Hema Chandra's grammar, the rules of which he occasionally made use of in his own way. I have discovered only one rule in Chanda (viz., 2, 3), the equivalent of which does not exist in Hema Chandra's great grammar. But on the whole, Chanda's small grammar covers the whole of the ground occupied by Hema Chandra's large work. Some things are expressed more concisely, many more of minor importance are omitted altogether. This will explain the smallness of the size of the work as compared with the extent of the ground occupied by it. On the other hand, there are some points, as e.g., the order of the subordinate dialects, which seem to show that Chanda was acquainted with and occasionally followed, the school of Vararuchi. Still the peculiarities of Chanda are sufficiently numerous and striking, to justify us in vindicating for him a place of his own among Prakrit grammarians.\n\nThe reading of the following paper was postponed.\n\n6.

R. Mallet communicated the following correction, received from Mr. Hugh Fraser, regarding the particulars already reported of the fall of the Dandapur meteorite (see 'Proceedings' for November).\n\n\"A few days ago I made enquiries on the spot regarding the third fragment of meteorite, said to have fallen at the same time as the two fragments I sent in September. I find that no other fragment fell, and the police in their report evidently mixed up two stories about one fragment which fell on the border of a tank or jhil. I can also find no one who says he saw anything like a cloud or smoke, as was reported. The story they told me was that about 5 in the afternoon a loud noise, like \"sun sun sun\" was heard. Some say it seemed to approach from the north-east; but others say it seemed merely to be straight above. Then there was a loud report like a single clap of thunder, but nothing was visible, and they thought it was some god passing, or a fire-work like a bomb. One fragment fell in a darzi's house-yard. The earth was hard there, so it did not make a hole. No one was present at the moment, but when they came up, a ghari afterwards, the stone was not hot, and had a whitish flush over it (as far as I can make out) like charcoal when it cools. The other fragment fell in some marshy land, distant 700 paces, as far as I could measure\nthere were sugar-cane fields and a tank partly in the way), from th darzi's house. Some people who were in their fields not far off searched for it, and found it buried about a cubit deep in the mud. It was not hot when they found it.\n\nThe general account is that the day was still. There was a break in the rains at the time, and except for a few not heavy clouds to the south and west, the sky was bright and clear. It was useless attempting to get any estimate of the duration of time during which the whizzing sound was heard. The crack is said to have been heard for 4 kos (about 8 miles) all round. I was afraid this account is somewhat vague and useless, but it is the best that can be got from the natives who were on the spot.\"\n\nMr. Lydekker exhibited the palate of a large anthropoid ape which had lately been discovered by Mr. Theobald in the Siwaliks of the Punjab; and made the following remarks:\n\nThe jaw was that of a female animal, as indicated by the small size of the canine, and indicated an animal intermediate in size between the Orang and the Gorilla. The molar teeth are of the form which is common to man and the living anthropoid apes; the false molars are, however, much narrower than in any of the latter, and are indeed relatively narrower than in man; the small size of the last molar and of the incisor are also characters in which the jaw has a human character. Of the living apes the Chimpanzee makes the nearest approach to the fossil, though the premolars are much wider in that species. The straight line of the molars, the relatively larger canine, and the diastema are quadrumanous characters.\n\nThe specimen is of great interest as it is the first of the large anthropoid apes discovered in India; it seems to afford evidence of a connection of Western Africa, the land of the Gorilla and Chimpanzee, on the one hand, and of Sumatra and Borneo the home of the Orang, on the other, with Northern India. The specimen will shortly be described and figured in the \"Records\" of the Geological Survey.\n\nDr. Rajendra Lal Mitra exhibited a new silver coin which he had received for identification from Mr. H. Rivett-Carnac. The coin was in a fair state of preservation, and weighed 34 grains, or a little over half an obolus. Its periphery was irregular, but the inscription on the exergue of the reverse, was complete. The obverse of the coin bore a head of the Shah type in profile, facing the left; and the reverse, a peacock with out-stretched wings and expanded tail, as common in the peacock coins of Kumara Gupta. The peacock, according\nto the Pur\u00e1\u1e47as, is the vehicle of Kum\u00e1ra alias K\u00e1rtika, the god of war; and\nthe Gupta prince, having the same name, adopted the vehicle of his name-sake\nfor his symbol. No attempt, however, was made to change the character of\nthe head so as to make it in any way accord with the likeness of the person on\nwhose coin it was struck. The likeness is the same on the coins of nineteen\ndifferent kings of the Sh\u00e1h dynasty of Guzerat, as also on the mintage of Ku-\nm\u00e1ra Gupta, and on the specimen under notice. Even the horned helmet,\nfirst borrowed from the Indo-Bactrians, remains unchanged, though it is not\nat all likely that Kum\u00e1ra Gupta ever bore such a head-dress. In so far the type\nremains the same for, as far as we are at present informed, 22 or 23 reigns;\nbut the artistic excellence of the design deteriorated markedly in course of\ntime. The earliest Sh\u00e1h coins are remarkable for the high relief of the\nhead; the eye so formed as to show the swelling of the eye-ball; the lips\npouting; and the locks of hair behind the head shown in profusion. In the\nspecimen under notice, the relief is low; the eye, a full one, formed of two\ncurving lines on a profile face, as was usually the case in Egyptian sculp-\nture; the lips indicated by two dots; and the locks attenuated to two or\nthree wavy lines. In front of the head there is a monogram, but it is par-\ntially obliterated, and its character cannot be fully made out. In the Sh\u00e1h\ncoins the monogram contains the date. In the earlier Sh\u00e1h coins a Greek\ninscription is also met with, but it does not occur in the specimen under\nnotice.\n\nOn the reverse the change is complete; the whole of the Sh\u00e1h\nsymbols being replaced by the peacock. The inscription round the peacock\nis in the Gupta character, and, on the whole, clear and well preserved.\nOwing, however, to the habit of the Gupta artists sadly neglecting the\nvowel-marks and the rules of grammar, it is difficult to determine with pre-\ncision the meaning of the record. The letters as read by Dr. Mitra are:\n\nThe first compound letter is unmistakeable; it is the well known S\u1e5b\u0301,\nthe auspicious symbol invariably used before proper names in Indian writ-\nings. As far as reading is concerned the next four are clear enough;\nthe Dr. reads them Nayasena or \"he who has justice for his army;\" but\nhe could not positively assert whether they are the components of a proper\nname, or those of an epithet. Coming after S\u1e5b\u0301 they seem to indicate a\nproper name, while their meaning suggests the idea of an epithet. The\nkey to the solution of the question lies in the next letter; but it is extreme-\nly doubtful. Its counterpart has been met with in some Indo-Sassanian\ncoins, (Thomas' 'Prinsep,' plate XLI), and there it is equivalent to \u1e5b\u0301 (de);\nbut by reading it \u1e5b\u0301 here no meaning can be extracted from it. The mark\nfor e is a spur on top, as seen very indistinctly on the letter s in Sena; but\nhere it is indicated by a hook hanging behind. This hook has been repeatedly found to stand for i, and it gradually lengthened till it became the modern ik\u0101ra in N\u0101gari writing. Dr. Mitra was disposed therefore to take it for an i, making the syllable di. Assuming then, the inherent vowel of the preceding \u0905 to be a long one, he got adi \u201cfirst,\u201d and, linking it with the next two letters, the result is adir\u0101ja or \u201cthe first king\u201d, the founder of the family. The next two letters \u092a and \u0930 should in that case be taken for putra \u201cson\u201d\u2014\u201cthe son of the auspicious first king Nayasena.\u201d The omission of the u under p is not material, but the spur for r under the t is not common (under the first word Sri it is distinctly shown,) but without assuming the omission no sense can be extracted from pata. The letters \u0930 and \u0905 with dots over them may safely be taken for r\u00e1j\u00f1a, the genitive singular of r\u00e1jan \u2018a king.\u2019 The name of the son is Taramana, which, there is no reason to doubt, is the same with Toram\u00e1na, the sovereign whose name occurs in the History of K\u0101shmir and in the Iran boar and the Gwaliar inscriptions. The letter r of the name is very faint and indistinct. The last four letters call for no remark. The first three, \u0930 \u0905 and \u0905, are unmistakable, and the last, (\u0930) though somewhat smudgy, is suggested by the context. The result is ra\u1e47an\u0101tha, \u201cthe lord of war.\u201d The restored version according to this reading would be:\n\nSri Nayasenadir\u0101ja-putra-r\u00e1j\u00f1a Toram\u00e1na ra\u1e47an\u0101tha.\n\nAnd in English \u201c(The coin) of the king Toram\u00e1na, the lord of battle, son of the auspicious first king Nayasena.\u201d\n\nThis interpretation, however, is open to a serious objection. In the History of K\u0101shmir, Toram\u00e1na is described to be the son of one Sresh\u1e6dhasena and not Nayasena, and, unless the latter be accepted as an alias of the former, the interpretation must be wrong. Dr. Mitra was disposed to believe that the two names belonged to the same person; but if this be inadmissible, it would be necessary to take the letter \u0905 to be a remnant of Deva, and pata to be the remnant of pati a \u2018lord,\u2019 the meaning of the whole being thus rendered\u2014\n\n\u201c(The coin) of the auspicious (Sri) king Toram\u00e1na, the divine (deva), the master of kings (r\u00e1japati), the lord of battle (ra\u1e47an\u0101tha), who had justice for his army (nayasena).\u201d As the word Toram\u00e1na cannot be converted into an epithet, the words Nayasena Deva cannot be taken to be the name of the king. Thus whatever interpretation is accepted the coin must be attributed to Toram\u00e1na, and a strong proof of this is afforded by the coin described by Mr. Thomas in his edition of Prinsep\u2019s Essays (II, p. 339) as an \u201cunpublished and unique\u201d specimen, which, in weight, character and devices, closely corresponds with the specimen now under notice. The only difference between the two lies in the inscription; but as Mr. Thomas\u2019 specimen was very imperfect, and nothing beyond the name could be satisfac-\ntorily read on it, it is of no importance; not to advert to the fact of it having been formerly a common practice with kings to change the legends and inscriptions of their coins.\n\nDr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra next exhibited some Hindi MSS. which he has lately obtained from B\u00e1bu Brajan\u00e1th Bandyop\u00e1dhy\u00e1ya of Jaypur.\n\nThe first work he noticed was named Sarfar\u00e1j-chandrik\u00e1. It is a puthi of 92 folia, each 8 x 5 inches. It opens with a brief notice of Sarfar\u00e1j, the hero, who is said to have been the 10th in descent from Sa\u1e45kara Ach\u00e1rya, the great Vedantist. It is stated that Sa\u1e45kara had four sons: 1st, To\u1e6daka Ach\u00e1rya, 2nd, Padma Ach\u00e1rya, 3rd, Udyama Ach\u00e1rya, 4th, B\u00e1lagovinda; and the sons of these formed the ten founders of the Da\u015ban\u00e1mi sect. One of them was, (3) Omk\u00e1ra, and his descendants were successively, (4) Purushottama, (5) Chandaka Giri, (6) N\u00e1r\u00e1ya\u1e47a Giri, (7) Dhy\u00e1na Giri, (8) Rajendra Giri, (9) Umrao Giri, (10) Sarfar\u00e1j. It was for the instruction of the last that the work was composed by Devakinandana Kavi, son of one Bhavas\u00e1gara, a Kanauji Br\u00e1hman. Judging from its style the work cannot be older than the 14th century. Its subject is mystic poetry, describing the amours of Krish\u1e47a and R\u00e1dh\u00e1. The codex is dated Samvat 1843, and is 90 years old.\n\nThe second work shown was a genealogical table of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jaypur. Its first folium was wanting, and therefore it was not possible to ascertain the name of the founder; but there were altogether 238 names, and, if the list be reliable, the founder must have lived in a remote period of antiquity. The later names have dates attached to them, and a short chronicle of the later kings is appended. The last folium is wanting, and nothing can be said of the authenticity of the work.\n\nThe third work has three names. On its cover it is called Kewat R\u00e1s\u00e1; in the introduction, Anantar\u00e1ya S\u00e1khl\u00e1ki V\u00e1r\u00e1t\u00e1, and in the colophon, Anantar\u00e1ya Sakhl\u00e1ki v\u00e1t. The word r\u00e1s\u00e1 appears to be a generic term for biography. It is used both for poetical and prose compositions, and occurs under different forms. In the oldest MS. of Chand the form most common is R\u00e1yas\u00e1, but in some later MSS. of that work R\u00e1s\u00e1 is sometimes met with. The better order of people at Ben\u00e1res invariably use the former; but in the Marha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u00e1 country the latter is preferred, the common term there for this class of composition being B\u00e1khars. R\u00e1s\u00e1 also prevails in R\u00e1jput\u00e1n\u00e1, where its synonyms are V\u00edd\u00e1sa, Charitra, and Prak\u00e1\u015ba. The work under notice was originally written in the ballad style by a family bard, or Bhat\u1e6da, of the hero, in Samvat 1347, but it was recast and a great deal of prose introduced into the text in the Samvat year 1854 by a scribe. The hero is Anantar\u00e1ya, a petty prince of Kol\u00e1pur P\u00e1\u1e6dan. He lived in the second half of the 14th century, and his struggles against Muhammedan ascendancy form the subject of the work.\nThe fourth was entitled Ham\u00edr R\u00e1s\u00e1. It is a small work of 54 folia 4to, written in the ballad style of Chand's Prithvir\u00e1j R\u00e1yas\u00e1, the language being old Hindi, but not quite so archaic as that of Chand's. The hero of the ballad is Ham\u00edr, the renowned sovereign of Ranthambor, whose name has served as a title of honor to many an Indian chief since his time. He lived in the time of 'Al\u00e1udd\u00edn, against whom he waged a devastating war for many years. The author of the work is Mahe\u015ba who was the family bard or Bhatta of the hero. The MS. is dated Samvat 1861, and is seventy-four years old. Dr. Mitra also submitted an English translation of the work by B\u00e1bu Brajan\u00e1th Bandyop\u00e1dhy\u00e1ya, and suggested that, after revision, it be printed in the Journal.\n\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1.

On Arvicola Indica, Gray, and its relations to the sub-genus, Nesokia, Gray.\u2014By Dr. J. Anderson.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\nMr. W. T. Blanford said that he had a few years ago, paid some attention to the genus Nesokia, but at that time he had not sufficient materials for a complete understanding of the species. Indian Zoologists were indebted to Dr. Anderson for working out a very difficult subject.\n\nAlthough Mr. Blanford was not quite convinced of the identity of Arvicola indica with Nesokia hardwickei, he quite agreed with Dr. Anderson that the specific name indica should be abandoned. The original figure of Arvicola indica in the \"Illustrations of Indian Zoology\" was probably taken from a bad native drawing of an ill-stuffed specimen. The name\nN. indica had been for so long generally applied to the other common Indian species that to transfer the specific term would cause great confusion, and should be avoided if possible. It must be understood, however, that if it be once conceded that the plate in Gray and Hardwicke's 'Illustrations' was undoubtedly intended to represent N. hardwickei, there was no choice in the matter, the rules of nomenclature must be followed and the species must stand henceforth as N. indica. It was no more practicable to substitute the later name N. hardwickei, than to apply the still more recent term of Spalacomyss indicus. He considered that in the absence of any type, there was a sufficient uncertainty as to what rat was represented by Arricola indica to justify the disuse of the specific name.\n\nThe speaker added that he had dug up some of the burrows of Neskia hardwickei and traced them over a large space of ground. One especially in Sind he had traced for between 40 and 50 yards and finally captured the inmates, an adult male and female, and two fully grown but younger animals, also a pair. The burrow was sometimes close to the surface, but in places as much as two feet beneath the ground, and contained a chamber lined with fragments of grass, but no store of grain.\n\n5. On the Indian Species of the genus Erinaceus.\u2014By Dr. J. Anderson.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\n6. Description of a supposed New Hedgehog from Muscat in Arabia.\u2014By W. T. Blanford, F. R. S., &c.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nAmongst a collection of small mammals, birds and reptiles sent to the writer by Col. Miles, the Political Agent at Muscat, were two specimens, one preserved in spirit, the other a dried skin, of an apparently undescribed Erinaceus, somewhat intermediate in characters between the Indian E. collaris and the Persian and Baluchistan E. macracanthus and E. megalotis, being larger than the former and having longer spines, whilst it is inferior in both respects to the two latter. The following is a brief description\u2014\n\nERINACEUS NIGER, sp. nov.\n\nBlack above; the spines from an inch to an inch and a quarter long on the hinder part of the back, black at the points for half an inch, then surrounded by a narrow white ring, then dusky to near the base. All the lower parts blackish brown. Ears long, rounded at the end, thinly clad outside and near the margin inside with short whitish hairs. Head sooty black with a few grey hairs intermixed. Feet of moderate size, each with five claws, the inner claw on each hind foot much smaller than the others. Length of a female specimen in spirit (and doubtless somewhat contracted)\nfrom nose to anus 5\u00b75, of tail 0\u00b79, of ear from orifice 1\u00b76, breadth of ear 0\u00b79, length of palma 0\u00b79, of planta 1\u00b725 inches. The skull is 1\u00b79 inches long and 0\u00b798 broad across the zygomatic arches.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\n7.

Sewell, Esq., M.C.S.\nJ. F. Browne, Esq., C.E., M.R.A.S.\nCapt. W. E. Gowan.\n\nThe following are candidates for ballot at the next meeting\u2014\n\n1. Lieut. C. R. Macgregor, Quarter Master, 44th N.I., Shillong, proposed by Dr. Anderson, seconded by G. H. Damant, Esq., C.S.\n2. Major J. Sconce, B.S.C., Depy. Surveyor General of India, proposed by Col. J. T. Walker, R.E., C.B., seconded by Capt. J. Waterhouse.\n3. J. F. Duthie, Esq., Superintendent Botanical Gardens, Saharunpore, proposed by Dr. G. King, seconded by Capt. J. Waterhouse.\n\nThe Secretary announced that Dr. W. J. Palmer had intimated his desire to withdraw from the Society on proceeding to England.\n\nIn the absence of Dr. Hoernle, Philological Secretary, Mr. C. H. TAWNEY read the following note on Jainism received from Mr. E. Thomas:\n\nJainism.\n\nAmong other questions put down for consideration and discussion at the 'Congr\u00e8s des Orientalistes' at Lyons, on the 31st of August last, there was formulated a subdivision devoted to \"Les Dja\u00efnas sont-ils d'anciens Bouddhistes ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 Sakia Mouni, ou des Bouddhistes modifi\u00e9s depuis les pers\u00e9cutions brahmaniques?\"\n\nAs I have paid some attention to this subject,* though unable to attend the Congress, and therefore unaware of the course taken in the dis-\n\n* 'Jainism; or, the Early Faith of Asoka' (Tr\u00fcbner, 1877); J.R.A.S., IX, p. 165.\ncussion, you will, perhaps, allow me to advert in your columns to a very important item, bearing upon the relative priority of the creeds of Jainism and Buddhism which has not hitherto been noticed; that is to say, how their reputed dates balance and adjust themselves inter se within the bounds of reasonable probability.\n\nThe Jains have a fixed and definite date for the Nirv\u00e1na of \"Mah\u00e1v\u00edra,\" their great saint, which is established by the concurrent testimony of their two sects, whose method of reckoning varies in itself, thereby securing, as it were, a double entry. The Svetambaras date in the era of Vikram\u00e1ditya, 57 B.C.; the Digambaras reckon by the Saka samvat, 78 A.D., and both arrive at the same figures of B.C. 526-7 for the death of Mah\u00e1v\u00edra. This calculation is equally supported by the dynastic lists, which satisfactorily fill in the period from the accession of \"P\u00e1laka, the lord of Avanti, [who] was anointed in that night in which......Mah\u00e1v\u00edra entered Nirv\u00e1na,\" \"to the four years of Saka,\" who immediately preceded Vikram\u00e1ditya.*\n\nOn the other hand, Buddha's date varies according to different authorities from the extreme points of B.C. 2420 to 453, and even is reduced so low as 370 B.C.; so that up to this time modern inquirers have been unable to concur in the determination of this epoch\u2020 further than to suspect, as we are taught by the Chinese, that the period was antedated from time to time, with the direct purpose of arrogating priority over other saints.\n\nNow, if the ascertained Jain date will serve to determine the era of Buddha, under the theory that Buddha himself was a disciple of Mah\u00e1v\u00edra, it will, in the fact, go far to establish the priority of the latter, and the pre-existence of the creed of which he was the twenty-fourth or last prophet.\n\nThe date of Buddha most largely accepted has been adopted from the Ceylon annals, which supply the figures 543 B.C.\u00a7 But, as was remarked by Mr. Turnour, who first investigated the local traditions, the acceptance of such a date involved an error, in default of the required period of sixty years (sixty-six); or, to use his own words, \"the discrepancy can only proceed from one of these two sources; viz., either it is an intentional perversion, adopted to answer some national or religious object, which is not readily discoverable; or Chandra Gupta is not identical with Sandra-\n\n* Dr. B\u00fchlcr, 'Indian Antiquary,' Vol. II, 363; J.R.A.S., IX, 15, note 2.\n\u2020 Prof. Wilson, J.R.A.S., XVI, 247; see also IX, n.s. 170; Beal, 'Travels of Fah-Hian,' pp. xxvi. 22; and Hioun-Thsang (Paris, 1857), I, p. 163.\n\u00a7 Lassen; St. Hilaire; M.

None, however, bring the question home so distinctly and in so quaintly graphic a way as Prof. Weber's translation of a passage from the 'Bhagavat\u00ed,'\u00b6 wherein the Chela, \"the holy Mah\u00e1vira's eldest pupil, Indrabh\u00fati\"\u2014\"houseless of Gautama's Gotra,\"\u2014begins to distrust the negative perfection of Jainism, in the terms of the text,\u2014\"Thereupon that holy Gautama, in whom faith, doubt, and curiosity arose, grew and increased, rose up. Having arisen, he went to the place where the sacred \u010cramana Mah\u00e1vira was.........After performing these [salutations] he praises him and bows to him. After so doing, not too close, not too distant, listening to him, bowing to him, with his face towards him, humbly waiting on him with folded hands, he thus spoke.......\"\n\nIn conclusion, I may recapitulate certain deductions, which I have suggested elsewhere.

Eclipsed for a time by the energy of the reformers, whose missionaries carried the Buddhist doctrines over so large a section of the globe, non-proselytizing Jainism has survived in its simplicity\u2014as the natural outcome of the ideas and aspirations of a primitive race\u2014still undisturbed in the land of their common birth; while Buddhism, with its fantastic elaborations, retains scant honour, and no place within the limits of its nidus in India proper. (Athen\u00e6um.)\n\nMr. W. T. Blanford exhibited the skin and skull of a bear from the neighbourhood of Gwadar, and read the following\u2014\n\nNote on the 'Mamh' or Baluchistan Bear, Ursus gedrosianus.\n\nIn November 1877, I exhibited to the Society a skin of the bear inhabiting Baluchistan.* In the belief that this skin, which was of a brown colour, indicated the existence of an animal previously undescribed, I proposed to call the species Ursus gedrosianus. From various sources, however, both before and after the publication of the paper, I had heard that a black bear occurs in Baluchistan, and it remained to be seen whether there were two species, or whether the colour was variable. Moreover as no skull had been examined, the affinities of the animal remained doubtful.\n\nI am indebted to my friend Major Mockler, who sent me the first specimen, for enabling me to clear up this difficulty. He has succeeded in procuring from the neighbourhood of Gwadar a second skin, in better condition than the first, and with the skull. The fur of the skin now sent, although far from being as black as in Himalayan specimens of Ursus torquatus, is very much darker than in the example previously received; the hairs are rather coarse, but there is no marked distinction from those of the Himalayan black bear. The Baluchistan skull is scarcely distinguishable from one in the Indian Museum, belonging to a female U. torquatus, recently living in the Zoological Gardens at Alipore.\u2020 The following are the dimensions of the skull from Gwadar.\n\n| Dimensions                          | Inches | Millim. |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Length from the lower margin of the foramen magnum to end of premaxillaries | 9\u00b77    | 246     |\n| Ditto from occiput to do             | 10\u00b745  | 265     |\n| Breadth across zygomatic arches      | 6\u00b79    | 175     |\n| Least breadth of cranium between orbits | 2\u00b79    | 73      |\n\n* P.

This, although fully adult, is so much smaller than any full grown skull of the Himalayan black bear, as to render it possible that the first skull, although precisely corresponding in size to that of a female *U. torquatus*, belonged to a male *U. gedrosianus*. The latter can, however, be but little more than a race or sub-species of the former, and is evidently a near ally.\n\nThe distribution of the Himalayan black bear, if the Baluchist\u00e1n form be classed as a sub-species, is very anomalous and remarkable. It is essentially a forest animal inhabiting the slopes of the Himalayas and parts of Southern China, and, it is said, even Eastern Siberia, whilst a closely allied species is found in Japan. But the extension of this Himalayan form to the mountains of Baluchistan has no known parallel amongst other animals. The fauna of Baluchistan is desert with an admixture of Indian types, but the Indian types are those of the Indian Peninsula and not of the Himalaya. The most characteristic Indian forms in Baluchistan* are such animals as *Sciurus palmarum*, *Gerbillus indicus*, *Athene brahma*, *Gymnornis flavicollis*, *Ortygornis ponticeriana*, &c., but nearly all are Peninsular types in India, prevalent in the drier parts of the Peninsula, and as a rule wanting both in the Himalayas and to the eastward of the Bay of Bengal. The only known Baluchistan species that range to the east of the Bay of Bengal are two birds, *Pratincola caprata* and *Butastur teesa*, and a lizard, *Calotes versicolor*. But all these abound in the plains of India, and no example has hitherto been known of an animal wanting in the Indian peninsula, but occurring in the Himalayas and also in the hills of Baluchistan. The very great difference in physical conditions between the damp forest-clad slopes of the Himalayas and the bare ranges of the Baluchistan highlands renders it very surprising that the same or closely allied types of bear should be found in both areas.\n\nThe Philological Secretary read the following extracts from a letter from B\u00e1bu Hari\u015bchandra to Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra on a new Hindi book\u2014Drista-k\u00fa\u1e6da of S\u00far D\u00e1s, with his own commentary.\n\n* Eastern Persia, Vol. II, p. 15.\n\"Two or three days ago I found quite a new Hindi book: Dristakuta of Sur Das with his own commentary. The book contains at the end a sketch of the author's biography, which differs from the story of his life hitherto known. The Varta of 84 Vaishnavas also contains some biography of Sur Dasji. It mentions that he was a Sarasvata Brahman, and was the son of poor parents, and had no brothers. His village was Sih near Delhi. This is the idea we Vaishnavas believe. But the poetry at the end of this new book says\u2014He was born in Prath Jagat Gotra. The founder of his family was Brahma Rao. In the family of Brahma Rao, there was a man Bhonchand or Chand in the time of Prithviraj. The king Prithviraj gave him Joala Desa. He had four sons. First Naresa, second Gunachand, third and fourth not told. Silachand was Gunachand's son. From him Birchand. In his family Harischand was most famous. He lived first in Agra, and then in Gopachal, where he got a son, name not told (or if the word Bir is a proper name, it must be Birchandra). He had seven sons: Krishnachand, Udanchand, Rupchand, Buddhichand, Devachand, Prabodhachand, and Surajchand. If the word Rupchand be taken as an adjective, the name of the fourth son would be Prakaschand. All these were slain in the Muhammadan battles, except one, Surajchand, who was blind. (It seems that then his family had fallen into a low state.) Surajchand, walking out, once fell into a well, whence he was saved by Sri Krishna. No one helping him he was for seven days in that blind well, but Sri Krishna himself saved his life, and showed him his own beauty\u2014full svarupa. He named him Sur, Sur Das and Surasyam. Then he went to Vraj, where Gosainji (son of Sri Vallabhacharya) made him one of Vaishnavas.\n\nThe Bhaktamal says that Sur Das was a Brahman, no doubt, but he was living at Gaughat, a place near Agra, and so all other Vaishnava granthas say. He was a great poet, as told\n\n\"It is said that the famous poet Behari once, when walking about, saw a man very uneasy.

B. R. Branfill, Depy. Superintendent Survey of India,\u2014Communicated by Colonel J. T. Walker, C. B., R. E., Surveyor General of India.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n2. *Pali Derivations in Burmese.*\u2014By H. L. St. Barbe, Esq., C. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe Burmese have borrowed their alphabet, religion and a great portion of their language from India. The alphabet was no doubt introduced at a very early period. It has never been analyzed in any case, but its square variety approximates more closely to the \u00c1s\u00f3ka and fifth century B. C. inscriptions than any later Indian modifications. It was adopted en bloc, though the Burmese have never themselves found any use for 12 out of 84 consonants, and have altered several of the sounds, notably the 2nd varga from \"e\" and \"y\" to \"s\" and \"z,\" the vowel \"ai\" into \"\u00ea\" (pronounced more or less like the \"e\" in there) and the o into \u00f4 (like the aw in \"law.\") The bulk of the Aryan element found its way into the Burmese language through a Pali channel. But Sanskrit words had entered the language before this without any connection with Buddhism. The names for the days of the week are derived from a Sanskrit source, and some other words such as *missa*, a ram, (*Sans. mesha*) *pritta* (*Sans. preta*, the dead) *prasad*, a town, (*Sans. for \u00e1s\u00e1da*), seem to point to a time when foreign vocables were written down as they sounded in Burmese without reference to their etymology. The importation of those words is due to Indian immigrants who founded kingdoms in Burmah (the Sorehkhetar\u0101 kingdom was founded B C. 482) and were the pioneers of civilization there. At present, words of Indian extraction constitute more than one-seventh of the entire Burmese vocabulary. The process of engrafting Aryan vocables on a Mongoloid stock must be more or less clumsy and inadequate. Gautama himself would not understand ten words together of his own doctrine as recited by a *phungyi*, and most certainly will not make himself intelligible to a Burmese audience. The character must always be a most unsatisfactory one to adopt for a new dialect or language, and it is a great misfortune that the Latin alphabet has not been used in reducing the Karen language to writing.\nThere is, however, a certain method observable in the appropriation of Pali terms. The author has been able to frame a simple set of rules which are tolerably comprehensive, and which may be of some use in dealing with future importations. These rules form the most important part of the paper which will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n3. Prehistoric Remains in Central India.\u2014By H. Rivett-Carnac, Esq., C. S., C. I. E., M. R. A. S., F. S. A., &c.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper contains an account of the remains discovered by the author in the barrows near Junapani, a hamlet lying about 5 miles to the west of the civil station at Nagpur, in the Central Provinces. These tumuli, which are by the people of the neighbourhood ascribed to giants or to the Gaoli or shepherd kings, regarding whose rule in Central India prior to the Aryan invasion a deep-rooted tradition exists, are surrounded with double rows of trap boulders selected from the masses with which the hillside is strewn. On those selected stones are found the \"cup-marks\" resembling those found on exactly similar tumuli in Europe.\n\nThe remains discovered were all found in the centre of the barrows. The earth dug through was invariably hard and firm, as if compressed by many centuries into its present compact shape.\n\nThe first indication of a \"find\" is broken pieces of pottery of red and black clay, 2 or 2\u00bd feet below the surface. The fragments of metal implements and ornaments are found, and further pieces of broken pottery, evidently the fragments of urns. With the urns is found a whitish-coloured earth, probably the remains of bones.\n\nIn a plate accompanying the paper are represented some iron instruments found in these barrows, among them the best specimen of the battle-axe or hatchet that has yet been discovered. It was found by Mr. Henry Dangerfield in one of the outlying groups of barrows near Junapani. The bands with which the axe was fastened to the wooden handle are in perfect preservation.\n\nAnother plate represents six bangles or bracelets found in a mound adjacent to that in which the axe was found.\n\nIn a third plate are represented some instruments dug out of a barrow which Mr. Rivett-Carnac supposes to have been the grave of a chieftain. Among them are arrow-heads, axes, spear-heads, a snaffle bit in excellent preservation, and what Mr. Rivett-Carnac supposes to be a pair of iron stirrups.\n\nIt is generally supposed that the \"cup-marks\" are a rude kind of ornamentation. But Mr. Rivett-Carnac has observed on these boulders\nwhich he has examined, a striking combination of large and small cups. He is therefore of opinion that this combination of marks may have some secret meaning yet to be discovered. He remarks that those who are acquainted with the system of printing by the electric telegraph, and the combination of long and short strokes in the Morse code, and the recent arrangements for communicating signals to troops at night, will agree that these marks may have some hidden signification. He connects these marks also with that found in the Kumaon Hills, and described in the Society's Journal for January 1877, believes them in some cases to be the remains of Mahadeo worship.\n\nHe thus sums up the results of his paper:\n\n(1.) The sketches shew that the shape of the tumuli in India and Europe is the same.\n\n(2.) The Barrows in India and Europe always face towards the South.\n\n(3.) The remains found in the Indian barrows resemble almost exactly the remains dug out of the burial-places of Europe.\n\n(4.) The cup-marks on the boulders which surround the Indian tombs are identical with the marks found on the stones placed round the same class of tumuli in Europe.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\nThe President said that he had been until recently under the impression that the stone circles of N\u00e1gpur had already been fully described, but that having occasion lately to search for a description of them, he had been unable to find any sufficient account, and he was therefore very glad that Mr. Rivett-Carnac had furnished the necessary details. These curious remains are of peculiar interest and deserve more attention than they have hitherto received. Rude stone monuments, sometimes in the form of circles, sometimes of cromlechs or kistvaens, and occasionally of both together, the connexion being such as to shew that all are probably the work of the same people, have been found in the extreme north-west of India near Pesh\u00e1war and in many places in the Peninsula, as at N\u00e1gpur, in several parts of the Hyderabad territory, in Mysore, Coorg, on the Nilgiri hills, in Malabar, Coimbatour, Salem, Tinnevelly, &c., and near Madras. In Southern India the rings are generally known as Koramba rings, and it is curious, as noticed by Mr. Foote, that near Madras some are formed of laterite, in which, in the same neighbourhood, pal\u00e6olithic human implements are imbedded. The best descriptions hitherto given of any explorations are those of Capt. Meadows Taylor, who excavated some of the stone circles and kistvaens, here found together, near Ferozabad and Shorapur in the Decan, west of Hyderabad, and gave a full account of his discoveries in the\nJournal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (Vol. III, Pt. 2, p. 179, and IV, p. 380,) and in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy (Vol. XXIV, Antiquities, p. 329.) He found cists containing skeletons, some of them headless, and thus furnished the necessary link between the stone circles of N\u00e1gpur, in which enclosed chambers are wanting and the bones appear to have decayed, and the burial-places of the Scythian tribes.\n\nThe distribution of these monuments in India is so peculiar and restricted, that they are very probably the tombs of an immigrant race, and not of an aboriginal population. The so-called aboriginal tribes of the country, such as the Gonds, appear, as a rule, to have no knowledge of the remains. If the curious articles supposed by Mr. Rivett-Carnac to be a snaffle bit and stirrups are really what he thinks them to be, they would furnish another connecting link between the circle-building race and the tribes of Central Asia, who have been horsemen from time immemorial, whilst none of the wilder tribes of the Indian peninsula use horses, nor is it probable that the animal is indigenous to the country, the climate of most parts of India being ill-suited for horse-breeding. At the same time it must not be considered as conclusively proved that these pieces of iron are really a bit and stirrups, although the view is probable, especially in the case of the bit.\n\nThere is one very striking peculiarity to which I think Mr. Rivett-Carnac has not called attention, but which deserves notice. Mr. Rivett-Carnac has remarked the numerous points in which these circles and the markings upon them shew a connexion with similar remains in Europe. There is, however, one very remarkable distinction. In Europe all such stone monuments as these are classed in the bronze age, the implements of human manufacture found associated being chiefly or entirely of bronze. The occurrence of iron implements in so many cases in India may be due to either of two causes, to the later age of the Indian remains, or to the circumstance that the use of iron was known earlier in India than in Europe. From the extreme paucity of bronze and copper implements in India, it is not improbable that the interval between the time when smoothed stone implements were employed and the discovery of iron was shorter in this country than in Europe, and the relative abundance of iron in Indian tombs may very possibly indicate that the use of the metal was known in India at an earlier period than in Europe.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in December last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PERIODICALS, AND JOURNALS,\npresented by the respective Societies or Editors.\n\nBerlin.

Blanford, F.R.S., President, in the Chair.\n\nAccording to the Bye-Laws of the Society, the President ordered the voting papers to be distributed for the election of Officers and Members of Council for 1879, and appointed Drs. King and Cayley, Scrutineers.\n\nThe President then called upon the Secretary to read the Annual Report.\n\nAnnual Report for 1878.\n\nIn presenting to the Society the customary review of the state and progress of its affairs during the past year, the Council are glad to be again able to report that the condition of the Society is satisfactory, as regards the state of its finances and the interest that continues to be shown in its operations, as evidenced by the accession of members and the number and variety of the communications received for publication.\n\nDuring the year 1878, 35 new Members joined the Society, a larger number than usual. The losses, by death (9), by retirement (11), and removal (31) amount to 51. The number of Ordinary Members at the close of the year was therefore 327 against 345 in 1877. Of the Ordinary Members 29 are absent from India, so that the effective list now numbers 117 Resident, 153 non-Resident, 15 Foreign and 13 Life Members.\n\nThe annexed tabular Statement shows the fluctuation in the number of the Ordinary Members during the past 6 years.\nThe diminution in the numbers is apparent rather than real, and is due to the lists having previously included a number of individuals who had virtually ceased to be members, and had for a considerable period abstained from paying subscriptions. All such have now been removed from the list of Members, under Rule 38.\n\nDuring the year one Member compounded for his subscription, and the free life-membership of the Society was granted to Sir E. C. Bayley and General Thuillier on their retirement from India.\n\nThe Society has specially to deplore the loss of Mr. H. Blochmann, who had for many years past so ably filled the post of Philological Secretary, and whose researches into the Ancient History and Geography of Bengal, and more especially his labours in connection with the editing of the text and translation of the Ain-i-Akbari, and other Muhammadan historical works, have enriched the pages of the Society's Journal and Bibliotheca Indica, and gained for their author a world-wide renown among scholars. It is greatly to be regretted that by Mr. Blochmann's untimely death a great part of the immense wealth of valuable information that he had collected on these subjects has been lost to the world.\n\nAnother serious loss to the Society is Mr. S. Kurz, the author of many valuable papers relating to the botany of India and Burma, and by whose early death the Society loses a zealous contributor, and botanical science an experienced and indefatigable worker.\n\nThe Society has also to regret the death in England of Dr. T. Oldham, late Superintendent of the Geological Survey, who was on several occasions President of the Society.\n\nThe Obituary further includes the names of Mr. A. Anderson, who had contributed several papers on Indian Ornithology to the Society's Journal and other scientific periodicals, Mr. P. T. Carnegy, Mr. T. Chennell, Dr. E. J. Gayer, Mr. C. Heintze, Dr. Verchere, Ordinary Members; M. Garcin de Tassy and Dr. T. Thomson, Honorary Members, and Dr. H. Bleeker, Corresponding Member.\nIndian Museum.\n\nDuring the past year the Council have received no presentations requiring to be transferred to the Indian Museum under the provisions of Act XXII of 1876. A large number of sculptured stones from the ruins of Buddha Gaya, have, however, been received from Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra, Rai Bah\u00e1dur, C. I. E., which will be transferred to the Museum as soon as a selection has been made from them for the Berlin Museum.\n\nMr. T. S. Isaac and Capt. J. Waterhouse have continued to act as Trustees on the part of the Society throughout the year. On the vacation of the Presidentship by the Hon\u2019ble Sir E. C. Bayley, K. C. S. I., he was succeeded as ex-officio Trustee by Mr. W. T. Blanford. On the death of Mr. Blochmann, Mr. C. H. Tawney was appointed Trustee, and Mr. H. Beverley took the place of Dr. T. R. Lewis, who went on furlough to Europe.\n\nFinance.\n\nThe Council are glad to be able to report that the financial position of the Society continues in a satisfactory state, and that the accounts of the year show a slight balance of income over expenditure.\n\nThe income of the Society from its vested funds will, however, be less in future than it has been during the past year or two, on account of the expiry of the 5\u00bd per cent. loan, and the consequent transfer of the Government Securities held in that loan to the new 4\u00bd per cent. loan. This loss of income will necessitate the most careful economy in the administration of the Society\u2019s funds, a point to which the attention of the Council will be duly given.\n\nThe gross receipts of the Society during the year amount, as shown in the table below, to Rs. 27,284-9-0 and the gross expenditure to Rs. 20,961-9-11. From the balance, Rs. 6,322-15-1, must be deducted Rs. 976-0-0 for admission fees and Rs. 100-0-0 for compounding fees, both which sums were transferred after the close of the year to the Permanent Vested Fund, leaving a balance of Rs. 5,222-15-1 available for the expenditure of the present year.\n\nThe gross receipts are larger than they would have been under ordinary circumstances, owing to the Society having received the whole of the interest due on the 5\u00bd per cent. loan up to its expiry on the 30th April next, amounting to Rs. 10,266-1-5, instead of Rs. 7,308-0-0, the interest due for the year. The difference, Rs. 2,958-1-5, must therefore be considered as part of the income of the current year.\n\nThe gross expenditure includes the following items of extraordinary expenditure: under Publications, Rs. 928-1-6 remitted to England in advance\nfor the publication of Mr. Moore's papers on Indian *Lepidoptera* from the collection of the late Mr. C. S. Atkinson. This sum was provided by the sale of Government Securities for Rs. 1,000. Under *Library*, Rs. 1,594-0-0 paid for the preparation of the new Catalogues of Books and MSS. This sum, which should have been met by sale of Government Securities in the Temporary Vested Fund, has actually been paid from current income.\n\nApart from the interest derived from the vested funds, the ordinary income of the Society shows a further falling off in the two important items of *Subscriptions* and *Publications*, which is to be regretted. The loss is, however, more than made up by an increase in the items of *Library* and *Contingencies*, the increase on the latter head being chiefly the proceeds realised from the sale of the old Museum cases &c.\n\nThe receipts from admission and compounding fees amounted to Rs. 1,076-0-0. Rs. 1,100-0-0 have been transferred from the Temporary to the Permanent Vested Fund on this account, and steps will be taken immediately to replace the amount in the Temporary Fund.\n\nAt the close of 1877 the outstandings due to the Society for admission fees, subscriptions, sale of publications &c., amounted to Rs. 7,074-5-5. Of this sum Rs. 3,250-9-0 has been written off as irrecoverable. The sum now due from members for arrears of subscriptions &c. amounts to Rs. 2,215-5-0, a great part of which it is hoped may be recovered during the current year.\n\nThe net income of the Society amounted to Rs. 20,461-13-9, but from this Rs. 2,958-1-5, the amount of interest received in excess for the half year October to April 1878, should be deducted, leaving a balance of Rs. 17,503-12-4. The ordinary expenditure amounted to Rs. 16,417-15-7. There is thus a balance of Rs. 1,085-12-9 in favour of the Society.\n\nThe following is a Statement of the Cash Assets of the Society at the close of 1878:\n\n| Description                  | Amount |\n|------------------------------|--------|\n| Permanent Vested Fund        | Rs. 127,800 0 0 |\n| Temporary ditto              | Rs. 7,200 0 0 |\n| Balance in the Bank of Bengal| Rs. 6,265 14 11 |\n| Cash in hand                 | Rs. 57 0 2 |\n\nTotal, Rs. 141,322 15 1\n\nThe following tables will show the Gross Receipts and Expenditure of the Society as compared with the previous year, and also the Net Income and Ordinary Expenditure.\n### Gross Receipts\n\n| Description                                      | 1877       | 1878       |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Balance of 1876,                                 | Rs. 8,432 3 5 | Rs. 2,694 13 3 |\n| Admission Fees,                                  | Rs. 880 0 0 | Rs. 978 0 0 |\n| Subscriptions,                                   | Rs. 7,200 2 0 | Rs. 7,006 0 0 |\n| Publications,                                    | Rs. 1,633 5 0 | Rs. 1,340 5 0 |\n| Library,                                         | Rs. 227 5 0 | Rs. 270 11 0 |\n| Fines &c.,                                       | Rs. 47 7 9 | Rs. 42 11 9 |\n| Sale of Government Securities,                   | Rs. 17,501 0 11 | Rs. 1,045 8 0 |\n| Interest on Government Securities,               | Rs. 7,583 0 0 | Rs. 10,226 1 5 |\n| Coin Fund,                                       | Rs. 17 0 0 | Rs. 0 0 0 |\n| Loan from Fund a/c                               | Rs. 1,000 0 0 | Rs. 0 0 0 |\n| Do.

Tr\u00fcbner and Co.'s yearly statement of accounts with the Society from 1st January to 31st December, 1877 showed a balance of \u00a334-2-1 due from the Society. On subsequent examination, this sum was reduced to \u00a333-16-11 and duly remitted.\n\nAccording to Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner's statement, the sale of the Society's publications during the year 1877 amounted to Rs. 278-6, and that of the Bibliotheca Indica publications to Rs. 545-10. This sum representing \u00a375-11-6 was placed to the credit of the Society and O. P. Fund respectively.\n\nTwenty-four invoices, consisting of publications of scientific Societies presented to the Society, books purchased and books on inspection, were received from Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. during 1878. The money value of these consignments amounted to \u00a399-6-11. 335 copies of both Parts of the Journal, and 288 copies of the Proceedings, representing respectively a money value of \u00a361-8-4 and \u00a315-12, were despatched to Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. for sale. 546 copies of the Bibliotheca Indica publications, valued at Rs. 407-2, were also sent for sale.\n\n---\n\n**Library.**\n\nThe additions to the Library during the past year comprise in all 1,326 volumes or parts of volumes. Of these 677 were received as presentations from Government, from authors, or by exchange, and 649 were purchased.\n\nThe new Catalogue of the Library, to which reference was made in last year's Report, progressed as far as completion of the cataloguing in the hands of the late Mr. Blochmann. A heavy work of revision and arrangement has yet to be done before the Catalogue can go to press. Mr. H. B. Medlicott has kindly taken charge of the work, and it is hoped that the current\nyear will see it through the press. As, however, the Council have to rely entirely upon the gratuitous aid offered by already over-worked officers and Members of Council for the effective supervision of such important works, they trust that delays will be excused.\n\nArrangements have been made with Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. for the quick despatch by Overland Parcel Post of the periodicals and Journals supplied to the Society, and these now come in monthly or fortnightly parcels instead of being collected and sent out by the P. and O. Steamers.\n\nPublications.\n\nThe publications of the Society issued during the year comprise 9 Nos. of the Proceedings, consisting of 188 pages of text with two plates; No. 10, with Index, will be ready immediately. Three Nos. of the Journal, Part I, have been issued containing 257 pages of text, illustrated by 24 plates. Of the Journal, Part II, three Nos. have been issued, consisting of 174 pages of text illustrated by 8 plates (5 coloured). No. 4 is well advanced in the press and will shortly be ready.\n\nThe Council hoped that the 1st Part of the Extra Number, containing descriptions by Messrs. Moore and Hewitson of the Indian Lepidoptera found in the collections of the late Mr. W. S. Atkinson, would have been ready for distribution during the year. Some delay has, however, occurred in the drawing of the plates, and it is uncertain when the first part will be ready.\n\nBuilding.\n\nThe amount expended on repairs to the Society's premises and for furniture during the year has been very trifling, amounting only to Rs. 632.\n\nWith reference to the erection of the railing in front of the Society's premises, the Council have decided on having the present wall altered and repaired, as they do not consider it advisable to diminish the funds of the Society further at present. The arrangement the Council had hoped to conclude with the Municipality to give a small strip of land to the latter in exchange for a sum that would have sufficed to pay part of the expense of erecting railings has not been carried out, no acceptable proposal having been made by the Municipality.\n\nCoin Cabinet.\n\nThe accessions to the Coin Cabinet during 1878 were 2 gold, 6 silver, and 41 copper coins purchased; 5 silver Burmese coins presented by the Trustees of the Phayre Museum, Rangoon; one gold and two silver coins received from the Rajah of Suket through the Foreign Office; and 3 silver and 5 copper coins received from Col. C. Martin.\nMr. James Crawfurd, C. S. brought to the notice of the Council the desirability of a reference being made to Government on the subject of the Treasure Trove Act, in order that the Society might have a chance of purchasing coins &c., found in different parts of the country. The Council accordingly addressed the Government on the subject, and orders have been issued to the Civil authorities throughout the country to inform the Asiatic Society of all finds of coins within their respective jurisdictions. The consequence is, that the Society is constantly receiving intimations of finds of this kind and has been glad to purchase on several occasions. By more recent orders the Asiatic Society is to inform the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society of such finds and vice versa.\n\nSecretary's Office.\n\nPart I of the Journal was in the hands of the late Philological Secretary, Mr. Blochmann, until his death in July, when Mr. C. H. Tawney kindly undertook the duties of the Philological Secretary as a temporary measure. The Rev. Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle was subsequently appointed permanently Philological Secretary.\n\nCaptain Waterhouse has continued to hold the General Secretaryship, and charge of the Proceedings, with the exception of 4 months from July to November when Mr. H. B. Medlicott acted for him.\n\nPart II of the Journal has been in various hands during the year. Mr. Lydekker being appointed Natural History Secretary in the early part of the year, relieved Captain Waterhouse and Mr. Blanford of the charge of it; but on Mr. Lydekker's sudden departure in March, those gentlemen again resumed charge of it. During Captain Waterhouse's absence on leave, Mr. Medlicott took charge and the editorship is now held again by Captain Waterhouse and Mr. Blanford.\n\nThe Treasurership was held until March by Mr. H. B. Medlicott, who was relieved by Mr. E. Gay. On Mr. Gay's departure for Bombay in August, Mr. H. Beverley was appointed Treasurer and now holds the office.\n\nMr. G. S. Leonard resigned his appointment as Assistant Secretary in April and Mr. W. E. Bateman was appointed in his place. Mr. Andrews and Babus Kedarnath Bysack, Ramjiwun Mookerjee and Jadu Bindu Bysack have continued to hold the post of Assistant Librarian, Cashier, Assistant Cashier, and Storekeeper, respectively.\n\nBibliotheca Indica.\n\nThe progress made in the publication of oriental works has been entirely satisfactory. Altogether 24 fasciculi have been published, including\nportions of 9 different works, and three large and important works have been completed. Of the works published, one is an English translation from the Sanskrit, five in Sanskrit, and three in Persian.\n\nThe translation above referred to is an elegant and most accurate rendering of the Aphorisms of S\u0101ndilya with the commentary of Sivapne\u015bvara. The Society is indebted for it to Professor E. B. Cowell. The work is devoted to the Hindu doctrine of faith, and forms the text-book of the Bhakti system, which appears in its most developed form in the Bh\u00e1gavata Pur\u00e1\u1e47a, and in the commentary of R\u00e1m\u00e1nuja on the V\u00e9d\u00e1nta aphorisms of Vy\u00e1sa. In many of its salient points it is closely related to the doctrine of the S\u00faf\u00eds. The cardinal principle which the author of the work upholds is, that \"knowledge is only the hand-maid of faith and not, as contended by the Hindu gnostics, the only thing needful.\" The Sanskrit text was originally undertaken by the late Dr. Ballantyne, and on his retirement from India when half of the work had been printed, was completed for the Society by Mr. Griffith, in 1861.\n\nOf the Sanskrit works, the most important is the Sa\u00f1hit\u00e1 of the S\u00e1ma Veda. It comprises four different works, namely, Gr\u00e1magcya G\u00e1na, the Uha G\u00e1na, Uhya G\u00e1na and Aranya G\u00e1na. These include all the hymns of the S\u00e1ma Veda set to music. Inasmuch, however, as the hymns with their musical notations were perfectly unintelligible, the words of the hymns were early separated into a distinct compilation called \"Archika; or the Richas of the Rig Veda, occurring in the S\u00e1ma Veda\". This last was commented upon by S\u00e1ya\u1e47a. A recension of this compilation was published by the Oriental Translation Fund of London, in 1842, and another by Dr. Benfey in 1848. Both appeared under the name of the Sa\u00f1hit\u00e1 of the S\u00e1ma Veda; but as they did not include those peculiarities which convert Rig verses into S\u00e1ma hymns, they were, in the form in which they appeared, not S\u00e1mas but Rig verses. The Society undertook, in 1870, an edition of the S\u00e1ma hymns, and it has now been completed in 5 volumes. The Rig collection has been adopted as the basis, and to every verse of it have been added all the various transformations which it has undergone in changing from the Rig to the S\u00e1ma,\u2014including all the musical notations, as also the commentary of S\u00e1ya\u1e47a on the text. Thus practically the Society's edition comprises six different works, namely, the Archika, the four G\u00e1nas and the commentary of S\u00e1ya\u1e47a, and the bulk of the edition has necessarily been greatly increased thereby; but it is hoped that it will afford to oriental scholars the most complete edition of the S\u00e1ma Sa\u00f1hit\u00e1. The plan adopted has in some places disturbed the order in which the G\u00e1nas appear in their respective collections; but this was unavoidable. To remedy the defect full indexes have been supplied at the beginning of each volume. The Council have great\npleasure in adding that the editor, Pandit Satyavrata Sama\u015brami, has completed the work with commendable zeal, ability and care.\n\nThe Agni Pur\u0101\u1e47a was taken in hand in 1871 by the late Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit Haramohan Tarkabh\u016b\u1e63ha\u1e47a; but it was stopped after the publication of two fasciculi. Dr. R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra has now completed it in three volumes. The work forms a Cyclop\u00e6dia of Sanskrit literature, and has been printed from nine different MSS., one of which was obtained from Bombay, one from Tanjore, two from Benares and five from different sources in Bengal.\n\nOf the Society's edition of Hem\u0101dri's Chaturvarga Chint\u0101ma\u1e47i, seven fasciculi have been published during the period under report. Four more will complete the second volume, and with it the work will for the present be concluded, as it has not been possible to procure sufficient materials for the remaining 3 volumes.\n\nPa\u1e47\u1e0dit B\u0101la S\u0101str\u012b of the Benares College has brought out the sixth fasciculus of the Bh\u0101mati. It is expected that the work will be completed in the course of the current year. Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit Chandrak\u0101nta Tarkaratna's edition of the Gobhiliya Grihya S\u016btra is also expected to be completed in a short time. The whole of the text has been printed, and two short appendices are now in the hands of the printer.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Hoernle's edition of the Prithvir\u0101ja R\u0101yas\u0101 has advanced by one fasciculus. The work is a large one, and it will be some time before it can be brought to a conclusion.\n\nThe Persian series has sustained a serious loss by the death of Mr. H. Blochmann. Under his able superintendence it was progressing in a most satisfactory manner, and the Council doubt if they will be able to replace him for a long time to come. A little before his death, he had completed the second volume of the text of the Ain-i-Akbari, which is a large 4to. of nearly a thousand pages, got up in a manner that leaves nothing to be desired. Annexed to the volume is an interesting biography of the author, in English. It is to be regretted that the untimely death of the learned editor has deprived the public of the chance of obtaining an English translation of this portion of the work from his pen. An impression appears to exist both in this country and in Europe, that the late Mr. Blochmann before his death had completed this translation. The Council have, however, had a most diligent search made for the MS., but without finding the least trace of it or any allusion to it in Mr. Blochmann's papers, and are therefore inclined to believe that the translation was not completed, and that a confusion has arisen between the completion of the text and translation.\n\nMaulaw\u012b 'Abdur R\u0101h\u012bm has advanced the Society's edition of the Akbarn\u0101mah by one fasciculus, and has also brought out an Index of names of persons and places occurring in the first volume of the work.\nThe following is a list of the number of fasciculi published during the past year.\n\n**Sanskrit Series.**\n\n1. **Chaturyarga Chintaman\u012b**, by Hem\u00e1dri, edited by Pandit Bharatachandra Siromani.

In the great Societies of Europe, where the subjects discussed are of cosmopolitan interest, it is not an unusual proceeding to review the progress of human thought generally or of the particular branch to which each Society devotes itself, during the course of the preceding twelve months, but situated as we are, at a distance from the greater centres of scientific activity, we shall best do service to the general cause by confining ourselves to the area of the continent from which our Society derives its name, and more especially to the country in which we live.\n\nTo review the various discoveries made during the year, and to afford anything like an adequate sketch of their scope and meaning, is indeed a task far beyond the powers of any individual. The year commenced with that marvellous triumph of mechanical resource, the liquefaction, simultaneously and independently by two different chemists, of the only gases which had hitherto resisted all attempts to induce them to change their gaseous state, and terminated with Mr. Norman Lockyer's spectroscopic analyses of the metals, analyses so singular as to have led to the announcement, more sensational than accurate, that the decomposition of bodies hitherto supposed to be elementary had been effected, and even in the columns of newspapers to the suggestion that the old alchemist's dream of transmutation had come true. Great additions have been made in the course of the\ntwelvemonth to the remarkable series of discoveries of which the telephone was the first-fruits and the phonograph and microphone some of the results, and in astronomy one if not two planets have been shewn to exist, on far more satisfactory evidence than any previously existing, within the orbit of Mercury. There has been no lack of scientific energy, and the results have been in proportion to the labour, the correspondence between power expended and work done holding good in mental as in material dynamics. In Europe and America, where the workers are many, the advance in scientific thought is great. Here in British India and its dependencies, the labourers are comparatively few, and the results are consequently small, but it will be well to pass some of these briefly in review, and try to ascertain what the labours of the year have added to our knowledge.\n\nThere is one feature in which almost all scientific work in India differs from that in Europe and America, and especially from the work done in the British Islands and in the United States. In the west nearly all that is effected is due to the labour, entirely spontaneous, and for by far the greater part unremunerated, of private individuals, or of associations like our own; very little is due to the initiation of the ruling power, however willing the Government may be, in some cases, to aid and extend exploration already commenced. In India, although Societies like the Asiatic are not directly subordinate to the Government of the country, by far the larger proportion of our members are officers of the Government, and, in many cases, are officially engaged in scientific enquiries. Hence no small portion of the scientific work of the year, instead of being due to private research, is the result of investigations made for the Government of the country by its own officials, and consequently a review of the year must deal largely with national rather than individual undertakings.\n\nTo the members of the Asiatic Society, and especially to those resident in Calcutta, perhaps the most interesting incident of the past year has been the opening of the new Indian Museum. The ornithological and reptilian and the arch\u00e6ological galleries were thrown open to the public on the 1st April, and the mammalian gallery in December. The collection of specimens in spirit is arranged in cases and nearly ready for exhibition, and a portion of the beautiful Buddhist railing from Bharahut has been set up in the arch\u00e6ological gallery in the room to the south of the entrance. Very much still remains to be done; the ethnological collection has not yet been provided with cases, although arrangements have been made by the Trustees to meet the expense, and the arch\u00e6ological collection, almost entirely transferred from the Society, is still unarranged and unprovided with stands; but for this also provision has been made by the Government. But seeing the progress that has already been made, and considering how great has been the labour necessary, I think that very much has been accomplished.\nby Dr. Anderson, the superintendent, and by his staff of assistants, especially by the taxidermists' department under Mr. Fraser, in the course of the last year. To the members of the Society it must be a source of gratification to see the superb collections made by themselves and their predecessors fairly exhibited in well-lighted galleries, instead of being hidden in small rooms, as they formerly were, and the value of the collections can be much better appreciated since it has been possible to see and examine them.\n\nThe geological galleries at the Museum, which were finally opened to the public from the 1st of January, 1878, had been ready for exhibition for some time before, and even temporarily thrown open, but they required much less preparation, and more superintendence was available, amongst the officers of the Geological Survey, for the important work of arrangement. Although the Society's specimens form a much smaller element of the geological than of the zoological, arch\u00e6ological, and ethnological collections, no unimportant part, both of the fossils and minerals, was the property of our association, the most valuable amongst the specimens derived from the Asiatic Society being probably the Siwalik mammalian remains, and the series of meteorites, both of which occupy a conspicuous position in the new galleries.\n\nThe Zoological Gardens of Calcutta continue to flourish, and although, like other gardens of the same class, they are rather adapted for recreation than for study, it is a question whether this is not an advantage, for the number of students is so limited in India, that education is needed more than opportunities for original investigation. Several rare Indian animals have already been exhibited, and it is to be hoped that the number will be increased.\n\nPassing now from the more local subjects of interest and turning to those of wider scope; first and foremost of all research in India, as the ground-work upon which so many other sciences depend, is our knowledge of the topography of the country and of neighbouring regions. The first branch of enquiry progresses satisfactorily in the hands of General Walker, and his able assistants of the trigonometrical and topographical surveys, and if the second is still far from what we could desire, some advance has been made, thanks to the officers of the same survey. Some important progress, to which I will refer presently, has been achieved in trans-frontier exploration, and almost the only scientific use hitherto made of the Afghan expedition has been the extension of geographical surveying.\n\nBut it is impossible not to regret that our present information is not wider. It is difficult to cast a glance over the map of India and not be struck by the hard sharp line that divides, on so many of our frontiers, the known from the unknown. Despite the new treaty with China, Tibet\nis still forbidden ground, and apparently awaits the advent of Colonel Prejevalski, or some other adventurous traveller from the distant regions of Northern Asia, to trace out the upper waters of the rivers that irrigate British India. We can but hope that it will not long remain a national reproach to us that we have less knowledge of the rivers of India than of those of Africa, and that the sources of the Nile and Congo have been explored before those of the Brahmaputra and Irawadi. There is no lack of willing and able explorers, but as the opposition in this case comes not from savage tribes or individuals, but from a fairly civilized Government, it can only be overcome by the action of the ruling power in India. There is no subject at the present time in which more general interest is taken than in the progress of geographical exploration. That there are difficulties in the road of research is unquestionable, but whatever may be the case in politics, it is certain that difficulties in science are not conquered by 'masterly inactivity.'\n\nIt is not likely that Tibet will long remain untrodden by European feet. Colonel Prejevalski, far from being discouraged by his two previous failures, failures, however, which have contributed more to our knowledge of Central Asia than any other recent travels, is again about to set out for Lhassa. Nor is he the only traveller who is endeavouring to reach the centre of Mongolian Buddhism, for an Austrian, Count Szechenyi, is about to leave Pekin for Tibet under peculiarly favourable conditions. But we hear of no British exploration, and we can only regret that the Government of Great Britain appears desirous of leaving the examination of countries almost within sight of its own mountains to Russian or German travellers. It is impossible that the inhabitants of the country should not contrast Russian energy with British apathy, and the result can scarcely be favourable to the diplomatic reputation of our own Government.\n\nAlthough Tibet has not been explored nor even entered by any European, something has again been added to our knowledge of its geography by the employment of trained natives, and a step in advance has been made by the determination of the quantity of water passing down the different Assam rivers in the dry season, for the purpose of ascertaining which receives the drainage of the Tibetan plateau. The measurements have been made by Lieut. Harman, R. E., of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, and serve to shew clearly that the Tibetan river cannot be the Subansiri, and that it is probably the Dihong. I have just been informed by Genl. Walker that a native sent by Lieut. Harman to Tibet for the purpose of endeavouring to trace the Sanpo to the eastward, had returned after having followed the river to a point where its course turned southward nearly north of the spot where the Dihong emerges from the mountains into the Assam valley.\nAll therefore tends so far to support the view taken by the officers in the Great Trigonometrical Survey, and to shew that the Sanpo and Dihong are identical. At the same time the question cannot be considered settled until the two rivers are actually traced into connection with each other.\n\nWe may hope for large additions to our knowledge of Afghanist\u00e1n from the present expedition. I regret to say that hitherto the endeavour to take advantage of the presence of a British army in Afghanist\u00e1n for purposes of scientific enquiry has been limited to the despatch of surveying parties, but I hope this will not continue to be the case, and that so favourable an opportunity for extending our knowledge of the Archaeology of a most interesting region, and for examining the Ethnology, Geology, Zoology and Botany of Afghanist\u00e1n, will not again be allowed to pass away without being used. I am indebted to General Walker for the information that Major Tanner of the Survey Department has discovered, near Jellalabad, some relics of the old K\u00e1fir (pre-Muhammadan) rulers, and more particularly has found a subterranean palace, which has been already partially excavated. He has also made enquiries about those mysterious people, the inhabitants of K\u00e1firist\u00e1n, and finds that there are at least ten dialects of the K\u00e1fir language: of these dialects which, as might be supposed, are Aryan, he is making a glossary. It is greatly to be hoped that Major Tanner will succeed in visiting K\u00e1firist\u00e1n, a region which has for so long been an object of interest and enquiry, and which was strangely neglected when formerly access was possible. It is not probable that there will be much difficulty in going thither, as the inhabitants are believed to be friendly, and tried to induce English officers to visit them during the former occupation of Cabul.\n\nOn some of the other land frontiers of India good progress is being made in the work of surveying. In Burma and Assam, where the difficulties caused by dense forest, one of the worst enemies a surveyor can meet, are at their maximum, there is a steady advance in the triangulation.\n\nThe regular work of the Trigonometrical Survey has but little general interest, although it is laying the ground-work for every variety of knowledge, and the details of topography are even less exciting, but the Survey is certainly to be congratulated on the production of maps such as those of Guzerat. Scarcely any one in the country has so good opportunities of testing the accuracy of map-drawing as have the officers of the Geological Survey, and the maps of Kattywar on the scale of an inch to the mile are described as excellent.\n\nBut, besides exploration and mapping, there are several branches of scientific enquiry on which the officers of the Great Trigonometrical Survey are engaged. One of these,\u2014a question of far greater practical importance that it appears at first sight,\u2014is the determination of the exact differences\nin longitude between distant countries, and especially between England and India, by means of the electric telegraph. This has resulted in the correction of the longitude of Madras, previously ascertained by very long and tedious astronomical observations, extending over many years, by 31-8 seconds of time or rather more than half a mile of distance in this latitude. No addition has been made during the past year to the work described in the Report of the Survey for 1876-77, both the officers engaged, Major Campbell and Captain Heaviside, having been absent on furlough. Another question to which much labour has been devoted by the Survey is the establishment of bench-marks throughout several parts of the country by means of careful spirit-levelling. The vast importance of such marks for engineering works and especially for all plans of irrigation is manifest, and it is not improbable that the scientific importance of the levels will increase greatly, as, in connection with a series of other observations at tidal stations, they will afford data for determining whether changes in the elevation of land are taking place in different parts of the country.\n\nAmongst the numerous subjects to which the officers of the Trigonometrical Survey have directed their attention, some of great interest have been described, at Genl. Walker's suggestion, in the Journal of the Society for the past year, and it may fairly be hoped that the publication, in this form, of observations such as those made for the purpose of determining the mean sea-level in the Gulf of Cutch, may serve the purpose of making the results more widely known than if they were recorded only in an official report, whilst the Journal of the Society gains in interest and value by being made the medium of publication. The paper by Lieut Harman, to which I have already alluded, on the results of measurements of the Assam rivers, will, I hope, be read this evening.\n\nFew plans for recording the advancement of any enquiry are more trustworthy than a comparison of the methods employed in delineating the results: careful observations require for their record neat and accurate drawing, and facility of reproduction. Thus the account given by Captain Waterhouse in our Journal of the various photographic methods employed in the reproduction of maps and plans, whilst dealing solely with the art of map printing, shews indirectly the great advance of the science of Geography in India, and the demand for more accurate knowledge of the surface of the country. The progress of the whole art of Government in India during the last thirty years, and the change from comparative ignorance to more accurate knowledge, could not be better illustrated than by a comparison of the maps produced at the commencement of the period, and those now issued, and it may safely be asserted that the increase in the accuracy of the maps is at least equal to the improvement in map printing.\nThe work of the Marine Survey under Captain Taylor, I. N., is still greatly restricted by the want of a proper vessel, and until the steamer now being built at Bombay is completed, it is not possible that any important additions can be made to our knowledge of the Indian seas. Meantime, however, some most useful charts have been published, and several harbours, roadsteads, and tracts of the coast have been surveyed. For a knowledge of the true contour of the sea bottom in the neighbourhood of India, and for the investigation of all the interesting problems in geology and zoology that may be solved by means of the sounding line and dredge, we must still wait for the new vessel, which I am happy to say will be fully provided with the necessary apparatus, and which, in the hands of Captain Taylor and Lieut. Jarrad, may be expected to add to the magnificent series of discoveries due to the \"Challenger\" expedition. The seas of India are as yet untouched, and as the country itself has had a peculiar and exceptional geological history, it is not improbable that the depths of the surrounding ocean may harbour many forms of life not existing in the other oceanic tracts. Some of those curious questions as to the course of the great oceanic currents, questions upon which, undoubtedly, the distribution of temperature and rainfall largely depends, may receive their solution in an area where access from one polar region is entirely barred, and thus the conflicting effect of two sources of cold water is not present, as in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, to disturb the observations made.\n\nThe subject of deep-sea dredging is one to which the attention of the Society was first directed several years since, and the Council has never ceased to urge the importance of it. It may be hoped that there is at last a prospect of useful exploration. For geological purposes and for comparison with the marine fossils of the tertiary formations, a series of the invertebrata and especially of the mollusca, echinoderms and corals of the Indian seas is essential, and for much aid in obtaining such a collection we look to the Marine Survey.\n\nThe field work of the Geological Survey for the past year has not been very prolific in results of interest, and, as in the larger field of the Trigonometrical Survey, the importance of the work is due chiefly to its being part of a connected system. Some valuable additions have been made to our knowledge of Kashmir, Haz\u00e1ra, Bann\u00fa and some other portions of the Punjab, Kumaun, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, Chutia N\u00e1gp\u00far, Kattywar, the God\u00e1vari valley, Tanjore and the islands of R\u00e1mri and Cheduba, but in no case are the details such as greatly to alter the conclusions previously formed. The only published number of the \"Memoirs of the Geological Survey\" contains a paper by Mr. Ball on some previously unexplored coal-fields in Palamau (Palamow), and of this paper the interest is rather practical than scientific, although some interesting details are given as to the distribution of certain lower Gondw\u00e1-\nna formations beyond the Damuda valley, to which they were previously supposed to be restricted. A much longer and more important paper by Mr. Wynne on the Salt Range of the Punjab would have appeared, but for delay in the preparation of maps. All the principal facts and conclusions in this memoir had, however, been published previously in short notes contained in the 'Records of the Geological Survey' and elsewhere.\n\nThe 'Records' for the past year exceed the 'Memoirs' both in bulk and in importance, and several of the papers add materially to the knowledge previously existing. Perhaps the most important in their bearing upon physical geology are Mr. Lydekker's and Colonel McMahon's contributions to the geology of the north-west Himalayas. Many circumstances have concurred to delay the geological examination of the Himalayan chain, and thus it has happened that Kashmir, which, it might have been thought, would have attracted the earliest attention from the Geological Survey, has remained so long imperfectly known. For what has hitherto been ascertained we are chiefly indebted to Col. Godwin-Austen and the late Dr. Verchere, for although an excellent geologist, Mr. Drew, was for years resident in the country, in the service of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja, he was prevented by his official position from publishing the observations he made, and his opportunities of examining the country were much restricted.\n\nMr. Lydekker has now traced several points of connexion between the series of formations determined by Dr. Stoliczka in Spiti, Rupshu and Lad\u00e1k, and the rocks of Kashmir, Kishtw\u00e1r and P\u00e1ngi, and has in some cases modified the conclusions formerly arrived at, especially with regard to the very complicated relations of the metamorphic rocks. There is still much to be done before the relative ages of the latter are determined with certainty, but it seems clear that gneissic rocks of two different systems, distinct both in origin and in period of metamorphism, exist both in Kashmir and Lad\u00e1k, that the slates and bedded volcanic rocks, so abundantly developed both north and south of the Kashmir valley, are of older palaeozoic age, and although they have hitherto proved unfossiliferous, that they must be considered to represent the Silurians of Spiti and Hundes, and that all the different limestones of the Pir Panj\u00e1l range, including the great bed of the Jamu hills, are probably carboniferous, like the fossiliferous limestones of the Kashmir valley.\n\nNot the least interesting of Mr. Lydekker's observations refer to the physical structure of the mountains. He has shewn that the Kashmir valley is a compressed synclinal ellipse, and consequently similar in its main features to the area already described by Dr. Stoliczka further to the eastward in Spiti and Lad\u00e1k, although in the latter region newer rocks appear than are found in Kashmir, where the highest beds occurring are triassic. The Pir Panj\u00e1l range, to the south of the Kashmir valley, is shewn to be a\ngreat anticlinal flexure, with all the beds on the southern side inverted, as they so commonly are along the southern base of the Himalayas. A smaller synclinal ellipse occurs south-east of Kashmir on the upper Chin\u00e1b in the P\u00e1ngi district. To all these facts attention has been especially directed by Mr. Medlicott, the Superintendent of the Geological Survey, in his annual report for 1877, and he notices especially how the recurrence, in the north-western Himalayas, of a series of synclinal ellipses, formed of sedimentary beds and having their longer axes parallel with the main direction of the mountain range\u2014each ellipse being isolated from the others by intervening ranges of metamorphics,\u2014tends to shew that the different basins were all originally part of one sedimentary area, and that their present isolation is due to disturbance and denudation. Nevertheless some subsequent observations to the north of Simla are in favour of partial separation in early pal\u00e6ozoic times having subsisted between the two important sedimentary tracts of Spiti and Hundes.\n\nColonel McMahon's paper on the rocks of the Simla area was published in 1877, but it has been supplemented by another, now in the press, on the Central Himalayan region to the north of Simla. These contributions to the geology of the Himalayas are deserving of more than a passing notice. It is but rarely in India that any one beyond the limit of the Geological Survey possesses both the inclination and the opportunity to investigate the geology of the country, and it may be added that the physical geology of the Indian Peninsula in general is chiefly remarkable for monotony and want of interest. When a new observer arises amongst us and proves himself not only able but willing to examine such very difficult problems as those presented by the complicated formations of the Himalayas, all interested in geology must welcome so valuable an addition to our strength. One of the greatest drawbacks to scientific progress in this country is the want of external criticism,-and the worthlessness of much of such criticism as is offered; too frequently it happens that such remarks as appear, whether laudatory or adverse, serve chiefly to shew the ignorance of the critic. Hence arises a professional intolerance of criticism, and a disposition to dogmatize. Had we but a few more independent observers like Colonel McMahon, the progress of Indian geology would be far more rapid.\n\nThere are few tracts in the Himalaya more puzzling than the Simla area. North of the Sutlej lies the great band of ancient metamorphic rocks, called the Central Gneiss by Stoliczka, and beyond this again to the northward is the great sedimentary series of the Spiti valley, containing marine fossiliferous rocks of silurian, carboniferous, jurassic, triassic and cretaceous age, the lowest of which beds form the peaks of the snowy range. South of the band of central gneiss none of these fossiliferous rocks have been\nfound, but a series of sedimentary beds occur, long since classed and described by Mr. H. B. Medlicott, in descending sequence, as Krol, Infra-Krol, Blaini, and Infra-Blaini. With these sedimentary beds gneiss is associated, and two difficulties have hitherto attended all attempts at determining the position and relations of the Simla rocks; the first being that the sedimentary beds, in places, appear to be distinctly lower in position than the gneiss, and the second that no clear connexion can be traced between the sedimentary unfossiliferous beds to the south of the snowy range, and the fossiliferous series to the north. Stoliczka considered that the gneiss of Simla was newer than the central gneiss, and that the Krol limestone, the most characteristic bed of the Simla area, represented the Lilang triassic limestone of Spiti. Mr. Lydekker suggested on the other hand that the Krol limestone was probably the same as that of the Pir Panjal, and consequently carboniferous. Col. McMahon confirms Stoliczka's views as to the resemblance between the Krol and Lilang limestones, but has shewn, on what appears to be clear evidence, that the gneiss of Simla and the 'Central Gneiss' are identical, and that the apparent superposition of the gneissic rocks on the sedimentary series near Simla is due to the original deposition of the latter in valleys or other hollows worn out of the surface of the former, and to the subsequent great compression of the whole area, and partial metamorphism of the sedimentary rocks. These views, worked out with much care, suggest a similar explanation of those singularly anomalous sections in Sikkim in which, as Mr. Mallet has shewn, there appears, on all sides of the mass of hills around Darjiling, to be a gradual passage in an ascending section from unaltered Damuda sandstones and shales, containing coal seams and fossil plants, to quartzites and slates, and from these to gneiss.\n\nAnother Himalayan paper by Mr. Ball refers to the origin of Naini Tal and the other lakes of Kumaun. The peculiarity of these lakes is due chiefly to the paucity of similar accumulations of water throughout the lower Himalayas in general; in the higher Himalayas lakes are common enough, and are, in numerous cases, clearly due to glacial action. Mr. Ball considers that the Kumaun lakes are not of glacial origin, but caused by landslips, as are a few other lakes in the lower Himalayas. The question cannot, however, be considered as definitely settled, for Mr. Theobald, who has recently examined the neighbourhood of Naini Tal, has come to a conclusion exactly the reverse of Mr. Ball's.\n\nA subject of some interest has been discussed by Mr. Mallet in a paper on the 'mud-volcanoes' of R\u00e1n\u00edri and Cheduba, in which he shews, on what appears to me to be unanswerable evidence, that nothing resembling igneous volcanic action has been exhibited by these vents, and that they are due to the evolution of gaseous hydrocarbons, accompanied by water and small\nquantities of liquid hydrocarbons, such as petroleum; both the gases and petroleum having been formed by the decomposition of vegetable tissue contained in the tertiary rocks of the islands. Several severe and paroxysmal eruptions are on record, accompanied by earthquakes, and during these eruptions, the gases, which are of course inflammable, have frequently been ignited, but this is a very different phenomenon from the ejection of red-hot lava and scoriae. The cones of the mud-volcanoes are composed of clay, derived from the beds traversed by the gas on its way to the surface, mixed with water, and driven out by the gas. This determination of the non-igneous nature of the R\u00e1mri and Cheduba mud-volcanoes coincides with the observations made on similar vents in upper Burma and in Baluchist\u00e1n, and shews that the idea, so frequently put forward in geographical and geological works, that the great line of volcanoes, which traverses the Malay Archipelago, terminates in R\u00e1mri, is erroneous. The northernmost extremity of the volcanic chain in question is probably to be found in Barren Island, and may have some connection with the isolated extinct volcanoes of upper Burma and Yunan.\n\nThere are still three other subjects discussed in different papers in the Records of the Geological Survey for 1878, each of which is illustrated by a number of the \"Paleontologia Indica\" published during the year. Two of these subjects are intimately connected, both being stages in the investigation of that extraordinary series of sandstones and shales, so largely developed in south-western Bengal and the Central Provinces, and chiefly known from comprising all the coal deposits of the peninsula. This remarkable system, comprising the T\u00e1lchir, Damuda, Panchet, Mah\u00e1deva, Jabalpur and other groups or series, and now known by the collective term of the Gondw\u00e1na system, has long attracted much attention, no less on account of the rich seams of coal and ironstone that it contains, than because of the peculiarities of its fossil fauna and flora, and a discussion, by no means ended as yet, has arisen, as to the relations between this fauna and flora and those found in various rocks of Europe and Australia.\n\nIt must be remembered that the data on which the geological history of the earth, as shewn by fossiliferous rocks, has been determined, chiefly consist of marine organisms, and that, although it cannot be positively stated that beds at remote spots on the earth's surface, if containing an assemblage of the same or of similar organisms, are of exactly contemporaneous origin, yet the fact, that the succession of marine life in all countries hitherto examined has proved to be the same on the large scale, is in favour of the view, that all deposits containing the fossils of one epoch, such as the jurassic, were formed at a period subsequent to the disappearance of forms of the previous epoch, such as the triassic. At all events no instance is as yet known in which a purely older fauna occurs in a bed of clearly later date.\nthan another containing only the forms of a later epoch, and perhaps\nthe nearest approach to such an anomaly is in Barrande's well known\n'colonies' of lower silurian fossils apparently overlying upper silurian. I\nam not sure that this case of interposition can be yet considered as\ndecided, but admitting the fact, as contended for by Barrande, the\ndifference between upper and lower silurian is not equivalent to the\ndifference, for instance, between silurian and devonian, much less to\nthat between silurian and carboniferous, the next great and typical series\nin ascending order, nor can the change be compared to that between triassic\nand jurassic rocks. The freshwater and land organisms of past times, both\nvegetable and animal, are, however, far less thoroughly known than the\nmarine, and it appears to have been assumed rather than proved that their\nsuccession has been as uniform throughout the land surface as has that of\nmarine beings in the sea.\n\nNow in the Gondwana system, with one or two exceptions in the upper\nsubdivision, the only organic remains found are terrestrial or fluviatile,\nplants being much more common than animals. The few animals traced are\nchiefly reptiles, amphibia or fish, but these are of great interest, because\nsimilar forms, owing to their biological importance, have been very carefully\nexamined and described almost wherever they have been found.\n\nThe animal remains have only been found in a few parts of the country.\nOne of the richest of these is in the Panchet beds of the R\u00e1niganj coal field;\nanother is in the neighbourhood of Sironcha, at the junction of the Pr\u00e1hita\nand God\u00e1vari rivers. In this last-named country there are several locali-\nties, at one of which, near the village of Kotah, remains of several species of\nganoid fish have been found in limestone, whilst at another, close to a village\nsite called Maleqi, teeth and bones of reptiles and fish have been discovered\nin red clay. The part of the 'Palaeontologia Indica' to which I have referred\ncontains descriptions of some of the Kotah fish by Sir P. Egerton, and of\nthe teeth of Ceratodus, another fish found at Maleqi, by Mr. Miall, toge-\nther with a brief note of my own upon the deposits in which the fossils\noccur. In the 'Records' is a paper by Mr. Hughes describing the geology\nof the upper God\u00e1vari basin, between the river Wardha and the God\u00e1vari\nnear the civil station of Sironcha. Now Sir P. Egerton has shewn that the\nKotah fish belong to the genera Lepidotus, Tetragonolepis and Dopedius,\nand are typically lower jurassic (liassic) forms. The Ceratodus from Maleqi\nand some other places is very closely allied to a triassic species, and it is\nassociated with two reptiles, Hyperodapedon and Parasuchus, both triassic\ntypes. It is therefore very startling to find that Mr. Hughes is of opinion\nthat the Kotah limestone is a bed of the Maleqi deposits, and that the two\nare in fact identical.\nIf this case stood alone, taking into consideration the great difficulty of surveying in the neighbourhood of Sironcha, on account of the very imperfect manner in which the rocks are exposed, and the prevalence of forest, it would be reasonable to doubt Mr Hughes's conclusions, the more so as Mr. King, who also examined the ground, and who at first thoroughly endorsed them, has since expressed some slight doubts, although these doubts appear due rather to Palaeontological than to Geological considerations; but somewhat similar contradictions in homotaxis occur amongst the fossil plants of several Gondwana groups. The collections which have accumulated in the course of the last 25 years are now being examined and described by Dr. Feistmantel, who has already published accounts of most of those found in the upper Gondwana beds. One fasciculus of the \"Paleontologia Indica,\" containing the plants of the Jabalpur group, appeared during the past year, and the flora was shewn to be closely allied to that found in middle Jurassic (lower oolitic) beds in Europe. But some of the same plants have also been found in the Maledi beds associated with the Triassic fish and reptiles. Other plants from the Maledi beds, it is true, indicate a lower horizon, but still one superior to the Trias. Again, in Cutch, some of the Jabalpur plants recur together with others, all allied, like those of Jabalpur, to middle Jurassic types in Europe; yet the plant beds overlie marine rocks abounding in upper Jurassic mollusca. Last of all, the Indian coal measures or Damuda series, which are of lower Gondwana age, contain a flora considered by several botanists to be Jurassic, but lately classed by Dr. Feistmantel as Triassic. This flora, however, is most closely allied to one occurring in Australia in beds associated with others containing marine carboniferous fossils.\n\nIt may, I think, safely be inferred from these anomalies in the distribution of ancient terrestrial and fluviatile organisms in India, that such types did not exist at the same epoch as their nearest allies, often not to be distinguished in the fossil state, in other countries, and that the succession of life on land was less uniform than in the ocean. The fact that land regions at the present day, under the same parallels of latitude and enjoying the same climate, are distinguished by far more striking differences in their fauna and flora than marine provinces are, and that in some land regions, as in Australia, types have survived and even predominate, which in other parts of the earth's surface appear to have died out at distant past epochs, is quite in accordance with this view. It follows as a corollary that land plants and animals cannot be accepted as evidence of geological age with the same confidence as marine forms can.\n\nIt must not be supposed that the opinions just expressed are generally accepted. They are disputed by Dr. Feistmantel himself and by other\npalaeontologists. I think, however, the facts of the case must ultimately lead to conviction. It is of course impossible to describe the whole evidence here; a fuller account will be found in the 'Records of the Geological Survey' for 1878, in a paper on \"The Palaeontological Relations of the Gondwana System.\" But precisely the same important conclusion, the want of uniformity in the succession of terrestrial forms of life in distant countries, is enforced by the Sivalik fauna, the third subject to which a fasciculus of the 'Palaeontologia Indica' and a paper in the \"Records of the Geological Survey,\" both by Mr. Lydekker, have been devoted. The value of the part of the 'Palaeontologia' is, I regret to say, much diminished by the inferiority of several of the lithographs, but the artistic difficulties to be encountered in this country are well known.\n\nThe importance of Mr. Lydekker's work on the Siwalik and other tertiary mammalian fossils may be easily appreciated by the circumstance that very large additions, many of them from new localities, have been made to the original collections described by Dr. Falconer, that Dr. Falconer's descriptions were extremely incomplete, a very large proportion of them, including nearly all the details, having only been printed after his death, and having been kept back by him for years with a view of rendering them more perfect, and that the Siwalik mammalian fauna appears to be far richer than any existing, and perhaps than any other assemblage of fossil mammalian remains hitherto examined. Although very few bones of animals inferior in size to a pig or a sheep are found, although no bats or insectivora and but 8 species of rodents have been discovered, no less than 84 species belonging to 45 genera have been detected and described up to 1878, including 11 elephants and mastodons, 7 rhinoceroses, and 6 giraffes or their allies, such as the huge Sivatherium. Two or three additional species of mammals have since been added.\n\nThe whole of this fauna is still assigned to the miocene period by many European palaeontologists, and in the anniversary address of the President, Prof. Martin Duncan, to the Geological Society of London for 1878, the miocene age of the Siwalik fauna was advocated in very strong terms. The views held by those members of the Indian Survey who have written on the subject and have advocated a pliocene age for the Siwalik fauna were I think, rather underrated, and this is the more to be regretted, as several of the data quoted as adverse to those views are incorrect. Had the case really been as Professor Martin Duncan puts it, the Indian Surveyors would deserve to be ridiculed for bad reasoning, but I think it will be easy to shew that the arguments in favour of a pliocene age for the Siwalik fauna are much stronger than they are represented. I must refer all who wish to examine the argument more fully to Chapter XXIV of the 'Manual of the Geology of India,' but the principal facts are simple enough.\nThe Siwalik mammalian fauna consists of 21 extinct genera, comprising 30 species, and 24 living genera, represented by 53 species. Of the extinct genera, 10 are peculiar to the Indian tertiaries, 4 are only known to occur in Europe in miocene beds, whilst 7 are both miocene and pliocene; of the recent genera, 8 range back as far as the upper miocene in Europe, 10 are not known in older beds than pliocene, and 6 have elsewhere only occurred living or in post-pliocene deposits. Several mammalia are very closely allied to existing species.\n\nOf six Siwalik reptiles sufficiently known to be fairly comparable, three are common living species now inhabiting the same area. All the land and freshwater mollusca found, so far as they can be identified, are recent species. The whole facies of the fauna, including Mammalia, Reptilia and Mollusca is decidedly more recent than miocene. All the reptilia and most of the mollusca found in the miocenes of Europe are extinct forms, and the proportion of extinct mammalian genera is usually greater than in the Siwaliks, though there are exceptions.\n\nThe palaeontological data are confirmed by the geological. The Siwalik fauna is entirely derived from middle and upper Siwalik beds, the lower Siwalik or N\u00e1han being unfossiliferous in the typical Sub-Himalayan locality. But in Sind some beds called Manchhar occur, corresponding to the Siwaliks, and in the lowest of these strata, there are found, together with some Siwalik species, remains of extinct genera not detected in the upper or middle Siwaliks, and in some cases characteristic of the miocene epoch. Amongst these genera are Dinotherium, Anthracotherium, Hyopotamus and Hyotherium. The lower Manchhar beds pass down into a group of marine strata, called G\u00e1j beds, containing miocene (and apparently upper miocene) marine fossils. The age of the lower Manchhars cannot therefore be older than upper miocene, and as the Siwaliks contain a later fauna, and appear to be distinctly higher in the series, they must be pliocene. The Nerbudda osiferous gravels, containing human implements similar in form to those found in the post-tertiary beds of Europe, are universally admitted to be of later date than the Siwaliks, and must consequently be classed as post-pliocene. In the address to which I have alluded Prof. Martin Duncan notices the difficulty of finding a place for the newer gravels in the Deccan, from which Rhinoceros deccanensis was obtained. This is on the assumption that these Deccan gravels are of later date than those of the Nerbudda, but there is no reason for believing that the two differ in age.\n\nAt the same time it is only right to add that the alliances between the Siwalik fauna and the European miocene are very marked, and that a few Siwalik forms, such as Chalicotherium, indicate even more ancient relations. Moreover some beds at Pikermi in Greece contain a fauna having\nseveral points of resemblance to the Siwalik, and amongst the Pikermi mammals are several characteristic species occurring also in the miocene beds of Central Europe. The Pikermi fauna is consequently commonly quoted as upper miocene, both by geologists and naturalists. Now the Pikermi beds have been admirably described by M. Gaudry in a work entitled \"Animaux fossiles et g\u00e9ologie de l'Attique,\" in which it is shewn that, at the base of the ossiferous gravels, there is a layer containing pliocene marine fossils, and that all these beds rest unconformably on lacustrine miocene rocks. The age of the latter, it is true, depends on plants, but the pliocene marine fossils of the Mediterranean area are too well known for a mistake to be possible as to their relations. The reasonable conclusion appears to be that the Pikermi mammals are pliocene also, and that some species survived to a later period in Greece than in Central Europe. It is highly probable that the miocene affinities of the Siwalik fauna are due to a similar migration to the southward of the animals which in the warmer miocene period inhabited central and northern Europe and Asia. Such a migration may have been facilitated by the circumstance that the Himalayas up to pliocene times were of small elevation, even if they formed a range of mountains, for it has been shewn that all the disturbance of the north-western Himalayas is of post-eocene date and much is post-pliocene. A similar migration to the southward is perhaps indicated by the presence of miocene plants in Greenland, and the possibility, as explained by Mr. Gardiner, that the beds containing these plants are really of eocene age. If the suggestion made by Wallace in his \"Geographical Distribution of Animals\" be correct, and the astonishing difference in the abundance of large animals in the later tertiary periods and at the present day be due to the extermination of the greater portion in the glacial epoch, it is evident that the refrigeration of the earth, known to have commenced as early as miocene times, had for its first effect the migration of many forms to the southward.\n\nBefore quitting the subject of Indian Palaeontology, I am very glad to be able to announce an act of liberality on the part of the Government of India. It has been determined to engage Dr. Waagen's services for the description of Indian fossils, and thus to enable him to proceed regularly with the large collections from the Salt Range and other places. I am also happy to state that Professor Martin Duncan, who has described tertiary corals from so many parts of the world, has very kindly undertaken the examination of the large series of tertiary corals collected in Sind. We are also indebted to the same naturalist for having described some remarkable fossils from the Karakoram pass, occurring, apparently, in triassic beds, though Dr. Stoliczka's brief note does not state this so clearly as might be wished. These fossils are spherical with a\nvery peculiar structure, and have been alternately classed as corals, Forami-\nnifera, and sponges, and even by one writer as Cystideans, a view which\nmust have been derived from the examination of an imperfect drawing. It\nappears, according to Professor Martin Duncan's determination,* that these\nsingular \"Kar\u00e1koram stones\" are examples of an entirely new class of\nProtozoa, distinct from sponges and Foraminifera, but most nearly allied\nto the latter, and chiefly distinguished by the absence of cells and by the\nmuch greater development of the tubular structure. For this new class of\nanimals the name of Syringosphaeridae is proposed.\n\nFinally I am glad to be able to announce the completion of the Manual\nof Indian Geology, on which Mr. Medlicott and I have been engaged for more\nthan two years, and which will, I hope, render the study of Indian Geology\nin the future somewhat less laborious than it has hitherto been, and enable\nall who are interested to gain some knowledge, at all events, of the science,\nwithout going beyond the limits of a single work. I have the pleasure of\nlaying before you this evening the bound copy of this work, complete, with\nthe exception of the index, which is now being printed. It is a deplorable\ncircumstance that the late Dr. Oldham, under whose superintendence the\ngreater part of the survey has been carried out, and to whom so much of\nthe labour is due that has rendered it possible to prepare anything like a\nconnected account of Indian Geology, should not have lived to see the com-\npletion of the Manual.\n\nIn Biology, although, owing to the sad gaps left in our numbers by\nthe losses of the last few years, and by the absence of some of the most\nenergetic members of the Society in Europe, the contributions to the Jour-\nnal of the Society have diminished, there is no decrease in the work done,\nand the smaller number of the papers published in our Journal is partly\naccounted for by the publication of such works as \"Stray Feathers.\" At\nthe same time, as the continuance of these works shews the growing inter-\nest in different branches of science in India, our Society cannot but benefit\nindirectly from the rivalry.\n\nThe most important botanical work at present in progress is of course\nthe 'Flora Indica' published by Sir Joseph Hooker, with the assistance of\nseveral excellent botanists. Of this Flora one part was published during the\nyear, bringing the work down to the natural order Myrtaceae, and, as I learn\nfrom Dr. King, another is nearly ready, completing the second volume. A\nlarge amount of material for Vol. III, is ready or nearly so. To the staff\nengaged in the preparation of this hand-book, Mr. C. B. Clarke, one of the\nbest Indian botanists, has been added, and it may confidently be hoped that\n\n* Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., Octr. 1878, Ser. 4, Vol. II, p. 297.\nmany years will not elapse before a complete hand-book of the Flora of British India and its dependencies will be completed.\n\nKurz's 'Forest Flora of Burma,' the last work of its lamented author, although dated 1877, only appeared at the commencement of 1878. It consists of two octavo volumes, and contains descriptions of all the woody plants, i.e., trees and shrubs, about 2000 in number, hitherto detected in British Burma. Any criticism of this work is of course beyond my power, but it is easy for any one to recognize the very great amount of labour expended on its production, and I am assured, by both forest officers and botanists, that it is a most valuable addition to the botanical literature of India.\n\nIn zoology the field is so wide, and the observations so scattered, that it is difficult to select the particular points of importance. One of the most important works published during the past year is the British Museum Catalogue of Chiroptera, written by one of our members and a frequent contributor to our Journal, Mr. G. E. Dobson. The descriptions of Asiatic bats are copied from the author's Monograph of Asiatic Chiroptera, published by the Trustees of the Indian Museum two years ago. The effect of Mr. Dobson's studies of bats has been simply to render the mammalian order of which, previously, the least information existed, one of the best known amongst the smaller and more obscure sub-divisions of the class, and to place the study of the Chiroptera, at all events so far as generic and specific distinctions and geographical distribution are concerned, considerably in advance of such orders as Rodentia and Insectivora. The number of species of bats known to exist is 400: of these no less than 122 are Asiatic, and as the species in tropical and subtropical climates vastly exceed in number those found in temperate countries, it is not surprising to learn that, of these 122, a large proportion are found in some part of the territories belonging to British India, no less than 69 species being enumerated within these limits. In Dr. Jerdon's Mammals of India, published in 1869, the number of species of bats noticed was 55, not including purely Burmese forms. This, however, conveys an inaccurate idea of the additions made by Dr. Dobson, for many of the supposed species noted by Dr. Jerdon were merely varieties, differing in colouration alone.\n\nBirds have, as usual, attracted far more attention than any other class of animals, vertebrate or invertebrate, and foremost amongst the publications devoted to them must be placed Mr. Hume's Journal of Ornithology for India and its dependencies, which continues to appear, under the title of 'Stray Feathers.' By far the greater portion of this periodical is from the pen of its proprietor and editor, and it is difficult to over-estimate the energy and hard labour by which alone a work of this kind can be published.\nby one busily engaged in official duties. Collections on the scale of Mr. Hume's have never been made in India before, in any branch of the animal kingdom, and much time and care are devoted to the determination and description of the large series of skins collected. Indeed Mr. Hume may fairly claim to have founded a school of ornithology in India, and the great attention now given to one of the most interesting classes in the animal kingdom, by training observers, has no small effect in leading to a study of other branches of zoology, less attractive perhaps at first, but of equal scientific importance.\n\nOf 'Stray Feathers', one whole volume and part of a second have appeared during the past year, or more than has ever previously been published within the same period. The completed volume is entirely filled with a list of the Birds of Tenasserim, and is, in all respects, a great addition to our knowledge of one of the richest, though hitherto the least known, of the territories belonging to the Indian Government, and a country of singular zoological interest for two reasons, firstly, because few tracts on the earth's surface have been less changed by the hand of man, and secondly, because within the limits of the province there is one of those dividing lines between the faunas of different zoological subregions or provinces, the investigation of which is so essential in order to determine the history and causes of geographical distribution. The value of Mr. Hume's work may be partly inferred from the circumstance that his assistant and coadjutor Mr. Davison has collected no less than between 8000 and 9000 specimens of birds in the Tenasserim provinces, and that these and about 500 specimens received from other collectors represent 580 species out of the 669 believed, on good authority, to occur within the province. Mr. Blyth's list of the birds of all Burma, published in the Society's Journal for 1875, contained but 660 species, and of these at least 100 have been found in Pegu or Arakan, but not in Tenasserim, whilst 41 are said by Mr. Hume to be either not Burmese or else not distinct specific forms, so that fully 150 birds have been added to the avifauna of Tenasserim, (and, in most cases, this implies an addition to the avifauna of British India and Burma,) in the short space of three years. It is scarcely necessary to say that a large proportion of the additions are Malay species now detected for the first time in Southern Tenasserim. The whole bird fauna of British India and its dependencies, inclusive of Ceylon and Burma, as now known, comprises, according to Mr. Hume's estimate, about 1700 well authenticated species,* whilst only 1008\n\n* Mr. Hume informs me that the number of species, roughly calculated, is 1793; of these probably about 93 are sub-species or varieties or of doubtful occurrence within the limits. If the neighbouring countries, as the Laccadives, Baluchistan, Afghanistan, Wakhan, Upper Burma, and the western half of the Malay Peninsula with Malacca,\nwere enumerated in Dr. Jerdon's Birds of India, the Assamese, Burmese and Ceylonese forms not being included.\n\nBesides the volume on the Birds of Tenasserim, a goodly fasciculus of 172 pages has appeared, devoted to various Indian Ornithological subjects. Probably the most valuable paper is \"a second list of the birds of Southern Travancore,\" a region quite as interesting as Tenasserim, and until recently equally neglected, as least so far as its birds were concerned. Some important additions too are made to the avi-fauna of the desert country in Western India, although it is to be hoped that such species as Ruticilla mesoleuca and Lanius auriculatus will not be included in the Birds of India until their occurrence within the limits has been verified on unquestionable evidence.\n\nCaptain Legge's 'History of the Birds of Ceylon' is a most important work, of which one quarto part containing 347 pages has already appeared. I am indebted to Mr. Hume for an opportunity of seeing an early copy of this part, the only copy, I believe, that has reached India, and I can only endorse his opinion that it is the best work of the kind devoted to Indian Zoology that has appeared. Carefully and systematically arranged, very much on the model of Dresser's 'Birds of Europe,' containing ample descriptions of plumage, habits, distribution, and nidification, it is still free from excessive discursiveness, and the plates, in which most of the species peculiar to Ceylon are represented, are excellent. The present part contains the Accipitres, Psittaci and Picari\u00e6.\n\nIt is almost too soon to hope for a similar book on the birds of all India. Should such a work be produced, there are, I would suggest, two slight additions that would greatly increase its value in the hands of students. One of these is a key to the genera and species, the other the addition of lithographs or woodcuts giving details of characteristic parts, such as the bills, feet and primaries.\n\nAs ornithology appears to be the favourite zoological study of so many Anglo-Indians, it is impossible to avoid regretting the conservatism shewn in one respect by the leaders of the science in India. It is not surprising that Jerdon's 'Birds of India' should be a favourite book, for but few works on birds possess higher merits, and it is unquestionable that the existence of this book has aided greatly in fostering a taste for ornithology. But the classification adopted by Jerdon was antiquated and obsolete, even when his book was published, and very important advances have been made in our knowledge of the affinities of the various families since it appeared, so that at the present day there is really no excuse for such absurdities as the Penang and Singapore, all countries more or less under British protection, be added the number will be raised to 2000.\nretention of gulls and ducks together in one order, and plovers with herons and storks in another. If there is any one point clearly made out, it is that gulls are far more closely allied to plovers than to ducks. This is, of course, only one instance out of several: the classification of swifts and goat-suckers beside swallows, of *Euptychium* beside hornbills, and of parrots next to wood-peckers are gross violations of natural affinity. Yet whilst almost everything else has been changed; whilst the nomenclature of a large proportion of the birds has been altered, a mass of additional information added as to range, habits and nidification; whilst the very limits of the country classed as British India have been so greatly extended as to change entirely the geographical range of the fauna, the worst feature of Jerdon's work, the classification, has been so religiously maintained that even the numbers given by him to the species enumerated are carefully quoted, and the numerous additional species inserted after their nearest allies. It is scarcely necessary to say that these remarks do not apply to Captain Legge's work on Ceylon birds, the arrangement of which, so far as it has gone, is consistent with our present knowledge of the class. We are, however, promised a most useful work on the Game Birds of India, including, it may be presumed, the *Anseres*, *Columbae*, *Gallin\u00e6*, *Fulicari\u00e6*, *Alectorides*, and *Limicol\u00e6* of Mr. Sclater's classification, but which would consist of broken fragments of orders under the old system. It is to be hoped that in this, which is very likely to be the first book on zoology studied by many future ornithologists, the classification will not be such as grievously to mislead every tyro who uses the work.\n\nIt is impossible to write of Indian ornithology without deploring the loss it has sustained in the death of the Marquis of Tweeddale, for many years past one of our first authorities on all subjects connected with the Avi-fauna of the Oriental region, who died at the close of the year after a few days' illness. To many of the working ornithologists of India, and especially to those who are carrying on the study in England, the loss will be irreparable, the more so as Lord Tweeddale was engaged upon a new edition of Jerdon's 'Birds of India.' Unquestionably such a work, compiled with the advantage of access to the libraries and collections of Europe, would have remedied the defects almost inseparable from the preparation of a similar monograph with only the means available in this country.\n\nThere is but little novelty to record in *Reptilia* or *Amphibia*. Colonel Beddome continues his discoveries amongst the wonderfully rich fauna of the Malabar hills, and some curious forms of lizards, snakes and frogs have been described by him. Some interesting forms have also been obtained by Mr. Davison in Tenasserim, and described in the Society's Journal, and a new snake has been captured in Sikkim, one of the last places from which a novelty could have been expected.\nDr. F. Day's work on the Fishes of India has been much delayed by the death of Mr. Ford, the artist, to whom the plates had been entrusted for preparation, and hitherto but one volume has appeared, containing the first 22 families of *Acanthopterygii*. Both descriptions and plates appear to be all that can be desired. It is to be hoped that, for the advantage of local students, who will have some difficulty at first in understanding the descriptions, a complete explanation of all scientific terms used may be appended, but the abundance of figures should render it easy to recognize the various forms. To the volume there are no less than 68 plates, exquisitely drawn, each representing on an average about 6 species.\n\nWhen Dr. Day's work on the Indian fishes is concluded, we shall possess hand-books of all the vertebrate classes; Jerdon's Mammals and Birds, G\u00fcnther's Reptiles and *Amphibia*, Theobald's on Reptiles alone and Day's on Fishes. But with the exception of the last, all these works are more or less imperfect, and require considerable additions in order to bring them up to the present state of our knowledge. The most imperfect of all is perhaps that on the *Amphibia*, the number of which, known to inhabit British India and its dependencies, has been greatly increased since Dr. G\u00fcnther's work was produced. Large and expensive illustrated works are not so much needed as books on the model of Jerdon's, of such size as to be easily carried, and containing sufficient descriptions to enable any one with a little study to identify the animals he meets with.\n\nBut much as hand-books of Indian *Vertebrata* are wanted, there is a far greater need of similar aids to the study of the *Invertebrata*. In the course of the last few years a beautifully illustrated work on land and freshwater shells, the \"Conchologia Indica\" of Hanley and Theobald, has been published, but I know of no other monograph of any large group of Indian invertebrates. The number of students would be greatly increased were the means of identifying the animals greater, and even from a practical point of view, the only view in which, I regret to say, the majority of the world is capable of sympathizing, much good might be done. For instance, the injury done yearly by insects to the crops of India is something enormous, without considering the mischief inflicted by our various six-footed rivals and enemies in other ways. Yet we scarcely know which kinds of insects are to be guarded against, nor what are their natural enemies, and any one desirous of ascertaining the species and of learning what is known about their habits must search through an extensive library in order to gain the information required.\n\nIn time much aid in the preparation of books on Indian natural history may be anticipated from the officers of the Indian Museum. The only work hitherto commenced on any portion of the invertebrate collection, Mr.\nNevill's 'Hand-list of Mollusca,' is little more than an enumeration of the specimens in the Museum. This by itself is extremely useful, and would be easily rendered more so by a reference to a description and figure in the case of each species, but it is a matter for regret that the labour spent in determining so many foreign land Mollusca, all comparatively well known, and perhaps better monographed than almost any other section of invertebrata, should not have been devoted instead to the preparation of a work on the marine Mollusca of the Indian seas.\n\nOne small fasciculus, containing three families of freshwater Gasteropoda, the Ampullariidae, Valvatidae and Paludinidae was issued in 1877. This part contained numerous references, and many excellent critical remarks, but in the much larger part printed last year the remarks are comparatively much fewer, and scarcely any references are given. This, it is true, is not of much importance, since the Indian land-shells are mostly figured in the 'Conchologia Indica,' and all can be found in Pfeiffer's monographs, both of which works are, of course, well known to every naturalist who pays more than a passing attention to the subject, but it may fairly be hoped that any future fasciculi containing lists of marine Mollusca will be rendered more useful to students by the addition of references, if not of descriptions. It is also, I think, unfortunate that Mr. Nevill should have adopted the classification of Carus and Gaerstecker, as it is, I believe, in error in classing together the Helicinidae, Cyclostomidae and Cyclotidae in one suborder Neurobranchia, a suborder founded on the old false system of neglecting all the details of structure except the characters of one prominent organ. The breathing organ is selected in this particular instance, although its variability in some families of Prosobranchiate Gasteropoda, such as the Littorinidae and Cerithiidae, is notorious, and the close resemblance of these groups to some of the so-called Neurobranchia is manifest. It is true that Mr. Nevill has the majority of European conchologists with him, but very few of these have had the same advantage of becoming acquainted with the animals of operculated land-shells that Indian observers possess. If the Cyclophoridae belong to a suborder of Gasteropoda distinct from that comprising Littorinidae, and if the distinction of the supposed suborder Neurobranchia be founded on the absence of gills, why is not Assiminea removed from the Rissoidae (as is done by von Martens) and Cerithidea obtusa* from the Cerithiidae, and both classed with the other air-breathing Gasteropoda?\n\nAnother cause for regret, due I believe also to the evil example of Messrs. Carus and Gaerstecker, is the want of uniformity in the termi-\n\n* See Stoliczka P. A. S. B., 1869, p. 187, and 1871, p. 114. Dr. Stoliczka's most valuable observations appear to have been much overlooked by Malacologists.\nnology used for names of families and subfamilies. In this matter it may be hoped in future that the British Association rules will be followed, and the terminations id\u00e6 and in\u00e6 employed, as they are by almost all English zoologists. It is confusing to find Ampullariacea and Paludinid\u00e6, Helicid\u00e6 and Auriculacea, Aciculidae, Pomatiacea, Helicinacea, &c., as families and Onchidiid\u00e6, Testacellid\u00e6, Limacea, Philomycid\u00e6, Arionid\u00e6, Helicea, Vaginulid\u00e6, Orthalicea, Succineacea, Otinea, Melampoa &c., Cyclotina, Cyclophorina, &c., Pupinea, Cyclostomina and Realica as sub-families.\n\nThe value of Mr. Nevill's catalogue consists in the large number of authentic localities, and in the care which has been given to the generic and sub-generic classification of that most difficult family the Helici\u00e6. To a few details, such as the position assigned to Camptonyx and to the sub-genus Thysonota, I should be disposed to take exception, but I believe the greater part of the classification is sound. As a rule too, though not so often as would be desired, in each locality, the name of the province or district is given after that of obscure villages, streams or hills, a most important matter constantly neglected by compilers of catalogues, and which should be invariably attended to.\n\nThe promised description by Mr. Moore of the new species in the late Mr. W. S. Atkinson's large collection of Indian Lepidoptera will, it may be hoped, be in the hands of members of this Society before long. Meantime it is satisfactory to see that numerous descriptions of Indian butterflies and moths from the collections of Mr. Atkinson, Capt. Beavan, Col. Godwin-Austen and others have appeared within the past year in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society. In the same Journal for the preceding year Mr. F. Moore gave a complete list of the known Lepidoptera of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, together with a table shewing the geographical distribution of each species, a most important addition. Mr. Wood-Mason has continued his notices of certain orthopterous forms in the same periodical and elsewhere.\n\nDuring the past year, the arrangements for the description of the very varied collections made by the late Dr. Stoliczka in the Punjab hills, Kashmir, Ladakh, the Kuenlun, Eastern Turkestan, the Pamir, Wakh\u00e1n &c., when accompanying the mission sent by the Government to Yarkand and Kashghar in 1873-74, have been completed by Mr. Wood-Mason, and a commencement of printing the various reports has been made. The following is a list of the naturalists engaged in working out the different groups of invertebrata.\n\nMollusca, ......................... Mr. G. Nevill.\nColeoptera, .......................

Wood-Mason.\nOrthoptera, }\n\nThe birds have been worked out by Mr. Hume, the fishes by Dr. F. Day, and the mammalia (except the bats, which Mr. Dobson has examined) and reptiles by myself. I have also compiled the geological portion of the work, and I have already noticed that some very interesting fossils will be described by Professor Martin Duncan. The parts containing the fishes, Reptilia and Amphibia, Mollusca, Neuroptera, Hymenoptera and Geology are now ready for issue, and those on Spiders and Mammalia are in the press. With so much able assistance, it may be hoped that we shall succeed in producing a worthy memorial of our late friend Dr. Stoliczka.\n\nThe arch\u00e6ological literature of India has been enriched by the publication of two Volumes, VII and VIII, of Reports from the Arch\u00e6ological Survey of India. Both these volumes are by Mr. Beglar. Of the \"Indian Antiquary,\" certainly one of the most admirably edited periodicals ever published in India, parts have appeared monthly. The names of the writers in this Journal are sufficient to shew the value of the contributions, and it is manifest that the cessation from existence of those scientific periodicals in India that have attained Nirvana is due to other causes than want of raw material.\n\nFew subjects of enquiry in India have made so rapid an advance in the course of the last few years as Meteorology. The establishment, first of provincial reporters, and then of a central office for the whole of India, has been succeeded in the last twelve months by a plan of telegraphic reporting. From the commencement of the monsoon in 1878, reports have been received once daily by telegraph from 8 stations in Assam, 10 in Bengal, 3 in Burma, 8 in the North-West Provinces; 7 in the Punjab, 8 in Bombay and Berar, 3 in the Central Provinces, 6 in Madras and 1 in Ceylon, or 49 in all. These reports give readings of the barometer, wet and dry bulb thermometers, the wind direction and amount of cloud, all observed at 10 A. M., and the rainfall in the preceding 24 hours, together with remarks on the weather. The returns of each morning are received during the day at the head quarters of the Government, either at Simla or Calcutta, and printed off, with remarks, in time to be issued early on the following morn-\ning. In the remarks all the principal features of pressure, wind, rainfall &c., during the preceding 24 hours are noticed. The Government of India has now sanctioned the continuance of this system permanently, and has authorized the publication, with the daily reports, of lithographed weather charts for India, similar to those published for some years past in the United States and several European countries. This improvement will come into operation shortly.\n\nIt is very satisfactory to find that the vast practical importance of extended meteorological observations, and of quick and accurate information, has been so rapidly recognized throughout India as has been the case, and that the great advantage to commerce and agriculture to be derived from a careful study of the changes in the atmosphere has been appreciated, if not to the extent that it deserves, still sufficiently to convince thinking men. The time may come when a meteorological report will have to be posted at every thannah in the empire in order to warn farmers when to expect rain or fine weather for their crops, and there can be no reasonable doubt that either a continuance of dry weather or heavy rainfalls could, in India, as a general rule, be foretold several days beforehand even now. Just as the storms of Western Europe are outstripped by the telegraph in their race from the American coasts to the shores of Great Britain, so the singular cyclonic movements to which, as Mr. H. F. Blanford has shewn, the heavy rainfall of the year is mostly due, are now predicted in Northern India before the atmospheric disturbance itself has travelled beyond the shores of the Bay of Bengal.\n\nThe publication of the 'Indian Meteorologist's Vade-Mecum' by Mr. H. F. Blanford in 1877 has furnished a record of the present state of Indian Meteorology. The work consists of two parts, the first containing Instructions to Observers, with a description of different meteorological instruments, instructions as to their use, and of the precautions to be taken in observing them, and rules for the reductions necessary. The second part of the work consists of a description of the meteorology of India, and comprises chapters on the physical properties of air and vapour, the Physical Geography of India and its dependencies, Radiation and Temperature, Atmospheric pressure and Winds, Hygrometry, Cloud and Rainfall, Storms, and suggestions for future enquiry. At the end of the work are tables of annual and monthly mean barometric pressure, temperature, rainfall, &c., and an accompanying volume gives the necessary tables for the reduction of observations. The work is intended to be a Manual or Hand-book of Meteorology for India, and whilst shewing how much has been ascertained in the course of the last few years, it will serve as a mark from which to measure future progress.\nDuring the past year besides the Annual 'Reports on the Meteorology of India' for 1876, by Mr. H. F. Blanford, a large quarto work on the Meteorology of the Bombay Presidency, accompanied by a portfolio of beautifully engraved maps and diagrams, has been published in London by Mr. Charles Chambers, F. R. S., Principal of the Bombay Observatory. In this work a summary of the results derived from the observatory at Bombay since 1841, and especially from 1860, and for the last 17 years at Karachi, D\u00eds\u00e1, P\u00fana and Belgaum, is supplemented by observations made at other stations. A second number of Indian Meteorological Memoirs has also been published in Calcutta, containing papers \"on storms in Bengal with increased atmospheric pressure\" by Mr. Eliot; \"on the rainfall of Benares\" by Mr. Hill; and \"on the diurnal variation in the barometer at Calcutta and Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh\" by Mr. H. F. Blanford.\n\nThe investigation of cyclonic storms has always been one of the first duties of the Indian Meteorological Department, and has become doubly important now when so large a portion of the rainfall has been shewn to depend on the same laws as the destructive gales of the Bay of Bengal. Mr. Eliot's masterly report on the Vizagapatam and Backergunge Cyclones of October 1876 was published in 1877, and was a most important addition to previous knowledge. The Backergunge Cyclone is probably the most destructive of which any accurate information has been recorded, for it caused the death of more than 100,000 human beings, but it furnished rather more data than usual for an examination of the meteorological phenomena which preceded and accompanied it. The result of the examination of these two cyclones was distinctly in favor of Mr. H. F. Blanford's local depression theory of the causes of cyclones.\n\nI now learn from Mr. Eliot, who has officiated as Meteorological Reporter for the greater part of the past year, that an investigation of some of the recent cyclones has not only apparently confirmed the views held by Mr. H. F. Blanford and himself as to the origin of cyclonic storms, but has also shewn that the paths of the intense cyclones of May and October follow the lines (approximately if not exactly) of least relative atmospheric motion before the generation of the cyclone. The views referred to as to the origin of cyclones will be found described at length at p. 250 of the \"Meteorologist's Vade-Mecum,\" already referred to, where it is shewn that the antecedent conditions are calm weather over the sea, with a barometric pressure equal or nearly equal around the coasts. Under these circumstances a large quantity of vapour is produced by the solar heat, and this vapour being unable to escape is again condensed and liberates a great amount of latent heat over the place of its production; the replacement of cooler by warmer air induces a local diminution of atmospheric pressure, and this causes a\nviolent indraught of air. In this indraught, cyclonic circulation is caused by the earth's rotation, according to known laws. Mr. Eliot has now determined that in all probability the path of the cyclone is due to the same antecedent causes as the origin of the cyclonic movement.\n\nBut little reflection is needed in order to show the importance of these conclusions as to the laws which govern the origin and cause of cyclones. It simply means that, with a few additional opportunities of observation, such as telegraphic communication with the Andaman and Nicobar islands would afford, it would be possible, if the theories are correct, not only to tell when cyclones may be expected and when they cannot occur, but to trace out the approximate course they must follow when formed, and to give warning to threatened portions of the coast days in advance instead of hours. The importance of this for the protection of the shipping is easy to understand. But the injury done by these terrible gales to the shipping, fearful as it is, is really small compared with the destruction of life and property on shore; it is probable that more lives were lost, and more property destroyed by the Backergunge Cyclone on land in a few hours, than by all the cyclones of the Bay of Bengal at sea in the course of the last century. It is not probable that the dangers of tropical gales can be averted, but much may be done to diminish the destruction of life and property by timely warning, and this can only be given if the course of the storm can be foreseen. This most important object appears now within our reach.\n\nThe progress of Indian Meteorology cannot but be satisfactory to the Asiatic Society, for it was in no small degree owing to the representations made to the Government of India by a Committee of the Society that the Meteorological Department, which has already achieved such important results, was established.\n\nAlthough the above is so far from an exhaustive account of scientific work in India during the year 1878, that I fear, except in geology and in some branches of zoology, it gives a most imperfect idea of what has been done, I trust it will serve to shew how much labour is being expended in India upon scientific enquiry of various kinds. Time does not serve me to attempt a review of all that is being done in other parts of Asia. There are, however, two works published during the year, each a record of scientific travel, and each deserving of notice. One is the account of Colonel Prejevalski's journey to Lob-nor and the Altyn Tag, a range of mountains previously unknown, lying south of Lob-nor and forming the northern scarp of a plateau apparently connected with that of Tibet. The other is the first volume of Baron F. v. Richtofen's 'China,' containing a mass of\ninformation as to that country, and especially as to portions of it previously very imperfectly known. Indeed there can be no question that this work, the results of its author's long residence and extensive travels in the interior of the Chinese Empire, will be for a long time to come the great authority on the Celestial Kingdom. The present volume contains, amongst other matters, full details of v. Richtofen's investigations of the loess-like deposits of China, deposits which he attributes to deposition from dust transported by the atmosphere. To the same origin Dr. E. Tietze has attributed the deposits in the upland plains of Persia, and it is not unlikely that he may be correct in so doing, although I myself thought these formations due to a different mode of deposition.\n\nI had hoped in this address to enter upon at least one other subject, the distribution of the fauna of India, and to have reviewed the present state of our knowledge on the question. I had collected for this purpose some notes relating to the connection between India and some of the other zoological regions into which the earth's surface is divided, but the time at my disposal has not been sufficient to enable me to treat the subject as thoroughly as I could desire, and I must therefore postpone all remarks upon it for another opportunity.\n\nThe President added\u2014In conclusion I have to propose a vote of thanks to the Honorary Secretaries for their labours on behalf of the Society. The amount of work, and hard work, done by them at all times is so large as to merit our hearty acknowledgements, and during the past two years, in consequence, in the first place, of the alterations in the Society's house, secondly of the absence of the Natural History Secretary, who has for so many years edited Part II of the Journal, and thirdly of the resignation of the Assistant Secretary and his replacement by another, there has been more to do than usual, and by far the greater portion of this additional work has been done, and, I am sure you will agree with me, very well done by Captain Waterhouse, who has now filled the office of General Secretary for the long period of 6\u00bd years. We are also greatly indebted to several other gentlemen;\u2014to Mr. Medlicott, who undertook the duties of General Secretary for four months, during Captain Waterhouse's absence from Calcutta; to Mr. Tawney, who very obligingly carried on the work of Philological Secretary, when the sudden death of Mr. Blochmann deprived us of his invaluable services, and to Dr. Hoernle, who has now accepted the Secretaryship; to Mr. Gay, who was Treasurer until his departure from Calcutta in July, and to Mr. Beverley who has taken charge of our finances since. All of these gentlemen have given a large proportion of time, care and attention to the Society's business, and we are greatly indebted to all\nfor their aid. I think too the Society is to be congratulated upon the circumstance that so many members, all of them hardworked officers of Government, or of Educational Institutions, have offered to undertake onerous labour, when, owing to the sad loss we have experienced by the death of Mr. Blochmann, and in consequence of the absence of some of our most hard-working members, there has been an unusual amount of difficulty in providing for the current work of the Society. At the same time we have the more reason to be grateful to those upon whose exertions the progress and even the existence of the Society so largely depend, and I think the least we can do is to thank our Honorary Secretaries for the valuable work they have performed for us, and for the time and care they have devoted to our affairs.\n\nThe vote was carried unanimously.\n\nThe President announced that the Scrutineers reported the result of the elections of Officers and Council as follows:\n\nW.

Blanford, Esq.\n\nThe Secretary exhibited some gold and silver coins received from Mr. H. Rivett-Carnac, C. I. E., and read the following note regarding them.\n\nMr. Rivett-Carnac says:\n\nI submit for the inspection of the Society, three Hindu and three Muhammadan coins.\n\nOf the Hindu coins, two are gold, and one silver. They are of the class termed 'Sit\u00e1r\u00e1mi' by the villagers, the idea being that the female figure represented S\u00edt\u00e1, the male (?) figure on the obverse R\u00e1m.\n\nThey are supposed to weigh seven m\u00e1sas each, and each to be worth seven Rupees, the village rhyme running\u2014\n\nS\u00e1th Masa, Seven m\u00e1sas in weight,\nS\u00e1th d\u00e1m, Seven Rupees in value,\nEk war Sita, On one side S\u00edt\u00e1,\nEk war R\u00e1m, On the other R\u00e1m.\n\nThey are obviously of the type figured in Thomas' \"Prinsep,\" Plates XXIX, XXX. But it is not impossible that the legends may be different from those of coins in the possession of the Society, and I am encouraged by the interest taken in the S\u00e1h (?) coin recently submitted through Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra, C. I. E., to forward these also for inspection.\n\nI would enquire whether silver coins of the Kanauj series are common? I have several gold ones, but this is the first silver \"Sit\u00e1r\u00e1mi\" I have seen, and Prinsep has, I think, generally figured gold coins of this series.\n\nAs regards the Muhammadan coins, I cannot trace them in Thomas or Marsden.\n\nThe gold coin is a F\u00edr\u00faz Sh\u00e1h, but which F\u00edr\u00faz? And the two silver coins, are they common, or known?\n\nThe gold coin seems to be the same as No. 50, Plate II (silver coin of F\u00edr\u00faz Sh\u00e1h J\u00e1l\u00e1l-uddin Khilji).\n\nBut Thomas mentioned no gold coin of that king.\n\nNote by Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra.\n\nNo. 1. A silver coin of Chandra Gupta.\nNo. 2. A gold coin of Kum\u00e1ra Gupta, apparently a cast coin\u2014a forgery.\nNo. 3. A debased coin of Kum\u00e1ra Gupta. The metal is gold alloyed with about $\\frac{1}{3}$ of copper. There are some coins in which the gold and copper are in equal proportions\u2014billon. Some such were found in Jessore thirty years ago, and noticed by me in the Journal, Vol. XXI, p. 401.\n\nNo. 4. A gold coin of Jal\u00e1l-uddin Fir\u00faz Sh\u00e1h of Delhi\u2014apparently the counterpart of the unique gold coin in the British Museum, noticed by Mr. Thomas in his \"Pathan Coins,\" page 144. The legend is the same as in the silver coin figured No. 50.\n\nNo. 5. A silver coin of Nu\u00e7rat Sh\u00e1h, son of Husain Sh\u00e1h of Bengal, figured by Mr. Blochmann in the Journal, Vol. XLII, plate IX, fig. 2.\n\nNo. 6. A silver coin of Ghi\u00e1s-uddin Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h, son of Husain Sh\u00e1h of Bengal and brother of Nu\u00e7rat Sh\u00e1h. A rare coin, figured by Mr. J. W. Laidlay, in the Journal, Vol. XV, plate V, fig. 23.\n\nThe Secretary read the following communication from Mr. H. Rivett-Carnac, C. I. E., on the subject of preservation of Archaeological remains in India.\n\nMemorandum by H. Rivett Carnac, Esq., C. I. E., M. R. A. S., F. S. A., &c. on administrative Rules for the protection of Indian Antiquarian remains.\n\nI submit for the consideration of the Society, whether it would not be advisable that the Supreme Government should be addressed, with a view to the issue of some simple administrative rules for the better protection of the Antiquarian remains of the various Provinces of India.\n\nRecently when staying with Mr. Grant-Duff in England, I met Sir J. Lubbock, whose interest in such matters is well known, and on the subject being discussed, it was, I think, considered that some action was desirable. Mr. Grant-Duff, I understood, contemplated a representation being made to H. E. The Viceroy in favour of some such measure. But even if this has already been done, the subject is perhaps not undeserving of the attention of the Society.\n\nThe difficulties which Sir J. Lubbock's Bill for the United Kingdom has encountered are well known. But they are not likely to present themselves in the same form or in the same degree in India, where even legislative action will perhaps hardly be necessary, and where the district officers might, it is to be hoped, carry out without objection, the instructions approved by the Government.\n\nI am not unmindful that the Government of India has, of late years, evinced considerable interest in the subject; that Archaeology is one of the Departments under the Secretary to the Government of India for Revenue, Agriculture and Commerce; that Archaeology also now forms a heading in the Administration Reports of all Governments and administrations; that\n\"lathe\" are not used now-a-days as rollers on metalled roads; that there is a prejudice against carved and inscribed stones being utilised as foundations for bridges and other building purposes; and that the Hon'ble Sir J. Strachey has recorded a very effective protest against the demolition of architectural remains for the manufacture of temporary triumphal arches. In the Central Provinces, of which I have some knowledge, the object has received much attention, and doubtless in many other parts of India of which I have no knowledge, the same good work is going on. The interesting archaeological reports of General Cunningham shew that the examination of the antiquarian remains is progressing slowly but surely on a well-considered plan. And in the North-West Provinces, the action of Sir J. Strachey and the department created under his rule is doing much to ensure the preservation of interesting monuments, which another ten years of neglect might have placed beyond repair.\n\nStill, with all this, it is desirable, I submit, that something more should be done to protect antiquarian treasures from demolition and spoliation. If it be held that heretofore the want of special measures has not been felt, it may fairly be answered that they are necessitated by the changes which India has undergone and is rapidly undergoing. The India of to-day is widely different from the India of Tod and of Prinsep. Those who are now employed in the country have less leisure for antiquarian enquiry than their predecessors. The official of 1879 has much of his time taken up with returns and reports, of which Tod knew nothing. The daily telegrams from Europe, the weekly mails from home loaded with cheap literature, enabling all who care to do so to keep pace with European thought, distract the attention from, and restrict the leisure available for, subjects of purely Indian interest. In old days, whatever of antiquarian value was discovered, was beyond the reach of the many, and either remained undistributed or was worked up for local publication. With rapid and cheap steam communication and the aid of guide-books, a new element has recently been introduced into the country. Now-a-days many of the most important places of antiquarian interest, are, comparatively speaking, easy of access, are marked on the maps and noticed in the guide-books, with which every tourist is provided. And there is now hardly a traveller with any pretensions to intelligence or culture, who does not consider it necessary, before returning home, to master roughly, the difference between \"Buddha\" and \"Siva,\" and to carry back with him some proof of the results of his studies. The rich vein of Indian antiquarian interest once opened, the brass trays of Benares hardly satisfy the cultivated mind, and a brisk demand springs up for genuine fragments from S\u00e1nchi or old sculpturings from S\u00e1rn\u00e1th. The danger is perhaps not so much from the tra-\nweller himself as from the Philistine class of guides and collectors whom\nthe tourist creates. Hangers-on may now be found at many Indian hotels\nwho devote a portion of the dull season to grubbing up the antiquarian\nrelics of the neighbourhood and who during the tourist months display\nand descant on the value of their spoils in the verandah of Indian hotels.\nThere is hardly anything too cumbrous in the shape of an inscription or figure\nfor your cultivated tourist to collect, and to my certain knowledge, figures,\ninscriptions and bas-relief, whether of much real value, I cannot say, have\nbeen carried out and are being carried out of the country by tourists to-\ngether with Benares toys, brass trays, and Delhi jewellery.\n\nIt may be held that the above view is somewhat exaggerated, and that\nif anything at all is really carried away, it is of little value and hardly\nworthy of objection. But admitting this, it will not be denied, there is\nsome danger for the future, when the demand will most assuredly increase.\nFrom my own observation, I can state that there is little to prevent any\none from digging at Sarnath and carrying off and placing to no remunerative\nuse, what in the hands of General Cunningham might be of real value\nto antiquarian research. And what applies to Sarnath, may, so far as I\nknow, hold good for many other parts of India, the antiquarian treasures\nof which are only now beginning to be explored.\n\nAs regards coins, the recent Treasure Trove Act now provides for\nsome chance of the preservation, examination and publication of coins of\ninterest, many of which would otherwise go into the melting pot, or into\nthe hands of so-called collectors, who, as I have myself seen, think little of\npiercing the legend in order to utilise the coin as an ornament. But what\nis there to prevent the new class of guides or their myrmidons, when they\nhave once realised the market value of such relics, from collecting slabs\nand tablets of more or less interest, for sale to travellers who are not certain\nto be able to appreciate their worth? And travellers are not the only of-\nfenders. Old carvings and sculpturings and inscribed tablets may some-\ntimes, I believe, be seen in the rockeries or ferneries of station gardens.\nAt present there is nothing, so far as I know, to prevent me, or any one\nlike myself who pretends to take an interest in antiquarian research, from\ndigging up a tumulus or demolishing the ruined wall of a temple, and an-\nnexing and placing to no real remunerative use, the relics which in the\nhands of an expert might prove of no small value in the determination of\nvexed points in Indian history.\n\nThe Hon'ble Mr. Egerton, C. S. I., the present Lieutenant-Governor of\nthe Punjab, when Commissioner of Nagpur, discovered in a field near Ram-\ntak an inscribed slab which was found to contain a copy of Asoka's well-\nknown edicts; although the edicts had been discovered in many other parts\nof India, their existence in the wild out-of-the-way Nagpur Province was unknown. This discovery, placed by Mr. Egerton in the hands of General Cunningham, has proved of real value, as shewn by his recently published volume on Indian Inscriptions. But one cannot depend upon such treasures always falling into the hands of men like Mr. Egerton. Others ignorant of its value, might think little of bricking such a tablet into a wall or of utilising it, as I myself have seen an inscription used, to replace the broken leg of a school form.\n\nWhat I urge is, that antiquarian remains, unless other well established interests exist, should be considered to be State property, and should be brought under the protection and management of the State, in the manner that Sir J. Lubbock's Act suggests, or as is provided for in the French system of \"Administration des Monuments Nationaux.\" And, save under permission from competent authority, I would not allow any one to dig, or demolish on any such ground, or to remove or place to his private use any specimen or relic that may be discovered. Investigations or excavations should be carried on upon an approved plan, the fortunate discoverer of anything of interest being obliged, as I believe is the rule in the Central Provinces, to report the result of his investigation to the Collector or Deputy Commissioner. A full description of the discovery should then be forwarded to the Government, and to the Asiatic Society, and the specimens found should, if necessary, become the property of Government for preservation in the Indian Museum. I would not of course advocate that the finder should not have every encouragement to describe the result of his labours, or obtain full credit for his research. To do this, would be to remove what often is the chief incentive to work and to dig. But local antiquaries may not always be competent to test whether a discovery is really of value or not. My object is to insist on the result of all such investigations being subjected to the test of efficient criticism, with a view to the publication of the results, where they are of value, and to prevent what may be of real interest being carried out of the country by those who may or may not appreciate its merits.\n\nThe subject, I submit, is not unworthy of the attention of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, which has done so much to promote an interest in, and to secure a record of the progress of Indian antiquarian research.\n\nIf supported by the weight of the recommendation of the Society, the idea would, I am sanguine, receive the attention of the supreme Government, many of whose members have evinced a valuable interest in the preservation of what still remains to us of the monuments of the Ancient History of India.\n\nIn conclusion, I would desire again to call the attention of the Society\nto the remarks contained in my Memorandum of January of last year, published in the Society's Proceedings for February 1877, regarding the neglected condition of the celebrated Buddhist Stupa at Sarnath. Until recently, at least, no attempt had been made to save this grand old relic from ruin. The trees are still applying the powerful levers of their roots to the masonry of the tower. The massive stones with their beautiful tracery are being gradually but surely displaced, and must fall if some measures are not promptly taken to clamp or support them. If they do fall, I am quite confident there are many enterprising tourists who will gladly bid for the fragments of one of the most remarkable monuments of its class in the world.\n\nSince this was written a notice has appeared of the discovery, as was to be expected, of valuable antiquarian remains in the country now occupied by our troops in Afghanistan. If no action has yet been taken it would be desirable, I submit, that instructions should issue that excavations should be carried out on a well-considered plan, and under competent supervision, and that the relics found should be kept together, and not distributed.\n\nThe following paper was read.\n\nOn the Operations for obtaining the Discharges of the large Rivers in Upper Assam during 1877-1878 \u2014 By Lieut.

Rivett-Carnac, Esq., C. I. E.\n\nThe Secretary read the following extract from a demi-official letter, dated 21st February, 1879, from Major H. C. B. Tanner to Major-Genl. Walker, Surveyor General of India.\n\n\"I told you in a former letter that I had found a new language. I am steadily going on with it for it is closely allied to the language of the Kafirs. My interpreter Hassain Khan, a resident of Kunar, teaches me; it is his mother-tongue, and he has brought to my aid one of the Sirdars of Kunar, Mir Ahmed Khan of Shewa (or K\u00e9l as the Kunar people call it). The Mir is very intelligent and has influence among all the tribes to his north, and I am quite confident that I require only his help to get me a footing in Kafiristan. He often comes to see me, and takes the greatest interest in my study of his language. He makes me read over what I have written down, for he says that I must learn the pronunciation of the upper and not of the lower classes.\"\n\"Shewa is at the mouth of Dara N\u00far (Valley of Light?) which runs into the Kund mountain. The villages up the valley are inhabited by Dehgans who are not Pathans, but descendants of the original people of this country (probably); and Mir Ahmad Kh\u00e1n has great influence among them. Beyond Dara N\u00far, there comes M\u00e1z\u00e1r Dara which rises also in Kund, and flows S. E., falling into the Kunar River at Nurgal, and it is the inhabitants of this valley who are my stumbling-block. They are Pathans and Safis and have never become subjects of the Am\u00edr; and the other day, when the principal chief of the Kunar valley was coming in to tender his allegiance, they attacked him in force. Beyond Mazar Dara there flows Chauki Dara, also rising in Kund but having a course almost easterly (as I take it). The inhabitants are Safis and Momands and are not subjects of the Amir, and are therefore yaghi, or independent as they are termed.\n\n\"Now, beyond Chauki is Pech, a valley (or dara) also rising in Kund but flowing N. E. into the Kunar River. Of Pech I know little or nothing; but it is beyond Pech that the interesting and unknown tract of Kafiristan commences, and it is to introduce to you two of the inhabitants of the valley N. W. of Pech, that I have entered into this long and tedious preface. I had long heard of a tribe called Ch\u00faguni and I therefore sent the Subadar (Hussain Khan my interpreter) to bring some of them in to me. These Ch\u00fagunis are the next door neighbours of the Kafirs and live in a valley, which as far as I can understand, flows from Kund northwards and then turning east empties itself into the Kunar near Ch\u00e1g\u00e1r Sarai.\n\n\"They are a powerful clan, and can number 6000 fighting men, but are true wild men of the hills, and seldom come as far as Jelalabad; and like all true and wild mountaineers, dislike to expose themselves to the unknown perils which may be experienced in travelling in an open plain. To sell their ghi, cheese and wood, the Ch\u00fagunis cross the head waters of the valleys I have named, and come down into the Dara N\u00far, at Amla (Indian name); and it was at that place that the Subadar found the two specimens which he brought to me. He had to give his nephew as a hostage and make many protestations of friendship before they would consent to come. Wild ragged fellows they were, of pale complexions and thin features. Their legs were clothed with coarse goat's hair socks, then an outer covering of goat's hair and such curious untanned shoes tied on in a cunning fashion. One of them spoke nothing but his own language, but the other, who was described to me as being a great warrior, spoke Pushtu; so with the Subadar as an interpreter we got on very well together. I kept the men four days and during that time, when I had leisure, managed to elicit a good deal of information about them and their valleys. The \"warrior\" informed me that he had been brought up amongst the Kafirs, and indeed I\nfound that his own language differed but little from that of the Kafirs which he appeared to know thoroughly. I learned\u2014I cannot say with any amount of pleasure\u2014that there are nearly as many languages in Kafiristan as there are tribes, but of this I am pretty well sure, that the one which I have been learning from the Subadar, may be taken as typical of the whole. I asked the Ch\u00faguni the numbers in the Kafir tongue, and they almost exactly correspond with those given by Burns, but the dialogue given by him differs as much from the Kafir language of my Ch\u00faguni, as the latter does from the Kunar language, which may be broadly called the Kunar dialect of the Kochis.\n\n\"My two wild men soon tired of this place and its novel and strange sights, and went away assuring me that my life would be protected by them in their own valley, as they would protect their own heads. They have gone under a promise to bring back two L\u00e1l Kafirs, and are to be here in 8 days, and it is with the Ch\u00fagunis that I must enter Kafiristan if I do it at all. They are half Kafir themselves, and though professed Mussalm\u00e1ns they seem to have their sympathies more with the hereditary enemies of their co-religionists than with the Muhammadans.\"\n\nCapt. Waterhouse exhibited some gold and copper coins and relics &c. found by Mr. W. Simpson in the Ahin Posh Tope near Jelalabad, and read the following letter from Mr. Simpson to Colonel Colley regarding them.\n\n\"Yesterday morning (16th February,) I penetrated to the centre of the Ahin Posh Tope, and found the cell. In it there lay about two or three handfuls of what I suppose to be ashes, 18 gold coins, and a golden relic-holder, for wearing by a cord round the neck. It is $3\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long, and in it were 2 gold coins and a small dark-coloured substance which I suppose was a relic. All these objects I have delivered over to Major Cavagnari, who is sending them off to Calcutta for Lord Lytton.\n\n\"I write this to give a very slight account of the position of the cell and the finding of the objects, all of which will no doubt be of interest to His Excellency. The tope is about 80 feet diameter, but I had to begin the gallery from what remains of the square base, which gave me about 45 feet of digging; and judging from other topes with galleries which were made to get at the articles deposited, I guessed that it would be wisest to go on the level of the lowest bed of stones. When the gallery reached the centre, the cell was at my feet.\n\n\"It had been formed of slates and on the surface of the ground. We apply the term \"Buddhist Masonry\" to the kind we find here. It is of stones with a slate packing. The accompanying sketch will give its\ncharacter. This peculiar kind of masonry may have had the earthquakes of this country in view. The Ahin Posh Tope is externally of this kind of building, but through the whole 45 feet of masonry within, there was nothing but large water-worn boulders embedded in mud, and it was very hard work to dig them out. So when the men at last unbared some slate, I knew that the centre had been found. I was anxious to know exactly how it was arranged, and caused the stones to be cut out till I had got beyond it, and felt that there was no more slate either on its offside or at either end. I then lifted up a large slate about 3 feet long\u2014beneath this was another large slate\u2014and on raising it the central cell was opened. It was about 15 inches on each of its sides, I think it was intended for a perfect cube, about 15 courses of slate\u2014I rather think it was 14 courses\u2014I hope to measure it more perfectly. The most conspicuous object was the golden relic-holder. I had expected a jar with the ashes in it, but they simply lay on the bottom of the cell. The bottom being also slate\u2014I could see one coin among the ashes, and as I began to gather them, coin after coin was found, till at last I counted 18 of them in all.\n\n\"There are some Roman coins among them, and one is of the reign of Domitian. This is important, as giving at least an approximate date to the Tope. That Emperor died 96 A.D., so the Tope cannot be dated earlier than that. I believe it is some centuries later.\n\n\"I am not up in coins, and we have no one here at the moment who can tell us about them, but you will no doubt be able to get them all explained when they reach Calcutta, and I should feel obliged for any account of them that may be made.\n\n\"I have also given Major Cavagnari some unimportant copper coins and other objects found in the excavation.\n\n\"The final destination of the coins &c. is a matter for Lord Lytton to determine. I would say either the Lahore Museum or the Indian Museum at South Kensington. Kindly point out to Lord Lytton that it would be as well to consider also where all sculptures and other archaeological finds should be sent for presentation, and where they would be of use to Archaeologists.\n\n\"I am now told that the exploration of the many topes we see here already opened was the work of Masson. Why he left such a prominent tope as the Ahin Posh one untouched I do not know. There is another very large one, it is 100 feet diameter, known as the \"Ummer Kheyl tope,\" which I think is untouched, I feel now a very strong desire to have it opened. About three-fourths of the topes hereabouts have been\nopened, but I know a good number which are still with their finds within them, but the Ummer Kheyl one ought to give us something: a message from you would get it done quickly.\n\n\"I am still going on bringing to light what remains of the architecture of the Ahin Posh Tope, and we have now visible some figures in plaster which remain on the square base. In a few days it will be so far advanced that a proper plan can be made.\"\n\nCapt. Waterhouse said that of the 20 gold coins 3 were Roman and the remainder Greek, one showing a good figure of the preaching Buddha with an inscription in Greek BO\u0394\u0394O. The relics and other articles consisted of a gold relic-holder inlaid with garnets and containing two gold coins and a piece of relic.\n\nA piece of clear white glass with dark blue raised bands.\n2 pieces of shell.\n11 copper coins.\n1 piece of red stone.\n1 small leaden bullet.\n1 small glass (?) bead.\n1 piece of fused glass.\n\nHe had heard that these coins and relics had been received by the Viceroy, and thinking that they would be of interest to the Society, he had written to the Private Secretary for permission to exhibit them at the meeting.\n\nDr. Hoernle and Mr. Tawney made some remarks on the coins.\n\nThe President said that the Society was greatly indebted to His Excellency the Viceroy for an opportunity of seeing these interesting coins &c. As they had only been received that evening there had been no time to examine them thoroughly as yet.*\n\nDr. Hoernle exhibited a MS. of the well known Pr\u00e1krit grammar of Vararuchi, edited by Professor Cowell. In many points its readings differ considerably from those of the published text. For example after viii. 37, there is an entirely new sutra: chhijjabhijj\u00e1v apy eke || chhijjai, bhijjai || The phraseology of the commentary is generally different and very much more concise. The Sanskrit translations of the Pr\u00e1krit examples are, as a rule, omitted. Instead of 12 chapters there are only 10; the last one containing all the rules of the usual 10th, 11th, 12th chapters and dividing them merely by the remarks iti pais\u00e1chi after x, 14, and\n\n* Dr. Hoernle has succeeded in determining all the coins, among which he finds two unique ones. They will be described at the next meeting. Ed\niti m\u0101gadh\u012b after x, 31 (=xi, 17). The last rule x, 63 (=xii, 32) has the following commentary added: mah\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drodbhav\u0101\u1e41 bh\u0101h\u0101\u1e41 visuddham pr\u0101k\u1e5btam vidu\u1e25, ity uktah ||. The whole ends with the formula iti Vararuchivirachit\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 manoram\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 v\u1e5bttau bh\u0101shavibh\u0101sh\u0101vibh\u0101go n\u0101ma da\u015bamah parichhedah || sam\u0101pt\u0101 cheyam manorama v\u1e5bttih ||. The commentary accordingly is here ascribed to Vararuchi himself, and not, as usual, to Bhamaha; so also at the end of the 2nd chapter, iti vararuchikrt\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 manoram\u0101v\u1e5bttau dvitiyah parichhedah ||. On the other hand at the end of the 1st chapter the formula is iti vararuchik\u1e5bte pr\u0101k\u1e5btaprak\u0101se prathama\u1e41 parichhedah. In the remaining chapters no author is mentioned at all; the uniform formula being iti manoram\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 v\u1e5bttau (tritiyah etc) parichhedah. The MS. bears no date; but its appearance is old. The characters are N\u0101gari; now and then rather indistinct from age; in other places evidently re-drawn wrongly, sometimes by a later hand. It consists of 11 leaves (paper), of 18 lines each. It belongs to Pandit R\u0101madatta of Amritsar (Panj\u0101b). An accurate list of all its various readings has been made.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. The Snake Symbol in India, specially in connection with the Worship of Siva. By H. Rivett-Carnac, Esq., C. I. E., M. R. A. S., F. S. A., &c.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe author begins by stating that the snake as a personal ornament or as a canopy surmounting the figure is not confined to representations of Siva, but is to be seen overshadowing Vishnu, Garuda and others. The snake symbol also appears in the prehistoric cromlechs and menhirs of Europe, in which also traces of phallic worship may be traced. The author's attention has been given to the subject chiefly in connection with the worship of Siva, with a view to ascertain whether the worship of the snake and that of Mah\u0101deo or the phallus may be considered identical, and whether the presence of the serpent in the prehistoric remains of Europe can be shown to support his theory that the markings on the cromlechs and menhirs are indeed the traces of this form of worship, carried to Europe from the East by the tribes whose remains are buried in the tumuli.\n\nThe author then describes a series of articles in brass, obtained in the Benares bazar, in which the snake is found in one form or another. These articles accompanied the paper, and were exhibited to the Meeting.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\nSince the meeting, Babu Pratapa Chandra Ghosha has kindly forwarded the following note on the articles exhibited by Mr. Carnac.\n\nIt is interesting to observe how the ornamental and the artistic help in complicating the myths of the Hindu religion. The occurrence of the snake on several of the articles exhibited is ornamental in some and inconsistent with the S\u00e1stras in a few. The snake on the spoon or ladle is for ornamental purposes, and that on the bell is altogether out of place. The S\u00e1stras make no mention of the necessity of any such figures on the handles of spoons, sacrificial ladles or water-pots. In the case of the bell the only figure directed to be represented on a religious bell is that of Garuda, the bird-god. The Padma Purana has the following\u2014\"He is not a Bh\u00e1gavat (worshipper of Bhagav\u00e1n) in this iron age who has not in his house a conch-shell or a bell surmounted by a Garuda or the bird-god.\" Such a bell as the above is used in the worship of V\u00e1sudeva (Vishnu). And although in the S\u00e1stras regarding the worship of Siva and R\u00e1machandra, it is nowhere provided that the bell used in such service should be adorned with figures of snake and Hanuman, (the monkey-god), the v\u0101hanas of the two gods respectively, yet the bell-maker in his devoutness has added these figures to the bell thinking that such a bell would serve the threefold worship of Siva, Vishnu and R\u00e1machandra. The white paint of sandal-wood paste on the lingam in the form of a circle or a semicircle and a dot, is intended to represent the sacerdotal thread (poit\u00e1) and the mark (phont\u00e1) and, in the case of the semicircle, the half moon which is said to adorn the forehead of Siva.\n\nIn the paper on Tree and Serpent worship published in Part I, No. 3, J. A. S. B. for 1870, Ananta the serpent king is said to have a thousand heads and four arms. In the Briddha Baudh\u00e1yana quoted by Hem\u00e1dri, a N\u00e1g is ordinarily described to have five heads.\n\nIn the Visvakarm\u00e1 S\u00e1stra, Anant\u00e1 is said to have a hundred thousand heads, and the other secondary eight N\u00e1gas to have seven heads each.\n\nA N\u00e1ga is said to have hoods and the body of a man, the lower extremities being like those of a reptile. A sarpa or serpent is a reptile. The three-headed or the nine-headed snakes are imaginative figures, they have no foundation in the S\u00e1stras. The figures of snakes forming backs of\nthe shrines exhibited are evidently artistic and ornamental, they have no direct connection with serpent worship.\n\nCup-marks occurring in the vicinity of sepulchral monuments suggest their origin in the Smritis, in which it is stated that after the cremation of the body, the son of the deceased is directed to offer water and milk \u0928\u0940\u0930 and \u0936\u0940\u0930 to the manes of the departed, and the water and milk are generally presented in unburnt clay cups, and it is not unfrequent that they are poured in little hollows made with the finger on the soft ground of the river side where the funeral ceremony is generally performed. May not the cup-marks on stone slabs represent these water and milk cups offered to the spirits of the departed?\n\nThe ant hill has been known to be a resort of snakes where these reptiles have been seen to coil themselves up for comfortable and warm lodging. The eggs of ants and the queens of the same are well known favourite food of snakes.\n\n2. Pr\u00e9cis of a Report on Electric Light Experiments.\u2014By L. Schwendler, Esq.\n\nMr. Schwendler said it would be impracticable to read the \"Pr\u00e9cis of Report on Electric Light Experiments\" in extenso, since it contained too many technicalities which could not easily be followed if the paper were read in the manner usual at these meetings, and that he therefore would prefer to give verbally a short account of his researches and the results obtained. He stated that the enquiry originated with General Strachey who, in April 1876, recommended to the Secretary of State that a trial of illuminating Indian Railway Stations by the electric light, should be made. In February 1877, Mr. Schwendler was requested to institute detailed enquiries which led him to propose that it would be advisable to first make some more experiments, before a practical trial at Indian Railway Stations should be attempted. The Board of Directors of the East Indian Railway Company agreed to this, and sanctioned the necessary outlay, whatever it might come to.\n\nThe experiments made at the India Office Stores, London, terminated on the 1st November, 1878. The report, however, could not be finished in time, before Mr. Schwendler left for India, and he therefore prepared a Pr\u00e9cis\u2014the paper before the meeting to-night. After pointing out the general results obtained, and explaining in a brief manner the three principal questions at issue, viz.\u2014\n\nEconomy of the electric light; practicability and efficiency of the electric light for certain illuminating purposes; and best means of distribution of the electric light\u2014Mr. Schwendler proceeded:\nYou all have heard no doubt a great deal about the division of the electric light. During the last two years this question has been before the public almost permanently. This is not to be wondered at if we consider that on the solution of this problem it will ultimately depend whether the new mode of lighting becomes a successful and general rival to the illumination by gas, or other combustive means. But before entering on the subject it will be best to formulate the question definitely, to avoid any misunderstanding with respect to the answer I am about to give. The question is: A given permanent current (C), no matter how produced, does work in a closed single circuit of total resistance (R), of which a part (r) represents the resistance of one electric arc. This electric arc produces an electric light of measured intensity (I). Now if we introduce instead of one arc, two arcs of resistance \\( r' \\) and \\( r'' \\) and measured light intensities \\( i' \\) and \\( i'' \\) respectively, and suppose the current to be the same as before\u2014or the E. M. F. and total resistance in the single circuit the same, then \\( a \\) priori we should conclude that \\( I = i' + i'' \\) for \\( r = r' + r'' \\). Experiments, however, show that this is not the case, i.e., the sum of the measured intensities of two small lights is perceptibly smaller than the measured intensity of one large light, and this difference becomes larger and larger as we increase the number of lights produced by the same current, i.e., by the same E. M. F. with the same total resistance in circuit. This appears at first sight an inconsistency with the known laws of cause and effect. How is it possible that the same current through the same resistance should produce more light in one point than in two points, although the total amount of work done by the given and constant current is exactly the same in one point as in two points?\n\nThat the measured intensity of one light, is invariably greater than the sum of the measured intensities of \\( n \\) lights, is an undoubted fact proved by my own experiments very conclusively. But we may well ask what has become of the energy which is expended and does not appear as light?\n\nA careful analysis of all the physical facts connected with the subject will, however, show easily enough how this apparent loss of energy is to be accounted for, without reverting to far-fetched explanations, and without the necessity of making such statements as: \"the division of the electric light is in contradiction to dynamic principles;\" or \"the laws of nature must be reversed\"\u2014whatever that may mean; or \"new laws have to be discovered first, before a solution of this important problem could be even attempted;\" &c. &c., which I have read frequently in scientific or professional journals and newspapers. Statements of this kind appear very clever to the uninitiated, and they are exceedingly cheap to make, but they\nwill invariably do an enormous amount of harm towards the further progress of an important application of the resources of nature.\n\nIt will be seen from the foregoing that I have called the light intensity\u2014measured intensity. For if we produce a light by any source, it will be at once perceived that not all the light produced by that source can be made available for illuminating purposes. A part of the total light will be lost for the special purpose of illumination, inasmuch as only a part of the total light is in a position to act on the Photometer, or which is the same, on the retina. Hence we may say, the total light produced by any means consists of two parts\u2014the one is lost for illuminating purposes, and may be called internal light; the other acts on the retina, can be measured, and may be called external or measured light. For instance, of all the light produced in one electric arc, a considerable part is hidden by the electrodes between which the arc plays. Because the electrodes have a volume, and moreover the positive electrode is hollowed out like a dome, and it is the highest point of that dome, which contains the most intense light, which is mostly lost. How much this loss in each case will be, depends on a variety of circumstances. In the first place, all other conditions being the same, that loss will increase with the thickness of the electrodes. The loss of light will further increase with a decrease of the length of the arc. By length of arc is to be understood the distance between the highest point of the hollow of the positive electrode and the apex of the negative electrode. Hence already in the case of one arc, although naturally we have here the longest arc, for the given current and the given electrodes, the light lost or the internal light may represent a considerable portion of the total light produced in the arc.\n\nIf we produce two arcs, it will be seen at once that the sum of the losses must be greater than the loss in one arc. Hence the sum of the measured intensities of two lights must also be smaller than the measured intensity of one light. Suppose the length of one arc, when a given current passes, is 3 m.m., then the sum of the lengths of two arcs will not be 3 m.m., but much less, in order to have the same current passing through the two arcs as passed before through one. From this it follows that the loss of light must increase rapidly with the number of lights, and moreover that soon a limit to the possible practical division of the electric light is reached, leaving out the question of economy altogether.\n\nThis constitutes one of the reasons why the division of the electric light becomes less and less economical with increase of the number of lights, and that soon a practical limit will be reached for the division.\n\nTo express this result more definitely, we may say:\nThe consumption of power per unit of measured or external light is an increasing function with the number of lights produced by a given current in a single circuit.\n\nSupposing, of course, always that the sum of the resistances of \\( n \\) arcs is equal to the resistance of one arc, and that the other resistance in the circuit, in which no light is produced, has remained constant throughout.\n\nIf we had a material infinitely conducting, of infinite strength, and with a melting point at least as high as that of carbon, then surely the division of the light would be perfectly economical, up to any limit, inasmuch as we might then use linear electrodes.\n\nIn practice we can only try to approach this limit. Up to the present time, there appears to be no better material for electrodes than carbon, either natural or artificial. But this is no reason why an effort should not be made to try to find a material for electrodes more accommodating to the division of the electric light than even carbon. The above, limited strength, limited electric conductivity and limited melting point of the material of electrodes, constitutes only one of the difficulties, which stand in the way of an unlimited economical division of the electric light.\n\nA second cause is for instance the fact that in each arc an E. M. F. is established in opposition to the original E. M. F. and by no means to be neglected against it. This secondary E. M. F. established in each arc, appears to be a function of the current which passes the arc, most likely proportional to that current. Hence, if for a given current passing one arc this secondary E. M. F. be \\( e \\), then the same current through \\( n \\) arcs, successively connected, would produce an E. M. F. equal to \\( ne \\). This secondary E. M. F. \\( ne \\) is to be subtracted from the original E. M. F., and internal resistance of the original E. M. F. plus resistance of leading wires having remained constant, we necessarily have to decrease the total resistance of the \\( n \\) arcs in order to work with the same current as before. This merely means a decrease of the total length of the \\( n \\) arcs, or which is the same, an increase of internal light or decrease of the measured or external light. A parallel connection of the \\( n \\) arcs with reference to the poles of the given original E. M. F. would certainly produce only one secondary E. M. F. instead of \\( n \\), and for this reason it might be better to use the parallel circuit for the division of the electric light. But there are other very important objections to this solution. In the first case, as can be easily shewn, the variation of one arc has a far greater influence on the variation of the others, in parallel, than in successive circuit. Further, the length of each arc must be made very much smaller, in parallel circuit than in consecutive circuit.\n\nAnother reason against an unlimited economical division of the elec-\ntric light is constituted by the practical necessity that lamps, of whatever construction they may be, have a resistance inherent to their nature in addition to the resistance of the arc. For instance, in an ordinary lamp with an electromagnet, the resistance of the lamp consists of the resistance of the electromagnet plus the resistance of the two electrodes when metallically closed. This resistance, although small, is by no means nil, and cannot be neglected against the resistance of the arc, especially when strong currents are used. In other words, when producing the electric light in \\( n \\) points instead of one point, we are unable to fulfil practically the condition, that the sum of the resistances of the \\( n \\) arcs is equal to the resistance of one arc to have the same current, i.e., the former must be made smaller than the latter on account of practical construction-reasons.\n\nWe may therefore sum up as follows: The economical solution of the division of the electric light is theoretically quite possible, but practically difficult to obtain. The division can never become unlimited, but ingenious inventors may nevertheless solve the problem practically.\n\nAny attempt by inventors to solve the question is therefore perfectly legitimate. If their attempt cannot lead to a perfect solution, they may nevertheless do so approximately, and by it tend towards real progress in illumination, inasmuch as by their attempts the electric light may probably become more and more a successful general rival to gas, which at present it certainly is not.\n\nBefore I conclude, I must briefly advert to a paper on \"the Electric Light\" by Mr. W. H. Preece, published in the Philosophical Magazine for January 1879, in which the author believes that he has demonstrated from dynamical considerations that the division of the electric light is impossible. This it certainly is under the conditions introduced by Mr. Preece, viz., that the resistance of each voltaic arc, or each incandescent wire, is maintained constant. But it is unfair to the electric light to introduce this condition, especially as it does not at all represent the question at issue.\n\nWhen a number of lights are connected in series, the resistance of each must be diminished, and when a number of lights are joined parallel, the resistance of each must be increased, in proportion to their number, so as to maintain the total external resistance constant. If Mr. Preece will introduce this condition into his equations he will find that theoretically the division of the electric light is quite possible, i.e., that, theoretically, however the lights be arranged, the unit of light will always be produced by the same expenditure of energy. Inventors should not therefore be down-hearted. On the other hand, investors in gas need not hasten to get rid of their shares, for there are many questions involving\npractical difficulties which still remain to be solved; but, at the same time, gas companies should be aware that they have a formidable rival in the field, and bestir themselves to maintain the lead they hold by improving their own means of illumination and extending its application.\n\nPr\u00e9cis of the Report on the results obtained by the Electric Light Experiments instituted on behalf of the Board of Directors of the East Indian Railway Company.\u2014By Louis Schwendler, Superintendent Electrician of Government Telegraphs in India (on special duty in England), dated 1st November, 1878.\n\nResults obtained.\u2014The questions which I set myself to answer by direct experiment were:\n\nI.\u2014Quantity of Light per Unit of Power, Unit of Speed, and Unit of Money (First Outlay).\n\nTo solve this question I have tried four different Dynamo-electric Machines producing the electric current in one direction, viz.\u2014\n\nDynamo-electric Machines \\{ A Medium size,\n\\{ B Small,\n\nas supplied by Messrs. Siemens, Brothers, of London (construction:\u2014Siemens; system:\u2014Hefner von Alteneck).\n\nDynamo-electric Machine C, workshop pattern, as supplied by Messrs. Soutter & Lemonnier, of Paris (construction:\u2014Gramme).\n\nDynamo-electric Machine D, with two sets of brushes, as supplied by the British Telegraph Manufactory (construction:\u2014Gramme).\n\nCareful, severe, and long-extended trials, during the time of my experiments, have established that these four machines are all sufficiently practical for the production of the electric light, but that, as a rule, the statements of their actual efficiency were not found to be in conformity with the results obtained from my own experiments. The quantity of light produced by these dynamo-electric machines had been overrated, and the amount of power consumed underrated.\n\nThis discrepancy between my results and those of others is probably to be explained by the difficulties which stand in the way of executing trustworthy photometric measurements.\n\nBut, notwithstanding this, I find that the unit of light as produced in the electric arc (disintegration) by any of the four dynamo-electric machines is at least fifty times cheaper than the unit of light as produced by combustion, considering the expenditure of power only.\n\nThis represents an enormous engineering margin in favour of the electric light.\nIt is, however, necessary to state that this relation only holds good as long as one dynamo-electric machine produces one electric light.\n\nThe three dynamo-electric machines B, C, and D I found practically equal, i.e., they produce the same quantity of light by the same expenditure of power. Any difference which may be found is entirely within the limits of observation and other errors.\n\nBut the dynamo-electric machine A gives a much stronger light for a comparatively smaller expenditure of power.\n\nIn round numbers it may be said that dynamo-electric machine A gives about double the quantity of light given by any of the other three machines, and that only about half as much power is expended to produce the unit of light.\n\nThis favourable result is principally due to the comparatively small internal resistance of A, and its low speed.\n\nWith reference to mechanical construction and regular working, dynamo-electric machine C is highly efficient.\n\nMy experiments necessarily have suggested alterations and improvements of the dynamo-electric machines, with which, however, I shall not deal in this pr\u00e9cis of the Report.\n\nII.\u2014CONSTANCY AND REGULARITY OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT.\n\nThis appears to be still the weak point, and many improvements in this respect are possible and desirable.\n\nAlthough it is not in the nature of dynamo-electric machines to produce a perfectly steady current, like, for instance, galvanic batteries, the irregularity of the light resulting from this source can be entirely neglected against those produced by the lamp itself.\n\nI have tried two different lamps:\n\n(a) The Serrin Lamp, as supplied by Messrs. Soutter & Lemonnier, of Paris, and the British Telegraph Manufactory.\n\n(b) The Siemens Lamp, as supplied by Messrs. Siemens, Brothers.\n\nThe Serrin lamp, for any given adjustment, regulates the length of the arc only in one direction, i.e., it diminishes that length.\n\nThe actual consumption of the carbon points regulates the length of the arc in the other direction, i.e., increases it.\n\nIn the Siemens lamp the decrease of the length of the arc is effected exactly in the same manner as in the Serrin lamp, but the increase in the length of the arc is not only left to the consumption of the carbon points\u2014a comparatively slow process\u2014but is accelerated by the addition of a make and break arrangement, which separates the carbon points.\n\nHence, from a theoretical point of view, the Siemens lamp is undoubtedly superior, since the length of the arc is rapidly adjusted in both\ndirections, and consequently the working currents can increase to a very considerable degree without spoiling the dynamo-electric machine.\n\nBut practically I find the Siemens Lamp somewhat difficult to manage, and although, when once well adjusted, it burns as regularly as the Serrin Lamp, it is far more difficult to arrive at this adjustment.\n\nFor practical use I prefer, therefore, the Serrin Lamp, with those alterations and constructional improvements which my own experiments have suggested. I shall not refer to these improvements here.\n\nA second cause of the irregularity of the electric light is the still imperfect state of the carbon points.\n\nThey sometimes split, break off, burst, and crumble. Under these circumstances, not even the most perfect lamp will produce a steady light.\n\nOf late some great improvements have been made in the manufacture of artificial carbons, but much more is required; and this point deserves the closest attention. In my final Report I shall treat this subject in detail. With the improvements which I have been able to introduce in reference to lamps, position, form, and nature of the carbons, the electric light (emanating in a line passing through the centre of the arc, and being normal to the axis of the arc) is still exceedingly variable (ranging in intensity during short intervals of time between 1 and 3).\n\nIt is true that these variations in the light are flashes lasting for a moment only; but they are nevertheless there, the eye perceives them, and they are disagreeable.\n\nTo make the electric light more steady should be considered one of the most important questions to be solved.\n\nIII.\u2014How to put up the Light\u2014Position and Mechanical Details.\n\nTo solve this question is of the greatest practical importance.\n\nTwo essentially different methods are available:\n\nDivision of the Electric Light, i.e., to produce by the same electro-motor a number of lights at different points of a given space.\n\nThis method, besides being scarcely solved, appears to be impracticable from an engineering point of view.\n\nSuch divisions of the electric light can only be effected by a large sacrifice of total and external light, and moreover this loss increases rapidly with the number of lights burned in the same circuit.\n\nIt appears that the electric light can alone compete with light produced by combustion, when produced of great intensity in one point by one dynamo-electric machine.\nEndeavours to cut up the electric light into a large number of small lights, although of great interest, must, I think, invariably result in engineering failure, as nobody could afford to pay for the luxury received.\n\nI have succeeded in working three Serrin Lamps connected up successively in the same circuit of a dynamo-electric machine, but found the loss of light very great.\n\nHaving satisfied myself of the difficulty and impracticability of the division of the electric light, I tried:\n\nDiffusion, i.e., a few large lights (each light produced by one machine), are placed at different points of the space, and by optical means the light is diffused over a large area.\n\nThis method I find perfectly practicable.\n\nThere is naturally also a large amount of light lost (by absorption), but this loss will bear a constant ratio to the total light produced, nay probably may decrease with the intensity.\n\nThe actual plan by which I propose to do it, and have done it during the trial, is to construct a Silvered-glass reflector in which a powerful electric light burns, throwing direct and reflected rays up to a white ceiling or any other convenient white surface. A number of such arrangements is to be put up in the most convenient places, and where they have the greatest effect.\n\nThe form and size of each reflector will depend on the locality where it is to be used.\n\nIn future constructions of railway stations the lighting up by the electric light should be taken into account.\n\nIV.\u2014WHAT REPAIRS ARE REQUIRED IN COURSE OF TIME, AND ARE THEY OF SUCH A NATURE THAT AN ORDINARY MECHANIC CAN EXECUTE THEM?\n\nAny repairs which during this extended trial had to be made were entirely limited to the commutator, and the brushes of the dynamo-electric machines. These repairs were exceedingly simple, and any native mechanic would be able to execute them.\n\nI consider the Commutator or Dynamo-Electric Machines A and B the best.\n\nPractice will however answer this question much more effectively than any experimental trial can do.\n\nThe commutators are to be often cleaned, and the brushes are to be well set.\n\nAlthough the electric lamps look rather formidable, they are nevertheless very simple apparatus, not easily getting out of order if well adjusted.\nV.\u2014Routine; Difficulty of Manipulation and Superintendence.\n\nOnly one man is actually required in each station, to take charge of the steam engine, dynamo-electric machine, lamps and reflectors.\n\nThis man should be of a rather high intelligence to be able to understand the working of the system, the adjustment of the dynamo-electric machines and lamps.\n\nHe should be a skilled mechanic in order to be able to execute the necessary repairs.\n\nA simple Test-Galvanoscope is to be used to gauge from time to time the efficiency of the dynamo-electric machine in producing a current through an external resistance equal to one unit.\n\nAPPENDIX I.\n\nGeneral Specification of a Dynamo-Electric Machine Required for Use in India (East Indian Railway).\n\nThe dynamo-electric machine to be of the same size and pattern as the one manufactured by Messrs. Siemens, Brothers, of London, under the name, \"Medium sized,\" and which in my report has been called A.\n\nThe following alterations of the present construction are to be made:\n\n1. The induction-cylinder to be wound with twelve separate sections of wire, instead of with six, as at present.\n\n2. The commutator, therefore, to consist of twenty-four copper plates, instead of twelve, as at present.\n\n3. The diameter of the commutator to be increased in the proportion of 3 to 4 at least. In all other respects to be, however, of exactly the same construction as the present one, which from a construction point of view is perfect.\n\n4. Number of brushes, four, as at present, with the difference that they should consist of several layers of finer wire instead of one layer of thick wire as is the case at present. 12 sets of brushes are to be issued with the machine in question.\n\n5. The present adjustment of these brushes (with reference to pressure on the commutator, and relative position to the poles of the electro-magnet) wants some improvements.\n\nIt is required for a safe and regular working of a dynamo-electric machine that the adjustment of the pressure of the brushes against the commutator should not only be more handy, but also finer, and that the adjustment for finding approximately the neutral line of the commutator should be made more convenient and finer. The proper practical fulfilment of these two conditions is of paramount importance, and if the present\nconstruction should not allow of such improvements, it is worth while to alter that construction somewhat. Further, the insulating material between the brush-holders and moveable collar should be made much thicker.\n\n6. The driving pulley of the dynamo-electric machine should keep its present diameter, but should be made broader in order to be able to use a wider strap for driving. A loose pulley should run on the axis of the induction cylinder.\n\n7. An iron plate must form the separate base of the dynamo-electric machine, and when putting up the dynamo-electric machine this iron plate is fixed either to a beam or to masonry. Along this iron plate the actual bottom plate of the dynamo-electric machine is to slide in grooves, so that it may be fixed in any one position by four strong screws with nuts.\n\n8. The magnetic field in which the induction cylinder moves, should be a uniform one.\n\nIn the present construction this is not the case. The magnetism at the ends is much stronger than in the middle, but it is probable that making the poles of a solid piece of iron would alter this.\n\nThis should be tried, and if it answers should be introduced in the present specified dynamo-electric machine.\n\n9. The terminal screws of the dynamo-electric machine should not be hand screws as at present, but strong hexagonal-headed screws with lock-nuts, and the outside wires connecting electro-magnets with brushes and induction cylinder should be insulated like the rest of the wire used in the electro-magnets.\n\n10. When the above dynamo-electric machine is delivered, the following statements must be given:\n\n- Total weight, including everything.\n- Weight of iron used in the electro-magnet.\n- Weight of iron used in the induction cylinder (not including the axis).\n- Weight of copper used in the electro-magnet, and\n- Diameter of wire in millimetres.\n- Weight of copper used in the induction cylinder, and\n- Diameter of wire.\n- Total internal resistance of the dynamo-electric machine, as found by direct measurement through the brushes.\n- Resistance of the separate coils of the electro-magnet.\n- Total resistance of the induction cylinder, as found by direct measurement.\n- Resistance of each separate section.\nAll resistances to be expressed in S.U. and the temperature to be stated at which the measured resistances are right.\n\nAs these resistances are all very small, they should be given to 3rd decimal; hence a special bridge for testing must be used.\n\n11. The speed of driving is to be between 700 and 750 revolutions per minute, and at this speed through a known external resistance, the current produced should not be less than that given by the following formula:\n\n\\[ C = 0.3 \\sqrt{\\frac{W^i - w^i}{m + r}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the current in Webers.\n\n\\( W^i \\) the power required per second to produce that current.\n\n\\( w^i \\) the power per second to drive the dynamo-electric machine empty (external resistance infinite, i.e., circuit open).\n\nBoth \\( W^i \\) and \\( w^i \\) are expressed in Meg Ergs* per second.\n\n1 Meg Erg = 1,000,000 Ergs.\n\n\\( m \\) is the internal resistance of the dynamo-electric machine, i.e., resistance of electro-magnet plus resistance of induction cylinder plus contact resistance in the commutator as found by direct measurement when all brushes are on.\n\n\\( r \\) is the external resistance; both \\( m \\) and \\( r \\) expressed in S.U.\n\nWhen gauging the dynamo-electric machine by the above formula it is best to make \\( r = 1 \\) S.U. about.\n\nIf the dynamo-electric machine produces less current (say more than 10 per cent. less) then there is something wrong either in the machine or with the measurements. If it is in the machine it may be due to the following causes:\n\nBrushes make bad contact and do not approach sufficiently near to the neutral line; try therefore a better adjustment; or there is a shunt in the machine which can best be found by driving the machine empty; or the iron is bad, &c., &c., &c.\n\nThe actual measurements are to be forwarded with the dynamo-electric machine.\n\nNote.\u2014The above formula has been calculated from the experimental fact that at the production of currents above 20 Webers, the loss of power in making current is about 12 per cent. If all the force used for producing current were represented in the external circuit by that current flowing through a known resistance, then the formula would be:\n\n\\*\u20147460.6 Meg Ergs per second equal one Watt's H.P. per second, i.e., 550 foot-pounds per second in London.\n\\[ C = 0.33 \\sqrt{\\frac{W^2 - w^2}{m + r}} \\]\n\ntherefore the observed current never can be higher than this value, and this fact gives a criterion for trustworthy observation.\n\n**General Specifications of an Electric Lamp Required for Use in India (East Indian Railway).**\n\nThe lamp to be constructed on the Serrin principle, with the following alterations:\n\n1. All parts of the lamp, including clockwork, &c., &c., to be made of gun-metal. No steel or iron is to be used except in the electro-magnet and its armature.\n\n   Even the axles of the wheels and the fly-escapement must be made of gun-metal.\n\n2. The carbons to be used in this lamp may be of any shape\u2014round, triangular, or square. The carbon-holders should be sufficiently large to hold a round carbon of 18 mm. diameter; and should be constructed in such a manner that they can hold carbons of a much smaller diameter, and also that by the expansion due to heating, the carbons should not become loose in their clamps.\n\n   The construction of the carbon-holders in the Siemens lamp appears to be good, and should be adopted in this lamp.\n\n   With 18 mm. carbons the lamp should burn 8 hours.\n\n3. The screw for regulating the tension of the spring or springs which act in opposition to the magnetism of the electro-magnet should move 1 mm. by one whole turn.\n\n   In order to know the adjustment at any one time, and to be able to make the same adjustment again, a millimeter scale is to be attached, by which the movements of the screw can be read. The circumference of the head of the screw is to be divided into ten equal parts. Hence by this arrangement the comparative tensions of the spring or springs can be read up to 0.1 mm.\n\n   This micrometer screw, after the lamp has been regulated for any given current varying within two known limits, is to be fixed by a clamp and screw to keep that adjustment constant.\n\n4. The distance between the electro-magnet and its armature is also to be made adjustable by a micrometer screw, provided again with millimeter scale like the above, and with a clamp and screw, for making any best adjustment constant.\n5. The clockwork and all regulating parts of the lamp to be entirely covered by a strong metal case, which is to be constructed in such a manner that it can be taken off or put on without interfering in any way with the adjustment of the lamp. The best, I think, would be to make that case cylindrical, opening like a door in two halves on hinges, and with a key for closing it. There is no limit to the actual size of the case, since the lamp is intended for lighting up by the method of \"diffusion\" with an opaque reflector, which is placed and begins above the cover.\n\nNone of the adjustable parts of the lamp are to protrude, as it is intended not to touch the lamp after its proper adjustment, which is done in the laboratory only.\n\nIt is quite a mistake to give people easy regulating means. That will never answer in practice. People, as a rule, will turn anything in the opposite direction they ought to do; then they get excited, and the failure is attributed to the lamp instead of to the people.\n\nEach lamp has only one best adjustment for any given current varying between two known limits, and the best adjustment is made constant by fixing everything. The case or cover is then closed, and the lamp put up for use.\n\n6. The electro-magnet which pulls the arc should offer no more resistance than $0.02$ S.U. It is to be shunted by another Electro-Magnet which offers exactly the same resistance ($0.02$ S.U.)\n\nHence, one half of the current passes through the electro-magnet of the lamp, and is made use of for pulling the arc. The amount of iron used in the electro-magnet, and the number of convolutions should be such, that at the mean distance of the electro-magnet from its armature, the magnetic force is strong enough to produce an arc of $2.5$ mm. against the mean tension of the spring or springs when employing a current of about 25 Webers.\n\nThe magnetic action of the shunt for the same current should be about double that of the electro-magnet of the lamp, in order to leave a margin for a finer adjustment, i.e., equalization of the magnetic action of the two.\n\nIn the foregoing it has been supposed that the shunt does not act on the armature. But it can be easily conceived that the free magnetism of that shunt may be made to assist the electro-magnet for regulating the arc.\n\nI consider it, however, better not to do this, especially when the currents produced are sufficiently strong, above 30 Webers, which will be the case when using a dynamo-electric machine, as described in the first part of this Appendix.\nThe two electro-magnets, each forming a shunt to the other, are adjusted in such a manner, that the extra currents they produce, when the primary current varies, are equal, and therefore, as they are invariably opposite to each other, they neutralize one another entirely, which will have the desired effect of a quicker regulation of the lamp for any variation of current.\n\nThe iron used in the shunt should have double the weight of the iron in the electro-magnet.\n\nThe section of the wire for filling the shunt should be double the section of the wire filling the electro-magnet.\n\nCoil on so many convolutions on to the shunt until its resistance becomes equal to the resistance of the electro-magnet.\n\nFor adjusting the equality of the extra currents the following method should be adopted:\n\nForm a Wheatstone bridge two sides of which are formed by a mercury-rheostat, each side offering about 0\u00b702 S.U. resistance. The third side of the bridge is formed by the electro-magnet of the lamp, the fourth side by the shunt. In one diagonal place a dynamo-electric machine and about one unit resistance, together with a convenient make-and-break contact, best done by a mercury cup. In the other diagonal, place a Bell-telephone of lowest possible resistance. One end of this diagonal can be moved along the mercury-rheostat. Start the dynamo-electric machine, listen to the telephone and alter the ratio of the mercury-branches of the bridge, by shifting along the contact until the telephone is perfectly silent.\n\nThen if, at commencing and stopping the current a strong click is heard, we know it is due to the two extra currents not being equal, and as we further know that the shunt produces the greatest extra current, we make this extra current smaller, by shifting along the two poles of the shunt, an iron wedge until the telephone is quiet, when starting and stopping the current. The iron wedge is then fixed in its position.\n\nThis shunt is also to be inside the metal cover of the lamp.\n\n7. The two terminals of the lamp are to be of exactly the same pattern and size as those used in the dynamo-electric machine described in the commencement of this Appendix.\n\nThey must not be terminals with hand screws.\n\nAPPENDIX III.\n\nON SOME OF THE SCIENTIFIC RESULTS OBTAINED BY EXPERIMENT.\n\nSYSTEM OF UNITS ADOPTED:\u2014In my investigations I have adopted the Centimetre-Gramme-Second system of units.\n(Illustration of the Centimetre-Gramme-Second (C.G.S.) system of units, by J. D. Everett.)\n\nIn Appendix I.* attached to the Report, all the required data are given for easy reference.\n\nMeans of Measurement:\n\nThe Tangent Galvanometer which is described in Appendix (II) of the Report.\n\nBy means of this instrument, constructed in special manner to suit the particular purpose, all the currents between 1\u00b76 to 38 webers could be measured very accurately.\n\nThe currents, in absolute measure, may be taken as correct within 3 per cent. at least. The Astronomer Royal most kindly gave me the value of the horizontal component of the earth's magnetism at Greenwich.\n\nThe Photometer described in Appendix III. The comparison of two lights by means of this instrument rests on the following principle:\n\nTwo surfaces, equal in size and nature, are placed side by side, quite close together, and in the same plane.\n\nOne surface is illuminated by one light, the other surface by the other light.\n\nThis is best done by using two equal flint-glass prisms.\n\nThe surfaces towards the eye are covered with tracing paper, the top half of each paper being divided by fine pencil lines into small squares.\n\nThe equalization of the intensities of the two lights under comparison is done by keeping the distance between the two lights constant, and moving the two illuminated surfaces within that constant distance.\n\nThis Photometer is particularly well adapted for comparing the intensities of two differently coloured lights.\n\nAn experienced eye can easily distinguish the relative distinction between the pencil line and the back ground of each surface, and if this relative distinction is the same in both surfaces, the two surfaces have equal intensity, no matter what the colour of each light may be. However, as a rule, the comparison of any two lights was made by observing the two surfaces through a red glass. This glass, after trying a great variety of glasses, was found to have the convenient quality of making the colours of the electric light and of the standard light equal.\n\nIt was ascertained that this red glass absorbs all the violet, blue, and green rays, letting through only some yellow, more orange and all the red.\n\n* All the Appendices referred to in the following belong to the actual Report, of which the present paper is a Pr\u00e9cis only.\nHence if the two lights under comparison contain the different coloured rays in different proportions, it may be said that by adjusting balance by means of the red glass, the ratio must become erroneous.\n\nHowever, actual experiments proved that this is practically not the case. If there is a difference it is quite within the limits of errors caused by the considerable variation in the intensity of electric lights.\n\nTwo electric lights compared with each other by means of the red glass and without it, gave practically the same ratio.\n\nFurther, the same electric lights compared each with a standard light (either a standard-candle or a platinum-light standard, to be described further on), and by adjusting balance through the red glass gave a ratio sufficiently close to the one found by direct comparison of the two electric lights. I can therefore recommend this photometer for practical use.\n\nThe Dynamometer, described in Appendix (IV). When transmitting force by means of a strap from a driving pulley to a driven pulley, it will be noticed that that side of the strap which runs towards the driving pulley has always a greater tension than the other side of the strap which runs from the driving pulley.\n\nThis difference of tension in the two sides of the same strap is proportional to the force transmitted, a well and long recognised fact. The difference of tension is measured either by a graduated spring or weight, and hence the force can be calculated if the constant of the dynamometer is known.\n\nFrom this and the speed the power consumed per second can be calculated. Dr. C. W. Siemens called my attention to this very simple, convenient, and accurate method of measuring force transmitted and power consumed. It is a method not to be found in any text-book, and was first suggested and employed by Mr. Hefner von Alteneck, of Berlin.\n\nA drawing to scale of the dynamometer, as actually made, is attached to Appendix IV.\n\nThe measurement of speed. See Appendix V. In this investigation, where almost all results depend on the speed of the induction cylinder, it becomes a matter of importance to select the proper apparatus for measuring that speed accurately.\n\nI have employed three essentially different instruments:\n\nThe Pocket-Counter\u2014an instrument well known and extensively used.\n\nThe Mercury Speed Indicator by J. M. Napier. The speed is measured by a column of mercury, which increases its length when the speed increases. It is a most convenient instrument.\n\nThe Cycloscope, this is another very ingenious instrument for mea-\nsuring the speed continuously, and is an invention of Lieut. G. S. Clarke, R. E., and Professor McLeod.\n\nThe principle of the cycloscope consists in employing a tuning fork or reed as the standard by which to measure velocities of rotation. The instrument is described in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, 1877, Vol. XXVI.\n\nResistance measurements. See Appendix VI.\n\nAn ordinary Wheatstone bridge with S.U. has been employed.\n\nBy careful comparison I find,\n\n\\[ 1 \\text{ B.A.U.} = 1.0509 \\text{ S.U.} \\]\n\nThe resistance measurements are all correct within 0.01 S.U.\n\nStandards of Light employed. See Appendix VII.\n\nThe Standard Candle.\n\nThe Metropolitan Gas Act of 1860 defines the Standard Candle as follows:\n\n\"Sperm candles of six to the pound, each burning 120 grains an hour.\"\n\nTo keep the flame of a candle at exactly the same position in the photometer, a condition required for accurate photometric measurements, I place the candle in a closely fitting tube against the top rim of which a spring presses the burning candle.\n\nThe Platinum Light Standard (P.L.S.)\n\nThe unit of light is defined, as the light emitted from a piece of pure platinum weighing \\( x \\) grammes and having the most convenient shape and size, when a constant current of \\( y \\) webers passes through it.\n\nThe current can be easily kept constant by a convenient battery, and by inserting in the circuit a galvanoscope and adjustable mercury-rheostat. The deflecting wire of the galvanoscope should consist of one thick copper wire only. On the galvanoscope the point is marked off which corresponds to a current of \\( y \\) webers.\n\nThis Standard produces a light of perfect constancy, so long as the current is kept constant, and further allows a correction to be made if the variation of the current is known.\n\nIt is further a standard which can be reproduced very accurately anywhere, and its magnitude may be altered to any extent to suit certain practical purposes, by simply varying the elements of the weight, shape and size of the platinum, or the strength of the current passing through it.\n\nIt does not alter in itself. Hence the Platinum Light Standard fulfils all the conditions of a good standard, and I therefore propose it should be used in future as the standard of light in England, in lieu of the standard candle.\nRESULTS.\n\nEconomy of Electric Light.\n\nThe energy of the standard candle was ascertained by direct experiment. See Appendix VIII.\n\nIt was found that the standard candle, in order to produce the unit of light, does work at the rate of 610 meg-ergs per second, at the least.\n\nIn fact it is highly probable that the standard candle, in order to produce the unit of light, works up to more than double that amount (1365 meg-ergs per second).\n\nFurther, by direct experiment, it was ascertained that the unit of light, as produced in an electric arc, by any one of the dynamo-electric machines under trial, and through a leading wire offering not more than 0\u00b71 S.U. resistance, is produced at the rate of not more than 20 meg-ergs per second, including all the work transmitted, and the light measured in a line which passes through the centre of the arc, and stands normal to its axis. Hence the probable engineering margin in favour of the electric light is between 30 to 70, or equal to a mean of 50.\n\nDynamo-electric machine A produces the unit of light at a rate of not more than 10 meg-ergs per second.\n\nHence it may be safely asserted that the electric light produced by dynamo-electric machines is as an average 50 times cheaper than light by combustion.\n\nThis is, however, true only as long as the light is produced in one arc.\n\nIf more than one light is produced in the same circuit by the same current the external or available light becomes rapidly dearer with increase of the number of lights produced.\n\nFor this reason already, if not for many others, the division of light must result in an engineering failure.\n\nIt is in the nature of the electric light that it should be used in great intensity in one point, instead of small intensities in many points.\n\nFor the experimental details and complete information on this interesting point. See Appendix IX.\n\nCurrent produced by Dynamo-Electric Machines. See Appendix XI.\n\nThese currents, as the insertion of a bell-telephone (used as a shunt) will easily prove, are not steady.\n\nThe dynamo-electric machine with the greatest number of sections in the induction cylinder gives the steadiest current. Twelve sections I find necessary and sufficient.\n\nInfluence of Speed. See Appendix X.\n\nThe current produced by any dynamo-electric machine through a given constant total resistance in circuit increases permanently with the speed of the induction cylinder.\nThis increase of current for low speeds is more than proportional to the speed; afterwards it becomes proportional; and for high speeds the increase of current is less than proportional to the speed.\n\nThe current has, however, no maximum for any speed, but reaches its greatest value at an infinite speed.\n\nThis same law, as the total resistance in circuit is supposed to be constant, of course holds good also for the electro-motive of the dynamo-electric machine.\n\nInfluence of External resistance. See Appendix XII.\n\nKeeping the speed constant, the electro-motive force of any dynamo-electric machine decreases rapidly with increase of external resistance.\n\nThis decrease is more rapid, the smaller the internal resistance of the dynamo-electric machine is made.\n\nHence the currents must decrease much more rapidly than proportional to the total resistance in circuit.\n\nAs in the case of speed, the electro-motive force has no maximum for a certain external resistance, but approaches permanently its greatest value for an external resistance equal 'Nil.'\n\nIt appears that the function which connects E. M. F. and speed, is the same as that which connects E. M. F. and external resistance.\n\nWe have only to substitute for speed the inverse of resistance and vice versa.\n\nMaximum work by a current in the resistance R.\n\nAs the current decreases much more rapidly than the total resistance in circuit increases, this resistance R should invariably be made smaller than the remaining resistance of the circuit, i.e., smaller than the internal resistance of dynamo-electric machines plus resistance of leading wires.\n\nSee Appendix XI and the special proof attached.\n\nThe Electro-motive force of a Dynamo-Electric Machine as a function of the resistance and speed.\n\nIt appears that the following two formulae are most probably correct for all Dynamo-Electric Machines, if the loss of current by transmission is taken into account:\n\n\\[ E = \\kappa \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-(m + r)^2}} \\right\\} \\]\n\nE the E. M. F.\n\nm the internal resistance, and r the external resistance, including resistance of leading wire.\n\u03ba and \u03b1 are independent of m and r, and are functions of the speed of the induction cylinder, and contain also the construction coefficients. e is the basis of the natural logarithm.\n\nFurther:\n\n\\[ E' = \\kappa' \\left\\{ 1 - \\frac{(\\frac{v}{a'})^s}{e} \\right\\} \\]\n\nE' the E. M. F., and v the speed of the induction cylinder.\n\n\u03ba' and \u03b1' are independent of v, and are functions of m and r only.\n\nThese two functions, E and E', correspond to all the characteristics of the curves found by experiment, and they also fulfil the limit conditions.\n\nIn Appendices IX and X, the question has been gone into fully.\n\nResistance and Electro-motive force of the Electric arc.\n\nThere appears to be no doubt that an appreciable E. M. F. in the arc is established which acts in opposite direction to the electro-motive force of the dynamo-electric machine.\n\nThis E. M. F. of the arc increases with the current, passing through the arc.\n\nThe resistance of the arc for constant length is also a function of the current passing through it, i.e., the resistance of the arc decreases with the current, see the following table:\n\n| Current in Webers | Resistance of the Arc in S.U. | E.M.F. of the Arc in Volts |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 28\u00b781             | 0\u00b791                          | 2\u00b702                     |\n| 23\u00b787             | 1\u00b772                          | 1\u00b791                     |\n| 16\u00b727             | 1\u00b797                          | 1\u00b786                     |\n\nSee Appendix XI. The E.M.F. in an electric arc, opposite to the electromotive force of the dynamo-electric machine, constitutes another reason against the unlimited divisibility of the electric light.\n\nRegularity of the production of Currents by Dynamo-Electric Machines at different periods.\u2014If the brushes are well set, and if they are placed as nearly as possible in the neutral line of the commutator, the production of current is perfectly regular, and measurements taken through the same external resistance at the most distant periods agree most perfectly with each other, supposing the correction for variation in speed and internal resistance are applied.\n\nDisregarding the heating of the dynamo-electric machine by the current, the time required to arrive at dynamic equilibrium, i.e., when\nforce transmitted, current and magnetism received are constant, is very short indeed, especially for the strong currents, which alone are made use of for lighting.\n\nFormula for controlling the Test-results.\u2014As the power which is represented by the measured current working through a given resistance can never exceed the original power transmitted to the machine, we can, from current, resistance, and force measurements, frame a formula which checks the probability of the results.\n\nThis formula is:\n\n\\[ C \\leq 0.33 \\sqrt{\\frac{W' - w'}{r + m}} \\]\n\n\\( W' \\) is the total power consumed by any dynamo-electric machine when producing the observed current \\( C \\) in a circuit of resistance \\( r + m \\).\n\n\\( w' \\) is the power consumed by the dynamo-electric machine when producing no current (i.e., driven empty; circuit open; external resistance infinite).\n\n\\( r \\) is the external resistance, and \\( m \\) the internal resistance.\n\nIn the above formula \\( C \\) is in webers, \\( W' \\) and \\( w' \\) in meg-ergs per second, and \\( r \\) and \\( m \\) in S.U.\n\nOf late, exaggerated statements of the performance of dynamo-electric machines have been made, the absurdity of which would have become evident at once if the above formula had been applied as a check to the results.\n\nCo-efficient of transmission.\u2014If all the work \\( (W' - w') \\) were transformed into available current in the external circuit then:\n\n\\[ \\frac{W' - w'}{W} = \\text{unity}, \\] where \\( W \\) is the total work performed by the observed current in the circuit of known resistance.\n\nIn practice it will be found however that \\( \\frac{W' - w'}{W} > 1 \\) (for many reasons).\n\nThis expression, \\( \\frac{W' - w'}{W} \\), I have called:\n\nThe co-efficient of Transmission and designated it by the letter \\( \\kappa \\).\n\n\\( \\kappa \\) is different for the different dynamo-electric machines, which have been tried, and decreases with increase of current.\n\nProducing currents above 24 webers, the following average values of \\( \\kappa \\) have been obtained:\u2014\n| Name of Dynamo-Electric Machines | \\( \\kappa \\) | Average Current in webers |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| C                                | 1\u00b701      | 31\u00b70                     |\n| A and B                          | 1\u00b712      | 31\u00b70                     |\n| D                                | 1\u00b728      | 27\u00b79                     |\n\n**Co-efficient of Efficiency.**\n\n\\[ \\epsilon = \\frac{w}{W' - w} ; \\text{ where } w \\text{ is the useful work done in the circuit by the current.} \\]\n\nAs the resistance of dynamo-electric machines and leading wires cannot be made \"nil,\" this co-efficient must be always smaller than unity.\n\nFor currents above 24 webers we have:\n\n| Name of Dynamo-Electric Machine | \\( \\epsilon \\) | Average Current |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| A                               | 0\u00b762        | 29\u00b75           |\n| B                               | 0\u00b753        | 31\u00b70           |\n| C                               | 0\u00b747        | 32\u00b76           |\n| D                               | 0\u00b730        | 27\u00b79           |\n\nHence the dynamo-electric machine A converts 62% of the total energy transmitted into useful work, while 38% is lost in heating the machine.\n\nDynamo-electric machine D converts 30% of the total energy transmitted into useful work, and loses 70% in heating its own wires.\n\n**Practical Mechanical Equivalent of the currents produced by Dynamo-Electric Machines.**\n\n\\[ \\eta = \\frac{W' - w}{C} \\text{ where } C \\text{ is the current in webers.} \\]\n\nAbove 24 webers, the different dynamo-electric machines produce the weber at the following consumption of power:\n\nDynamo-electric machines A and B produce one weber at 686\u00b75 meg-ergs per second.\n\nDynamo-electric machine C produces one weber at 736 meg-ergs per second.\nDynamo-Electric Machine D produces one weber at 920 meg-ergs per second.\n\nN. B.\u2014Through certain external resistances which are sufficiently small to get currents above 24 webers.\n\nRegularity of the Electric Light\u2014\n\nIf the resistance external to the dynamo-electric machine is represented by the resistance of the arc only, i.e., resistance of leading wires equal \"Nil,\" then although the light is naturally the most powerful, it is the least steady, since any variation of the resistance of the arc has then evidently the largest influence on the current and on the light.\n\nBy connecting across the electro-magnet of an electric lamp, another electro-magnet which acts as a shunt, and adjusting the two electro-magnets in such a manner that they produce equal extra currents when variations in the primary current take place, the regularity of the working of the lamp is greatly enhanced.\n\n(See Specification of Lamp, Appendix I, of Pr\u00e9cis of Report.)\n\nAn electro-static shunt will have a similar effect. For strong lights or strong currents, the electro-magnetic shunt is best; for weak lights or weak currents the electro-static shunt is best.\n\nThe lamp should be constructed mechanically so well and delicately that the carbon points run together with a minimum tension of the spring of the lamp. Then the lamp will be a balance with small weights.\n\nWhen making photometric measurements, to get more trustworthy results, it is best to use a flat carbon (2 to 3 mm thick) as the positive electrode, and a carbon of the usual form as the negative electrode.\n\nThe light is to be observed in a line normal to the flat surface of upper carbon, and passing through the centre of the arc. In this manner the largest quantity of total light produced is measured, and, moreover, the ratio between total and external light is more constant.\n\nThe lower carbon should be invariably of less section than the upper carbon.\n\nFurther, when producing the light by a short arc, which it is always advisable to do, the lower carbon should be natural carbon. Coppering the carbon is advisable under all circumstances. Artificial as well as natural carbons appear to be very little hygroscopic, a great fortune for damp climates like India during the monsoons.\n\nWhen the arc is long, the flame by combustion of the carbons is large.\n\nThis appears to be due to the fact that for a long arc the vacuum formed round the carbon points by expansion of the air by heat is less complete than in an arc of shorter length.\nThe consumption of the carbon points is due more to combustion than to disintegration.\n\nThe incandescent part of the carbon points has so much more intensity of light than the flame that the latter causes a shadow.\n\nThe hissing noise produced by the electric arc is, I believe, due to the formation of a vacuum round the incandescent carbon points.\n\nThe noise is much stronger in a short than in a long arc. It may also be due in part to the disintegration of the carbon points. The noise of the electric light in a quiet room is simply unbearable. This speaks only against the use of the electric light for domestic purposes.\n\nThere can be no doubt that one length of arc is best under given circumstances, considering both the intensity and regularity of the light.\n\nThe light permanently decreases with length of arc, hence the arc should be made as short as possible. This would, however, be bad for the constancy of the light, and may also spoil the dynamo-electric machine. Hence adjust the commutator by turning the brushes in the direction of the rotation until only small sparks are observed.\n\nIf this is impossible make the arc longer by lessening the tension of the spring.\n\nIn this manner the best length of arc can be experimentally found.\n\nThis would give the best tension of the spring at the starting point. Now let the dynamo-electric machine run for several hours, and make the same experiments, when the best tension of the spring will be found somewhat less. Take the mean of the two tensions and fix the micrometer screw.\n\n**Proportionality of light and current\u2014**\n\nAlthough the light produced in the arc must be very nearly proportional to the total energy consumed in the arc (minus the energy expended in giving the disintegrated carbon particles velocity), the resistance of the arc decreasing with increase of current, it follows that the light cannot be proportional to the square of the current.\n\nIf we make the highly probable supposition that the resistance of an arc of constant length is inversely proportional to the current which passes through, then the light produced would be proportional to the current.\n\nThis appears to be the case.\n\nThe conduction of the arc appears to be due to two causes, rarefied air and carbon particles flying in both directions.\n\nBoth causes would point towards an inverse proportionality between current and resistance of arc.\n\nThere are many other novel points of great interest to be discussed, and many more practical and scientific results, I have no doubt could be\nelucidated from my experiments, but unfortunately, I must conclude here, since I have to start for India in a few days.\n\nThe completion of the results shall, however, be given in my final report which is in preparation.\n\n3.\u2014On new species of the Genus Plectopylis of the family Helicid\u00e6.\u2014By Lieut.-Col.

S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper consists of extracts freely translated from the Bhoja Prabandha, a work which contains various anecdotes concerning the court of King Bhoja, related by one Vall\u00e1la. The work has been edited by Pandit Jib\u00e1nanda Vidyasagara of Calcutta. Only three of the most interesting anecdotes are given in the paper. The first narrates how K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa introduced himself to the king\u2019s notice by an ingenious explanation of an apparently unreasonable act of liberality on the part of the king. The king once presented a certain poet Sankara with 12 lakhs of Rupees, which roused the jealousy of the other courtiers; but K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa pacified them by the\nremark that of the twelve lakhs only one was given to the poets, but the eleven others to the 11 Rudras, who are the visible forms of the god Sankara or Siva. On another occasion when some pandits who were skilled in the Vedas, but no adepts in verse-making, were at their wit's end to complete a couplet, with which they wished to ingratiate themselves with the king, K\u0101lid\u0101sa supplied the rest. The third anecdote illustrates the great ascendancy which the poet K\u0101lid\u0101sa had gained over the king's mind; so that the king did not dare to remove him from his court, although he was greatly dissatisfied with his dissolute mode of life, wherein he was supported by his queen, and although his courtiers contrived by an intrigue to get K\u0101lid\u0101sa turned away, the king remained inconsolable, until he had succeeded in re-discovering and bringing back K\u0101lid\u0101sa, who henceforth stood higher than before in the king's favour.\n\n7.\u2014On the Norwegian Taters, their language and its relation to Hindi.\n\u2014By Dr. Sundberg.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe Taters are the gipsies of Norway. An account of them has been published by Mr. Eilert Sundt in his work \"Beretning om Fante-eller Landstrygerfolket i Norge.\" The notices of them in the present paper are principally taken from it. The name \"Tater\" has been identified with Tatar \u0924\u093e\u0924\u093e\u0930. Dr Sundberg suggests a new derivation, from tha-thi\u00e1r (a brazier; Hindi thather); because one of their occupations is working in brass and other metals. Though outwardly professing the religion of Norway, they really have their own religion; they worship the moon, and call their god Dundra, which Dr. Sundberg identifies with Devendra \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 or the god Indra. It used to be a practice among them to tie a stone round their neck and drown themselves when they thought they had lived long enough. They state their original home to have been the city of Assos in Assaria which has been identified with Assam; and its aboriginal tribe of the Doms is said to have given to their language its name Romani. Dr. Sundberg adverts to a story of the Persian poet Firdusi, that the king Behramgur of Persia requested king Kanodsche (Kanouj) of India to send him some musicians; and that the latter sent 12,000 musicians and dancing girls. These are said to have spread all over Europe and are the gipsies, Tater etc.; and Dr. Sundberg points out that in the Punjab the musicians, who accompany nautch-girls, are called Dom. There is a small vocabulary of about 800 words added to Mr. Sundt's book, from which Dr. Sundberg gives a few examples of words of apparently Hindi origin; e.g., jana to know, jido living, ka to eat, kalo black, lon salt, meros mine, pani water, pansh five, per belly, pi drink, baro great, bersh rain, besha to sit, brasha to rain, de to give, deros thy, dikka to see, dives day, dui two, ratti night, etc. There are also a few Russian and Finnish words which\nare explained by the Taters having come to Norway through Russia and Finland. In Norway they are said to have first appeared in the 16th century.\n\n---\n\n**Library.**\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in February last.\n\n**Transactions, Proceedings, and Journals, presented by the respective Societies or Editors.**\n\nAthens. *Cyriacus, A.

Ditto ditto ditto.\n\n\"No. 20 is worthy of special note, as it contains a date which cannot be reconciled with the history of Isl\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h. The Tar\u00edkh Daud\u00ed, quoting the T\u00e1r\u00edkh Akbar Sh\u00e1hi, says, 'when Sher Sh\u00e1h rendered up his life to the angel of death in Kalinjar, Jal\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, his youngest son, was in the town of Rew\u00e1n, in the province of Bhata, and his eldest son \u2019\u00c1d\u00edl Kh\u00e1n, the heir-apparent, in the fort of Ranthor (Ranthambhor). The nobles perceived that \u2019\u00c1d\u00edl Kh\u00e1n would be unable to arrive with speed, and as the State required a head, they despatched a person to summon Jal\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, who was nearer. He reached Kalinjar in five days, and, by the assistance of \u2019I\u1e63a Hajj\u00e1b and other grandees, was raised to the throne near the fort of Kalinjar, on the 15th of the month Rabi-ul-awwal, 952 A. H. (25th May, 1545, A. D.) He assumed the title of Isl\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, and this verse was engraved on his seal:\n\n\"The world through the favour of the Almighty, has been rendered happy,\nSince Isl\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, the son of Sher Sh\u00e1h, has become king.\"\n\n\"If this record be right, Isl\u00e1m must be accepted to have succeeded Sher Sh\u00e1h in the middle of 952, immediately after the death of his father. How comes it that we have coins bearing date 951, and describing him as a Sult\u00e1n, son of Sher Sh\u00e1h? In Mr. Thomas' excellent monograph of the Path\u00e1n Kings of Delhi, mention is made of a coin of Isl\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h bearing date Ranthamar 951 H., and the type of that coin is the same with that of the above list, but the inconsistency in the date has not been noticed. It is impossible that the father and the son could reign at the same time, unless a revolt of some kind be admitted, and such a revolt or rivalry for the empire between the father and the son has nowhere been mentioned by Muhammadan writers. The son, acting in subordination to the father, would have struck the rupees in his father's, and not in his own, name. Moreover he was not the rightful heir, and could not succeed except by superseding his eldest brother. My own reading of No. 20 I accept with diffidence, but Mr. Thomas' unrivalled knowledge of Indian numismatics and Semitic pal\u00e6ography leaves no room for doubt that the reading is cor-\n\n* Apud Elliot's Muhammadan Historians, IV, p. 478.\nrect, and the only solution that I can offer of the difficulty is that the second son was striving for the empire even from before the death of his father, and was not only in open revolt, but had gone the length of proclaiming himself the Sult\u00e1n, and of putting in circulation coins bearing his name a year before his father's death, and that the Muhammadan historians have glossed over this part of his career. The only objection to this solution would be the tender age of the youth, but that would be removed if it be assumed that he had been set up by some disaffected grandees of his father's court.\"\n\nThe Secretary reported that, with the consent of the Subscribers, the sum of Rs. 273-7-0, balance of the Stoliczka Memorial Fund, had been transferred to the Asiatic Society's Servants' Pension Fund.\n\nThe Secretary read the following letter from Prof. J. de Goeje, dated 20th January, 1879, requesting help in obtaining subscribers for the publication of the Great Arabic Annals of Tabari, and said that he would be glad to receive the names of members who had already subscribed or wished to subscribe.\n\n\"Permit me to explain why I take the liberty of addressing you. In 1875 a consortium of Orientalists resolved to undertake the publication of the great Arabic annals of Tabari. Though there was not known a single manuscript of the whole work, still several libraries possessed parts of it, from which it would be possible to restore the text. To get these volumes copied or collated, a relatively considerable sum of money was required, and a good number of subscribers was thought necessary to cover the costs of printing. I addressed myself for support to many promoters of science and had not bad luck. I had great expectations from India and was not disappointed. Dr. Blochmann wrote to me that it would be easy for him to procure me 60 subscribers, and Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra told Prof. Sprenger in a letter of earlier date, that Dr. Blochmann had already a dozen names on his list, and that he himself had a few more. Now by the illness and subsequent death of Dr. Blochmann, this most promising correspondence has been broken off, and I never received the list of subscribers, which Dr. Blochmann had given himself so much trouble to collect. I was at a loss to whom I might address myself for information, when Mr. A. Grote emboldened me to appeal to your kindness. So now I venture to recommend to you the interests of our undertaking, and to ask for your help in promoting them.\"\n\n\"The first half volume of Tabari is nearly printed and will be published within two months.\"\nDr. Hoernle exhibited facsimiles of three inscriptions and a statuette sent by Mr. Rivett-Carnac, and read a note by Dr. R. Mitra on the same. The inscriptions are incomplete and of not much value. They are intended for Sanskrit, but both the language and orthography are corrupt. The first, of seven lines, is from Bhojpur, near Fatehpur. It is now built into a wall, face inwards; but this is not its original place, for it was put up to record the making of the approaches to a bridge, at some locality not named. According to the record, this was done during the reign of Sultan Sikandar, son of Behlal Lodi, by one Buddhana, son of Hajibal Euradi, of the race of Bahl\u00edm. It also mentions one, Khan Daudan. The names cannot be identified. The date is Samvat 1545 (A.D. 1491). The second, of two lines, in Kutila characters, partly illegible, contains the names V\u00e1sava D\u00e1mudaka (for Damodara?). It is from a stone at Kanauj, apparently the top of a pillar; without date. The third, from the remains of a sandstone figure, containing only ten Sanskrit letters and a monogram, is illegible. Date Samvat 1580 (A.D. 1523). The statuette is a small black sitting figure. The pose according to Dr. Mitra is that of Buddha in ecstasy, and is well known. Mr. Rivett-Carnac takes it to be a Jain figure. The symbol of the hooded snake engraved on the base, and the black colour of the figure, perhaps, indicate it to represent Parsvan\u00e1tha. There is an inscription in modern N\u00e1gari all round the base, of which, however, only the date Samvat 1548 (A.D. 1491), the 6th of the waxing moon in the month of Vais\u00e1ka, and the words pr\u0101\u1e47amati sadgurum, i.e., \"he salutes the true guru\" can be made out.\n\nDr. Hoernle read the following description of the gold coins found by Mr. W. Simpson in the Ahin Posh Tope at Jalal\u00e1b\u00e1d, exhibited at the last meeting.\n\nThere are altogether 20 coins, two (Nos. IX and XIII) contained in a small gold reliquary, the other 18 loose. They are all of gold, of small size, about \u00bc inch wide, and about 2 drams in weight. They are of two different classes, 8 are Roman, the other 17 Indo-scythian. The latter are of three different reigns, of Kadphises, Kanerki and Hverki. See Plates II and III.\n\nI. INDO-SCYTHIAN COINS.\n\nA. Coins of Kadphises.\n\nThere are altogether ten of these; they are of two sorts; (1) such as bear the bust of king Kadphises on the obverse, and a standing human figure on the reverse; (2) such as have the same obverse as the former, but on the reverse bear a human figure standing by the side of a standing bull.\n\n(1.) These again are of two kinds, in some (a) the head of the bull is turned to the left; in the others (b) it is turned to the right.\n\n* It has been decided to have these plates produced in England by the Autotypic photo-mechanical process, as being far superior to lithography. Some delay will therefore arise before they can be issued.\u2014Ed.\nGOLD COINS FOUND IN THE AHIN POSH TOPE, JALALABAD.\n\n(Obverses)\nGOLD COINS FOUND IN THE AHIN POSH TOPE, JALALABAD.\n\n(Reverse)\n(a.) Of this kind there are five specimens:\n\nNo. I Obverse\u2014Figure of king to the front, head turned to the left, with a thick closely cut full-beard (in most specimens so much abraded as to give the appearance of a beardless face,) dressed in a coat and a low Tartar cap with fillets and frontlet, in the right hand a mace or short club, leaning on the shoulder; monogram (No. 1, on table III, Pl. I.) behind the head; below the bust and all round it the inscription.\n\nReverse\u2014Naked standing male human figure turned to the front; head to the right; apparently leaning back with the left elbow on some invisible support, hid by a skin thrown over the left lower arm; in the left hand a short club, right hand raised and resting on a spear which is surmounted by a trident and combined half way down the staff with an axe; hair done in a cone on the top of the head. Monogram double, on right and left (table III, Pl. I. Nos. 2, 3); inscription running all round.\n\nNo. II. A duplicate of No. I.\n\nNo. III. Obverse\u2014Like that of No. I, except the head-dress being a high Tartar cap, like those given in Wilson's Ariana Antiqua, Pl. X, 7, 8, 13.\n\nReverse\u2014Like that of No. I.\n\nNo. IV. and No. V. duplicates of No. III.\n\n(b.) Of this kind there are three specimens:\n\nNo. VI. Obverse\u2014Bust of king to the front; head turned to the right; dressed in Tartar coat and high cap with ordinary fillets and frontlet; in the right hand a mace carried erect; monogram behind the head; inscription below and around the bust.\n\nReverse\u2014Like that of No. I.\n\nNos. VII, VIII, and IX duplicates of No. VI.\n\nOf Nos. I and II no specimens are given by Wilson in his Ariana Antiqua. Nos. I and II are in a good state of preservation; Nos. VII and VIII are fairly good; the rest are very much worn; especially Nos. III and V which are for the most part effaced.\n\nExplanation.\n\n(1.) Figures. Alike on all coins I to VIII; the bust on the obverse evidently a portrait of king Kadphises; features Tartar; very heavy, especially in the lower part of the face. The figure on the reverse very closely resembles that on the reverse of the coins of Kadphises or Kadaphes under Su-Hermaeus. On the latter coins it is a figure of Hercules in the conventional posture, as seen, e.g., in the well-known Ercole Farnese in Naples. It is a naked standing Hercules, to the front, slightly reclining on his left elbow; the lion's skin hanging over the left lower arm, and the Hesperide apple in the left hand; the right hand resting on his club, the butt end of which is on the ground (see Wilson's Ariana Antiqua, 309,\nThe same figure is also found on coins of Hverki (see Ed. Thomas' Jainism, p. 61, Pl. II, 2). On the present coins the figure is the same, but the attributes of Hercules are exchanged for those of \u015aiva; his trishula or three-pronged spear (combined with his axe, as in the tridents of Barahat and Gopeshwar, see Wilson's Ariana Antiqua, 350), taking the place of the club; his tiger skin (in Indian representations wrapt round the loins, but here thrown over the arm to resemble Hercules) replacing the lion's skin; his noose or the khinkin (the object is not quite distinct) the apple, and the spiral coil of hair on his head the curly hair of Hercules.\n\n(2.) Inscription alike on all 8 specimens.\n\nObverse\u2014The legend is in Greek language and Greek characters; on the left BACIAEYC ooHMo, on the right KA\u0394\u03a6\u0399CHC, below the bust \u039c\u0399\u0393\u0391\u03a3; i.e., \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 \u03bf\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf-\u03ba\u03b1\u03b4\u03c6\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2, i.e. \"king Hvemo-Kadphises the Great.\" The word \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 has hitherto not been read, though it was already remarked by Wilson (Ariana Antiqua, pp. 354) that the lower part of the bust had the appearance of characters. The appearance of letters, indeed, is too unmistakeable to allow them to be taken as only parts of the dress. But owing to the fact that the letters are here cut at a higher elevation than in the rest of the legend, level with the bust itself, they have in most coins suffered so much abrasion as to be almost unrecognisable. There are, however, in the present collection two coins (Nos. I and II) on which the letters are in a sufficiently good state of preservation to permit an attempt at identification. I take them to be migas, where 'i' is either a mistake for 'e' or only badly cut. It should be observed (see Wilson's Ariana Antiqua, 355\u2014357, Pl. XI) that both on the silver and the copper coins of Kadphises the word megas is not only part of the inscription, but occurs precisely in the same place below the bust.\n\nb. Reverse\u2014The legend is in the P\u0101li language, and in what has been called the Bactrian or Arian-P\u0101li characters. It must be read from the right to the left; commencing at the top of the left side of the coin. It consists of 33 letters, see Pl. I. table I. The whole, with the exception of the last seven letters, is distinctly visible on coin No. I. The deficiency is supplied by No. II, on which the second half is distinct. By the help of these two specimens, therefore, the whole of the legend can be made out with tolerable certainty. On the others it is more or less imperfect. Nos. III and V are quite useless. On the rest the middle of the legend is generally readable and available for comparison. But though the form of the letters is assured, their value, for the most part, is not so. That of the first eleven is certain; it is Maharajasa rajadhirajasa. The next is sa; 13 is unknown; 14 and 15 are loga;\n16 is either i or sta; 17 is unknown; 18 and 19 are rasa; 20 and 21 are mahi; 22, 23 and 24 are the same as 17, 18 and 19; 25 and 26 appear to be hima or hvima; 27, 28, 29, and 30 are Kadphisasa; 31 is unknown; 32 and 33 are dara. There are various helps to determine the probable meaning of the legend. In the first place, it has been found that, as a rule, the P\u0101li legend on the reverse is a more or less accurate translation of that on the obverse. In the present case the legend on the reverse is much too long to be such a translation. But the same legend occurs also on the copper coins of Kadphises which have a much longer Greek inscription, viz., basileus basileon sotir megas himo-Kadphises; and it can scarcely be doubtful, that the P\u0101li legend is the equivalent of the longer Greek series (see Wilson's Ariana Antiqua, 350). Now maharajasa rajadhirajasa, \"of the great king, the king of kings\" is evidently intended to represent basileus basileon \"king of kings.\" The words hima-kadphisasa \"of Hima-Kadphises\" occur in both P\u0101li (letters 25\u201430) and Greek. The remainder, therefore, of the P\u0101li legend ought to be the equivalent of megas and sotir. In the second place, the P\u0101li legend is in the genitive case, which ends in sa. The same termination sa occurs twice again in letters 19 and 24, which shows that the letters intermediate between rajadhirajasa and hima (i.e., 12 to 24) consist of two groups, each containing an epithet of king Kadphises. There is a third group of letters (31\u201433) following Kadphises. It can hardly be doubted that this also contains an epithet of the king. In that case it ought to terminate with sa. I have no doubt that it was intended to end so and that the letter was simply omitted for want of space; the letters of the inscription being already packed so closely as to leave no room for an additional one. On coin No. X, letter 16 is similarly omitted. Again the unknown character 30 I take to be tra*; for r is marked by adding a stroke to the right foot of the letter (see Cunningham, Corpus Inscrip. Ind., 49), which, without this stroke, is the usual character for t. The whole group, then, must be read tradarasa or traddarasa, \"of the saviour,\" the regular P\u0101li or Apabhramsa-pr\u0101krit equivalent of the Sanskrit tr\u0101tuh (see Hema Chandra 3, 44) and the Greek sotir. This reading is confirmed by the fact that the Arian P\u0101li as well as the Ap. Pr\u0101k. like to retain an r (see Cunningham C. I. I., 43 and H. Ch. 4, 398). The Greek sotir being thus accounted for, the remaining Greek word megas ought to be the equivalent of the remaining two groups. The simple P\u0101li translation of megas, as it\n\n* Since writing the above, I have discovered in the Shahb\u0101zgarhi rock inscription (towards the end of the IIIrd edict, see Cunningham C. I. I., Pl. I) and on some of the coins of Hermaeus (see Wilson A. A., Pls. IV and V) a character for tra, very closely resembling this one.\noccurs on other coins, is mahatasa (= Pr\u00e1k. mahantassa or mahattassa). Here, of course, it cannot be taken as translated, but is paraphrased and expanded. The unknown letter 22 resembles the Arian P\u00e1li character for s; but there is a curve added to the right foot, which may indicate the combination of another consonant with s; such combinations being not uncommon in Arian P\u00e1li (see Cunningham C. I. I., 49). Now the only possible conjunct here is sv; so that the whole group (20\u201424) must be read mahi\u015bvarasa, which I take to stand for the Sanskrit mah\u0113\u015bvarasya \u201cof the great lord,\u201d with i for e, as in the Pr\u00e1krit devimdo for Sanskrit devendra\u1e25 (see H. Ch., 3, 162). Again the group (22\u201424) \u015bvarasa re-occurs in 17\u201419. The group 14\u201415 is loga. The intermediate letter 16 must therefore be i, to give any sense at all. No. 13 is generally valued as va, so that the whole group 12\u201419 would be savvalokai\u015bvarasa, which I should take to be equal to the Sanskrit sarvalokai\u015bvarasya \u201cof the supreme in the whole world.\u201d In this way, this and the other group together would give a fulsome paraphrase of the Greek megas \u201cthe Great.\u201d The explanation of the last two groups is substantially the same as that given by Thomas in his Jainism (p. 59) where, however, the author of it is not mentioned. The word logai\u015bvarasa is not = Sanskrit loke\u015bvarasya, as Thomas has it, but is equal to lokai\u015bvarasya, for Sanskrit e would not dissolve into ai, whereas ai does (see H. Ch., 1,151, where the very word ai\u015bariam for Sanskrit ai\u015bvaryam is given as an example). However, the form of 13 in the group is, by no means, the usual form of v, as may be seen by a reference to the alphabets in Wilson, Prinsep, and Cunningham. It is doubtful, therefore, whether the correct value has been assigned to it. It looks like a conjunct, the two parts of which somewhat resemble the characters for g and d, and may therefore be gda. In that case, the whole group (12\u201419) would read sagdalogai\u015bvarasa \u201cof the sovereign of the Sagda people.\u201d The Sagdas might then be identified with the Sogdians who are spoken of by the Greek historians as one of the Scythian tribes. It should be also noticed that the letter 25 is not the usual one, as we have it, e.g., in 21. I take it to be a compound consonant, made up of h and v with the vowel i and to be the equivalent of hv\u012b, so that the whole group 25, 26 must be read hv\u012bma. This corresponds exactly to the Greek \u03bf\u03bf\u03bd\u03bc\u03bf (oo\u00edmo). That the Greek o may stand for v is shown by oado for v\u00e1to (see Wilson, A. A., 362), and that it may also represent the aspirate h, by oo\u00edrki for hv\u00edrki (see p.134). The latter is the name of the king who is otherwise known as hv\u00edr shka. Here hv\u00edr is rendered in Greek by \u03bf\u03bf\u03bd (ooi), the same as in \u03bf\u03bf\u03bd\u03bc\u03bf P\u00e1li of the present coin by the Arian-P\u00e1li consonant must repr to hv or rather hv.\u2014Of the con\naware of any explanation having been given hitherto. Wilson (A. A., 258); indeed, notices the true interpretation which I have given above, but only to reject it.\n\n(2.) Of this kind there is only one specimen.\n\nNo. X. Obverse\u2014Exactly like that of No. I. On the back of the head very long hair, flowing down to the shoulders, is distinctly visible, reminding one somewhat of the long hair of the modern Afghans.\n\nReverse\u2014The figure principally differs from that on the reverse of No. I by the addition of a bull which stands behind the human figure. The latter closely resembles that of No. I in general posture; the left elbow on which it reclines is supported on the hump of the bull; the right hand, as before, resting on a three-pronged spear which, however, is only half as long as in No. I and rests with its lower end on the back of the bull; it also wants the axe. But the tiger's skin is absent and the left hand is empty. Instead of the coil of hair, the head is covered with a bell-shaped helmet or bonnet, reaching to the shoulders behind, surmounted by three prongs or rays, and with a lobe on each side. The face is turned to the front, not to the right, as in No. I. A chaplet of balls is hanging over the left shoulder and reaches down to the hips. The figure is naked and is that of a woman, as shown by the general configuration of the body. The bull is standing with its head seen on the left side of the woman; his horns arranged so as to form a regular crescent; a cloth is thrown over his back so as to nearly reach to the ground. There is only one monogram (No. 5 on table III), not two as on No. I; and it is the right side one of No. I, which is here on the left side of the coin (the right of the figure). Inscription round the whole circumference.\n\nWhat distinguishes this coin from all the others of the Indo-Scythian class is the superior sharpness, a miniature-like clearness, with which both the figures and the inscriptions are cut. It is also in a very fair state of preservation; only a small part of the rim being worn away on one side.\n\nExplanation.\n\n(a.) Figures. That on the obverse requires no explanation, being the same as on No. I; but instead of the mace there is a short club, and the fillets are Sassanian.\n\nReverse\u2014The attributes are those of \u0160iva; his vehicle, the white bull or nandi; his tris\u016bla; his chaplet of skulls, the munda m\u0101l\u0101; the bell-shaped head-dress perhaps signifies the Ganges, flowing from his head. As the figure is that of a woman, it is probably meant for Parvati, the wife or female form of \u0160iva. On some coins the figure is said to be hermaphrodite (see Wilson's Ariana Antiqua, 351). In that case it would repre-\nsent arddhanari\u015bvara, the half male, half female form of \u015aiva. \"The housings of the bull are such as may still be seen upon the Indian bull that is led about by mendicant Jangamas\" (see Wilson's Ariana Antiqua, 351).\n\n(b.) Inscriptions. Obverse\u2014The legend is the same as in No. I, but the form of some of the Greek letters is cruder as may be seen by a reference to Pl. I, table II.\n\nReverse\u2014The legend is identical with that of No. I, but there is a slight difference in the tracing of some of the letters (4, 7, 10, 12, 15, 32), as will be seen by a reference to Pl. I, table I. In 13 and 15 the relative position of the loop is exactly reversed. In 4, 7, 10, 32 an ornamental stroke is added to the foot of the letter. 16 is entirely omitted. The last and the first letters of the legend are, for want of space, made to run into each other; thus fully accounting for the omission of the final sa.\n\nB. Coins of Kanerki.\n\nOf these there are altogether six. Among them there are only two that are quite alike, so that there are five different kinds according to the form of the figure on the reverse.\n\n1. No. XI. One specimen only. Obverse\u2014Standing figure of the king to the front, head to the right, with long straight full-beard, dressed in a close-fitting frockcoat or tunic, closed in front, in pajamas, and clumsy (boots or) shoes, much broader at the toes than at the heels, also in a mantle thrown over the shoulders and held by a button in front, the sleeves of which are seen flying out on both sides behind the arms. (Wilson, Ariana Antiqua, p. 358, takes the latter to be a bow carried on the back; but on none of the present specimens does it at all look so; he was misled by the outline of the sleeves being drawn too straight and stiff in some cases). On the head there is a crown or helmet, consisting of a parallel trapezium, with the narrower side below, with the royal fillet attached, and surmounted by a dome and above it a trident. It is probably the same crown as in No. XVII, though it is too much abraded to clearly distinguish minor points of detail. The right hand, pointing downwards, holds a hook or ankusa over a very low object, standing beside the right foot; the left hand is raised and rests on a spear. Attached to the waist-band (only distinguishable on No. XII) there is a short sword, protruding on the left side. The whole figure closely resembles one on some coins of Kadphises of which there is no specimen in the present collection, but drawings of which may be seen in Wilson's Ariana Antiqua, Pl. X, 12, 14, 21. [They differ in the features and beard; in those of Kadphises there is a high Tartar cap on the head (as, however, also in Nos. XII\u2014XIV);\nthe tunic is worn open in front, so as to allow the tie-strings of the pajamas to be distinctly seen; the sword is wanting; there is added a monogram (the same which in the present coins appears on the reverse); a mace or short club replaces the spear, but not carried in the (left) hand which is placed on the hip; a trident and axe (combined as in No. I) replace the hook, but again not carried in the (right) hand which is empty and points downwards to the unknown object.] Inscription on both sides, but not below the feet and above the head; between the feet, along the rim, a series of dots.\n\nReverse\u2014Standing male figure with large pendent ears and a large tuft on the top of the head, dressed in a long robe reaching to below the knees; parts of the dress (apparently a neckerchief) are hanging over both arms which are in elbow-position, the right one turned inwards with its hand on the breast, the left turned outwards with its hand holding some round object (a lotus); a circular nimbus round the head, another elliptical one round the rest of the body, both meeting at tangents behind the neck; monogram on the right of the coin (No. 6 on Pl. I, table III); inscription on the left; a series of dots all round the rim.\n\nThis coin is well executed and in a very fair state of preservation. It appears to be unique, as being the only gold piece found hitherto with the figure of Buddha on the reverse, and the only one on which the name of Buddha is distinctly legible. All those known hitherto are \"copper pieces of imperfect execution, whose legends are absolutely chaotic in the forms and arrangements of the Greek letters,\" (see Ed. Thomas' Jainism, p. 79.)\n\nExplanation. (a.) Obverse\u2014Figure. Likeness of Kanerki; head and features easily distinguishable from those of Kadphises. Head of the latter thick and broad, of the former more elongated; features here sharp, there heavy; beard long and straight here, there short and thick. The low object at the foot of the king is very like a miniature of the large fire-altar, represented on the reverse of the Sassanian coins (see Wilson's Ariana Antiqua, Pl. XV, 3, XVII, 13, 14). Hence the king is generally supposed to be represented in the act of sacrificing on a Mithraic altar.\n\nInscription. In the North-western or Arian P\u0101li language and in Greek characters; on the left of the coin PAoNANO PAo KA, on the right NHPKI KoPANO, i.e., raoanavo rao kainpki koravo. The corresponding legend on No. XIV is \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5; and it cannot be doubtful that the P\u0101li legend is but a translation of the Greek one. Raoanano rao, therefore, must be the equivalent of basileos basilon and mean \"king of kings.\" And, in fact, r\u0101o is the regular Pr\u0101krit nominative singular of r\u00e1j\u00e1 king (see Si\u1e45ha R\u0101j\u00e1, fol. 20, H. Ch., 3, 49, 56). It still occurs as a title of Hindu princes. Again r\u0101\u1e47\u0101na (or r\u0101\u1e47\u0101nam) is the regular Pr\u0101krit genitive plural \"of kings\" (see H. Ch. 3, 56). Strictly\nthe Greek \\(\\rho\\alpha\\omega\\omega\\) represents a Pr\u00e1krit form \\(\\rho\\alpha\\alpha\\eta\\eta\\); but the shortening of the second \\(a\\) may be a local peculiarity. As a rule the P\u00e1li does not observe the later Pr\u00e1krit rule of eliding medial consonants (here \\(j\\)), as may be seen from the P\u00e1li legend on the coins of Kadphises. But the adoption of it by the Western or Arian P\u00e1li in the case of the title R\u00e1j\u00e1 is also proved by the Sh\u00e1hb\u00e1zag\u00e1ri rock inscription of Asoka, which has rayo instead of the r\u00e1ja and l\u00e1ja of Girnar and Dhauli. The approximation of the Western P\u00e1li to the later Pr\u00e1krit is also shown by the use, in the former, of the Pr\u00e1krit form baraya \"twelve\" (see Cunningham, C. I. I., pp. 42, 67 and Vr. 2, 14 bar\u00e1ha), instead of the ordinary P\u00e1li duvad\u00e1sa. The word r\u00e1n\u00e1no has not hitherto been fully understood. Prinsep took it as two words r\u00e1o-n\u00e1no, and explained n\u00e1no as the Sanskrit n\u00e1n\u00e1 \"repeatedly.\" Wilson and after him Lassen also divided the word, but into raon\u00e1-no, interpreting raon\u00e1 as the plural of r\u00e1o, and no as the genitive affix of the Gujarati. But it may be doubted whether the documentary use of that affix is so old. Kanerki is the name of the king, and is supposed to be identical with Kanishka of Kashmerian history. The word korano has not yet been satisfactorily explained. Perhaps the identification of it with the Greek koiranos \"chief,\" especially a \"military chief\" (as Masson and Wilson, see Ariana Antiqua, 78, 358, and Ed. Thomas' Jainism, p. 20), is after all the most plausible. The use of an old Greek word need not surprise, for there are also other signs of a Greek revival in the time of king Kanerki in the use of Greek deity-names (see also Ed. Thomas' Jainism, p. 8). Lassen takes it to be a Greek corruption of kushana, expressing some title (see Ind. Ant., Vol. II, p. 389). The whole legend then would mean: \"the king of kings, Kanerki, the war-chief.\"\n\n(b.) Reverse\u2014The figure is that of Buddha as shown by his posture and attributes and the inscription. The posture of preaching or blessing, the tuft of hair on the top, the large ears and the lotus characterise the figure too clearly to be mistaken (Wilson's A. A., 363), and this is confirmed by the inscription which is in Greek characters Bo\u0394\u0394\u03bf, i.e., \u03b2\u03bf\u03b4\u03b4\u03bf or buddha.\n\n2. No. XII. One specimen only. Obverse\u2014Figure and inscription like that on No. XI.\n\nReverse\u2014Standing male figure; general posture resembling that on the reverse of No. I, but left arm a-kimbo with hand on the hilt of a short sword, protruding on the left side; right arm extended straight, with apparently all the fingers of the hand closed except two; dressed in a long thin robe and pallium; a rayed nimbus, with fillets, round the head. Same monogram as on No. XI, but on the left of the coin (No. 7 on Pl. I, table III); on its right the inscription; a circle of dots all round, but a little off the rim.\nExplanation. Obverse\u2014As in No. XI.\n\nReverse\u2014The figure is supposed to represent the Persian Sun-god, Mithra. This is indicated by the filleted nimbus of rays and the inscription which is in Greek characters MIIPo, i.e., \u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf. This appears to be a local form of mihiro, in modern Persian mihir, a corruption of mithra. In western P\u00e1li and Pr\u00e1krit mithra would regularly turn into midhiro or mihiro. On some other coins of this kind the word is found spelled miaro (= miharo) or mithra.\n\n3. No. XIII. One specimen only. Obverse\u2014Figure and inscription as on No. XI, only the sword is wanting, but probably only worn off, and the head-dress appears to be a high Tartar cap rather than a helmet or crown.\n\nReverse\u2014Standing male figure; general posture and dress exactly as on No. XII. Here the left hand seems to rest on two swords instead of one; perhaps they are large pincers, if the figure be rightly interpreted as Vulcan. In the extended right hand a scroll; something like flames issuing from behind both shoulders; on the head which is full-bearded, apparently a low cap with fillet. Monogram as on No. XII. On the right side the inscription. A circle of dots originally round the circumference, but about one-third worn away.\n\nExplanation. Obverse\u2014As in No. XI.\n\nReverse.\u2014The legend is in Greek characters \u0391\u0398\u03a1\u039f, i.e., \u03b1\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf which has been conjectured by Prinsep to be the Zend word atars or athro \u201cfire,\u201d and to represent the god of fire (Wilson\u2019s A. A. 362) or Vulkan (Ed. Thomas\u2019 Jainism, p. 76), indicated by the pincers, if that be the indistinct object.\n\n4. No. XIV. One specimen only. Obverse\u2014As on No. XIII, except that here the hook also is wanting, and the dots between the feet of the figure; but both apparently worn off.\n\nReverse.\u2014Standing male figure; general posture as in No. XII; left arm a-kimbo, with hand resting on the hilt of a short sword and holding a long staff surmounted by a ball, below which four streamers are attached to it. The staff is held across the body, so as to touch the left shoulder and form an X with the body; the right arm extended, having all the fingers of the hand closed except two (apparently the second and the middle fingers). On the head there appears to be a cap or diadem (much effaced) with fillets, from under which thick hair protrudes. What has been above described as streamers are possibly the continuation of these fillets. The head is enclosed between the crescent of the moon projecting from the shoulders. Monogram as in No. XII. On the right side the inscription. Circle of dots originally round the circumference, but about one half worn away.\nExplanation. Obverse\u2014Figure and legend as on No. XI, except that the legend is in the Greek language; on the right of the coin \u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a5C \u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u0399\u039f\u039d \u039a\u0391\u039d\u0397\u03a1\u039a\u039f\u03a5, i.e., \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5 meaning \"the king of kings Kanerkou.\" The title korano is omitted, apparently only for want of space, the Greek legend occupying more room than the P\u00e1li one. The termination ou of the name seems to be only a gr\u00e6cified form of the P\u00e1li i.\n\nReverse\u2014The figure is clearly that of the moon-god. This is shown by the attribute of the crescent on the shoulders, as well as by the legend in Greek language and Greek characters \u03a3\u0391\u039b\u0397\u039d\u0397, i.e., \u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b7 \"moon,\" though it is wrongly spelled with a for e. As the figure is male, it is meant for the Deus Lunus as seen on the coins of Asia Minor (see Wilson A. A., 360). The figure very closely resembles that of the Sun-god (or Apollo), as seen on No. XII; the principal difference being the crescent here for the rayed nimbus there.\n\nThis coin also is unique and is the most important of the collection, being, so far as I am aware, the only specimen, known hitherto, which has the legend selene. All those, known hitherto, of a like kind, i.e., bearing similar figures on the obverses and reverses, have P\u00e1li legends, viz., on the obverse raonano rao etc., on the reverse mao (see Wilson A. A., Pl. XII, 1, 13). The latter has been rightly identified with the Zend mao and Sanskrit m\u00e1sa \"moon\" (see Wilson A. A. 360). The present specimen is their exact Greek counterpart. Those coins of Kanerki which bear on the reverse the legend nanaia should not be confounded with these. Nanaia is the Persian Artemis and her figure is very different. It is that of a woman, with quite different attributes and without the crescent (see Wilson's A. A., Pl. XI, 17). The P\u00e1li counterparts of the nanaia coins bear the legend nana or nano (see Wilson, Pl. XII, 2, 12).\n\n5. Two Specimens.\n\na. No. XV. Obverse\u2014Figure and inscription exactly as on No. XI.\n\nReverse\u2014Figure, slightly effaced, the same as on No. XVII, where it will be described. Monogram as on No. XII; on the right of the coin the inscription; circle of dots along the rim, slightly worn.\n\nExplanation. Obverse\u2014Figure and inscription as on No. XI.\n\nReverse\u2014The legend is in Greek characters oHPo. It has generally been taken to be okpo (okro, see Wilson's A. A., 361), but, I am persuaded, wrongly. It is onpo (oiro). The second letter is a corrupt form of \u03b7 (No. 22 on Pl. I, table II). The same corrupt form also occurs on the obverse in the name Kanirhou where it undoubtedly stands for \u03b7. The letter \u03ba occurs\nthree times on the obverse and is always distinctly K (see Pl. I, table II). In fact in all coins of Kanerki, having a P\u0101li legend, \u03b7 is uniformly distinguished in this way from \u03ba, as may be seen by comparing Nos. 19, 22, 24 with No. 33 on table II. The corrupt form for \u03b7 already occurs in No. X, of Kadphises. It is only on the Kanerki coins with a Greek legend (as in No. XIV), that \u03b7 appears in its proper form H; but in these, too, K is always K, while the corrupt form of \u03b7 does not occur at all (see Nos. 20 and 34 on table II). It may be observed that Nos. 18, 19, 21 are evidently the intermediate form between Nos. 17, 20 and Nos. 22, 23, 24. The legend \u03bf\u03bd\u03c0\u03bf I would identify either with v\u012bra or with h\u012bra; o standing both for v and for h (see p. 126). V\u012bra (for the fuller form v\u012brabhadra) as well as h\u012bra are, according to Jat\u0101dhara, names of \u015aiva. The figure is that of \u015aiva, as shown by his attributes of the tr\u012b\u1e63\u016bla, drum, noose and deer. Usually he has only two hands, but in the dhy\u0101na or religious meditation of the daily worship and frequently in the shastras he is represented with four. The attributes in such four-handed representations of \u015aiva vary very much. Usually the two lower hands are in the attitudes of blessing and giving; in the upper hands are a trident and thunderbolt, or trident and noose, or thunderbolt and drum, or axe and deer, or trident and skull, (see Moor's Hindu Pantheon, and Radha Kanta Deva's Sabdakalpadruma). Sometimes there is an object in each of the four hands, as noose, red lotus, skull and trident. The combination of objects represented on the present coin I do not remember to have met with elsewhere.\n\nb. No. XVI. A duplicate of No. XV.\n\nIn the coins of Kanerki a further step is observable in the corruption of the form of the Greek letters, see Pl. I, table II. The corruptions occurring in No. X of Kadphises continue. Additional are the two corrupt forms 44, 45 for N. The only exception is the coin No. XIV which has a legend not only in Greek characters but also in the Greek language. Here the letters are of superior make, see table II; especially N and H and A are well made.\n\nC. Coins of Hoverki.\n\nOf these there is only one specimen.\n\nNo. XVII. Obverse\u2014Bust of king; general posture like that of No. VI; to the front, head to the right; on left cheek thick, pendent whiskers (as in Wilson's A. A., Pl. XIV, 1; perhaps intended for cheek plates, as in Pl. XIV, 3. and Ed. Thomas' Jainism, Pl. II. 14); chin and lips shaven; dressed in coat of mail; on the head a crown or ornamental helmet (as in Wilson's A. A., Pl. XIV. 2), consisting of a circular band, studded with jewels and surmounted by a dome, which has on its side a crescent or circle,\npartly effaced, and on its summit something like a trident or flower; double frontlets and fillets; in the right hand an iron-bound mace carried erect; in the left a sceptre (apparently a stalk with flowers and leaves, as in Wilson's A. A., Pl. XIV, 1). Inscription on the right and left of the coin; below the bust some ornamentation, taking the place of the legend of No. VI; the monogram, on the left (No. 8 on Pl. I, table III), differs from those of Kadphises and Kanerki.\n\nReverse\u2014Standing male figure; general posture as in No. XI, to the front, head to the right; upper part of body naked, with a chaplet of balls round the left shoulder; the lower part dressed in ordinary Brahminical dhotie; hair thickly matted, and done into a knot on the summit; nimbus round the head; four arms each with two armlets, one at the wrist, the other above the elbow; in the upper right hand an Indian drum, in the lower a hook or ankusa and a sort of sceptre (held cross-wise); in the upper left hand a long trishula, held cross-wise (like the staff in No. XIV); in the lower, placed nearly a-kimbo, a short noose, by which he is leading after him an animal. The latter in Nos. XV and XVI looks very much like a deer or goat. On the present coin long bristling hair is distinctly visible on its body. It is very small, standing below the angle of the lower left arm, and (in Nos. XV, XVI, though not in No. XVII) looks as if rising towards the figure on its hind legs. Monogram and inscription as in No. XV. Circle of dots along the rim.\n\nBoth as regards execution and preservation this is a very good specimen. The Greek characters generally resemble those on the coins of Kanerki, see Pl. I, table II. But N appears in the still ruder shape 46 and hardly distinguishable from 21 for H. Nos. 44, 45 evidently are the forms intermediate between 42 and 46.\n\nExplanation. Obverse\u2014The inscription is the same as on Nos.

Age of the Tope.\u2014The latest of the Roman coins is that of Hadrian's wife, Sabina. She died about A.D. 137. This limits the time backwards. Some time must be allowed for the wear and tear of it, and also for its travelling to Afghanistan. The construction of the Tope therefore cannot be placed earlier than the 3rd century A.D., nor, as the Indo-seythian coins show, can it probably have been much later. The Roman coins were put in\nas curiosities, but the Indo-scythian coins must have been deposited as those current in the country. The notice by the author of the *Periplus* that in his time, the end of 1st century A.D., the drachms of Menander and Apollodotus, two Indo-grecian kings who reigned from about 150\u2014100 B.C., were still current at Baroach on the coast of Gujarat (see Wilson's A.A. 281), gives an approximate limit of about 200 years, during which the coins of a king may be supposed to have remained current. Of the three Indo-scythian kings, whose coins have been found in the Tope, the two later ones are Kanerki and Hverki. They are generally placed in the first half of the first century A.D. Adding to this 200 years for the currency of their coins, the forward limit of time for the construction of the Tope would be the first half of the third century A.D. It is a noteworthy fact, that no Bactro-Grecian coin has ever been found in any Tope (see Wilson's A.A., 43); nor any Indo-Grecian, except of the last king of that line, Hermaeus, whose rule was subverted by the Scythian prince Kadphises in the first century B.C.; while foreign coins are often met with in them in conjunction with native ones. The omission cannot be well explained otherwise but by supposing (as Wilson A.A., 44), that they had ceased to be current at the time when the Topes were erected. It follows, then, that the coins which are found in the Topes must have been placed in them, as being contemporary and current, whether native and common (as the Indo-scythian) or foreign and rare (as the Roman).\n\n2. On Kadphises.\u2014The kings Kanerki and Hverki are admitted by all to be later than Kadphises, and placed in the first half of the first century A.D. As to Kadphises, it is commonly thought that there were two rulers of that name, one in the beginning, the other towards the end of the first century B.C.; and the present coins of Kadphises are ascribed to the second of that name. Some even distinguish a third one, called Kadaphes, a contemporary of the first Kadphises (so Lassen). The subject is involved in much obscurity, owing to the data, which we have, being in part not easy to understand, in part difficult to reconcile. So far as I can judge them, there does not appear to be sufficient ground to distinguish three or even two men. The coins of the (so-called) first Kadphises and of Kadaphes are all of copper and badly preserved. The reading of their legend is by no means assured. Even if it were so, the two names are not sufficiently unlike to preclude the identity of the persons to whom they belonged. As regards the two Kadphises, the evidence, such as it is, rather seems to me to point to their unity. For (1) there is a striking resemblance in the figures on the reverse of their coins, as pointed out on p. 123. The coins of the last Indo-Greek king Hermaeus have on the reverse a sitting Jupiter; in those of Kadphises I, his place is\ntaken by a standing Hercules, and the same device re-occurs on those of Kadphises II, only exchanging the attributes of Hercules for those of Siva. The same name Kadphises occurs on the reverse of both; only the attributives vary, Kadphises II being called Great king, while Kadphises I is called merely a warrior-chief. Again on the obverse of Kadphises II, there is his own bust and superscription; while on that of Kadphises I, there is the bust of king Hermaeus with the latter's superscription, precisely the same, both as to figure and legend, as on the coins of Herm\u00e6us himself. The coins of the so-called Kadphises I, clearly exhibit an intermediate or transition state, but do not necessarily point to a succession of three different rulers. It would rather appear, that under the weak king Hermaeus, the chief of one of the warlike Scythian tribes usurped the regal power, though not at first the regal title. Accordingly the obverse of the coins of the time was allowed to continue to bear the bust and legend of the nominal king, while on the reverse the usurper put his own name and device, the latter being a Greek one in imitation of the Greek device which it had supplanted. Later when Hermaeus was removed (perhaps by death), Kadphises assumed the regal titles also, and henceforth substituted his own bust and legend for those of Herm\u00e6us. At the same time to further suit the changed state of things, the subordinate titles on the reverse were changed to the regal ones, and the Greek attributes of the figure on the reverse were also changed to native Indian ones, perhaps to conciliate his new subjects or to suit his own religious opinions. (2). The device of a standing Hercules used by Kadphises on the reverse of his coins, occurs on none of the coins of the Indo-Grecian kings; it is found only on the coins of three Bactro-Greek kings Euthydemus, Demetrius, and Lysias. The Bactrian Greek kingdom was founded by the two Theodotus, father and son, who had adopted as their device a standing Jupiter. The sovereignty was afterwards usurped by Euthydemus (about B.C., 215\u2014185) who most probably had originally been ruler of Sogdiana (see Lassen I.A., Vol. II, pp. 284,293) and who substituted his own device of Hercules (either standing or sitting). His son Demetrius (about 185\u2014160 B.C.), who ruled not only Sogdiana and Bactriana, but extended his empire to the south and south-east as far as India proper, continued the same device of a standing Hercules. Towards the close of Demetrius' reign, however, his overgrown empire broke up. Thus Eukratides and Antimachus (about B.C. 165\u2014145) wrested the southern parts of the empire from him, as shown by the fact, that the coins of these two kings are the first which have Arian-Pali legends. In Bactriana and Sogdiana itself Demetrius was succeeded by Lysias (about B.C. 160\u2014140) who continues the old device of the standing Hercules and who re-conquered (about B.C. 145) some parts of his patrimony in the south from Helio-\ncles, the son of Eukratides, as shown by his coins bearing an Arian-P\u00e1li legend. The device of Hercules, especially the standing one, may, therefore, be looked upon as peculiar to the Sogdian line of Bactro-Greek princes. Not long afterwards\u2014there appears to have been an intermediate Queen Agathokleia, whose coin also shows the sitting Hercules\u2014the Bactro-Greek kingdoms were subverted by Scythian tribes. The first to suffer that fate naturally was the northern kingdom of Sogdia and Bactria about B. D. 127. The southern kingdoms continued for a short time longer. The Sogdians themselves were Scythians, and they were joined by other tribes of the same race, living further to the east. Their leader would naturally assume the device of the standing Hercules of the old Sogdian house of Greek princes. This was done by Kadphises, under whom the Sogdian Scyths, advancing southwards, encroached on, and finally subverted the southern Greek kingdom under the last Greek king Hermaeus, about B. D. 90. (3). In the legend of his coins, as read by me, Kadphises describes himself as the sovereign of the Sogda people. This would agree with and confirm the facts as stated in No. 2. It may be noticed also that Arrian (in his Anabasis VI, 15, 4) mentions a people of Sogds as living on the Indus, though already at the time of Alexander's invasion.\n\nMr. H. F. Blanford exhibited an enlarged photograph of a portion of the solar disk, taken by M. Janssen at the Meudon observatory. Referring to the observation of Mr. Nasmyth more than twenty years ago, that the surface of the sun appeared to be composed of lenticular luminous masses which had been compared by some to willow-leaves and by others to rice-grains, he pointed out that the study of the solar surface by ocular inspection was attended with very great difficulties, owing to the intensity of the glare, which renders it almost impossible to determine the true forms of the luminous elements, notwithstanding such protection as may be afforded by the use of dark and coloured glasses. On the other hand in such photographs as have been taken for some years past at Kew and Greenwich, no structure is perceptible; and that this is the case arises from the phenomenon known as photographic irradiation. Any very brilliant object when represented in a photograph appears with blurred boundaries, the brilliantly illuminated surface extending beyond its true outlines over any darker objects around. Hence, the solar surface, which as M. Janssen's photographs show, consists of brilliant granules surrounded by others which are comparatively shaded, presents a blank area of uniform white. M. Janssen is the first who has succeeded in conquering this difficulty; and, for the last two years, has obtained photographs, on all clear days, which present the details of structure so sharply and distinctly, that they may be enlarged\nnot less than nine diameters (81 times in superficial extent) for the purpose of convenient study. The specimen exhibited is one of these enlarged photographs.\n\nThe original pictures having represented the sun's disk with a diameter of 30\u00b75 centimetres, the enlarged photograph represented the central portion of a disk which, if complete, would be not less than 2\u00b7745 metres or about 9 feet in diameter.* It showed in great perfection, the granular structure of the surface and that differentiation of parts which M. Janssen terms the 'r\u00e9seau photosph\u00e9rique.' In certain areas, all the granules are more or less confused and drawn out as if swept along in a gaseous current; while, in the intervening tracts, they are distinct and rounded in form, presenting a series of brilliant dots surrounded by more shaded portions. M. Janssen is now engaged on the study of the movements thus brought to light, and this may be done with comparative ease with photographs, which afford an exact representation of the solar surface taken at intervals of 3 or 4 minutes or less.\n\nThe method which M. Janssen has devised with such signal success, depends on the fact that the prepared plate is not equally sensitive to all parts of the spectrum. In a series of experimental photographs of the solar spectrum which M. Janssen had taken in the speaker's presence, an exposure of one-third of a second gave only that portion immediately about the G line; as the exposure was prolonged, the image was extended further in both directions; and from two to three minutes gave the whole that could be obtained without the admixture of special pigments in the collodion. The first condition, then, requisite to obtain a sharp image of the granulations is to limit the exposure to the time requisite for the action of the G ray (and those rays immediately contiguous). This, in the case of the whole solar disk and in a favourable state of the atmosphere, is from $\\frac{1}{60}$ to $\\frac{1}{30}$ of a second. The second condition (seeing that no lens is completely achromatic, that is to say, that no lens has absolutely the same focus for all rays) is to adjust the sensitive surface of the plate to the focus of the G ray. And the third is to employ a collodion which presents a very perfect and even surface. The duration of the exposure is measured and adjusted by a very ingenious application of the tuning-fork. A sliding screen with a narrow slit is drawn by springs rapidly across the image formed in the focus of the objective. The width of the slit can be varied and adjusted by means of a micrometer screw. To determine the duration of exposure, a small slip of glass, previously smoked in a candle flame, is attached by a little wax to the slide, and a tuning-fork giving a known note (i.e., giving a known number of vibrations per second,) with a bristle attached to one\n\n* On this scale the earth's disk would be about 1 inch in diameter.\nof its prongs, is set vibrating transversely to the path of the slide. The slide being then released, a waved line is engraved on the smoked surface; and supposing that the fork vibrates 500 times in the second, the length of each wave represents the distance traversed in $\\frac{1}{500}$ of a second. If then the width of the slit be adjusted to one-sixth of a wave length, the duration of the exposure afforded will be $\\frac{1}{3000}$ of a second.\n\nIn conclusion, Mr. Blanford remarked on the wide field for the study of solar phenomena which is opened up by M. Janssen's discovery. The sun is still passing through a prolonged period of minimum activity, indicated by the absence of spots, faculae and hydrogen flames. It is now in a state of comparative quiescence. Mr. Norman Lockyer has particularly remarked the reduced size of the corona, the absence of hydrogen flames and the predominance of the characteristic lines of magnesium* in the chromosphere of the late eclipse. It will be especially interesting to observe the changes presented when the sun approaches another period of maximum activity, since faculae always accompany sun-spots. It may be safely predicted that the brilliant faculae and hydrogen flames (the same phenomenon seen from two different points of view) will increase at least to the same extent as the spots, and thus will probably be explained the apparent paradox which results from measurements (such as we have) of the solar radiation, viz., that the sun is hottest when the spots are most numerous. It is a common popular idea, that the reverse is the case. Ignoring direct observation and reasoning *a priori*, it is inferred that the spots being cooler than the luminous disk, the sun must emit less heat when these are most numerous. It is with the character of the sun's surface as with that of men. The eye seizes quickly on the blots, but ignores and takes no note of the brilliant faculae which accompany them, and outshine the general surface.\n\nCapt. Waterhouse observed, with reference to Mr. Blanford's statement that the photographs of the sun previous to those done by M. Janssen were quite blank and showed no traces of structure beyond the spots, that when exhibiting one of M. Janssen's photographs at the Meeting in May last, he had mentioned that some of the small photographs taken with the photoheliograph by Colonel Tennant at Roorkee after the Transit of Venus showed very distinct traces of structure over the solar disc, and though of course they were wanting in the fine details of the granular structure, the outlines of what he believed M. Janssen called the polygons of his network were easily distinguishable. These photographs had been very carefully\n\n* Mr. Lockyer's view as is well known is that the greater intensity of the solar heat at the time of maximum sun-spots, causes a dissociation of the magnesium molecules, resolving it into hydrogen.\ntaken by Colonel Tennant and developed with pyrogallic acid. Some of the photographs taken in Calcutta with the same instrument on dry plates by Sapper Meins, who was sent out by the Secretary of State to take photographs of sun-spots, also showed the same structure. Owing to want of the proper appliances none of these photographs had been enlarged, and they were too small to give anything like such satisfactory results as those obtained by M. Janssen because the size of the disc was only 4 inches instead of 12 inches.\n\nThe following papers were read:\u2014\n\n1. On a new Standard of Light.\u2014By L. Schwendler, Esq.\n   (Abstract.)\n\nThe author illustrated his paper by exhibiting an actual standard. The new standard of light consists of a piece of pure sheet platinum of an U shape, cut accurately to fixed dimensions. When a sufficiently strong electric current is made to pass through the platinum, it becomes white-hot and emits a brilliant light. He showed experimentally how the intensity of this light could be varied, i.e., the magnitude of the standard altered,\u2014by varying the current, and that when the current was kept constant, the light was rigorously constant also.\n\nMr. Schwendler defines the new unit of light as:\n\nThe quantity of light emitted from a piece of pure platinum weighing \\(x\\) grm. and having the most convenient shape and size, when a constant current of \\(y\\) webers per second passes through it.\n\nThe advantages of the new standard are:\n\nThe Light is perfectly constant if the current is kept constant; it allows a correction to be made for the variation of the current when this variation is known; it can be reproduced very accurately anywhere; its magnitude can be altered to any extent to suit certain practical purposes by simply varying the elements of weight, shape and size of the platinum, or the strength of the current passing through it; it does not alter of itself, either in intensity, size, or position, and therefore most accurate photometric measurements can be made with it; the standard can be easily made to fit into any adopted system of absolute units. Hence the new standard fulfils all the recognised conditions of a perfect and rational standard, and Mr. Schwendler therefore proposes it should be adopted in future in England and India in lieu of the Standard Candle.\n\nMr. Schwendler concluded by saying that there would be no practical difficulties met with in the introduction of the new standard for technical purposes. Gas Companies and other Corporations that may in time be formed to supply that necessary commodity \"light,\" to the general public would find it quite easy and highly satisfactory to themselves to\nuse such a reliable standard for measuring the light they sell, and the public on the other hand, would then know correctly the quantity of light they receive, and for what they have to pay.\n\nThe paper, written at the beginning of 1878, and originally intended to form an appendix to Mr. Schwendler's report \"on the Electric Light experiments,\" will be printed in the Journal, Part II.\n\n2. Notes on the Old Burmese route over Patkoi via Nongyang.\u2014By S. E. Peal, Esq.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn this paper the author shows the advantages to be gained by opening out a trade route between India, Burma and China over the Patkoi range, and recounts the various explorations that have been made with this object.\n\nThe paper will be published, with maps, in the Journal, Part II.\n\n3. On some experiments made at H. M.'s Mint in Calcutta on coining Silver into Rupees.\u2014By Col. J. F. Tennant, R. E., C. I. E., F. R. S., &c., Master of the Mint.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper contains an account of some experiments made by the author to ascertain the cause and extent of the apparent refining that takes place when an alligation containing fine silver and copper is melted and of the further changes in the alloy during the processes of coining. The author also places on record some interesting information as to the general working of the Mint.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\n4. Observations on some Chandel Antiquities.\u2014By F. C. Black, C. E., and V. A. Smith, B. A., C. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper is intended to be supplementary to the accounts of Mahoba and Khajur\u00e1ho given in General Cunningham's Archaeological Reports.\n\nThe present position of the Chandel clan is briefly noticed, and the rumoured existence of an unpublished inscription at Khajur\u00e1ho is mentioned. The writers suggest that the 'magic square' cut on the right jamb of the door of the Jinan\u00e1th temple may not be ancient, and urge the necessity for careful editing of the known Chandel inscriptions. The discovery of two short inscriptions near Mahoba, and of a sixth life-size elephant statue in the Madan S\u00e1g\u00e1r is announced.\n\nSome remarks on the construction and decoration of the Khajur\u00e1ho temples are offered, and stress is laid on the proofs of the extent to which restorations have been effected.\nThe questions as to the age and destination of the Gan\u1e6dhai temple are discussed at length, with the result that in the writer's belief this temple is not nearly so ancient as has been supposed by General Cunningham and Mr. Fergusson, but is on the contrary a comparatively modern unfinished restoration, composed possibly of ancient materials. This temple probably belonged to the Jains, and not to the Buddhists.\n\nThe concluding section of the paper is devoted to a description of three hitherto undescribed temples. These buildings are rectangular in plan and seem to have been Jain.\n\nThe writers hope in another paper to describe certain other remarkable buildings.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n5. A Chandel Inscription dated 1240 S.\u2014By V. A. Smith, B. A., C. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe inscription from Mahoba of which I send a rubbing and hand-copy appears to me worth publishing, for although it is unfortunately very imperfect, it contains several names not mentioned in the Chandel inscriptions which have been published.\n\nThe record is engraved in very distinct Kutila characters on a large black slab, which was discovered by General Cunningham in 1843, built into the northern wall of the building known popularly as R\u00e1j\u00e1 Parmal's fort.\n\nIn his account of Mahoba (Arch. Report, Vol. II), General Cunningham speaks of this inscription as one of Parmal's or Param\u00e1rdi's, but in a private letter to me he explains that he \"did not mean to attribute it to 'Param\u00e1rdi himself, but only to the period of his reign.'\"\n\nThe inscription does not contain the name of the reigning R\u00e1j\u00e1, but there can be little doubt that the year 1240 S. was included in the reign of Parm\u00e1l.\n\nI cannot venture on a translation of what is left of this curious record, but perhaps some more learned member of the Society may be induced to take the trouble of making a translation so far as is possible.\n\nNo personal name appears in the first ten lines, which are occupied with the praises of some one whose name is lost.\n\nThe whole inscription consists of sixteen lines, at the eleventh of which the first complete verse is found. The record then goes on to state that \"in the great family of V\u00e1tsavya was born Suhila son of Hallan.\" Reference is made to somebody named Jayap\u00e1la, and the names of N\u00e1nika the founder of the Chandel dynasty, of Lakshma\u1e47a, Kal\u00e1la, and M\u00e1dhava occur. Dev\u00e1ja the son of Somar\u00e1ja is mentioned near the end as a skilled workman, and the inscription appears to be intended to commemorate the erection of an edifice, probably a temple, with a \"lofty steeple\" (s'ikhara).\n\n* The inscription as it now stands measures 27\" x 14\".\nNothing is known as to the original locality of this inscribed slab. Mr. F. C. Black has preserved it from further injury by fixing it carefully in the wall of the road inn below near Manora.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n6. Memo. on Bricks etc., found at Sankesur. Fatehgarh District.\u2014By H. Rivett-Carnac, Esq., F. S. A., F. R. S., &c., &c., &c.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper describes tiles and seals of baked clay, which were found by Mr. Rivett-Carnac in large quantities in the ruins near Sankesur and Behar (see General Cunningham, Arch. Survey, Vol. I., p. 371), and of which he forwarded a few specimens. The tiles are small, from 1 to 2 inches wide, and about \u00bd inch thick. They are mostly quite plain, a few are more or less ornamented; one of them bore a well-defined Maltese cross; some of them are pierced in the centre. There were also some discs of marble, crystal or other polished stone, and of various sizes (the smallest about \u00bd inch wide); only one of these (apparently of granite) showed the central hole. Mr. Carnac suggests that these discs were votive offerings at the Buddhist shrines of Sankesur; those of clay being the gifts of the poorer classes, the others those of the rich, and the perforated ones perhaps signifying that the prayer had been granted. The clay seals, also, are small, from 1 to 1\u00bd inches wide. Most of them bear an inscription, generally in the Kutila characters, but one in Gupta; containing the Buddhist creed: ye dharma\u00f1\u0101 hetuprabh\u016bs\u0101 hetum tekh\u0101m isthiganta hyasadd\u0101tth\u0101ma cha yamirodh\u0101 evam r\u0101di mah\u0101gr\u0101ma\u00f1\u0101\u1e25. In a note, contributed by Dr. Mitra, he says that these seals are well known. They were first noticed by Mr. Thomas in his paper on the ruins of Sarnath; then by General Cunningham in his \"Bhilsa Topes.\" They have been also noticed by Dr. Mitra himself in his \"Buddha Gaya,\" p. 119, &c. Two, however, of Mr. Rivett-Carnac's seals are new. One of them has the word \"of every day\" on it. The other has four letters, which, two being very doubtful, cannot be read; there are two deer on it which show that it is Buddhist.\n\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in March last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies or Editors.\n\nBerlin.

A. Smidt, Esq.\nJ. Schroder, Esq. C. J. Sheridan, Esq., C. E.\n\nMr. A. H. Anthony and Babu Uday Chand Dutt have intimated their desire to withdraw from the Society.\n\nThe Council reported that the following gentlemen had been nominated by the Council for election as Honorary Members of the Society.\n\nProfessor E. B. Cowell. Dr. J. Janssen.\nProfessor Regnand. Dr. A. G\u00fcnther.\n\nProf. H. Milne-Edwards.\n\nProfessor Edward Bayles Cowell, D. C. L., Edinburgh, is recommended in recognition of his services to the Society and to the cause of Sanskrit literature. He was elected a member of the Society on March 4th, 1857, and held the office of Philological Secretary from 1858 to 1864 when he retired from the country. When he joined the Society he had already established his reputation as an oriental scholar by his dissertation on Persian Poetry, published in the \"Oxford Essays,\" and by an edition of the Prakrit Grammar of Vararuchi with an English translation. During his stay in India he contributed several valuable papers to the Journal of the Society. He likewise edited for the Society a volume of the Taittiriya Sa\u00f1hit\u00e1 of the Black Yajur Veda, and published the texts along with English translations of the Maitri Upanishad of the Black Yajur Veda. The Kaushitaki Br\u00e4hmana Upanishad of the Rig Veda, and the Kusum\u00e1njali, an abstruse treatise on the Hindu arguments for and against the existence of the Deity. Since his retirement his interest in the labours of the Society has remained unchanged, and he has contributed largely to the elucidation of many intricate questions connected with the history of Sanskrit literature. He has published a volume in continuation of the late Dr. H. H. Wilson's translation of the Rig Veda Sa\u00f1hit\u00e1, an epitome of the several philosophical dogmas of ancient India, being a translation of the Sarvadar\u015bana Sangraha, and the text along with an English translation of the Aphorisms of S\u0101ndilya on the Hindu doctrine of faith. As a Sanskrit scholar he ranks with the foremost orientalists of Europe.\n\nProfessor Renaud is recommended in appreciation of the great services he has rendered to the cause of Semitic learning by his numerous dissertations on the literature of the Arabs, and by his researches into the Geography of Asia as known to the Arabs, and in recognition of the distinguished position he holds as an eminent Arabic scholar.\n\nAlbert Gunther, M. D., Ph. D., V. P. R. S., Keeper of the Department of Zoology in the British Museum, has chiefly devoted himself to the\nstudy of Vertebrata. His Catalogues of Reptiles and especially of Fish are amongst the most important works published by the Trustees of the British Museum. He is especially entitled to recognition in India on account of his \"Reptiles of British India,\" published by the Ray Society, a most valuable work, and the first complete monograph of any one class of Indian animals ever published.\n\nHenri Milne-Edwards, Professor of Natural History in the Museum of Natural History, Paris, Foreign Member of the Royal Geological and Zoological Societies, has long been one of the first naturalists in Europe. He has written on many subdivisions of the animal kingdom, but his best known works refer to the Crustacea and the Corals; the modern arrangement of both of which has, in great measure, been founded upon his work.\n\nM. Jules Janssen's original work as a physicist has been chiefly in connection with the Spectroscope. His earlier observations were directed to a determination of the selective absorption of the atmosphere for light and especially that of the vapour atmosphere. But his great discovery made in India, when engaged in observing the Solar eclipse of 1868, was the method of viewing the hydrogen flames of the Solar atmosphere at all times, by means of the spectroscope. This discovery was made independently and almost simultaneously, by Mr. J. Norman Lockyer. His latest discovery is perhaps even more important. By an ingenious limitation of the photogenic action of the sun, he has succeeded in photographing the solar surface with a degree of delicacy never before approached, and has thus opened out a new and most powerful method of studying the physical condition of the luminary.\n\nThe President said that the Council had also proposed to nominate Dr. Rajendralala Mitra as an Honorary Member, but Dr. Mitra had considered that by accepting the offer, he would not be in a position to do so much for the Society as at present, and had therefore begged to decline.\n\nThe Council reported that Mr. H. B. Medlicott had kindly undertaken the office of Treasurer during Mr. Beverley's absence on privilege leave.\n\nThe Secretary read a letter from Mr. H. Rivett-Carnac, C. I. E., in continuation of his first memorandum on the subject of the preservation of antiquarian remains, and in which he describes the destruction of carvings and sculptures from the ruins of Kanauj he had lately witnessed while marching between Cawnpore and Fatehgarh, where he found that the kheras or mounds with which the country is dotted were being excavated\nby a party of contractor's men in search of ballast for the new railway between Cawnpore and Fatehpur.\n\nMr. Carnac again urges the Society to address the Government of India and beg that local Governments may be requested to call the attention of officers engaged on railways and other works to the importance of preventing the destruction of ancient remains for ballast and also to encourage zemindars to preserve and submit for inspection any old figures, inscriptions or other curiosities dug up on their estates.\n\nThe Secretary added that the Council had submitted Mr. Rivett-Carnac's memorandums to Government with a recommendation that some steps should be taken to carry out his suggestion.\n\nThe Secretary announced that the Committee of the Oldham Memorial Fund had transferred the sum of Rs. 65-4-9, balance of the fund, to the Asiatic Society's Servants' Pension Fund, and read the following report of the Committee.\n\nReport of the Oldham Memorial Committee.\n\nThe Oldham Memorial Committee have the pleasure to report that the marble bust of the late Dr. Oldham, by Mr. Geflowski, was received from England in March, 1878, and is considered a good likeness.\n\nThe Committee have examined the accounts, as annexed, and find them correct.\n\nAs will be seen, there remains a balance of Rs. 65-4-9. The Committee do not think it necessary to consult the subscribers as to its disposal, as the sum is so small, but have added it to the Asiatic Society's Servants' Charitable Pension Fund in the same way as was done with the balance of the Stoliczka Memorial Fund.\n\nThe Committee have to warmly acknowledge the valuable services rendered by Dr. Dobson, in arranging for the execution of the bust, and its despatch to India.\n\nJ.

Fryer.\n\n\"In a note on page xiii, of the Preface to his 'Dictionary of the P\u00e1li Language,' the late Professor Childers records the following:\n\n'The authorship of the well known stanza asserting P\u00e1li to be the original language is still unknown. Turnour (Mah. xxvii,) says it comes from the Payoga-siddhi, a grammar of the fourteenth century; but this is a mistake, for on examining a MS. of that work I find the stanza is merely referred to, the first p\u00e1da only being quoted. It may possibly be in Moggall\u00e1na Vy\u00e1karana, a twelfth century work, but I am inclined to think it yet older. I venture to quote it here.\n\ns\u00e1 M\u00e1gadh\u00ed m\u00falabh\u00e1s\u00e1 nar\u00e1 y\u00e2y' \u00e1dikappik\u00e2\nbrahm\u00e1no c' assut\u00e1l\u00e1p\u00e1 sambuddh\u00e2 c\u00e1pi bh\u00e1sare;\nwhich means 'the Magadhese is the original language in which men of former ages and Brahma angels, and those who have never heard speech, and supreme Buddhas speak.'\n\nWith reference to the foregoing I have to state that the stanza occurs in the R\u00fapasiddhi\u2014a commentary on Kacc\u00e1yana's grammar\u2014in the comment on the first sutta of the second\u2014or N\u00e1ma\u2014book, which is as follows:\u2014\n\n\u00a7 1. jinavacanayuttam hi.\nadhik\u00e1ro 'ya\u1e41; tattha pa\u00f1cam\u00e1re jitav\u00e1 ti jino; buddho;\njinassa vacanap jinavacanap; tassa jinavacanassa yuttam, jinavacanayuttam, tepitakassa buddhavacanassa m\u00e1gadh\u00edk\u00e1ya sabh\u00e1vaniruttiy\u00e1 yuttam anur\u00fapan ev\u00e1tadam adhik\u00e1rattham veditabap.\ns\u00e1 m\u00e1gadham\u00falabh\u00e1s\u00e1 nar\u00e1 y\u00e2y' \u00e1dikappik\u00e2\nbrahm\u00e1no c' assut\u00e1l\u00e1p\u00e1 sambuddh\u00e2 c\u00e1pi bh\u00e1sare.\"\nadhi\u015b\u0101ro pana tividho, s\u012bhagatika-ma\u1e47\u1e0dukagatika-yath\u0101nupubbika-vasena; \u0101yam pana s\u012bhagatiko pubb\u0101paravilokanato, yath\u0101nupubbiko yeva v\u0101.

Moggall\u0101na lived in Ceylon during the reign of Par\u0101krama b\u0101hu I., 1153-1186 A.D. The R\u016bpasiddhi therefore could hardly have been written earlier than the thirteenth century A.D.\"\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. Rough Notes on the Distribution of the Afghan Tribes about Kandahar.\u2014By Lieut. R. C. Temple, 1st Goorkhas.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis is a very interesting paper on a subject on which every additional information must be welcome, especially at the present time. Another paper on the subject is promised by the author. The information contained in the present paper was collected by him, while he was employed in foraging in advance of General Stewart\u2019s Division during the march back from Kel\u0101t i Ghilzai to Kandahar and afterwards in taking a convoy of camels to Col. Patterson\u2019s reconnoitering expedition down the Arghis\u0101n Valley (1st to 23rd Feb.) The author found that nearly all the Afghans living in the Kandahar district are Dur\u0101nis of the Popalzais and B\u0101rakzai sections, divided into numerous septs. Of these a correct list is given supplementing the imperfections of the official one. He accounts for the frequent discrepancy in the names of the Afghan villages by the circumstance constantly met with by him, that they may be called by six different names which may be either (1), its own name, or may be (2), taken from the district or tract of land in which the village lies, or (3), from the section, or (4), subsection of the tribe which inhabits it, or (5), from the late owner, if recently dead, or (6), from the present owner.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n2. Bulandshahar Antiquities.\u2014By F. S. Browse, Esq., C.S., M.A., C.I.E.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe town of Bulandshahar is so called after the high artificial hill on which stood the old Fort. Its original name was Baran, apparently an\nabbreviation of *Ahibaran*, meaning, according to the author, \"snake fort,\" and conjectured to have been originally a stronghold of the N\u00e1ga tribe. Of its early history, however, little trustworthy is known. Gold coins, bearing Greek and P\u00e1li inscriptions, which not unfrequently used to be washed down in the rains from the high ground of the old city, show that the place at that remote period was one of considerable wealth and importance. At the time of Mahmud's invasion, in 1017, it was the seat of a Dor Raja, by name *Har Datt*. In 1194, Chandra Sen, the last of his descendants, was killed while defending the fort against the army of Sahab ud d\u00edn Muhammad Ghori. Under the Muhammedan rule every memorial of their Hindu predecessors has gradually disappeared. After a search over every part of the district, the author was only able to discover a stone bearing two inscriptions, and a few fragments of pillars and doorjambs. The inscription contains a partly illegible date, which Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra in a note contributed on the subject, conjectures to be Samvat 1180 (A.D. 1124). Most of the pillars are ascribed by Mr. Growse to the time of the Dor Rajas, in the early part of the 11th century.\n\nMr. H. H. Locke made some remarks on the pillars, and said it would be of great interest to know how the author of the very interesting paper which had just been read had arrived at his conclusion as to the date of these pillars. There was no gainsaying the evidence of inscriptions\u2014and it was more than probable that Mr. Growse had evidence as strong as an authentic inscription in support of the date which he assigned to the carvings\u2014but Mr. Locke, judging from other examples, would have named a later date for these then Mr. Growse does, and therefore thought it would be very interesting and important to know how the latter gentleman had arrived at his conclusion.\n\nThe paper, with Dr. Mitra's note, will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n3. *Note on some Mammals from Gilgit collected by Major Biddulph.*\u2014By W. T. Blanford, Esq., F.R.S.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\n4. *Notes on a Donative Inscription from Rajaurgarh near Alwar.*\u2014By R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra, LL.D., C.I.E.\n\nB\u00e1bu Harischandra of Benares has forwarded to me a facsimile of an inscription lately discovered in the neighbourhood of Alwar, together with a N\u00e1gari transcript. The locale where the record was found and the circumstances connected with its discovery are thus described by the B\u00e1bu in his letter to me. He says, \"In R\u00e1jga\u0159h Parganah there is an inacces-\nsible hill at a distance of forty miles south-west of Alwar. The hill abounds with tigers and wolves, which have been for a long time so little molested that they do not hesitate to attack men even in day-light. On the upper part of the hill some relics of an ancient city are still traceable, but it is now the site of a small village called Rajaurgarh. There are many wells in the land, which are not circular as those of the present day are, but generally of a square form, and water rests in them at the depth of eight or ten feet below the surface. Several large Buddh idols (which are unimportable) and many Siva lingas still exist there. There is 'a house still existing called the \u092c\u0938\u0940 \u0930\u093e\u0923\u093f\u0915\u093e \u092e\u0939\u0932 (Rusi R\u0101nik\u0101 Mahal), or 'the Palace of an incensed Princess' (or Russian Princess?), but there tigers whelp now. Similarly remains of other old buildings are also traceable. A fortification made of stones runs over the hill for many miles. It has a gate known as As\u00e1var\u00ed gate, with shutters in comparative good order. The gate is named after the goddess As\u00e1var\u00ed whose temple stands in its vicinity. Just close to it stands the temple to which this d\u0101na-patra belongs. There, by the order and at the expense of the Mah\u0101r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Alwar, five Br\u00e1hmans are engaged to offer their continual prayers. The Mah\u00e1deva in it is known by the name of Nilakantha, because both the Linga and the Jaladh\u00e1ri are made of blue stone. The temple is built in the old style, and the very first view of it shows its antiquity. A cowherd by chance got the inscription stone, and, thinking it to be a bijak of some money hidden under ground, because persons happened to get some old coins there, made it over to the Tahsild\u00e1r of Rajgarh, which is a railway station twenty-four miles to the south from Alwar. The Tahsild\u00e1r, imagining it to be a new thing, presented it to Thomas Cadell, Esq., V. C., the political agent at Alwar, who, with a view to get it read, sent it to Pandit R\u00fapan\u00e1r\u00e1yana, a member of the Raj Council. The Pandit, seeing the characters written with anusv\u0101ras and visargas, took it to be a Sanskrit Inscription; but he could not make it out, and returned it back, saying it was written in Maithila characters, and none but a Maithil could read it.\n\n\"By chance my friends, Pandits Bhav\u00e1nand, \u015ar\u012bdhar, Uday\u00e1nand and R\u00e1mchandra, four brothers, had been to visit the agent, who asked them whether they had seen the inscription stone? They replied that they had seen Pandit Chanchal Jh\u00e1 and Jagann\u00e1th Daftari sitting outside the bungalow, and trying to make out the inscription; but that they had not examined the inscription with a view to read it. The agent told them that as yet nobody had been able to read it, but he hoped that they would succeed. When they came outside, and saw the inscription stone, they found the m\u00e1tr\u00e1s similar to those of other Sanskrit writings; but the mode of writing was quite different to that of the present day. The inscription being writ-\nten in Sanskrit, they could read it out, and they explained the purport of it to the agent, who was very glad to hear it, and requested them to translate it into English, and, if possible, to take a print of it. Accordingly they took the inscription home, took a print of it, and translated it into English; both of which they gave over to the agent. The agent is at present at Udaypur. It is not known whether he has sent these to any press or not.\n\n\"The stone is at present with the above named Pandits. It was found in the month of Magh, 1933 Samvat.\"\n\nThe inscribed face of the stone measures $24 \\times 17$ inches, and contains 17 lines of Sanskrit in the Ku\u1e6d\u012bla character. The record opens with the name of the paramount sovereign Vijyayap\u0101la Deva, son of Kshitip\u0101la Deva, during whose reign, on Saturday the 13th of the waxing moon in the month of M\u0101gha (January\u2014February), in the Samvat year 1016 = A.D. 1071, it was executed to attest the gift of a village, named Vy\u0101ghrav\u0101\u1e6dika, with its adjoining fields to certain hermits for the worship of a lingam consecrated by the donor's mother L\u0101chchhuk\u0101, and named after her L\u0101chchhuk\u0113\u015bvara. The donor calls himself \u015ar\u012b Mathana Deva, son of the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Adhir\u0101ja \u015ar\u012b S\u0101vata, of the \u015ar\u012bhara clan of Gujjara.\n\nThe fact of the donor's giving away a village in the neighbourhood of Alwar, would imply that he was, in the fourth quarter of the 11th century, a ruler of that part of the country, and his capital was named R\u0101jyapura, the modern Pargana of R\u0101jgarh. He lived under the supremacy of the paramount sovereign Vijayap\u0101la; but no information is vouchsafed regarding that sovereign. It is well known, however, that for three centuries or more, the P\u0101la kings of Gwalior exercised supremacy over a large tract of country, including a portion of the Doab and parts of Rajput\u0101na, and it is probable that one of these was the sovereign referred to. In P\u00e8re Tiefenthaler's \"Description of India,\" a long list is given of these P\u0101la R\u0101j\u0101s, and the 67th of the list is named \"Bedjep\u00e1l;\" but he is said to have reigned at a much earlier date than 1078 A.D., and his father's name was \"Tilekp\u00e1l.\"\n\nAt the close of the grant there is a supplementary sanad by which certain market tolls are assigned for the benefit of the temple aforesaid and of some others in its neighbourhood. The assignments include a toll of 2 Vis for every bag of goods, 2 Palas of oil or ghi for every jar or leather bottle of those articles, 2 Vis for every stall or shop, and 50 leaves for every Chollika coming to the market from outside the boundary of the village. The pala is a well-known liquid measure of a little over two ounces; but what the vi (\u0935\u093f) is, I cannot make out. It appears to me to be very like an abbreviation of vi\u015bv\u0101 or \"twentieth;\" but it cannot imply the twentieth of the merchandise brought for sale, for 2 vis would amount to ten per cent.,\nlarge percentage to be assigned for the use of the temple, and quite out of keeping with the two and a half ounces of oil per jar. It could not, besides, apply to stalls and shops, for it would be absurd to suppose that a ten per cent. toll was levied on shops every month. At that rate the whole of the shop would disappear in 10 months. Some current coin is evidently meant, and if we take it to be the twentieth of a rupee or a five-pice piece, it would be near the mark. But I am not aware of any such coin having been current in the 11th century.\n\nI am equally at fault about the meaning of the word *Chollika*. The word does not occur in any Sanskrit dictionary. The word *chulli* means \"an oven,\" \"a hearth,\" or \"a funeral pile,\" but such things can form no part of a market, nor can there be any consistency in asking the owner of a hearth, or the leader of a funeral procession, to pay 50 leaves. I think the word implied an aboriginal or wild man of the woods, and every wild man who brought *sh\u00e1l* leaves for sale had to give 50 leaves for the use of the temples. Such leaves are brought by thousands to every market in the North Western Provinces in the present day, and used partly for packing small parcels, serving in this respect the purposes of brown paper of European grocers, and partly for eating from, the poorer classes not being able to afford metal plates, and earthen platters; which, according to Hindu custom, cannot be twice used for eating rice, are always expensive and cannot be kept clean for repeated use.\n\n**Translation of a S\u00e1sana from Rajaurgarh near Alwar.**\n\nSalutation to Srim\u00e1n R\u00e1m\u00e1nuja. Om! may it be auspicious. On Saturday, the 13th of the waxing moon in the month of M\u00e1gha, in the Samvat year one thousand and sixteen (in figures) S. 1016 M\u00e1gha, Sudi 13, Sani, in the prosperous and auspicious kingdom of his excellent majesty Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja and Adhir\u00e1ja, Lord Vijayap\u00e1la Deva, the successor of his excellent majesty the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja and Adhir\u00e1ja, Lord Kshitip\u00e1la Deva. On this day the prosperous lord of R\u00e1jyapura Sr\u00ed Mathana Deva, son of the great king and king of kings, Sr\u00ed S\u00e1vata, of the Sr\u00edhara clan of Gujjaras, to the officers of state, whether hereditary or temporal, and to the inhabitants, including wealthy merchants, jewellers and others, high and low, assembled in the village of Vy\u00e1ghrav\u00e1taka, accords due greetings, information, and orders. \"Be it known unto you, that knowing the body, wealth and life to be as unstable as drops of water at the points of grass-blades, and all worldly pleasures to be worthless; knowing also the immortality of good name and reputation; we have, for the augmentation of the virtue of our parents and of ourselves, and for our weal in this world as well as in the next, as also with a view to cross the worldly ocean, and to remove all\nbarriers from our way to heaven; for the daily ablution of the image of Mah\u00e1deva, named Lachchhuke\u015bvara after our mother Sr\u00ed Lachhuk\u00e1; and in order to furnish him with sandal, flower, incense offering, lamp, drink and minium; for the reparation of the image and for its supervision; and to furnish it with holy thread, and for the salary of the porters and servants attached to the establishment; on this auspicious day of the consecration of the divinity, after performing due ablution and touching water, granted, in due form in an engraved record, without any reservation, the aforesaid village of Vy\u00e1ghrav\u00e1\u1e6daka, along with all its environs, pastures, trees, and reservoirs of water, along with the right of exacting the usual shares of the produce and alms-share, as also the right of collecting the revenues, such as fines, the fixed rates, the property of those who die without heirs, along with the adjacent fields of Gujjara. Knowing this, from this day and as long as the sun and the moon will endure, let the unmolested charge of worshipping the divinity in the auspicious temple of R\u00e1jyapura remain with the pupils and their disciples of Srim\u00e1n Onk\u00e1ra S\u00edy\u00e1ch\u00e1rya of great renown and popularity, a regular performer of Vedic rites, disciple of Sr\u00edr\u00e1upa S\u00edv\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, the pupil of Sr\u00ed Kanth\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, of the temple of Gop\u00e1la Devi Tad\u00e1gapali, and the pupil of Sopuriya family, descended from Srim\u00e1n A\u00ednardaka. And let this grant be upheld by all future sovereigns, whether born in our family or of other dynasties who may reign here. They should not at all act detrimentally to this; on the contrary they should, in compliance with our behest, uphold this our pious act, for they too will thereby derive from it a share of virtue, for it has been said by Bhagav\u00e1n Vy\u00e1sa, the digester of the Vedas, 'By Sagara and many other kings the world has been ruled; to whomsoever the land belongs for the time being, to him belongs the merit of gifts of land. Aditya, Varuna, V\u00e1yu, Brahm\u00e1, Vish\u1e47u, Hut\u00e1sana and Mah\u00e1deva congratulate and regard with favour the donor of land. The donor of land lives in heaven for sixty thousand years, while the revoker of the same and the abettor thereof dwell for a like period in hell. Those virtuous people who aspire to fame, white and stainless as the moon, or long for the blandishments of celestial nymphs, never resume grants made by others, for they think the upholding of grants to be even more commendable than making such grants.' This grant was made by the king himself; it was put in writing by his son; it was proclaimed by Surapras\u00e1da, and engraved by Hari.\n\nMoreover, for the divinity above mentioned, for the four guardian divinities (Kulik\u00e1)* around him, and for Vin\u00e1yaka established within the city,\n\n* Eight classes of N\u00e1gas are usually invoked as guardian divinities, and the Kulikas are one of them.\nmarket tolls are to be assigned at the rate of 2 Vis,* as customary in h\u0101\u1e6da, for every bag of goods; 2 Palast\u2020 for every jar or leather bottle (K\u016bpaka) of oil or ghi; 2 Vis per month for every stall or shop; and 50 leaves for every Chollika\u2021 coming from outside.

J. Janssen and A. G\u00fcnther.\n\nThe following is a candidate for ballot at the next meeting\u2014\nM. Finucane, Esq., c. s., Settlement Officer to the Court of Wards Raj Darbhanga, Madhubani, proposed by G. A. Grierson, Esq., c. s., seconded by Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle.\n\nThe Chairman announced that the Council propose the following amendment to Rule 14a; that, instead of the words, \"As to the time of returning books &c.\", the words: \"for the use and general management of the Library,\" should be substituted.\n\nThe object of the amendment would be seen from the following circular which had been issued to all resident members, and he invited discussion from the members present, reminding them that under the rules a statement of any objections would have to accompany the voting papers which would be sent to all members of the Society, and stated that the question would come up again for final settlement at the August Meeting.\n\n\"In accordance with Rule 64a the Council beg to announce that they will propose to the Society at the General Meeting in June the following amendment to rule 14a; that, instead of the words \"as to the time of returning books &c.\", the words: \"for the use and general management of the Library,\" should be substituted. The first paragraph of the rule will then read thus:\u2014\n\n\"To take out books, plates, drawings and manuscripts from the Library, subject to such restrictive regulations in the case of rare and valuable books, manuscripts, &c., and to such Rules for the use and general management of the Library as may be prescribed by the Council under Rule 48, Clause (a).\"\n\n\"Instead of\n\nTo take out books, plates, drawings, and manuscripts from the Library, subject to such restrictive regulations in the case of rare and valuable books, manuscripts, &c., and to such Rules as to the time of returning books, &c., as may be prescribed by the Council under Rule 48, Clause (a).\"\n\n\"The Council propose this amendment because a Member of the Society has raised the question whether the Council have the power, under rule 48a, to enforce the Library bylaw that Members shall not be allowed to take out new books and periodicals...\"\nuntil the expiration of a month after their receipt; such bylaw being, in the opinion of the Member in question, an infringement of the privileges of Membership under Rule 14.\n\n\"It is obvious that, although the Rule 14 does not actually define the power of the Council to prescribe restrictive regulations as to the issue of ordinary books and periodicals, the spirit of the Rule, in conjunction with Rule 48a, is, that the Council are to frame such regulations as seem to them desirable for the proper management of the Library, in the interests of the Society.\n\n\"The Council have under consideration the desirability of reducing the time that weekly periodicals shall remain on the Library table, to a fortnight. They would, however, remind Members that the Society's Library is essentially a Library of reference. The Society have not the means, nor is it an object, to make it fulfill the functions of a Circulating Library or Book Club. The Council are desirous of furthering the convenience of Members as far as possible in making use of the Library; but, in view of the great risk of loss that is run in letting out unbound numbers of serial periodicals and scientific Journals, and the difficulty of replacing many of them, if lost, the Council are of opinion that the facilities for taking such from the Library should be restricted as far as possible.\"\n\nIn reply to questions from some of the members present as to whether it was to be inferred from the last paragraph of the Notice that the Council proposed to restrict the privileges of members in taking books and periodicals from the Library, the Chairman explained that the Council had no such intention, that the object of the paragraph was to remind Members of the Society that their Library was distinctively one of reference, and that therefore it was of the highest importance to preserve their series of scientific journals as perfect as possible, and to appeal to Members to bear this in mind in making use of the Library, because the breaks in series caused by the losses that would probably be entailed upon the Library by attempting to use it as a Book Club greatly impaired the special value of the Library and were exceedingly difficult to make good.\n\nAfter some discussion, the meeting unanimously approved of the proposed amendment.\n\nThe Council announced that Mr. J. C. Douglas had been appointed a member of the Finance Committee and Major H. S. Jarrett of the Philological Committee.\n\nThe Secretary reported that Mr. W. A. Bion had been confirmed in his appointment as Assistant Secretary.\n\nDr. Hoernle exhibited and described four coins, kindly presented to the Society by F. S. Growse, Esq., Magistrate of Bulandshahar. They were\nfound in Bulandshahar on the site of its old Fort, some account of which has been given by Mr. Growse in his paper on the Bulandshahar Antiquities (see Proceedings, Bengal Asiatic Society for May 1879). Two of the coins are Indo-scythian copper coins; the other two are early Hindu gold coins. Of the former, one is a round specimen of the well-known coins of Kadphises, with the head of king Hermaeus on the obverse and a standing Hercules on the reverse (see Wilson's Ar. Ant., V, 9; XI, 10). The inscription, on both sides, is too much worn to be decipherable. The other Indo-scythian coin is also a round one and belongs to Azes. It is an exact counterpart of the specimen figured in Wilson's Ar. Ant., VII, 17. The obverse has the king on horseback, the reverse a standing Minerva, both turned to the right. Of the two gold coins, one is a specimen of the so-called \"second series of Link-coins\" of Prinsep. It is in fairly good preservation. On the obverse, there is the standing figure of the king, turned to the left, dressed in a suit bedecked with jewels and consisting of a tiara with the regal fillet, short coat with pendent sleeves, and trowsers. There is a nimbus round the head; the right hand points downwards to a small fire-altar; the left arm is raised, its hand resting on a spear or standard with pennons. Over the right hand and the fire-altar there is a trident with pennons. To the right of the fire-altar, and between it and the foot of the king, there is a small mark, looking like the letters chi in ancient N\u0101gar\u012b. Between the feet of the king there is a row of dots or minute marks and above it some mark, which is almost entirely gone and now quite undistinguishable. Both these marks may be seen on the coin figured in Prinsep's Ind. Ant., XXIX, 10 (ed. Thomas). In some of the coins of the preceding series (of Vasudeva?) in the cabinet of the Society the place of the chi-mark is occupied by the initial P of PAO, and that of the illegible mark by the final O of KOPANO. This circumstance may have been the origin of the marks on the present coin. Below the left arm, and between the body of the king and the staff of his spear, there are the letters si, quite distinct, in ancient (Gupta) N\u0101gar\u012b; and below them some letter, looking like ka, but partly destroyed. On the other side of the staff, between it and the rim, there are, in large, very distinct Gupta characters, the letters shaka or shake arranged Chinese-fashion (\u0936\u0915 or \u0936\u0915). Along the rim, there runs a circle of small, connected rings. On the reverse there is a draped female figure sitting on a high-backed, four-legged throne, looking to the front, holding a cornucopia in her left and the royal fillet in her right hand; her hair is dressed with jewels, and round the head there is a nimbus. On the right, between the frame of the throne and the rim, there are four very rudely cut letters, which seem to bear a faint resemblance to the Greek characters \u03a0\u0394\u039f\u039e, which would be a remnant of the word \u0391\u03a0\u0394\u039f\u039e\u03a0\u039f or\n\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c1\u03bf, that is ardha-vira or the half male, half female \u015aiva (Parvati). The letters are evidently meant as mere ornament, and badly imitated, without understanding, from the corresponding Greek legend on Indo-Scythian coins. The real legends of the coin are not Greek, but Indian. There is no monogram on either side. Neither in Prinsep nor in Wilson is there figured any coin exactly resembling this one. The copper coin, in Prinsep, XXXI, 4, is the nearest to it. Prinsep (Vol. I, p. 387) reads the legend on the obverse, m\u0101ka.\n\nThe other gold coin is one of the so-called Gupta series and belongs to Chandragupta II. There is no specimen exactly like it, in either Prinsep or Wilson. Those nearest are Prinsep, XXX, 9, and Wilson, XVIII, 4. But on the present coin, on the obverse, the king is turned to the right, looking at his bow, while his right arm is raised, the hand holding some indistinct object; the inscription is Deva sri mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101dh\u012br\u0101ja; no monogram. The reverse is exactly like that on Prinsep, XXX, 9.; viz., Lakshmi, sitting on a lotus; left hand pointing downwards, right hand holding the royal fillet; legend sri vikrama; monogram.\n\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1. Description of some new Species of Hydroid Zoophytes from the Indian Coasts and Seas.\u2014By Dr. J. Armstrong.*\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper contains descriptions of the following new species. Lafoea elongata, found at Pigeon Island and Konkan Coast, also at Diamond Island off the coast of Pegu; Halicornaria setosa, found off Cape Negrais in 80 fathoms, Cheduba Island in 8 to 10 fathoms, off the Terrible Islands in 25 fathoms, and off Cape Comorin in 40 fathoms; Halicornaria plumosa, found off Cape Comorin in 35 to 40 fathoms, and off Cheduba Island in 10 to 15 fathoms; Thimaria compressa, found in abundance off Diamond Island and on the Konkan Coast, also off Cape Comorin; Antennella allmanni, found off Cape Comorin in 50 fathoms and off Cheduba Island in 8 to 10 fathoms; Sertularella rigosa, found off Cape Comorin in 40 fathoms and off the Arakan Coast in from 10 to 15 fathoms; Desmoscyphus humilis, found on coast of St. George's Island, West coast of India. Endendrium ramosum, found off Cape Comorin in 40 fathoms and very sparingly along the coast of Arakan in from 10 to 70 fathoms.\n\nWith the exception of a single species, all the above hydroid are calypotoblastic. The one exception is Endendrium ramosum, which is a typical gymnoblastic zoophyte, and is especially remarkable in having the gonophores borne not upon a true blastic style but upon atrophied hydrantha from which the tentacles have disappeared.\n\nThe paper will be published, with plates, in the Journal, Part II.\nNotes on the Formation of the Country passed through by the 2nd Column, Tal Chotiali Field Force, during the march from Kala Abdullah Khan in the Khojak Pass to Lugari Bar Khan, Spring of 1879.\u2014By Lieut. R. C. Temple.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe author commences his paper by describing a remarkable feature to be observed all over South Afghanistan, viz., the peculiar gradual slope or glacis leading up to the foot of the hills which encompass the numerous valleys into which the valley is split up. This slope or glacis is generally very stony and covered with detritus from the hills, and is cut up by wide shallow stony river beds, down which the water rushes with enormous force after every heavy fall of rain. It seems likely, therefore, that the slopes have been formed by excessive denudation going on in the hills in consequence of their bare and treeless condition. But it is also possible that this denudation is helped by the action of frost in the case of hills formed, as many of the ranges are, of a slaty shale which is much disintegrated and split up near the hill tops. The cold at the summits of these hills, which are about 7500 to 8000 feet above sea level, is intense, and the frost separates the shale chips to be washed down by the next shower: the appearance of the hills seems to justify this hypothesis.\n\nThe author then goes on to make some remarks on the Metals, Salt deposits, Want of Trees, Fossil remains in the Shor Valley and about the Hanokai and Han Passes, and gives a series of notes on the country along the route followed.\n\nThe paper was illustrated with a large collection of upwards of 600 specimens of soils, rocks and fossils collected on the line of march, besides some specimens of pottery, and will be published, with a map, in the Journal, Part II.\n\nMr. H. B. Medlicott remarks as follows upon Lieut. Temple's specimens:\n\n\"With Dr. Feistmantel's assistance, I have gone through Mr. Temple's specimens, with the following result.\n\n\"The fossils are exclusively tertiary, none are post-tertiary. They are mostly nummulitic; possibly all of that age. The supposed lizard (No. 203,) is a detached segment of an echinoderm.\n\n\"The rocks are mere fragments, and the great majority of them only weathered pebbles. A very large proportion of them are of such limestone, sandstone and shale as are usual in the tertiary formation.\n\n\"There is no fragment of granitic or metamorphic rock, unless 121, which is crystalline limestone, but this may be only a contact rock. The\nsame may be said of the few specimens (Nos. 35, 44, 48 and 53) of indurated silicious rock, they are of the type common at the contact of eruptive rocks. Some of them are jaspideous. Of trappean rocks there are not a few (Nos. 57, 58, 89, 94, 95, 97, 100, 130, 141, 142, 143, 146, 161, 177, 180, 185, 186) some are syenitic or dioritic (non-quartziferous) and some are earthy amygaloidal.\n\n\"The crystalline minerals are the commonest forms of quartz, calcspar and gypsum, one (No. 240) is clear white cubical rock salt.\n\n\"There is no metalliferous rock or mineral in the whole collection.\"\n\n3. A Bal\u00fachi Vocabulary with an Outline of Bal\u00fachi Grammar.\u2014By M. Longworth Dames, Esq., B. C. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe language of Bal\u00fachistan is divided into two dialects, the Northern and the Southern. The latter which is also called the Makr\u00e1n\u00ed has been lately dealt with in Major Mockler's Grammar. The present work treats of the Northern dialect, which is spoken among the Rind Bal\u00fachis living in the neighbourhood of the Bol\u00e1n Pass, in Kach\u00ed and on the Upper Sindh and South Panj\u00e1b frontiers. The difference between the two dialects is so great, that the one is almost unintelligible to the tribes speaking the other. Bal\u00fachi can hardly be called a written language. It is only within the last few years, that Bal\u00fachis have begun to write it, Persian being the ordinary medium of written communication, and the Bal\u00fachis considering their language to be merely a colloquial form of Persian. As regards vocabulary, it is a mixed language. The original old Persian stock has formed the nucleus round which the alien elements, principally Sindhi and South Panj\u00e1bi, have gathered. The present work is the first attempt to compile a full and systematical vocabulary of the Northern dialect; and hereby differs from the accounts of it by Leech in the Journal B. A. S., for 1840, Bruce in his Manual (Lahore 1869) and Gladstone in his Bil\u00fachi Manual (Lahore 1873).\n\n4. A Maithili Grammar or the Accidence of the Language of Mithil\u00e1 (North Bihar); with a brief Chrestomathy compiled from various sources.\u2014By G. A. Grierson, Esq., c. s.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nMaithil\u00ed takes its name from Mithil\u00e1, the ancient capital of the modern province of Tirhut or North Bih\u00e1r, bounded on the north and south by the Himalaya and the Ganges, and on the east and west by the Ko\u015bi and Ga\u1e47\u1e0dak respectively. It is spoken by Hindus and Muhammedans alike; alto-\ngether by upwards of 7 millions of people. It is extremely free from admixture of foreign words, being composed mainly of words of Sanskrit origin. It differs from both Hindi and Bengali, its neighbours on the west and east respectively, both in Vocabulary and Grammar, and is as much a distinct language from either as Marathi or Oriya. It is emphatically, a spoken language, possessing no literary work, beyond a history of Krishna and the songs of Vidyapati Thakur. The materials for the Grammar were obtained by the author partly from lists of grammatical forms supplied by pandits, village gurus, &c., partly they were collected by himself in his intercourse with the natives in cutcherry, &c. The Grammar is divided into 4 Parts, with an Introduction and two Appendices. Part I treats of the Alphabet, Part II, of Nouns, Adjectives and Pronouns, Part III, of the Verb, Part IV, of Indeclinables and Numerals. Appendix I gives a comparative table of Alphabets, and Appendix II, a brief Chrestomathy.\n\n5. Coins of Khusrau Shah and Kharran Malik, the Ghaznavi Kings of Lohore.\u2014By C. J. Rogers, Esq., Principal, Normal College, C. V. E. S., Amritsar.\n\n(With Plate IV.)\n\nThe first Musalman king who took up his residence in India was Khusrau Shah. The coins of this king are very rare indeed. No. 8 is one of his. It contains his name and titles \"Us Sultan ul A'zim Muizz-ud-Daulat Khusrau.\" The mark on the jhul of the bull is found also on the coins of his son Khusrau Malik. No. 2 exemplifies this.\n\nThe coins of Khusrau Malik resolve themselves into four classes. Two are of the bull type. One of these bulls has another sign, peculiar to these coins, on the jhul of the bull, with a cross for a rump mark. The other has the sign already mentioned which is probably some word in tughra. The rump mark is the same as that of the previous coin, while the coin of Khusrau Shah has a trident or lotus.\n\nA third class has on the obverse a dotted margin and on the reverse two stars, one above the other, below the inscription, as in No. 3.\n\nThe inscription on all these coins is the same \"Us Sultan ul A'zim Taj ud Daulat Khusrau Malik.\"\n\nThe fourth class is by far the most numerous. The obverse is in every case the same:\u2014a dotted margin with inscription \"Us Sultan ul A'zim Suraj ud Daulat.\" The reverse is of four different kinds, though each contains the name \"Khusrau Malik\" in a circle. Above the name, in some kinds, is an empty space as in No. 4, in some a\nCOINS OF KHUSRAU SHAH & KHARRAN MALIK.\ncrescent as in No. 5, in some few a star as in No. 6, and in some a cloud or canopy as in No. 7. Nos. 4, 6 and 7 are very rare. No. 5 is common.\n\nNo. 9 is a new type of the coins of Tuglaq Sh\u00e1h I.\n\nNo. 10 shows that he went on coining as his predecessors had done. The name of the king is on the obverse, on the reverse \"hazrat Dehli.\" No. 13 shows that Bahlol Lod\u00ed did the same. Both these types are very rare and are not in Thomas.\n\nNo. 11 was published* by Mr. Delmerick in this Journal as \"a new type.\" His specimen had no mintage on it. The present one shows that it was struck \"fi mulk i Talang\" in the year 724 A. H. I have seen several specimens of this coin. They are all deeply, but roughly cut. This is the only one I have seen with the place of mintage on it.\n\nNos. 14, 15, 16 are different types of the coins issued in the joint names of F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h and Muhammad Sh\u00e1h,\u2014the one name occupying one side \"F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h Sult\u00e1ne,\" and the other side being occupied with \"Muhammad Sh\u00e1h Sult\u00e1ne.\" Thomas calls his coin \"unique.\" P. 307, No. 262.\n\nNo. 18 is a new type of a coin of the same kings. It is the same as some in Thomas, only about one half of the weight.\n\nNo. 17 is altogether a new type of coin of F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h. Obverse:\u2014\"F\u00edroz Sult\u00e1ne.\" Reverse:\u2014\"Amir ul Momin\u00edn Ab\u00fa ul Fath.\" This coin is in the cabinet of David Ross, Esq., Traffic Manager, Scinde Punjab and Delhi Railway.\n\nNo. 12 is an unpublished type of Bahlol Lod\u00ed:\u2014Obverse, Bahlol Sh\u00e1h Sult\u00e1n. Reverse, Shahr i Jaunp\u00far 888.\n\nThe above new types of coins were all obtained in the Panj\u00e1b. Many of them are unpublished. I have not the slightest doubt that further search will give duplicates of many as yet unique coins.\n\n* J. A. S. B. Part I, Pl.

From the Collector of Karnal\u2014one gold Pagoda, and one gold Moha found in the old ruined village site of Palagramme, District Karnal.\n\nThe Secretary read an extract of a letter from Mr. Grote, dated 5th June, regarding the publication of the first part of Mr. Moore's papers on New Indian Lepidoptera from the collection of the late Mr. C. S. Atkinson, stating that it was hoped that the work would be read for publication in about a fortnight.\n\nMajor Waterhouse exhibited a copy of a new\u2014the 4th\u2014edition of the Map of Turkestan, presented to the Society, by Major-General J. T. Walker, c. b., r. e., f. r. s., Surveyor General of India\u2014under whose orders it has been compiled\u2014and read the following note upon it.\n\nOn the Fourth Edition of General Walker's Map of Turkestan, in four Sheets.\n\nIn this edition the map has been extended by one degree in latitude, both to the north and south, beyond the limits embraced in the previous edition; extension was necessary to the south, in order to include the stations of Sukkur and Jacobabad, in Upper Sind, which formed the base of the recent military operations in Southern Afghanistan; and a corresponding extension was made to the north, to preserve the symmetry of the map.\n\nSheets 1, 2 and 3 have been entirely re-drawn. Sheet 4 embraces an area for which extensive geographical additions and rectifications may be expected in the course of a year or two; besides which it contains a large amount of intricate hill-shading of the Himalayas which could not well have been re-drawn by the available agency, soon enough to permit of the publication of the map at as early a date as was desirable; it has therefore been corrected up to date, and not re-drawn, and this circumstance will readily account for its being in some parts less highly finished than the other sheets, to any person who is familiar with the process of\nphoto-zincography, by which the map has been re-produced for speedy publication.\n\nThe new matter contained in the present as compared with the previous edition, and the various sources from which it has been derived, are as follow:\n\nSheets 1 and 2 have not only been extended northwards from the 47th to the 48th parallel, but contain extensive additions, on the borders of the Caspian and Aral Seas, in Khiva and Bokhara and the Turkoman Desert and along the course of the River Oxus, and more particularly in Khokand and Hissar, the Alai Plateau, the Northern Pamir, and the independent States of Karategin and Darwaz. These have been mostly derived from the Russian Map of the Turkestan Military Circle, in 12 sheets\u2014published first at Turkestan in 1877, and afterwards with corrections, as a chromo-lithograph, at St. Petersburg in 1878\u2014and other Russian maps of which early copies were obligingly forwarded to General Walker by General Stubendorf, the Director of the Topographical Branch of the Russian War Office; something also has been obtained from Russian maps published in the 'Geographical Magazine' and from the maps accompanying Mr. Schuyler's 'Turkestan' and Captain Burnaby's 'Ride to Khiva.'\n\nIt happens by a singular coincidence that, in the primary compilation of Sheet 2, the same error was made in accepting various details given in the Russian Map of the Upper Oxus Region (1878) which were afterwards proved to be erroneous, as was made in the compilation of the map Das Quellgebiet des Oxus, in Part I of Dr. Petermann's Mittheilungen for 1879. At the time when the drawing of this sheet was commenced, both the first edition of the Turkestan Map and the Map of the Upper Oxus Region were available; the latter, being on a larger scale and much superior in finish and execution, and also being the later of the two, was accepted as accurate, pending a reference to General Stubendorf on the subject. His reply to General Walker was almost identical with his reply to the editors of the Mittheilungen which is quoted at length in that Journal; happily it was received in time to permit of the erroneous matter being expunged and replaced by correct matter before the map was sent to press, which had not been practicable in the case of the German map.\n\nIn rendering the portions of Karategin and Darwaz which are most closely adjacent to the remarkable bend in the Panja branch of the River Oxus, the work of one of the Trans-Himalayan explorers\u2014the Havildar\u2014has been more closely followed than by the compilers of the Russian maps; for, though the Havildar was not a finished surveyor, he certainly\nwent over the ground near the river, taking bearings and pacing distances, whereas the Russian surveyors had not then extended their operations anything like so far to the south.\n\nOf Sheet 3 the greater portion has been re-drawn on the basis of Major St. John's Map of Persia, with additions and corrections up to date, which were obligingly furnished by Major St. John. Major Wilson's Map of Afghanistan has been borrowed from to a large extent; and the conclusion at which he arrived, on an examination of certain documents which were lodged in the India Office\u2014after the first Afghanistan War\u2014that the longitude of Kandahar is probably some 10 to 15 miles to the east of the position hitherto assigned to it on most maps, has been accepted. Recent surveys have shown that Major Wilson is probably correct; and moreover it is known that the longitude hitherto adopted was a provisional value, chosen arbitrarily, with the intention that it should be rectified, after the reduction of Lieut. Durand's astronomical observations in 1843 for the determination of the longitude; but apparently through some oversight Lieutenant Durand's value was not employed, and the provisional value has been adopted up to the present time.\n\nColonel MacGregor's Reconnoissance across the Desert of Beluchistan; and Major Napier's Sketch of the northern Frontier of Khorassan, have been used in the compilation of Sheet 3. The recent operations of the Survey officers attached to General Stewart's Division of the Army in Afghanistan, have been available to some extent, for the purpose of adding to, and correcting the details of the routes between Khelat, Quetta and Kandahar; but the information derived from this source has as yet been very little, the greater portion of the maps not having reached the Surveyor General's Office.\n\nSheet 4 contains much new geography which has been obtained from other Survey officers with the armies in Afghanistan. An area of nearly 8,000 miles has been reconnoitered on the south-east frontier by Captains Heaviside and Holdich, while accompanying the column marching with General Biddulph from Kandahar to Dera Ghazi Khan, by the Tal-Chotiali route. A considerable area has also been surveyed in the valleys of Kurram, Khost, and Alikheyl, and generally in the country to the south of the Safed Koh Range, by Captain Woodthorpe, in connection with the movements of the column under General Roberts. And extensive additions to our knowledge of the country to the north of the Safed Koh Range, and for some distance beyond the Kabul River, have been made by Major Tanner, Captains Strahan and Leach, and Mr. G. Scott. Alterations in the delineation of the basins of the northern affluents of the Kabul River, which take their rise in the western portion of the Hindu\nKush Range, have been made on the authority of Major Wilson's Map of Afghanistan. In the region between the Kunar-Chitral River and the Indus considerable rectifications have been made, on the evidence of recent route Surveys by one of the Trans-Himalayan explorers\u2014the Mullah\u2014who has traced the Swat and the Punjkora rivers and several affluents of the Indus, to their sources in the Kohistan. The position of Tirich Mir, the highest peak yet discovered on the Hindu Kush Range, lying immediately to the north of Chitral, has been laid down from observations by Major Biddulph, who inclines, however, to the opinion that the mountain is some three or four thousand feet higher than the provisional value, 23,400, entered on the map as derived from his observations. The rendering of Kunjut and Shimshal, and the tract of country to the north of the Western arm of the Karakoram and Mustagh Range, has been greatly altered, so as to show more clearly what a large extent of terra incognita still remains to tempt any enterprising explorer\u2014be he Russian or Englishman\u2014to visit those regions. And far away to the east, between the valleys of Gangutri and Milam and along the border line between British India and Chinese Thibet, various not unimportant rectifications have been made on the basis of recent Surveys by Messrs. Ryall and Kinney.\n\nSheet 4 is now being re-drawn with a view to the publication of a new (the fifth) edition of the map, as soon as further data are available, which will probably be at no very distant date.\n\nThe present edition of the map has been wholly drawn, and also photo-zincographed, at the Head Quarters Office of the Trigonometrical Branch of the Survey Department in Dehra Dun, as were all the preceding editions.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. Description of some Stone Carvings, collected in a tour through the Doab, from Cawnpore to Mainpuri.\u2014By H. RIVETT-CARNAC, C. S., C. I. E.\n\n(With Plate V.)\n\nThe carvings and fragments of carvings submitted to the Society are a portion of those collected by me, during a tour through the Doab from Cawnpore to Mainpuri, through the well known tract, marked by the ruins of Kanouj, Sankesar, &c. The carvings are sent to demonstrate the importance of even fragments of ancient carvings being collected and preserved in the hope of obtaining therefrom some information regarding the habits, the circumstances and the state of civilisation of the people, by whom they were fashioned.\n\n(I.) The red sandstone block is a fragment, and unfortunately a small fragment only, of what must have been a remarkably well-executed figure\nof a woman. The proportions are good, and it will be noticed that the drapery has been most carefully and elaborately sculptured, the effect of the fineness and transparency of the texture of the cloth having been successfully rendered. The hand has been delicately chiselled and the whole work has been finished ad unguem. The jewelled belt round the waist must have been laboriously copied in every detail, with its beads and settings and chains and bosses, from some handsome original. This fragment would appear to belong to the period of Hindu luxury and power, immediately preceding the Muhammadan invasion. The fragment, even in its very imperfect state, conveys some idea of the beautiful clothes and the jewellery with which the women of that time were bedecked, and proves that the Hindu sculptor seven or eight hundred years ago was a proficient in his art. This fragment came out of a khera or mound at Kanouj from which bricks and stone were being collected and broken up for railway ballast. The figure had obviously been smashed by Muhammadan iconoclasts. Still what remains, I am confident, the Society will consider worthy of being preserved, fragment though it is.\n\n(II.) The second piece (Plate V) is, I think, still more remarkable. This too is unfortunately only a fragment, the Muhammadan iconoclasts having effectually demolished the greater part of it. From what remains, however, it is to be gathered that the carving, when complete, represented a figure on horseback, accompanied by two attendants. The boldness of the group and the depth of the carving are, I think, remarkable; the figures stand well out in relief, and it will be noticed that even the portions of the dress &c. in the background are carefully finished. The saddle and accoutrements are elaborately rendered in every detail. There are, it will be seen, three saddle-cloths, the one arranged above the other, partly for ornamentation and partly to protect the horse's back. The knot securing the saddle has been tied and adjusted with professional precision. The body of the horse represents an animal, in rather too good condition, perhaps, according to our ideas, but with the rounded lines which even the native potentate of the present day is glad to secure for his steed of state. The action of the horse is spirited. The rendering of the two attendants is, I think, particularly meritorious. The proportions of the figures are excellent. They too are finished ad unguem. Unfortunately both of the heads have been smashed off. But enough remains of the leading figure to trace the turn of the head and the arrangement of the hair,\n\n\"in comptum Lacaenae\n\nMore comas religata nodum\".\n\nThe whole group seems to bear traces of Greek influence, and is certainly of a type quite different from the Hindu carvings of the present day.\nThe group was obtained by me from a little shrine near the village of Makranaggar close to a khera in which the sub-contractors had been digging for railway ballast, and this group, we were told, had been dug out of the khera during the operations.\n\n(III.) The foliage and mango fruit of the fragment of what would appear to have been a portion of a large-sized carving, is rendered with more truthfulness and care than is generally met with on native sculptures of the present day.\n\nIt was found under a tree close to Gudanpur, where ballast operations under a native contractor had been in full swing for six weeks, in digging up and breaking up for ballast a khera which is supposed to represent the ruins of a palace of the Raja Bhoj, a favourite character in the traditions of this part of the country. Several miles of sandstone ballast have been supplied by this ruin alone. When I first visited the spot, about a month ago, large quantities of sandstone rubble were being dug out of the ruins; this was well adapted for ballast, and there was no sort of objection to the material being so utilised. But I saw carvings and the remains of carvings in situ. It is true that those I saw were of no value. But I found a coolie in the act of breaking up a small carved figure. It was hardly worth preserving, perhaps, but a coolie who smashed up an indifferently carved figure would hardly discriminate in the case of a valuable work of art. Unfortunately no attempt had been made, so far as I could ascertain, to make any plan of the ruin which was being demolished. I was told on the spot that an interior tank, surrounded by a number of small chambers had been come upon in the course of excavation. The whole place was in the process of being dug out, and there will soon not be a stone left. Some pieces of carving had been rescued by the villagers and placed under trees, or on platforms close by, and some of these were obtained by me and made over to the Collector for the proposed Museum. The piece of green stone, which I believe to be jade, was found here.\n\n(IV.) The large head sent herewith was obtained at Behar, near Sankesar. From its proportions it must have belonged to a colossal figure. The type of face is hardly Hindu and approaches in character to the carvings found in the Punjab, which are held to bear distinct traces of Greek influence. Perhaps the figure to which the head belongs might be found, if Behar was systematically examined.\n\nThe mounds at Behar would, I am sure, repay excavation.\n\n(V.) The little group of a man, woman and child standing under a tree, was obtained by me at Sankesar, where it was placed with other carvings and fragments of carvings near one of the chief shrines. The man's figure is particularly well sculptured. The woman, with her ornament &c., is\nrendered somewhat in detail. The grouping, the proportions and the execution of these figures is, I think the Society will agree, very superior to the Hindu art of the present day. But for the presence of the child the group might be taken to represent Adam and Eve in the garden.\n\nI believe that if fragments such as these now sent, were to be carefully collected in all Districts, some information might be obtained of the customs and the circumstances of former dynasties. The different styles of arranging the hair to which Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra, c. i. e., first drew attention in his valuable work on Orissa, is in itself alone a study among the fragments I have seen in Fatehgarh.\n\n2. Note on an Inscription from the Gate of the Krishna Dw\u00e1r\u00e1k\u00e1 Temple at G\u00e1ya.\u2014By Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra, Rai Bah\u00e1d\u00far, c. i. e.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis inscription was first seen by Dr. Mitra in 1864. General Cunningham also noticed it in 1872 and published a facsimile of it in the Archaeological Survey Reports (Vol. III, plate XXXVII.) It consists of 18 long lines in the Kutila characters; and measures 30 x 13 inches. It is in no way connected with Buddhism, nor with the temple to which it is now attached. It distinctly names Vishnu as the divinity for whom the temple which bore it was built. The dedicator of the temple is said to be Soma, a petty Zamindar, a descendant of one Vi\u015bv\u00e1ditya. The latter is said to have encouraged the study of Sahadeva's treatise on the veterinary art. Sahadeva was a twin brother of Nakula, who is known to have written a work on the diseases of horses; and it is very likely that this work also passed in the name of his twin brother. The inscription bears date, the 15th year of R\u00e1ja Naya P\u00e1la Deva. His reign began about the year 1040 (see Dr. Mitra's paper on the P\u00e1la R\u00e1jas in the J. A. S. B., 1878). His fifteenth year, accordingly, would fall about the middle of the sixth decade of the 11th century.\n\nThis paper will be published in Journal, Part I.\n\n3. The Sect of the Pr\u00e1nn\u00e1this.\u2014By F. S. Growse, Esq., B. C. S., M. A. Oxon., c. i. e.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe small and obscure sect of the Pr\u00e1nn\u00e1this is one of the few of whose literature Prof. Wilson, in his Essays on the Religions of the Hindus, was unable to furnish a specimen. This want is now supplied by Mr. Growse's publication of the text and English translation of one of the poems of Pr\u00e1nn\u00e1th himself. It is entitled Kiy\u00e1mat-n\u00e1ma, and is\nthe last and shortest of the fourteen treatises, ascribed to Pr\u00e1nn\u00e1th. It is very curious, both from the advanced liberalism of its theological ideas, and also from the uncouthness of the language, in which the construction of the sentences is purely Hindi, while the vocabulary is mainly supplied from Persian and Arabic sources. The writer, a Kshatriya by caste, lived at the beginning of the 13th century and was under the special patronage of Chhattrasal, the famous R\u00e1ja of Panna in Bandelkhand, who is commonly said by the Muhammadans to have been converted to Isl\u00e1m, though in reality he only went as far as Pr\u00e1nn\u00e1th, who endeavoured to make a compromise between the two religions.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n4. The Copper Coins of the old Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1s of Kashmir.\u2014By Chas. J. Rogers, Esq., Principal, Normal College, C. V. E. S., Amritsar.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper gives a description of 26 coins, some of which have not before been published. Most of them belong to 19, out of the list of 38 kings given in Prinsep's Tables, beginning with Avanti Verma, A. D. 875, down to Jaga Deva A. D. 1153. Two of the coins, here described, belong to kings hitherto unknown, Java Deva Deva and Bopya Deva. A third coin has not yet been identified. Nothing like a sign approaching to a date has as yet been traced on any coin.\n\nThis paper will be published, with two plates, in the Journal, Part I.\n\n5. Copper Coins of the Sultans of Kashmir.\u2014By Chas. J. Rogers, Esq., Principal, Normal College, C. V. E. S., Amritsar.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper contains the description of 12 coins, among which are several that have not before been published. They belong to ten of the Sultans, mentioned in Prinsep's Tables; beginning with Sikandar Shah A. D. 1396, down to J\u00fasaf Shah A. D. 1578. Most of them have dates, more or less distinctly legible.\n\nThis paper will be published, with one plate, in the Journal, Part I.\nLibrary,\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in June last.\n\nTransactions, Proceedings and Journals,\npresented by the respective Societies or Editors.\n\nBerlin.

Rivett-Carnac asking for information from members of the Society on the following ethnological queries put to him by Prof. Schaffhausen of Bonn.\nly that its character is of the 8th century. It may be two or three centuries later, but certainly not older. The first three lines of B are exact counterparts of A, letter for letter, but the character is much older, probably of the 5th century. It is a corrupted form of the Gupta type. I cannot read the lower three lines just now.\"\n\nMr. W. T. Blanford exhibited a specimen of Hippuritic limestone collected by Dr. Oldham of the 1st Ghurka Regiment on the route from Kandahar to the Punjab by the Tal-Chotiali route. The specimen was obtained at a place called Siahgai, evidently the Mt. Siajgai of Lieut. Temple's map, about 70 miles E. N. E. of Quetta. The specimen exhibited shews casts of the interior of two Hippurites and portions of the shell of others.\n\nThe interest attaching to the discovery is considerable. Hippurites are characteristic of the cretaceous epoch, and especially of the period of the lower chalk (Turonian) and the Hippuritic limestone, so called on account of the prevalence of this very remarkable bivalve, is largely developed in Southern Europe and South-western Asia. This rock covers a large area in Persia and is found for some distance east of Karm\u00e1n. A very small outcrop, probably referable to this formation, has been found in Sind and traces appear to occur in Tibet, north of the Himalayas. The discovery of the same rock in South-eastern Afghanistan serves somewhat to connect these isolated outliers. The rock from Siahgai is very similar to some of the Hippuritic limestone found in Persia.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. The Ravages of Rats and Mice in the Dakhan during the Harvest of 1878-79.\u2014By the Rev. S. B. Fairbank.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn this paper the author gives an account of the ravages committed by rats at the end of 1878 in the Parner, Shrigonde and Karzat taluqs and part of the Nagar taluq in the Ahmednaggar collectorate, and also in some taluqs in the Poona, Sholapur and Kaladgi collectorates and adjoining native states. These ravages were attributed by the people to the Jerboa rat (Gerbillus Indicus or G. longipes), called by the natives p\u00e1ndhar\u00e1 undir or the white rat.

Exploration of the Great Sanpo River of Tibet during 1877, in connection with the operations of the Survey of India.\u2014By Major-Genl. J. T. Walker, C. B., R. E., F. R. S.\n\n(With map. Plate VIII.)\n\nThe course of this river has been explored by a new explorer N-m-g, for a distance of about 200 miles below the town of Chetang, the lowest point previously fixed. N-m-g was employed under the immediate instructions of Lieut. Harman, R. E., who has been writing out his journals and reducing and mapping his observations; but Lieut. Harman has had his time so fully engrossed by his regular duties in connection with surveys which he is carrying on in and around Darjeeling, that he has been unable as yet to send in the full report of the explorations. The following is therefore to be regarded merely as a provisional account of them.\n\nN-m-g was deputed to Chetang, the position of which had been determined by Pandit Nain Sing in 1875. His instructions were to explore the course of the Sanpo river downwards for as great a distance as he possibly\ncould. Crossing to the north bank of the river he went along it eastwards for a distance of about 30 miles, nearly down to the point where it is joined from the north-east by a small river, called the Mikchu; here he had to leave the river, and make a considerable detour, up the Mikchu valley, and over the Lungla pass on the range which forms the eastern boundary of the Lh\u00e1sa basin, then down the valley in which the Chokorgye monastery is situated half way up and that of Thakpo at its lower end, near the town of Gyatsa-Jong on the Sanpo river; here he again struck the river which had been wending its way through the mountains for a distance of about 20 miles while he had been making a detour of over 50 miles. From Gyatsa-Jong onwards he kept to the river, until he reached Gyal Sindong, beyond which point he could not advance.\n\nAbout 30 miles below Gyatsa-Jong he crossed over to the right branch of the river near Thakpo Nongjong; this place is situated near the junction of a river from the south which is said to pass by the town of Tsari, which Lieut. Harman believes is identical with D'Anville's Cha\u00efi.\n\nUp to Gyatsa-Jong the course of the Sanpo river is fairly in accordance with the course shewn on Pandit Nain Sing's map of the country which he traversed between Lhasa and Assam, via Tawang; Nain Sing had seen the course of the river for a distance of about 30 miles below Chetang, and he had been informed that from that point onward it flows in a southeasterly direction into Assam. We now find that it does flow in a southeasterly direction, but only for a short distance beyond Gyatsa-Jong, after which its course is due east for some 50 miles and then north-east for about 80 miles. The river reaches its most northern point near the intersection of the meridian of 94\u00b0 with the parallel of 30\u00b0, about 12 miles to the north-east of a place which the explorer calls Chamkar, and which Lieut. Harman identifies with D'Anville's Tchamca.\n\nAfter attaining its most northern point the river turns due southeast, reaching Gya-la-Sindong in 15 miles, beyond which place N-m-g was not able to follow it. There, however, he saw that it flowed on for a great distance, passing through a considerable opening in the mountain ranges to the west of a high peak called Jungla, of which the bearing was 130\u00b0. Beyond this opening the river was said to pass through a country inhabited by savages into a land ruled by the British Government.\n\nAssuming the position of Gya-la-Sindong to have been fairly well determined by the explorer, its direct distance from the highest point hitherto fixed on the Dihang river, in the course of the survey operations in Assam, is only about 100 miles. The height of Gya-la-Sindong was found by the explorer to be 8000 feet, showing that the river had fallen about 3500 feet in 200 miles of distance from Chetang and leaving a de-\nscent of 7000 feet for the distance of 160 miles down to the junction of the Dihang river with the Brahmaputra; this does not give an excessive slope compared with other Himalayan rivers.\n\nOne of the most interesting results of the present exploration is, that it affords an explanation of the probable source from which the Subansiri river draws its large volume of water. The fact of its volume being so large, coupled with the erroneous information derived from Nain Sing as to the supposed south-easterly course of the Sanpo below Chetang, had given rise to a conjecture that the Subansiri was the recipient of the Sanpo. That this conjecture is also erroneous has been shown by Lieut. Harman's recent operations for measuring the discharges of the principal affluents of the Brahmaputra river, which are briefly described at pages 16 and 17 of the General Report of the Operations of the Survey of India for 1877-78, and more fully in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. XLVIII, Part II, No. 1, 1879. These operations indicate that the volume of the Dihang is from twice to three times as great as that of the Subansiri, so that of the two the Dihang has a far better claim to be the recipient stream. Still the difficulty remained of accounting for the large discharge of the Subansiri from so small a drainage area, and this difficulty is now removed, by the discovery of a large area below the great bend in the Sanpo around what may well be one of the two principal basins of the Subansiri and its affluents.\n\n3.

Notes on the Gold Coins found in the Ahin Posh Tope.\u2014By Major-General A. Cunningham, R. E., C. S. I.\n\n(With plates IX, X, XI.)\n\nWhen Dr. Hoernle wrote his notice of the gold coins found in the Ahin-posh Stupa at Jalalabad, he was not aware that the inscription on the coins of Wema Kadphises had been discussed so long ago as 1863 by Professor Dowson and myself, quite independently of each other.* Had he read our papers, he would have seen that several of his emendations of\n\n* For Professor Dowson's paper, see Royal Asiatic Society, Journal, XX, p. 239, and for my paper, see Bengal Asiatic Society, Journal, XXXII, p. 149.\nWilson's readings had been forestalled sixteen years ago, and that his proposed reading of Sagdaloga-iswara, or \"sovereign of the Sogdians,\" is quite untenable. In our readings Mr. Dowson and myself agree in all the titles, and more especially in that of Sarvalokiswara; and I pointed out that the compound letter, which Dr. Hoernle now reads as gd was to be found in such words as p\u00farva and ach\u00e1rya as well as in Sarva; and that a similar compound, rt is found in the name of Artamisiyasa. My reading of the inscription on the coins of Wema Kadphises, was as follows:\n\nMah\u00e1r\u00e1jasa r\u00e1jatir\u00e1jasa Sarvalokisurasa Mahisurasa Hima Kadphisasa tradata,\n\nand I especially noted that the two long titles were certainly intended for Sarvalokeswara and Maheswara. The only change that I would now make in this reading is in the name of the king, which I think may be read as Kathphisa, the cross over the lower limb of the ph being probably intended for the cerebral th.\n\nMr. Dowson has altogether omitted the letters immediately preceding the name of Kadphises. I have read them as Hima or Vima, and have identified this name long ago with the Greek OOHMO. But I have done more than this, I have also suggested that Wema is the true name, and that Kathphisa is only a title; and further that Wema may be identified with the great king Wen, from whom no less than ten royal families in Sogdiana and Bactriana claimed descent so late as A.D. 600. We know also that Yen and Wen are interchangeable pronunciations; from which I conclude that Wemo Kadphises, or Wema Kathphisa, is identical with the great Yu\u00eb-ti Prince Yen-Kaoching, to whom the Chinese refer the conquest of India.\n\nThe inscription on the Greek side of these coins is invariably the same: BACI\u039b\u0395\u03a5C OOHMO \u039a\u0391\u0394\u03a6\u0399\u03a7\u0397C. Dr. Hoernle thinks that the objects placed immediately under the bust are letters, and he reads them as MITAC. But in this view he is certainly mistaken, as I have examined numbers of these coins, and have now lying before me two large double stater pieces, on which there is no trace of any letters. I have always taken these shapeless objects to represent clouds, above which is seen the bust of the king.\n\nThe figure on the reverse of these coins is certainly \u015aiva himself, and not the ardhanariswara figure, half male and half female. In all the androgyne figures of \u015aiva and P\u00e1rvati that I have seen there is a marked line of difference between the two halves of the figure in the dress. But on these coins we have \u015aiva alone, clad in a dhoti, and holding a trident in his right hand, and his water-pot in his left, with the panther's skin thrown over his left arm.\nAHIN-POSH STUPA.\nCoins of Kanerki or Kanishka.\n\nThere are six coins of the great Kanishka, with various reverses, of which only one is new. Of No. XIV, with the reverse of \u039a\u0391\u039b\u0397\u039d\u0397, I possess two specimens myself. The other coins with the reverses of Miilo, Athro, and Okro are common.\n\nThe new coin bears a figure of Buddha himself standing to the front, with his alms-bowl in his left hand, and his right hand raised in the act of teaching. It is inscribed simply \u0392\u039f\u0394\u0394\u039f or Buddha. This coin is unique; but the figure of Buddha has already been made known on his copper coins, of which I possess six specimens. Two of these represent him seated, and the others standing, exactly in the same position as on this gold coin.* On these copper coins of Kanishka there is a longer inscription reading \u039a\u0391\u039a\u0391-\u039c\u0391**\u0392\u039f\u0394\u0394* which I take to be intended for \u015a\u0101kya Maha Buddha. It will be remembered that two coins of this type were obtained by General Ventura in the Great Manikyala Tope. These passed to James Prinsep, from whom I obtained one by exchange.\n\nThe coins of Kanerki differ from those of Wema Kadphises in presenting us with Greek characters only; but in two languages, Greek and Indo-Scythian. The former gives only \u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a5C \u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a9\u039d \u039a\u0391\u039d\u0397\u03a0-\u039a\u039f\u03a5, of which the other is clearly a translation with the addition of a single word at the end\u2014\u03a0\u0391\u039f\u039d\u0391\u039d\u039f \u03a0\u0391\u039f \u039a\u0391\u039d\u0397\u03a0\u039a\u0399 \u039a\u039f\u03a0\u0391\u039d\u039f. Here Rao-nano-Rao is the equivalent of \u201cKing of kings,\u201d and the last word must be a title of some kind. Dr. Hoernle thinks that \u201cthe word Korano has not yet been satisfactorily explained.\u201d He mentions that \u201cLassen takes it to be a Greek corruption of Kushana, expressing some title,\u201d while he himself inclines to identify it with the Greek Koiranas a \u201cchief,\u201d and especially a \u201cmilitary chief.\u201d\n\nIt is evident from these remarks that Dr. Hoernle has not seen my identification of the Greek Korano with the Indo-Scythian Kush\u00e1n, which was the name of the tribe to which Kanishka himself belonged. I pointed out to Lassen that as Kanishka and Huvishka became Kanerki and Hover-ki in Greek, where sh is changed to r, so the sh of Kush\u00e1n would be changed to r in Greek, and become KOPANO. But my arguments were drawn chiefly from the coins of Kozola Kadaphes or Kadphizes who takes the title of Zavu (ZAOOY) of the Kush\u00e1n. Now we learn from the Chinese that Khieu-tseu-khi (Kujula) the leader of the one tribe of Kuei-shang, absorbed the other tribes and called himself \u201cKing of the Kuei-shang.\u201d\n\n* For both seated and standing figures see my article in the Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal for 1845, p. 430, with its accompanying Plate. Three coins with the standing figure will be found in 'Ariana Antiqua,' Plate XIII, figures 1, 2, 3.\nNow the title which all the descendants of Wen bore in the 7th century A.D. is given by the Chinese as Shao-wu, which I take to be the same as the Zavu of the coins. Thus on the coins of Kozola Kadphes we have the following inscriptions:\n\nKushanasa Ya\u00fcasa Kuyula Kophasa.\n\nWhich is simply transliterated in the Greek XOPANCY ZAOOY KOZO\u039b\u0391 \u039a\u0391\u0394\u0391\u03a6\u0395C. In this rendering it is especially noticeable that where the native spelling of the name begins with kh the Greek does the same. But this would not have been the case had the word been intended for the Greek title KOIPANOY.\n\nBut this peculiar change of sh to r is not a caprice of the author of the Greek legends of the coins; but is in strict accordance with a peculiar law of the Turki language by which sh and z are changed to r. We thus see how the Zavu (ZAOOY) of Kozola Kadaphes became Rao on the coins of Kanerki; and how the titles of Koranou zavu and Rao nano Rao Korano represent in the most literal manner the title of \"King of the Kush\u00e1n,\" which the Chinese say was taken by the Indo-Scythian leader.\n\nDr. Hoernle notes that the title of Koiranos means more particularly a \"military chief.\" But this term could not have been applied to the Indo-Scythian kings, as we learn from the Chinese that somewhere about A.D. 220 the Great Yu\u00eb-ti \"put their kings to death, and substituted military chiefs.\" It seems clear, therefore, that BAC\u0399\u0391\u0395YC BAC\u0399\u0391\u0395\u03a9\u039d KANHPKOY and Rao nano Rao Kanerki Korano, could not have been a \"military chief.\"\n\nCoin of Hoverki or Huvishka.\n\nThis is a single specimen of a very common coin of Hoverki. I notice that Dr. Hoernle reads the name as Hvirk\u0131: but the common form is OOHPKI and if the first O be aspirated, the second O may stand for V. On a few coins the name is spelt OYOHPKI, which can only be intended for Huverki.\n\nRoman coins.\n\nThe three Roman coins found in the Ahin-posh Tope are of great importance in fixing a limit to the antiquity of the structure. These coins belong to Domitian, Trajan and the Empress Sabina, the wife of Hadrian. As the last only is of consequence in dealing with the date, it is necessary to ascertain as nearly as possible the period to which her coin may be assigned. On it she takes the title of Augusta, which Orosius says she received at the same time as Hadrian was called Pater Patriae, which, as we learn from his coins, took place in the very first year of his reign, or A.D. 117. We know, therefore, from this coin of Sabina that the Stupa of Ahin-\nposh cannot be dated earlier than A.D. 120, and may possibly be as late as A.D. 140.\n\nRegarding the Indo-Scythian coins, it is worthy of note that several of the specimens of Wema Kadphises are so very much worn as to have lost 10 grains in weight. Some of Kanishka's coins also are much worn, and the single specimen with Salene on the reverse has once had a ring for hanging it from the neck. The single coin of Huvishka is in very good preservation.\n\nIf we regard these Indo-Scythian coins as contemporary with those of the Roman Emperors, then Wema Kadphises cannot be placed much earlier than the reign of Domitian, or about A.D. 70 or 80, while Kanishka and Huvishka would be assigned to 100 and 130 A.D. But I do not consider that there is any absolute necessity for making these Indo-Scythian Princes contemporary with the building of the Stupa. From all that I have seen of their gold coins I am inclined to think that they must have continued in circulation for more than a century before the issue of the coinage of the later Princes bearing Sanskrit letters. This view is strongly supported by the statements of the Chinese authorities which place the assumption of supreme power by the \"king of the Kushans\" not later than B.C. 26; and though they say that he was 80 years of age when he died, it is clear that his son Yen-Kaoching, or Wema Kadphises, ought to have succeeded to the throne before 25 A.D.\n\nAmongst the plaster fragments from the Ahin-posh Stupa which I have lately received there is one which, in the absence of the coins, would be sufficient to prove that the Tope was built during the period of Roman ascendancy. This fragment is the corner of a Roman Ionic capital. The volute is there, although it has no projection, but the capital is exactly the same on the two adjacent faces, which agrees with the Roman Ionic order, and differs entirely from the Greek. Apparently the whole of the pilasters of the Stupa must have been of this style, as the size of the capital exactly fits their shafts. In the accompanying Plate (see Plate XI) I have given a restored sketch of this capital with the base of one of the actual pilasters of the Stupa, as they now stand.\n\nIn the same Plate I have inserted several other fragments, some of which I have been able to restore as small examples in plaster of the Indo-Persian and Indo-Corinthian Pillars. Amongst the fragments also there are two acanthus leaves, each with a figure of Buddha seated upon it, as in the fine stone capitals which I have already made known. There are many pieces of large leaves, and of small flowered ornament; but I have found it impossible to fit any two of them together. The stucco of all these fragments is remarkably hard and heavy. All the small pieces were made in\nmoulds, and laid upon coarse canvas cloth to set. This was most probably done intentionally, as the rough back of the cast would adhere more firmly to the wall when it came to be fixed.\n\nDr. Hoernle said\u2014\n\nThe principal objections of Major-Genl. A. Cunningham to my notices of the coins seem to be those referring to the interpretation of the Arian Pali legend on the coins of Kadphises, and of the word Korano on the coins of Kanerki. As to the first, I did not claim the interpretation given by me either as my own or as something new. I mentioned it as being the best of the interpretations hitherto given, and I took it in the main from E. Thomas, who, as I said, does not mention its author. I did not know then, that it was substantially the one given by Genl. Cunningham. I sincerely regret the circumstance; as I should not wish to appear to fail in rendering to Genl. Cunningham that high consideration to which, on account of his long-continued and very successful labours in the cause of Archaeological Science, he is so fully entitled at the hands of all who follow similar pursuits. My contribution consisted in the reading of sagda for sarva. The latter, I admit, accords well with the characters as traced on coins Nos. I to IX. But on No. X the conjunct is traced differently. They may be merely two different forms of the same conjunct (rv). In any case the variety is worth noting.\n\nAs to Korano, I was not unaware of the explanation referred to by Genl. Cunningham. It was in my mind, when I wrote the remark about Lassen. I took it from Lassen, who, I think, omits to mention that he had it from Genl. Cunningham. I can only repeat my sincere regret, that I was misinformed as to the authorship of the explanation. But I must still think, as I thought then, that the identification of Korano with Kushano has not been satisfactorily made out. I do not say that the identification of Korano with Koiranos is quite satisfactory either. I only ventured to express the opinion, that the latter identification may yet prove to be correct. The mainstay of the other theory appears to be a certain assumed \"peculiar law of the Turki language by which sh and z are changed to r.\" It is not quite clear, whether this means that what is sh or z in Turki becomes r in Greek; or what is r in Turki becomes sh or z in Pali; probably the former. In either case it does not seem to me, that we really know what the Turki sound was. We have the corresponding sets of names: Kanerki, Hverki and Kanishka, Huvishka. Of these, I suppose, the former is the Greek, the latter the Indian equivalent of a Turki name; and clearly the Greek r corresponds to the Indian sh; but what the Turki sound may have been, which they both equally represent, it seems to me, we do not know. But admitting that law for the sake of argument,\nthe example just quoted would prove the law only with regard to the interchange of a conjunct sh and r; but not as regards single medial or single initial sh and r. In Kushana = Korano, the letters in question are single medial; in zavu = r\u00e1o they are single initial. Letters in such different positions may not, prim\u00e2 facie, be treated alike. But further, zavu = r\u00e1o does not appear to me to be an illustration of the law at all. Z\u00e1vu, I suppose, must represent a Turki word; so does r\u00e1o, if it be identical with z\u00e1vu. Now as far as I know, both zavu and r\u00e1o always occur in legends written in Greek characters. It would appear then, that in this case the Turki initial sound, whatever it was, became in Greek (i.e., when it was expressed by a Greek letter) z at an earlier period, and r at a later period. In the Arian Pali the word appears in the form ya\u00fcasa; so that we should get here three interchangeable letters (when single initial), viz., the two Greek z and r and the (Indian or) Pali y, all three equally representing some unknown Turki sound. Or again, if it be said, that r\u00e1o though written in Greek, gives the Indian pronunciation of the same Turki word, which by the Greeks was pronounced and written zavu;\u2014in this case we have an Indian r interchangeable with a Greek z, both representing some unknown Turki sound (besides being equivalent to a Pali y); that is, we have a case precisely the reverse of that seen in Kanishka = Kanerki. Add to this, that it does not seem probable, that r\u00e1o, standing as it does in close connexion with raonano, should not be the well-known Indian word r\u00e1o, but another form of zavu. But whether zavu = rao be or be not true; it does not strictly prove the case of Kushana = Korano; in so far as the letters do not occupy analogous positions in the two sets of words. I may add that supposing Korano to be Kush\u00e1na, it seems strange that the word does not occur in the titles of Kadphises, while it occurs in those of his predecessor (Kadaphes) and his successors Kanerki and Hverki; yet all belong to the same tribe. If Kadphises dropped it as unnecessary, why did his successors revert to it? I do not deny that the identification of Kush\u00e1na with Korano may yet be proved to be correct; it only seems to me that the evidence hitherto produced does not warrant it. On the other hand, I confess, I cannot understand, why a great king like Kanerki should not have borne the lesser title of \"military chief,\" beside the more imposing \"king of kings\"; just as, nowadays, I believe Kh\u00e1n may be found joined with Sh\u00e1h, or the like. This is not incompatible with the fact, that in later times there were not allowed to be any kings, but only military chiefs.\n\nThe remaining points are of less importance. It is very possible that the obscure marks under the bust of Kadphises represent clouds. If so, their apparent resemblance to Greek letters on two of the coins is merely a curious accident. On this point as well as on the following, General\nCunningham's wider experience of such coins must be decisive. I did not, however, ascribe the androgyne figure of Siva to Nos. I\u2014IX, but only to No. X.\n\nNo. XIV, with CA\u039bHNH, is not a unique, as General Cunningham himself possesses two specimens; one of which, as I have since been informed by him, is in even better preservation than the one found in the Abin-Posh Tope. I cannot, however, make out, whether or not it has been also published. If not, its publication and description now will be welcome to Numismatists.\n\nThe name OOHPKI I transliterated Hvirki, because I took the first O to represent the aspirate consonant h, and the second O the semivowel v, that is, OO to represent the conjunct consonant hv. Such a conjunct would naturally admit of the slight variations huv or hov, as in the form OYOHPKI.\n\nAs to the age of the Abin-Posh Tope, General Cunningham places it in the first half of the 2nd century A.D. I was inclined to ascribe it to the first half of the 3rd century, principally to allow time for the travelling of the Roman coins to Afghanistan and their wear and tear; the SABINA is considerably worn. I do not think we ought to reduce this time too much. But the margin allowed by me may have been too large. Perhaps the 2nd half of the 2nd century A.D. will be a safe date.\n\n5. A Translation of a Copper-Plate Inscription from Nirmand, in Kulu, with a note on the same.\u2014By R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra, R\u00e1\u00ed Bah\u00e1dur, C. I. E., LL. D.\n\nIn May, 1878, Major W. R. M. Holroyd, Director of Public Instruction, Panjab, forwarded to the Society a photograph of a copper-plate grant found in the temple of Parashur\u00e1ma at Nirmand, in Kulu, together with reports on that sanctuary by Messrs. Lyall and Clarke. The photograph, however, was too indistinct to be easily read, I therefore requested a sight of the original, which he subsequently favoured me with. The plate measures 18 x 8 inches. Its left hand corners are broken, the right hand ones rounded, the margins are irregular, and the surface uneven, showing that very little care was taken to prepare it for inscription. In the middle of both the upper and the lower edge, there is a hole for a ring which probably bore the donor's seal and another plate intended to serve as a cover for the inscribed face. The letters on the muniment are but slightly scratched, and very shallow and indistinct.\n\nThe inscription extends to sixteen lines, inscribed longitudinally. The letters at the beginning of the first three lines as also a few here and there, are obliterated, and the last two lines are unintelligible. The rest, however, is clear enough, and easily read. The letters are of the Gupta type,\nand must date from the 4th or the 5th century A.D. There is, however, no date in the record to verify this conjecture.\n\nThe purport of the document is the grant of a village named S\u00falisa to a Br\u00e1hman of the School of the Atharva Veda, for the use of a temple dedicated to S'iva, by a queen named Mihiralakshmi. Her son Samudrasena is the donor. He was a Br\u00e1hman, who assumed to himself the title of Mah\u00e1s\u00e1mana, \"great commander,\" and Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja, \"great king;\" these titles are also assigned to three of his ancestors, whose names are, in the ascending series, (1) Ravisena, (2) Sanjayasena, (3) Varu\u1e47asena. Who these worthies were I cannot ascertain. They were probably petty chieftains of the Panjab, where even at that early date Linga worship had become widely prevalent.\n\nTranslation.\n\nBorn in the year \u2014\u2014 of the celebrated king, of him, whose glorious deeds had spread far to the four oceans, whose feet had become replented with the reflection of the crown-jewels on the bended heads of many chiefs of great armies, who had celebrated great sacrifices, of the mighty commander and great king S'ri Varu\u1e47asena. His son and successor, born of her majesty Prav\u00e1l\u00edka, the great goddess, (was) his father's rival in merit, the mighty commander, and great king S'ri Sanjayasena. His son and successor, born of her majesty S'\u00edkharasv\u00e1min\u00ed, the great goddess, (was) the hero of a hundred battles, the mighty commander, and great king S'ri Ravisena. His son and successor, born of her majesty S'ri Mihiralakshmi, the great goddess, (was) the delighter of mankind like the autumnal moon, the bestower of gifts to those who are overpowered by powerful enemies, the kind to the poor, the merciful to the decrepit, the great devotee of Mahesvara, the great Br\u00e1hman, the devoted friend, the mighty commander, and great king S'ri Samudrasena. He, for the enhancement of the virtue of his mother Mihiralakshmi, and for the service of the lord, the destroyer of Tripura, the giver of light to the world, the beneficent to those who bow to him, * * * the divinity established at Kapiles'vara, and named after his mother Mihires'vara, alias Kap\u00e1les'vara, for his daily supply of sacrifices, boiled rice, offerings, flower garlands, incense, aromatics, lamps, and for occasional repairs, to Stoma, a Br\u00e1hman of the school of the Atharva Veda * * * has granted, for the period of the duration of the sun, the moon and the stars, the village of S\u00falisa, extending as far as the dependencies*\n\n* The boundaries described are unintelligible to me. The word Ku\u1e6dumba is in Sanskrit usually employed to indicate a kinsman, it does not mean a dependency in the sense of an adjoining piece of land, but it has been repeatedly so used in the text as to leave me no alternative but to use it in the latter sense. The names of the places are such as to be quite unintelligible.\nof Vakkhalika in Navavaidila, including the grazing ground of Paribhuta in the dependency of Phakkasvat\u00e1l\u00e1pur, and the dependencies of Salabha, as also the ground in the village of S\u00falisa presented by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Sarvadharma, the first founder of (the temple of) Kap\u00e1les'vara, and the plot of ground granted by my mother Mihiralakshm\u00ed, with all its level lands, waters and jungles, along with its inhabitants, its hills, its boundaries, its grass and timber, its water-courses, and religious buildings. Knowing this it should be the duty of (all future) kings and their dependants, whether of my kingdom or otherwise, for the good of all to uphold this (grant); for whoever will undo, or set it aside, or rob it, will be guilty of the five great sins as well as of all minor sins. It has been said, \"Many kings including Sagara and others, have owned the earth: to whomsoever the earth belongs for the time being, to him belongs the fruits (of such gifts). The donor of land enjoys heaven for sixty thousand years, and for so many years the destroyer and resumer thereof dwells in hell. Whosoever resumes land, whether given by himself or by another, is born a maggot in ordure for sixty thousand years.\" This was written in the presence of Nihilapati and Kus'alaprak\u00e1s'a, by Udyot\u00e1rka.

Coins of Ghi\u00e1s-ud-din and Mu\u2019az-ud-din-bin-S\u00e1m.\u2014By Dr. C. L. Stulpnagel, Professor, Government College, Lahore.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper begins with a brief historical notice of Ghi\u00e1s-ud-din of Ghor and his younger brother Mu\u2019az-ud-din, the first Path\u00e1n king of Delhi. It then describes eight silver coins, bearing the joint names of those two rulers. One of them, dated 597, closely resembles No. 1, Pl. I, in Thomas' Path\u00e1n Kings of Delhi, differing only in bearing the date on the Obverse. Two others, dated 596, resemble No. 35, Pl. XX, in Wilson's Ariana Antiqua. The remaining five coins have never before been described and are quite of a new type. They are binominal; weight 75-77 grains. The area on either side is a square composed of double lines, with the inscription arranged in five lines. The enclosing margin, in four sections, is bounded by double circles. They are dated 596, 597 and 598 A. H. None contains the place of mintage.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n* \u0938\u092e\u094b\u0926\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0932 (?) \u2020 \u0938\u093e\u0907\u0928\n7. Notes on a Collection of Reptiles and Frogs from the neighbourhood of Ellore and Dumagudem.\u2014By W. T Blanford, A. R. S. M., F. R. S., F. G. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn this paper 33 species of reptiles and 7 frogs are enumerated. They were collected on the God\u00e1vari, near Dumagudem (the engineering station at the first barrier) or between Dumagudem and Ellore, in the months of February, March, April and May, 1871. The new species were described by Dr. Stoliczka and some notes have been published, but others remain, and as these throw some light on geographical distribution or on the habits and structure of the animals, they are included in the present paper. The list of lizards (15 species) is doubtless much more nearly complete than that of the Ophidia and Batrachia.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\n8. Notes on a Collection of Reptiles made at Ajmere, in R\u00e1jp\u00fat\u00e1na, by Major O. B. St. John, R. E.\u2014By W. T. Blanford, A. R. S. M., F. R. S., F. G. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn this paper 24 species of reptiles collected or observed by Major St. John at Ajmere, are enumerated. The most interesting are a Varanus, supposed to be a variety of V. lunatus, with reference to which the distinctions between V. drac\u00e9na and V. lunatus are discussed; Ophiops microlepis; Euprepes monticola, (proposed to be re-named E. guentheri, as the original name is misleading); Hemidactylus triedrus (?); Cynophis helena and Python molurus. It was not previously known that the two last named genera were found in Central India.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\n9. Notes on Reptiles.\u2014By W. T. Blanford, A. R. S. M., F. R. S., F. G. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper contains a few desultory notes on various species of lizards and snakes, collected in different parts of India and the neighbouring countries. The only form described as new is a species of Hypsirhina from Pegu, thus distinguished.\n\nHypsirhina maculata, sp. nov. Near H. Chinensis, but differing in having 25 rows of scales instead of 23 and only 125 ventrals. Head short, snout blunt, truncated, tail compressed. The prefrontal is rather\nsmaller than either of the postfrontals; praecocular 1; postoculars 2. Colour ashy brown with a row of large irregular black spots down the back and another rather smaller row on each side; under parts whitish with a dusk band down each side of the ventral shield.\n\nThe single specimen examined is 12 inches long and was sent from Bassein in Pegu by Captain Spearman.\n\nMajor Waterhouse said that before the meeting closed he wished to say a few words, to express the regret of the Society that they were about to lose the services of their President, Mr. W. T. Blanford, who was going on leave to Europe almost immediately, and this was the last occasion on which he would be present among them for some time. He need not enlarge upon Mr. Blanford's labours and the support he had given to the Society during his long connection with it, as they were sufficiently evidenced by the number of papers from his pen that had been published in the Society's Journal. But he could not allow Mr. Blanford to leave without a warm acknowledgment of the cordial help he, as Secretary, had always received from him, and of the care and attention he had devoted to the interests of the Society during the time he had been President. He would therefore beg to move that the thanks of the Society be given to Mr. Blanford for his services as President.\n\nThe vote was carried unanimously.\n\nThe receipt of the following communications was announced:\n\nGeographical Information regarding the Kirghiz Steppes and country of Turkistan, afforded by the Book of the Great Survey.\n\nAlphabetical Index to the Geographical Names in the Kirghiz Steppes and in the country of Turkistan which are contained in the Book of the Great Survey.\n\nInformation regarding the Freezing and Thawing of the Waters of the River Yenisei below the town of Yeniscisk.\n\nSketch of the Geographical Investigations in Asiatic Russia.

D.*\n\nThree months ago I received from Mr. E. J. Barton, Collector of Gay\u0101, an ink impression of an inscription existing on the gate of the Krishna-Dvarak\u0101 temple in the neighbourhood of the Vishnupad at Gay\u0101. In forwarding it, Mr. Barton said: \"It appears that in the Buddhistic times, formerly there was a temple in which there were images of Krishna and Mah\u00e1deo. Fifty years ago it was pulled down by one D\u00e1modar Dhokri Gyaw\u00e1l, and a new edifice built in its place. Many Br\u00e1hmans were sent for, and asked to decipher the inscription, which they could not do. I shall be much obliged if you can favour me with a translation of it.\" The inscription was not new to me, as I had seen it in 1864, and brought a facsimile of it. I did not, however, notice it, as my facsimile was very unsatisfactory, and I hoped to visit the place again and read the record in situ. General Cunningham noticed it in 1872, and published a facsimile in the third volume of the 'Archaeological Survey Reports' (plate XXXVII). His account of it runs thus: \"The inscription consists of 18 long lines of well-cut Ku\u1e6dila characters. It opens with the invocation\u2014Aum namo Bhagavate V\u00e1sudev\u00e1ya, and ends with Kirtti. Near the end of the last line is found the R\u00e1j\u00e1's name, Sr\u00ed Naya P\u00e1la Deva, and the year of his reign, da\u015bapancha Samvatsare, the 15th year. This inscription, with the exception of a few slight injuries in the middle, is in excellent preservation, and is a fine specimen of sculptured lettering. As it is not mentioned by Buchanan in his account of the temple of Krishna Dvarak\u0101, it was most probably discovered after his time; but under any circumstances it has no connexion with the temple to which it is now attached.\"\n\nJudging from the reduced facsimile published by General Cunningham, and the ink impressions taken by me and by Mr. Barton, the record appears to be far from being \"in excellent preservation.\" There are breaks in almost every line, and lines 10 to 15 are all but wholly illegible, my reading and translation of the record are, therefore, very fragmentary, and far from being satisfactory. As the record, however, is of the time of the P\u00e1la R\u00e1j\u00e1s of the 11th century and bears a date, it is worthy of preservation even in its fragmentary state.\n\nThe idea of its being a Buddhist record has arisen from its being connected with the Buddhist P\u00e1las; but from what I have been able to make of it, it has nothing to do with Buddhism. It opens with an invocation to V\u00e1sudeva, or Krishna, and distinctly names Vishnu as the divinity for whom the temple which bore it was built. It goes further, and mentions the blue colour and the yellow raiment of the divinity. Around this temple\n\n* Read at the July Meeting.\nthere were several minor ones, erected at the same time for the accommodation of lingams.\n\nThe dedicator of the temple was one Soma, a petty zamind\u00e1r, who could venture to assume only the very moderate and equivocal title of adhipa. His genealogy as given in the record included the names of several generations; but, six lines in the middle being illegible, I cannot guess how many names have been lost. The founder of the family was an adorer of \u015aiva, but his name, apparently one of two syllables, is illegible. His son was \u015a\u00fadraka, and grandson Visv\u00e1ditya. Soma was the descendant of the last, some unknown generations removed.\n\nThe only remarkable circumstance connected with the last was the encouragement he gave to the study of Sahadeva's treatise on the veterinary art. Whether Sahadeva wrote anything himself on the subject or not, does not appear. I have by me two codices of a work on the diseases of horses by Nakula, and have seen the treatise quoted in other works on the subject, but I have never heard of Sahadeva having been an author. He was, however, the twin brother of Nakula, and the two were the natural sons of the celestial veterinary surgeons, the two A\u015bvins, and it is very likely that the work of Nakula also passed in the name of his twin brother.\n\nAccording to the calculations published by me in my paper on the P\u00e1la R\u00e1j\u00e1s (Journal for 1878) Nayap\u00e1la began his reign about the year 1040 A.D., immediately after Mahip\u00e1la, and was the person from whom Vijayasena wrested the kingdom of Northern Bengal. The fifteenth year of his reign fell in the middle of the sixth decade of the 11th century.\n\nThe engraver of the record was one S\u00e1thhasoma, and the size of it is 30 \u00d7 13 inches.\n\nTranslation.\n\nLine 1. Om. Salutation to the Lord V\u00e1sudeva. May that Vish\u1e47u, whose body is as resplendent as a multitude of new-blown blue lotuses, whose yellow robe is charmingly bright like gold, (whose praise) is sung \u2014\u2014\u2014 (preserve) you.\n\n2. Having made the Br\u00e1hmans happy with whatever they wanted, the lord of the people, adorned with every good quality, and residing with the highest glory as if in heaven, himself prepared a material image of Vish\u1e47u, and unbarred the gate of salvation by high temples, charmingly white as the cloud of autumn.\n\n3. They sing \u2014\u2014\u2014 Resounding the loud voice of the Br\u00e1hmans reciting the Vedas \u2014\u2014\u2014 further, the air was darkened by volumes of smoke emanating from the incessant homa offerings. Where virtue \u2014\u2014\u2014\n4. has found an asylum from the dreadful fear of Kali in this age. With highly-prized social qualities, exquisitely beautiful, the noble Br\u00e1hman\n\n5. He, who was the noblest of Br\u00e1hmans, because stainless, (or who bears on his head a stainless moon,) who was adorned with various ornaments, (or profusely smeared with ashes,) who was the adorer (or beloved) of the daughter of the mountain king (Durg\u00e1), was named \u2014\u2014\u2014 With many unrivalled lofty temples the source of three-fold blessings dispersed in various parts\n\n6. of the earth, and resplendent as the nectariferous light of the autumn, his glory was enveloped. Of him was born S\u00fadraka, the delight of Br\u00e1hmans and his dependants, himself dependent on none, (or master of the twice-born (bird), the son of Vinat\u00e1, and (the possessed of Lakshm\u00ed,) the protected of Lakshm\u00ed, who was like unto the enemy of Mura (Krishna).\n\n7. By his fame, white as the Kunda flower seen in a distant garden, in the autumn season, the surface of the three regions was filled as with camphor, or smeared as with sandal-paste, or inundated as with the waves of the milky ocean.\n\n8. True religion \u2014\u2014\u2014 good sense, as that of the priest of the gods, \u2014\u2014\u2014 resplendent with glory. These were his qualities. Vi\u015bv\u00e1ditya was born his son.\n\n9. And in him every thing found an asylum, \u2014\u2014\u2014 manly glory like the rising sun \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10 to 15. (Illegible except a few words here and there.)\n\n16. Pressing down the majesty of the (highest) peak of the Kail\u00e1sa mountain, his glory was ascendant, his fame was spotless as the driven snow, his body was comparable to the moon. Where, by the spotless rays of the autumnal moon on the top of the lofty peak \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n17. The treatise of Sahadeva, the veterinary surgeon, his work on the saving of life, which is like a mistress in the heart of a good man who is perfect in love, friendship, and pleasure. The self-earned glory of the king Sr\u00ed Soma\n\n18. was made manifest by the clever artist S\u00e1thhasoma. When the weight of the empire of the whole earth was borne by Sr\u00ed Nayap\u00e1la Deva, in the year ten and five (fifteen) of his reign (samvatasare) this accomplished noble deed was recorded.\n\n* The matter of this and the following line is very obscure owing to the epithets used having been designed to serve as double entendre applying once to Siva and Vishnu and next to the founder of the

regarding the Kirghiz Steppes and Country of Turkistan, afforded by the Book of the Great Survey.* Translated from the Russian by Captain W. E. Gowan, H. M.'s Indian Army.\n\nThe relations of our fatherland with the country of Turkistan are very ancient, for they date from a period prior to the formation of what is now the Russian Monarchy. The numerous hoards of Asiatic coins, relating to times between the 7th and the beginning of the 11th century (not later than the year 1012), that have been found in Northern Russia, in the tract of country stretching from the province of Kazan, (in which dwelt the Bulgarians of the Volga,) to the Baltic Sea and along the shores of that sea, testify that, during this period, an active trade was carried on between Central Asia and Northern Europe through the country which is now called Russia.\u2020 Some have supposed that this trade altogether ceased in the beginning of the 11th century in consequence of the fall of the Khazai Empire, which possessed the low lands of the Volga; a fall which followed the defeat of the Khazai Army by the Russian Grand Duke Sviatoslaf in the year 969. But in reality this trade did not entirely cease, it merely stood still and grew slack. For, at any rate, in the 12th and 13th centuries Khivan and Boukharian caravans made their way into Russia.\u2021 To our trade relations with Central Asia there were added, from the\n\n* Taken from Part I of Vol. XIV, of \"Proceedings of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society.\"\n\n\u2020 \"Russia and Asia\" by V.

But with the throwing off of that yoke, the confines of our Empire advanced with swift strides and with that extension increased the influence of Russia in the East. In the 16th century the Government of Moscow subdued Kazan (1552) and Astrakhan. Since then the free Cossacks, by moving from the valley of the Don and settling on the Volga, the Yaik (1580), the Teruk and in Siberia, have extended still more the confines of Russia.\n\nOur steady connection, both mercantile and political, with Central Asia has in the course of several centuries given us the power to enlarge by degrees the circle of our geographical knowledge of that part of the world. We have learnt much by questioning the natives of the countries of Asia both far and near who have visited us, but we have learnt still more from the journeys to such lands of our own countrymen. We, unfortunately, are not in possession of complete knowledge of all these journeys, much less of the geographical results of each of them. We therefore are not able to follow, step by step, the gradual collection of Russian geographical knowledge regarding Central Asia. Nevertheless we do possess a sufficiently full treatise of the knowledge obtained in the 16th century. This treatise must be reckoned the first complete and purely geographical work put together in Russia. We allude to the Chart of the entire Sovereignty of Moscow and of the adjacent countries, called \"the Great Survey,\" and to the compilation explanatory of the Chart entitled \"the Book of the Great Survey.\" The Chart has not come down to us, but the Book has been printed several times.\n\nIn the preface to the last edition of the Book of the Great Survey,\u2020 Spasski furnishes particulars as to the date of the completion of the Chart and of the explanatory book and of its later editions. The beginning of the Survey relates to the reign of John IV, who \"in the year 1552 ordered the land to be measured and a survey of his kingdom to be made.\"\u2021 In the time of Boris Godoonoff, that is, in the last years of the 16th century, the Survey was enlarged, and during the reign of Michael Theodorovitch, or about the year 1627, the Ancient Survey \"fell into complete disorder, so that henceforth it was not possible to determine the borders of the country\n\n* Amongst the number of such travels, the journey to the Khanates of Khiva and Boukhara of the Englishman Jenkinson in 1558-59 cannot of course be reckoned, even though it was carried out from Moscow, and this because it belongs more to Europe than to Russia. If moreover it had an influence on the circle of our information regarding Central Asia, that influence was very limited.\n\n\u2020 The Book of the Great Survey spoken of was issued, under the auspices of the Imperial Society for inquiring into the History and Antiquity of Russia, by Spasski. Moscow, 1846.\n\n\u2021 History of Russia by Tatishsheff, Vol. I, page 506.\nby an examination of it.\" It then became indispensable \"by adhering to the measurements of the old Survey to make out a new Chart of the entire Sovereignty of Moscow and of all the districts of the kingdom.\" It was thus that the Book of the Great Survey came to be compiled, a work which, as already has been said, is explanatory of the Chart. Both on the Chart and in the Book \"the standard of measurement is calculated in versts.\" In the year 1680 the Survey was made afresh, with such amplifications as the then condition of Russia required. Later on, that is, in the year 1773, there was issued a work by M. N. I. Novikoff, entitled \"Ancient Russian Hydrography.\" Again, in the year 1792 there appeared a description of the Survey of the year 1627. This was called \"Book to accompany the Great Survey.\" In 1832, M. Yazikoff published first editions of both the two works last mentioned. Spasski, in his edition of 1846 (see note \u2020, p. 223), availed himself not only of these publications, but also of eight manuscripts published during the close of the 17th century, i.e., after the year 1680. All existing differences between the printed editions and those in manuscript in relation to proper names, number of versts, omissions, additions, &c., he has noticed in the observations at foot of the text, whilst the explanations concerning the various subjects mentioned in the text have been inserted at the end of the book.\n\nRegarding the scale of measurements, Spasski is of opinion that the versts of the Great Survey do not always agree with the modern versts of 500 \"sajens,\"* and that the former may in some cases measure as much as 700 and 1000 \"sajens,\" and hence they should be corrected by copyists according to the more modern scale. When expressing this opinion, Spasski evidently knew nothing about the researches of Booktoff into the ancient Russian linear and itinerary\u2020 measurements, in which it is shewn that our verst in days of yore was made up of 500 sajens of 3 arshins or 7 feet.\n\nThe information regarding the Kirghiz Steppes and the Country of Turkistan takes up nearly a whole chapter (pp. 69-76) of the Book of the Great Survey. On p. 158 we find \"hordes of nomad Cossacks, the land of Urgentch and the land of Boukhara mixed up with the river Yaik.\" Intelligence of this kind is met with too in other passages of the book (p. 151 and 217, 218). Spasski has appended notes to such passages (see pp. 59-71, 172 and 218, 219), and many other writers on Central Asia have also commented on several revelations of the book before us. But no one has yet thoroughly analyzed these revelations, and therefore many of them have escaped that attention which they have merited, whilst others again have either remained altogether unexplained or imperfectly\n\n* 7 English feet.\u2014Translator.\n\u2020 Journal of the Minister of Home Affairs, 1844. No. 11.\ninterpreted, owing no doubt to the insufficient knowledge of the country hitherto obtained. I propose, therefore, to thoroughly analyze the subject de novo, and shall compare much of what is written in the \"Book of the Survey\" concerning the Kirghiz Steppes and country of Turkistan with the modern information on the subject.\n\nAfter a description of the Yaik, or the modern Ural, and of the tributaries on its right bank, we read (p. 69), \"And opposite those rivers, on the left bank of the Yaik, is the mouth of the Izlay.\" Now in other passages of the book, this river is called the Ilez or the river of Ilek.\n\n\"Above the river Izlay, at the termination of the Arattova mountains, the river Vor issuing from Mount Ur\u00fak falls into the Yaik. From the same mountain issues the river Irg\u00edz and falls into lake Akbashli.\" In another part of the book of the Great Survey, we read (p. 72). \"Mount Ur\u00fak, which is 70 versts long, is distant from the Blue Sea (Sea of Aral), 300 versts. From this mountain issue three rivers; the Vor, which flows into the Yaik; the river Irg\u00edz, which flows eastward into lake Akbashli; the river Hem, which flows towards the Caspian Sea and falls into the lake without descending to that sea.\" Mount Air\u00fak, which has been very happily chosen for explorers, is the highest point in the M\u00fagodjarski range and is equidistant (250 versts) from the mouth of the Or and from the north-west extremity of the Blue Sea or Sea of Aral. But in the \"Book of the Great Survey,\" the appellation of mount Air\u00fak is extended to the entire range which stretches 150 versts north and south. From the M\u00fagodjarski mountains, which surround the peak of Air\u00fak, there flow: to the north the river Or, to the east one mouth of the Irg\u00edz, which is known as the Chit-Irg\u00edz, and to the south the Emba.*\n\nThe river Or falls into the Ural \"at the extremity of Mount Araltova.\" But what is this mountain? Spasski supposes (vide his note 58) that this is the range which extends to the Sea of Aral; in other words that it is the Air\u00fak or M\u00fagodjarski range, but from three other passages in the work in which mention is made of Mount Araltova, one would sooner suppose that the range in question is that portion of the Ural chain which runs along the right bank of the river Ural and which terminates in the Guberlinski hills.\n\nThe river Irg\u00edz falls into the lake, which in former maps and in the old description of the Kirghiz Steppes by Richkoff and Tevshin\u2020 is called Ak-Sakal-Barbi, a name somewhat similar to that given in the \"Book of the Great Survey.\" But it is not known why on the newest Charts and in the\n\n* Vide Richkoff's \"Topography of the Province of Orenburgh.\" St. Petersburgh, 1762, Part I, page 214.\n\u2020 Vide Tevshin's \"Description of the Kirghiz-Cossack hordes and of the Kirghiz Steppes.\" St. Petersburgh, 1832. Part I, page 82.\ndescriptions of Blaramberg* the name of the lake spoken of should have been changed into Chelkar-Dengis, a designation common to many lakes in the Kirghiz Steppes. Blaramberg reckons that there are four Chelkars in the Orenburgh Steppes and Silverhelm says there are three\u2020 in the Siberian Steppes. The word \"dengis,\" in Russian \"m\u00f3re\" (a sea), is inserted in maps to denote either lakes of a considerable size, or to signify that the body of water alluded to has a bitter or brackish taste. In the more modern descriptions of the Orenburgh Steppes by Meyer, a lake in one place is called \"Chelkar,\" and in another \"Ak-Sakal-Ta\u00fap.\" The Kirghiz use the latter designation, whilst the Russians used to call a lake in those parts Ak-Sakal-Barbi. No doubt by mistake the word came to be applied to fresh water-lakes.\u00a7 The \"Book of the Great Survey\" here goes on to speak for the second time of the mouth of the river Emba. Let us now turn to the further indications of this book relative to the river Irg\u00edz and lake Akbashli. (p. 69.)\n\n\"And opposite those rivers (the Ur\u00fak-Irg\u00edz and others) the river Sa\u00fak falls into the same lake on the left side after receiving the waters of the Bozin-Hinchal-Ilgen.\" The omission from modern maps of the Sa\u00fak and Bozin does not give us the right to conclude that this indication is wrong. The conversion of Ak-Sakal-Barbi or Ak-Sakal-Ta\u00fap into Chelkar has already shewn us how completely without rule are names sometimes changed. In the word Ak-Sakal-Ta\u00fap we are supposed to hear still the sound of the Sa\u00fak of the \"Book of the Great Survey.\" In like manner the fact that the names of the mountain B\u00faz\u00fan Kh\u00e1n, and of the B\u00faz\u00fan sands, which, whilst marked on Tevshin's map of the Kirghiz Steppes as more to the north than Ak-Sakal-Barbi, i.e., about Polkoyak and T\u00fargaya, are altogether omitted from modern maps, shows that the name of the river Bozin was not an invention of the \"Book of the Great Survey.\" We find in the following testimony of Abul Ghazi Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n a confirmation of the existence of the river Sa\u00fak. Baty, on his return from Russia (about the year 1243), when assigning a lot to his youngest brother, Saiban Kh\u00e1n, says: \"Thou wilt have the entire country, which lies between the possessions of my eldest brother Idyen my own: thou wilt pass the summer on the Irg\u00edz-Sa\u00fak, or, Ilek and east of the Yaik almost to the Ural mountains and the winter in Kara K\u00fam Arak\u00fam, on the banks of the\n\n* Military Statistical Review of the land of the Kirghiz-Cossacks of the Lesser Horde (i.e., of the Trans-Ural Kirghiz of the Government of Orenburgh).

Without attaching, therefore, any great importance to the absence from modern maps of the names noted in the \"Book of the Great Survey,\" it now remains to take stock of the indications of the book itself. We are told then that into the lake Ak-Sakal-Barbi, on the side opposite the mouth of the Irg\u00edz, several streams fall. Now if these streams and their tributaries exist at all, they are too insignificant to be taken into account. Evidently, therefore, the remark does not refer to them. But, besides these rivers and the river Irg\u00edz, in the basin of the Ak-Sakal-Barbi there remains but one river. This is the T\u00fargai, and the one in all probability represented by the name Sa\u00fak. This assumption is supported by the\n\nERRATA.\n\nProceedings, August 1879.\n\nPage 224 line 26 for Booktoff read Bootkoff.\n\u201e 226 \u201e 26 \u201e Polkoyak \u201e Ulkoyak.\n\u201e 232 \u201e 7 \u201e Khvahni \u201e Khvalim.\n\nrar more distant, as, for example, the Jilanchik (p. 208), and consequently the T\u00fargai must have been known under another name. Besides which, according to the testimony of Tevshin, the lake Ak-Sakal-Barbi, as compared with its size during the latter half of the last century, has considerably diminished, and therefore in former times one can imagine that the rivers were independent of each other, that the course of the Irg\u00edz was more to the east and that of the T\u00fargai to the west. These arguments, therefore, seem sufficient for us to recognize in the T\u00fargai the ancient river Sa\u00fak. If such is the case, the river Bozin-Hinchal-Ilgan resolves itself into the Ulikoyak, a considerable tributary on the right bank of the T\u00fargai.\n\nAt the end of the passage in the \"Book of the Great Survey\" which we are now examining, a repetition of the name Irg\u00edz is observed, with the addition to it of the word Ur\u00fak. Now it has already been said that the river Irg\u00edz falls into the lake (Ak-Sakal-Barbi). Hence when it is observed for the second time that the Ur\u00fak Irg\u00edz falls into the same lake, reference must be made to that Irg\u00edz which flows from Mount Air\u00fak; in other words to the modern Chit-Irg\u00edz which is the same for the lower portion of\n\n* Histoire des Mongols et des Tatars, par Abul Gh\u00e1zi Bah\u00e1d\u00far Kh\u00e1n, par le Baron Desmaisons. St. Petersburgh, (page 191).\nthe large or Ul\u00fa-Irg\u00edz. It must of course too be borne in mind that, although not mentioned, there may be another Irg\u00edz, the name given to the upper part of the Ul\u00fa-Irg\u00edz. \"And opposite those rivers of the Khvahinski, or Caspian Sea, and in front of Mount Ur\u00fak are the sands of Arak\u00fam and Bars\u00fak-K\u00fam.\" In another part of the book (p. 73), it is said \"And towards the Blue Sea, 280 versts from the river Irg\u00edz, are the sands of Bars\u00fak-K\u00fam, across which the distance is 25 versts, the sands of Kara-K\u00fam being 200 versts from the Blue Sea. The sands of Kara-K\u00fam are 250 versts long and 130 versts broad, and these three sands are adjacent to the shores of the Blue Sea,\" which of the numerous sands in the southern part of the Kirghiz Steppe is called Arak\u00fam. Here of course there may be a slip of the pen, as in several manuscripts Arak\u00fam is designedly called Karak\u00fam (vide note 2 of the \"Book of the Great Survey\"). Now there are two known Karak\u00fams in the steppes, one more to the south of the Emba, where it enters the Caspian Sea, and the other in the angle formed by the lower portion of the Sir Darya and the north-east shore of lake Aral. But if we take into consideration the testimony above produced of Abul Gh\u00e1zi about the existence of an Ara-K\u00fam independent of Karak\u00fam, and if we note that the text of the \"Book of the Great Survey\" shows there are three sands contiguous to lake Aral, whilst it speaks only of two, viz., Bars\u00fak-K\u00fam and Kara-K\u00fam, and finally, when we really observe three separate steppes, viz., the Greater Bars\u00fak, the Lesser Bars\u00fak and Karak\u00fam, we are brought to believe that for the sands of Arak\u00fam is meant either the Greater or the Lesser Bars\u00fak, most probably the latter. And for this reason they, from their measurements, are more likely to resemble the Bars\u00fak spoken of in the book. The Greater Bars\u00fak is contiguous to the north-west shore of the Sea of Aral and is distant from Chit-Irg\u00edz (250 to 300 versts). It has a width of about 25 versts. The Lesser Bars\u00fak, or as we will call it, the Arak\u00fam, is adjacent to the Bay of Perovski, is distant from Chit-Irg\u00edz about 200 versts, and has a width of about 10 versts. Finally, the sands of Kara-K\u00fam adjoin the Bay of Sara-Cheganak and therefore the statement regarding the distance between them and the sea is not comprehensible, and probably is caused by an error in the manuscript. The sands of Kara-K\u00fam extend in a direct line 225 versts from north to south, that is from lake Ak-Sakal-Barbi to the natural boundary of Mailibasli on the Sir Darya, and they also stretch more than 100 versts to the eastward of the Sea of Aral. The width of the northern portion of the Kara-K\u00fam sands is 200 versts.\n\nTurning then again to Mount Air\u00fak and to the rivers which flow out of it, we read on page 69 \"Out of the same Mount Ur\u00fak flows the river Hem, and into this river, on the right bank, falls the river Temirs\u00fa. The river Hem, without descending to the Caspian Sea, a distance of 20 versts,\nfalls into the lake.\" Now the river Hem, by which is meant the Emba, flows from one of its two sources from the M\u00fagodjarski mountains, receives, as has been said, on its right bank, the waters of the Temir and at a distance of 72 versts from the Caspian Sea begins to split up into branches. At 21 versts' distance from the same sea it again passes into the same bed, and then again divides into branches, of which there are two principal ones. These having diffused their waters into lakes fall into the Caspian Sea,* \"50 versts distant from the right bank of the Hem, is the Kainyar-Sakgiz which discharges its waters into another lake. The Kainyar-Sakgiz has a course of 200 versts.\" The river Sagiz towards its mouth flows parallel with the Emba and at a distance from it of 70 versts, and then without reaching the Caspian Sea is lost in the salt marshes of the Tentyak-Sor, which lie at the mouth of the Emba. The length of the course of the Sagiz is 375 versts\u2020 \"420 versts below the river Vor, there flow into the Yaik through its left bank three streams without name. Between them there is a distance of 70 versts. Below these streams again the river Ilez enters the Yaik\" just below T\u00fartebi, which we call the Salt Mountain, for in it they break salt. The distance along the river Ural between the mouths of the Ori and Ilek is 360 versts. During this extent there fall into the Ural, on its left bank, not three but more rivers.\u2021\"\n\nAlphabetical Index to the Geographical names in the Kirghiz Steppes and in the Country of Turkistan, which are contained in the Book of the Great Survey.\u2014Translated from the Russian by Capt.

The Evidence afforded by the Indian Pendulum Observations on the Constitution of the Earth's Crust and on Geodesy; being an Extract from the Preface to Vol. V of the Account of the Operations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey.\u2014By Major-General J. T. Walker, R. E., C. B., F. R. S., &c.\n\nThe Great Meridional Arc in India, which was measured by Colonels Lambton and Everest, was long regarded as one of the most important of the several arcs which had been measured in various countries for the determination of the Figure of the Earth. But a paper by Archdeacon Pratt, which was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society for 1854, shewed that the astronomical determinations of the latitudes of the stations of the Indian Arc might be very materially influenced by deflections of the plumb-line, caused by the attraction of the Himalayan Mountains, and the high Table-lands included between the mountains, and extending beyond them into Tibet. Thus a short time after the publication of this paper, Colonel Clarke, of the Ordnance Survey, while making the elaborate and very valuable investigation of the Figure of the Earth which is appended to the Account of the Principal Triangulation of the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain and Ireland, London, 1858, was driven to the conclusion\u2014which is expressed in the last page of the volume\u2014that the value of the Indian Arc had been considerably diminished since the investigations of Archdeacon Pratt.\n\nBut the several Sections of the Arc, though showing some indication of having been influenced by Himalayan attraction, did not appear to have been influenced to anything like the extent to which they should have been, considering the magnitudes of the attracting masses. Thus it was suggested, by Mr.\u2014now Sir G. B.\u2014Airy, that the disturbing forces must be counteracted by some compensatory disposition of the matter in the in-\nterior of the earth's crust, immediately below the mountain masses. In this case pendulum observations, taken at stations on the Himalayas, and probably also on the table-lands of much lower elevation which are situated between those mountains and the sea, would show more or less diminution in the vertical force of gravity at each station (reduced to the sea-level) as compared with what would be found at stations actually situated on the sea-level. It was in order to throw light on this subject that the pendulums were employed in India, at a series of consecutive stations along the axis of the Peninsula, from Cape Comorin up to and then on the Himalayan masses, as well as at points on the coast and on islands contiguous thereto.\n\nOn making a comparison of the observed with the calculated results, we find a considerable diminution in the vibration-numbers of the pendulums\u2014that is to say, in the force of gravity\u2014at the Himalayan and the higher Continental stations, relatively to what is met with at the Coast and the Island stations. We may not, however, attribute this deficiency of gravity wholly to local causes, because Sir George Airy has already pointed out\u2014many years ago, in his discussion of pendulum observations, see the Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana, Art. Figure of the Earth\u2014that gravity appears to be greater at oceanic stations than at continental stations, on the evidence of the vibration-numbers of pendulums which had been swung at several stations in various parts of the world, on the coasts and islands of the Atlantic and Pacific, as well as on the continents of Europe and America. Subsequently, in 1849, Professor Stokes showed* that these differences between observation and theory might be due to a general raising of the level of the sea in the vicinity of continents, over the level at oceanic islands, because of the greater density of the continent than of the ocean. He proved that \"if we set a circle of land \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\)th of a mile high, of 1000 \"miles radius, surrounding one station, against a circle of sea 3\u00b75 miles \"deep, surrounding another station, we get a difference of about 3\u00b75, near- \"ly, in the number of vibrations performed in one day by a seconds pendu- \"lum.\" The principal part of this correction is, however, due to the depth of sea. \"Thus it would require a uniform elevation of about 2\u00b71 miles, in \"order that the land elevated above the level of the sea should produce as \"much effect as is produced by the difference between a stratum of land \"3\u00b75 miles thick and an equal stratum of water.\"\n\nIt is clear from Professor Stokes's investigations that whenever the results of the pendulum observations in India came to be compared with those of pendulum observations at distant oceanic stations, it was to be expected that the observed vibration-numbers might be found to be gener-\n\n* See his paper on the Variation of Gravity at the Surface of the Earth, in the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Volume VIII, Part V.\nally in defect, as compared with the theoretical numbers, at the Indian stations, and in excess at the Oceanic. This is what Major Herschel believes he has met with, in his preliminary investigations of the relations between the pendulum observations in India and those in other parts of the world. And it explains why in his comparison of observed with calculated results, he has referred the Indian results to the equator\u2014instead of to the southernmost Indian station, Punnae, as formerly\u2014and has adopted, as a provisional basis for conversion, a mean equatorial vibration-number which he has derived from other observations than those of the Indian group.\n\nThe alteration of treatment affects the vibration-numbers throughout by a constant, the magnitude of which, however, is only 2\u00b765 vibrations. We must look therefore to local rather than to distant causes for an explanation of the magnitudes of the deficiency of gravity which are met with.\n\nTo make this more clear it is desirable to refer the observations once more to Punnae, instead of to the equator. Then, ranging the stations in order of altitude\u2014from the ocean to the coast line and on to the interior of the continent, and finally up to the Himalayas\u2014we have the following apparent variations, at all the stations but Kew, which is so far to the north of the others that it can only be compared with them on the supposition that the value of the ellipticity employed in the calculation is very exact.\n\n### APPARENT VARIATIONS.\n\n| Island Stations | Inland Stations less than 2000 feet, mean 1210. | Inland Stations between 2000 and 7000 feet, mean 3822. |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Minicoy         | + 4\u00b702                                        |                                                 |\n| Colaba          | + 3\u00b740                                        | Mallapatti \u2014 1\u00b712                                |\n| Aden            | + 2\u00b734                                        | Pachapalam \u2014 1\u00b776                               |\n|                 |                                               | Namth\u00e1b\u00e1d \u2014 2\u00b789                                 |\n| Mean            | + 3\u00b725                                        | Kodang\u00e1l \u2014 1\u00b794                                  |\n|                 |                                               | Damarg\u00edda \u2014 3\u00b791                                 |\n|                 |                                               | Somit\u00e1na \u2014 1\u00b766                                  |\n| Coast Stations  | Badgaon                                       | Mean \u2014 5\u00b709                                      |\n| Punnae          | 0\u00b700                                          | Badgaon \u2014 1\u00b738                                   |\n| K\u00fadankolam      | + 0\u00b709                                        | Ahmadp\u00far \u2014 1\u00b773                                  |\n| Alleppy         | + 1\u00b741                                        | Kali\u00e1npur \u2014 0\u00b796                                 |\n| Mangalore       | \u2014 0\u00b759                                        | Pah\u00e1rgarh \u2014 2\u00b795                                 |\n| Madras          | \u2014 0\u00b774                                        | Usira \u2014 0\u00b795                                     |\n| Cocan\u00e1da        | + 0\u00b781                                        | Data\u00edri \u2014 1\u00b765                                   |\n| Calcutta        | + 1\u00b738                                        | Kali\u00e1na \u2014 3\u00b749                                   |\n| Ismailia        | \u2014 0\u00b748                                        | Nojli \u2014 4\u00b723                                     |\n|                 |                                               | Mor\u00e9 \u2014 21\u00b744                                     |\n| Mean            | + 0\u00b724                                        | Himalayan Table-land Station 15,400 feet high.    |\n\nMean \u2014 2\u00b727\nThese figures show a comparative excess of gravity at the Island stations which is equivalent to 3\u00b725 vibrations of a seconds pendulum, and which diminishes to an excess of 0\u00b724 at the Coast stations, and becomes a defect of 2\u00b727 at Inland stations under 2000 feet in height, of 5\u00b709 at Inland stations between 2000 and 7000 feet, and of 21\u00b744 at Mor\u00e9, where the height is 15,400 feet. It will be found that the ratios of the mean defects of the vibration-numbers to the average heights of the elevated masses, as exhibited at the two groups of Inland stations and at Mor\u00e9, are very fairly accordant, a change of one vibration accompanying changes of height of 533, 751 and 718 feet respectively. And if we multiply the mean of these values by 3\u00b725\u2014the mean excess at the three Island stations\u2014we get 2,168 feet, which probably does not differ very materially from the mean depression of the circumjacent ocean-bed below the level of the islands. Thus the amount of elevation above or depression below the actual sea-level has obviously a very important bearing on the discrepancies between theory and observation.\n\nNow it is to be remembered that the vibration-numbers at the Island and Coast stations have not, in a single instance, been increased for the deficiency of density of the sea as compared with the land; because satisfactory data of the surrounding sea-depths were not available. It will, however, be obvious that in order to institute a fair comparison between the force of gravity at these and at the inland stations, the vibration-numbers at the coast stations should be somewhat augmented, and those at the island stations should be augmented in a still greater degree, on this account. Moreover the vibration-numbers at the higher inland stations should also be increased, not on account of the density of the sea, but because the observations have been reduced to the apparent sea-level, which is presumably raised above the normal sea-level by the attraction of the continental masses. The extreme increase would be at Minicoy Island, for deficient density, on the one hand, and at Mor\u00e9, for elevation, on the other. For Minicoy we may take the increase as from 3 to 4 vibrations. For Mor\u00e9, if we assume the apparent sea-level to have been raised 1000 feet by Himalayan attraction,* we get an increase for height and mass of 2 to 3 vibra-\n\n* In the 4th edition of his *Figure of the Earth* (1871), Archdeacon Pratt shows (Arts. 200 and 201) that if \\( z \\) is the height through which the sea-level immediately below a station on a table-land is raised by attraction, \\( h \\) the height of the table-land, \\( d \\) the length of the mean horizontal diameter of the table-land through the station, and \\( e \\) the earth's radius, then\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{3}{8c} \\frac{hd}{e}, \\text{approximately},\n\\]\n\nand taking \\( h = 16,500 \\) feet, \\( d = 670 \\) miles and \\( e = 3,956 \\) miles he gets \\( z = 985 \\) feet.\ntions, by Dr. Young's rule. Thus the ratio of gravity at the extreme stations of Minicoy and Mor\u00e9 would not be very sensibly altered from what the given vibration-numbers indicate; but the increase in the vibration-number would gradually diminish in passing from either of the two extreme stations to any intermediate inland station, which is situated too far from the sea to be influenced by its density, and on land too low to raise the sea-level sensibly; consequently the ratio of gravity at the central as compared with the extreme stations may be very sensibly affected, that is to say by the amount due to an alteration of 2 to 4 vibrations at one or other of a pair of stations under comparison.\n\nStill, however, making every allowance for these causes, the broad fact remains that the observations at the Indian pendulum stations exhibit a marked increase of gravity, when we proceed from the interior of the continent to the coast and then to the islands of the ocean; and they also indicate a very marked decrease, when we proceed towards and ascend the high table-lands of the Himalayas. These facts point to a condensation of the matter of the earth's crust under ocean-beds, and an attenuation of the matter under mountain-beds, the crust contracting and condensing wherever it sank into hollows, and expanding and attenuating wherever it rose into continents, as has been suggested by Archdeacon Pratt.\n\nThis seems a fitting place for giving a brief sketch of the Archdeacon's labours and investigations, on the subject of the effects of Himalayan Attraction upon the Geodetic Operations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India.\n\nThe question was first brought to his attention, in 1852, by the then Surveyor General, Sir Andrew Waugh. Discrepancies of $5^\\circ 2$ and $3^\\circ 8$ respectively had been met with between the computed and observed amplitudes, in the two northernmost sections of the Great Arc, Damargida-Kali\u00e1npur-Kali\u00e1na, the observed value being in defect in the northern and in excess in the southern section. They were supposed to be due to the influence of the great mountain range to the north, though distant fully sixty miles from Kali\u00e1na, the nearest of the three stations. Archdeacon Pratt set himself to calculate the actual amount of the attraction of the Himalayan mass, and of the deflection on the plumb-line which it would cause at the three stations. The result obtained was very much larger than had been expected, or than was required to explain the differences between the astronomical and the geodetic amplitudes. The Archdeacon's calculations were communicated to the Royal Society, in the paper already alluded to which was published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1854. This paper is followed by one by G. B. Airy, Esq., Astronomer Royal, suggest-\ning that the effect of the mountains may be counteracted by their bases having sunk to some depth into the dense fluid lava below, on the surface of which the crust may usually be supposed to repose; such sinking would cause a displacement of dense by lighter matter below, which would tend to compensate for the excess of matter above. While demurring to the form of this suggestion, Archdeacon Pratt followed up the idea, and reduced to calculation another hypothesis regarding deficiency of matter below mountains, viz., that the irregularities of the mountain surface have arisen from the expansion of the earth's crust upwards, from depths below, which has upheaved the mountains and produced a slight but extensive attenuation of the mass below them. This attenuation he shows to be sufficient to produce a considerable amount of compensation for mountain attraction; but he states that it does not clear up the difficulties; and, being a mere hypothesis, nothing certain could be determined regarding it; see No. XXIX of Philosophical Transactions for 1858. Subsequently he investigated the influence of the Ocean on the plumb-line in India, and found that it also had a very sensible effect at the stations of the Arc, and in the same direction as the Himalayan Attraction (No. XXX, Philosophical Transactions, 1858).\n\nHitherto the Archdeacon had been inclined to attribute the calculated deflections of the plumb-line, in some degree, to errors in the elements of the figure of the earth which had been employed in the geodetic computations. But in 1860 he satisfied himself that this was not the case, and that there are hidden causes,\u2014in variation of density in the crust below the Indian Arc\u2014which, taken in combination with the Mountain and Ocean Attraction, explain the smallness of the discrepancies that had been met with, (No. XXXIV, Philosophical Transactions, 1861).\n\nThus far his attention had been directed only to horizontal attractions, producing, and measured by, deflections of the plumb-line. When the Indian pendulum operations were commenced, he watched their progress with great interest, to see whether their direct measures of vertical attraction supported his views regarding attenuation of matter below mountains. The results of his calculations are given in his Figure of the Earth, 4th edition, 1871. He shows, in Art. 196, that the discrepancies between theory and observation become considerably reduced when it is assumed that beneath any portion or cap of the earth's crust, which is raised above the sea-level, there is a uniform attenuation of matter equal to that of the cap, running down to a depth from fifty to one hundred times the thickness of the cap. This result was arrived at when as yet he had only been furnished with the evidence of the stations between Minicoy and Kali\u00e1na, the highest of which is only about 3000 feet above the sea-level. Subsequent-\nly, while passing the proof-sheets of the volume through the press, he learnt the result of Captain Basevi's observations at Mor\u00e9; he then made a calculation which showed that an assumed attenuation of matter equal to that of the Mor\u00e9 plateau, and extending to a depth equal to fifty times the height of the plateau, would, if taken account of in the reductions, leave so small a difference between theory and observation as to bear strong testimony to the truth of his hypothesis, see Art. 201.\n\nArchdeacon Pratt died before this edition of his Figure of the Earth was published. His views have since received further confirmation by the measurement of two longitudinal arcs across the Southern Peninsula of India, from Madras to Mangalore, and from Vizagapatam to Bombay. The terminal stations of these arcs being situated on the coast line, in each instance, it was probable that at each station the plumb-line would be deflected inland, because of the greater attraction of the land than the sea, in which case the astronomical amplitudes would have been greater than the geodetic. Actually, however, the converse was found to have happened, for the astronomical amplitudes proved to be less than the geodetic; this showed that the plumb-line had been deflected towards the sea, presumably because of denser matter under the bed of the ocean than under the land.\n\nAn additional support to the Archdeacon's hypothesis has been recently furnished by an interesting calculation in Colonel Clarke's latest investigation of the Figure of the Earth, published in the Philosophical Magazine for August, 1878. Colonel Clarke has computed the departure (in a vertical plane) of the curve which best represents the Indian meridian, on the evidence of the geodetic observations in India, from the curve which best represents the earth as a whole, on the evidence of the geodetic observations in all other parts of the world as well as India. He shows that the curves cross each other, and that their departure in no case exceeds 20 feet; and he says\u2014\"This deformation may or may not be due to Himalayan attraction; at any rate we have here an indication that that vast table-land does not produce the disturbance that might \u00e0 priori have been anticipated. This is in accordance with the fact that there is an attraction sea-wards at Mangalore and Madras, and slightly also at Bombay: and I think we have here a corroboration of Archdeacon Pratt's theory, that where the crust of the earth is thickest there it is least dense; and where thinnest, as in ocean-beds, there it is most dense.\"\n\nIf the hypothesis of sub-continental attenuation and sub-oceanic condensation is a true one, and is in accordance with the actual facts of the constitution of the earth's crust, then it follows that there can be no very\nconsiderable disturbance of the sea-level, so that all radii drawn from the centre of the earth to the surface of the ocean will be sensibly equal\u2014assuming the figure to be exactly spherical in order to avoid circumlocution; it also follows that deflections of the plumb-line are not likely to be very considerable, excepting in the immediate vicinity of mountain masses, where the deficiency below cannot neutralise the excess above. If so, then distant mountain masses may cease to be regarded as prejudicial to geodetic operations, for their influence will be sufficiently counteracted by other causes; the resultant effect at a distance may even be materially less than that of local and contiguous irregularities in the configuration of the ground, the magnitudes of which may be insignificant as compared with those of the mountain and continental masses. In like manner the deficiency of ocean-density need not be regarded as liable to influence distant geodetic operations, as it may be expected to be neutralised by an increase of density in the crust below the ocean-bed.\n\nOn the other hand, if the hypothesis is not correct, we are driven to conclude that the radii of the (spherical) earth are of unequal length, and that there must be considerable variations between the apparent level of the sea and the normal level which corresponds to the curve of equal radii. In this case the actual irregularities of the surface of the earth will be much greater than they appear to be, and the greater will be the departure of the Actual Figure from a simple geometrical figure, such as the Mean Figure\u2014either a spheroid of two axes, or a triaxial ellipsoid\u2014which geodesists deduce from their measurements over the earth's surface.\n\nThis latter view of the subject has found a warm advocate in Germany, in the person of Dr. J. Hann, who urges\u2014in a paper published in Vienna, in the Mittheilungen der Geographische Gesellschaft, 1875, No. 12,\u2014that the sea-level is greatly distorted, because of the unequal distribution of matter on the earth's surface; consequently, that we can no longer hope that geodetic measurements, reduced to a sea-level thus distorted, will conform to a regular ellipsoid of revolution; that our knowledge of the true form of the earth is deficient; and that it has become desirable to resort to pendulum operations, in order to determine the variation of gravity\u2014as against some normal station\u2014at as many oceanic islands as possible, and also at numerous stations on the coasts and in the interior of the great continents, in order to discover, by the shortest method, the irregularities of the sea-level.\n\nMeasurements of the variations of gravity have, unquestionably, one great advantage over measurements of meridional and longitudinal arcs, in that they can be conducted with far greater rapidity and at a far smaller cost. But they are open to a grave objection, in that when reducing them\nto the sea-level, in order to obtain results from observations at different stations which will be strictly comparable with each other, it is necessarily assumed that the matter of the whole of that portion of the earth's crust which lies directly below the sea-level\u2014and which, from its proximity, materially influences the attraction at the sea-level\u2014is of uniform density throughout, in all parts of the world, whether situated underneath mountains and continents, or underneath the bed of the ocean. On this hypothesis all pendulum observations have hitherto been reduced to a common level, and it is none the less an hypothesis that it has been made tacitly. It implies that the matter of the visible masses above the sea-level is wholly unconnected with, and independent of, the matter of the invisible masses below; thus the mountains and continents might consist of just so much stuff thrown off passing meteors and asteroids\u2014having a density $\\sigma = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho$ the mean density of the earth,\u2014instead of being a continuation, or an expansion, of the matter immediately below them, which is the more natural supposition. That there actually is any such severance of continuity and disconnection between the visible above and the invisible below, appears, on the face of it, to be highly improbable.\n\nSeeing then that, do what we will, we must make some assumption, I cannot but think that Archdeacon Pratt's hypothesis that the visible masses above may be regarded as so much matter abstracted from the invisible masses below, is the least difficult of the two hypotheses to accept. And if we proceed to consider the constitution of the crust below the bed of the ocean, it appears to me to be easier to assume, with the Archdeacon, that there the matter has been condensed down to a depth which bears some relation to the depth of the ocean above, than to assume it to be of the same density as the comparatively uncontracted matter at the level of the sea, on the coast lines.\n\nData are available for estimating, with tolerable approximation, the relative magnitudes of the greatest horizontal attraction exerted by the Himalayas and the greatest vertical diminution of attraction under the Himalayas, that is to say, of the two forces by which the geodetic and the pendulum operations, in India, are respectively most influenced. The latitude of one of the trigonometrical stations in Dehra D\u00fcn\u2014beyond the northern extremity of the Great Arc\u2014has been determined, both astronomically, and by calculation through the triangulation from Kali\u00e1npur, the astronomical origin of latitudes, 428 miles to the south. Dehra D\u00fcn being at the foot of the Himalayas, a large deflection of the plumb-line must be expected there, and, in fact, a larger meridional deflection has been met with there, than at any other station of the Survey at which astronomical observations have been taken. The astronomical latitude at Dehra is $37^\\circ 6'$ in defect of\nthe geodetic latitude, computed, from Kali\u00e1np\u00far, with the constants for\nthe figure of the earth which are employed in all the geodetic calculations\nof this Survey; the difference would be diminished by $1^\\circ 4'$, if Colonel\nClarke's constants of 1866 had been employed instead. The astronomical\nazimuth at Dehra is $12^\\circ 2'$ in defect of the geodetic azimuth, also computed\nfrom Kali\u00e1np\u00far; consequently, as the latitude is $30^\\circ 19' 57''$, the deflection on\nthe prime vertical\u2014being equal to the azimuthal error $\\times$ the cotangent of\nthe latitude\u2014may be taken as $20'' 8'$. The resultant of the two deflections\nis $43''$; it may be either increased or diminished by the local attraction at\nKali\u00e1np\u00far, which, however, is almost certainly not large. Assume the\ntotal deflection to be $48''$; then the horizontal attraction which would pro-\nduce a deflection to that extent is equal to gravity $\\times$ tangent of the de-\nflection = $0.002 g$. Now we have seen that at Mor\u00e9 the deficiency of\nvertical attraction diminishes the number of vibrations of a seconds pen-\ndulum by about 21 vibrations per diem; and this deficiency of force is\nequivalent to $0.005 g$. Hence it appears that the variations of attrac-\ntion which arise from hidden causes, below the Himalayan Mountains, may\nbe from two to three times as great as those which arise from the moun-\ntains themselves; this being the proportion of the maximum vertical\ndeficiency which has yet been met with, to the maximum horizontal attrac-\ntion which has yet been met with.\n\nThus the Pendulum Observations in India have furnished much evi-\ndence in confirmation of the accuracy of the Geodetic Operations in India,\ntending to show that the latter have not been influenced, either by the\npositive attraction of the Himalayas, or by the negative attraction of the\nOcean, to anything like the extent which each disturbing element, acting\nalone, would produce, were it not neutralised by the interior constitution of\nthe subjacent matter.\n\nIt would seem that measures of variations of gravity on the earth's sur-\nface can never be made to supersede direct measures of the earth's figure.\nEach process is supplemental to the other; for all determinations of varia-\ntions of gravity, in widely separated localities, necessarily rest on an exact\nknowledge of the figure; and a knowledge of the variations of gravity gives\ngreater exactitude to the determination of the figure. Thus there is no\nnecessity to divorce the two processes, and to relegate either the one or the\nother into obscurity; on the contrary, the simultaneous employment of\nboth, whenever practicable, appears to be most desirable, in the general\ninterests of Science.\n2. On a simple method of using an insignificant Fraction of the Main Current, produced by a Dynamo-Electric Machine for Telegraph purposes.\u2014By Louis Schwendler, M. I. C. E. &c., &c.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe author pointed out that up to the present the electric currents required for Telegraph signalling were chiefly produced by galvanic Batteries, a method comparatively expensive and also connected with cumbersome arrangements. Since his Electric light experiments, instituted last year in London by order of the Secretary of State for India, he had always been of opinion that it would be of technical as well as of economical importance if the strong, constant and exceedingly cheap currents, produced by the present construction of Dynamo-Electric machines, could be made available for signalling purposes. However Mr. Schwendler found at the time, that there were some difficulties in the way, which he believed he had now overcome; and having of late made some experiments on the subject, he did not hesitate to communicate the results. His method is a very simple and ingenious one. A strong current is produced through a comparatively small resistance by a Dynamo-Electric machine, which is an arrangement for converting Mechanical Power direct into Magnetism and Electricity according to the well known laws of Faraday's Magneto-Induction. This strong main current, so produced, is made use of for doing any kind of useful work. For instance, during night the useful work done by the main current may be given out as a powerful Electric Light to illuminate the signalling office; or during day-time the strong main current may be employed to drive an Electro-Magnetic Engine which, in its turn, is used for doing any kind of useful mechanical work, as pulling the punkhas, producing a draft of refreshing cool air through the building, lifting messages, &c. &c.; or the main current may be sent through a large galvanoplastic apparatus in use, say, at the Surveyor General's Office &c., &c. Thus a strong electric current becomes available, the production of which is wholly or partly repaid by the useful work it is able to execute in a variety of ways as indicated.\n\nOn the other hand the electric currents required for signalling purposes are exceedingly weak as compared with the strong main current. Hence the Electric currents may be supplied to the Telegraph lines, by simply tapping the main current without perceptibly reducing it, or without influencing the useful work done by the main current. This is the method Mr. Schwendler proposes. He said: \"This might be an inducement for Telegraph administrations to come forward more quickly with the introduction of the Electric Light in their Signalling offices, since they would\nget the signalling currents for all the lines terminating in an office into the bargain, and the costly and cumbersome galvanic apparatus might be dispensed with.\"\n\nOn the 14th October, 1879, Mr. Schwendler telegraphed by this method to Agra. The main current was produced at the Alipore Government Telegraph Workshops, and the useful work consisted of a powerful Electric Light, illuminating the Workshops perfectly. An ordinary Telegraph line conveyed the branch current to the Calcutta Signalling Office, where it was joined to the Agra line (850 miles in length); and several messages were despatched by the use of this current. No alteration of the electric light could be observed when telegraphing; and this, of course, is quite right, since the signalling current tapped off was scarcely 0\u00b704 per cent. of the main current producing the light.\n\nOther experiments equally successful were made. In fact, feeding in this manner all the 14 lines which terminate at the Calcutta Office, scarcely more than 5\u00b70 per cent. of the total main current is required.\n\nMr. Schwendler concluded by saying that there was little doubt left that, at no distant future, Telegraph lines would be supplied with currents produced by Dynamo-Electric machines instead of using galvanic currents as hitherto.\n\nThe paper will be published in full in the Journal, Part II.\n\n3.

S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper gives an account of the work performed by the Survey parties attached to the Quetta, Kuram and Pesh\u00e1war Columns of the Afgh\u00e1n Expeditionary Force in 1878-79, and will be published, with a map, in the forthcoming number of Part II of the Journal.\n\n4. On the Systematic Position of some little-known Asiatic Mantodea, with Descriptions of two new Species belonging to the Genus Hestias. By J. Wood-Mason.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nGenus HESTIAS, Saussure.\n\nThe genus Hestias, proposed in 1871 by De Saussure for the reception of a remarkable insect from Sylhet, is referred to the subfamily Harpagidae, wherein it must take its place next after, or in the immediate neighbourhood of, Acromantis and its allies, from which it is readily distin-\nguishable by the form of the prothorax, by the structure, and by the peculiar style of colouring of the insides, of the fore legs, &c. The author recognises five species, of which two are now for the first time described, viz.:\n\n1. **Hestias Brunneriana**, Saussure, M\u00e9l. Orthopt. i, 1871, 3me fasc., p. 454, \u2640.\u2014Wood-Mason, P. A. S. B. August 1876, \u2642 \u2640.\n\n   *Hab.* Sylhet and Calcutta in N. India and Mysore in S. India.\n\n2. **Hestias Rogenhoferi**.\n\n   *Pathymantis Rogenhoferi*, Saussure, M\u00e9l. Orthopt. ii, 1872, p. 77, pl. ix, fig. 27 \u2640.\n\n   *Hab.* Moluccas?\n\n3. **Hestias pictipes**, n. sp.\n\n   \u2640 \u2640. Head with a minute horn shaped like that of *H. Brunneriana* \u2642. Organs of flight \u2640 not reaching, \u2642 extending beyond, extremity of abdomen. Tegmina \u2640 with the marginal field opaque light yellowish green, the rest delicately hyaline; wings with marginal field subopaque orange-yellow, the venation of the rest of the organ of the same colour narrowly lined with hyaline, and the meshes pale smoky. Fore coxae red-violet especially internally, femora inside on the lower half jet-black with three distinct white spots in a longitudinal row, and with a narrow black stripe extending from the base along fully three-fourths of the length of the margin of the foliaceous expansion, the rest of the surface being rich red-violet.\n\n   Length \u2640 about 19 millims, \u2642 17.\n\n   The specimen of the male is somewhat bleached from long residence in spirit.\n\n   *Hab.* \u2640 Marble Rocks, near Jabalpur in the Central Provinces of India; \u2642, precise locality unknown.\n\n4. **Hestias inermis**, n. sp.\n\n   \u2640. Head without a vestige of a horn, with the postocular tubercles by correlation reduced to low smooth and rounded elevations; behind the ocelli longitudinally deeply 4-sulcate. Organs of flight not reaching extremity of body; tegmina with the light opaque umber-brown marginal field pubescent; and with the posterior field rich dark umber-brown mottled in places with lighter and with hyaline, and crossed beyond the middle by a band half hyaline and half opaque cream-coloured; wings opaque lemon-yellow very broadly margined with dark brown, with the transverse veinlets lined with hyaline.\n\n   Fore coxae jet-black inside, femora jet-black at base, whence this colour is continued for some distance as a marginal band on to the foliaceous expansion.\n\n   Length about 34 millims.\nHab. N\u00e1ga Hills (Captain J. Butler). Very nearly allied to the following.\n\n5. HESTIAS PHYLLOPUS.\n\n*Mantis (Oxypilus) phyllopus*, De Haan, Bijd. etc., p. 84, pl. XVI, fig. 7, \u2642.\n\nThe fore femora \u2642 \u2640 have two black stripes in the lower half (primitive femur).\n\nThe author has seen a specimen of the female either at Oxford or in the British Museum.\n\nHab. Java.\n\nGenus Oxypilus, Serville.\n\nThe author considers that this genus should be transferred from the Mantidae to the Harpagidae and therein placed between the genera Hestias and Sigerpes. Ceratomantis Saussuri, W.-M., and Mantis (Oxypilus) bicingulata, De Haan, are shown to be closely allied Asiatic species of it, having the same relation to one another, as regards degree of development of the cephalic horn, as have Hestias Brunneriana and Hestias pictipes. Oxypilus has in common with Sigerpes the two posterior ocelli placed at the bases of spines. The author has only been able to study immature specimens of one African species, and if the perfect winged insects of these should hereafter be found to differ sufficiently from those of the Asiatic species to warrant their separation from them generically, the latter must take the name of Pachymantis proposed for the reception of De Haan's Mantis bicingulata by De Saussure.\n\nThis paper will be published in extenso in the Journal, Part II, No. 4, for the current year, with figures of anatomical details.\n\n5. Description of Sigerpes occidentalis, the Type of a new Genus of Mantodea from West Africa.\u2014By J. Wood-Mason.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn this short paper a new species of Mantodea closely related to the East African Sibylla tridens, Saussure, is described and made the type of a new genus, Sigerpes, which must be placed in the subfamily Harpagidae next to the genera Oxypilus and Hestias.\n\nThe cephalic horn, as was suspected by the author (P. A. S. B., 1876), turns out to be rudimentary in the males.\n\nThe new species, described from a fine dried \u2640 specimen in the British Museum from the neighbourhood of Sierra Leone, differs from Sigerpes (olim Sibylla) tridens \u2640 in having the cephalic horn somewhat longer and without lateral lobes and teeth, the base of the wings greenish yellow, the fore tibiae more numerously toothed, the fore femora on the inside red tipped with black, and the extremities of the organs of flight not so obviously truncate.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part II, No. 4, for 1879.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in August last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\npresented by the respective Societies or Editors.\n\nBatavia.

S. Leonard, Esq.\n\nThe following are candidates for ballot at the next meeting\u2014\n\n1. Fred. E. Pargiter, Esq., B.A., c.s., proposed by H. Beverley, Esq., seconded by J. Crawfurd, Esq.\n2. B\u00e1bu Govinda Kumara Chaudhuri (re-election), proposed by Babu Prat\u00e1pa Ch. Ghosha; seconded by Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra.\n\n3. Lieut. W. H. Johnstone, R. E., proposed by Col. J. F. Tennant, seconded by Major J. Waterhouse.\n\n4. H. Kisch, Esq., c. s., proposed by J. Crawfurd, Esq., seconded by Major J. Waterhouse.\n\n5. J. W. Parry, Esq., proposed by Carr-Stephen, Esq., seconded by Major J. Waterhouse.\n\nThe Secretary reported that Major W. R. M. Holroyd had intimated his desire to withdraw from the Society.\n\nThe Council reported that they had elected Mr. H. B. Medlicott, M. A., F. R. S., President of the Society in place of Mr. W. T. Blanford, Messrs. C. H. Tawney and J. Westland, Vice-Presidents in place of Messrs. Isaac and Medlicott, and Mr. J. Crawfurd, Member of Council in place of Dr. J. Anderson who was about to leave for Europe. Mr. Crawfurd would also act as General Secretary on the departure of Major Waterhouse.\n\nMr. Medlicott said he had a few words to say upon the announcement that had just been made from the proceedings of the Council; first, to express the regret of the Council and, he had no doubt, of the Society at large, at losing the services of Major Waterhouse, who has for seven years and a half so efficiently fulfilled the duties of Honorary Secretary. At the same time the Society was to be congratulated upon securing so competent a successor as Mr. Crawfurd.\n\nNext as to the nomination of himself as President, owing to the resignation of Mr. William Blanford on the occasion of his leaving India: as his successor he felt how unfit he was to undertake the duties of spokesman. He could only accept the post with a claim upon the indulgence of the Society, and because more suitable men had declined to be brought forward.\n\nFurthermore, he had the honor to propose to the members who were present to pass a vote of thanks on the part of the Society to Major Waterhouse on his retiring from the office of Honorary Secretary.\n\nMajor Waterhouse said, he begged to thank the members present for the vote they had just passed. He was afraid he had not done so much for the Society as he could have wished, but he had tried to do as much as he could in the limited time at his disposal. The work had been a great pleasure to him and, though he feared he would be unable to take the Honorary Secretaryship again on his return from England, he should be very glad if he could be of any further use to the Society.\nPLAN OF ENCAMPMENT AT LHASSA USED AT THE INSTALLATION OF THE DALAI LAM\n\nPhotocopygraphed at the Surveyor General's Office\nThe Secretary reported that the following coins had been acquired under the Treasure Trove Act.\n\nFrom the Huzur Deputy Collector of Shikarp\u00far,\u2014One Bakhri Rupee found buried in a Muhammadan cemetery near Ratladera.\n\nFrom the Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society,\u2014(1) A silver coin from the Collector of Surat; and (2) A Gadhia Coin from the Collector of Nassick.\n\nThe Secretary read the following letter from C. Girdlestone, Esq., forwarding a plan of the encampment lately used at the installation of the Dalai Lama together with an extract from the Report of the Vakeel at Lhasa to the Durbar on the subject.\n\n\"In case the members of the Asiatic Society like to see it I send under separate cover the plan of the encampment lately used at the installation of the present Dalai Lama. I agree with the late Mr. Heeley (Article on Tibet, Calcutta Review, No. CXVII, pp 174, 175) in considering the present incarnation as the thirteenth and not the fourteenth as Pundit Nain Singh's account would imply. (Report of G. T.

Thus attended the Lama is conveyed from Rika\u2020 to Potla, and Chinese and Bhotia officers join in the procession.\n\nOn the 14th\u2021 of Sawun Sudi, the Lama is put on the gaddi. Before putting him on the gaddi, the Lama is made to stand before the gaddi, and Ambah puts the presents from the Emperor of China before him and the two papers in Chinese and another in Bhotia are read. The Lama then facing to the East kneels down and bows his head in obeisance to the Emperor of China. He, after going through these ceremonies, sits on the gaddi. The Chinese papers alluded to above are explained to be an order from the Emperor of China to the effect that having learnt from the Lama.\u00a7 the Chinese Ambahs and the four K\u00e1jis of Bhote, that the Lama has identified the things left by the late deceased Lama as his own, the Emperor authorizes him to sit on his former gaddi. When the Lama is conveyed from Rik\u00e1 to Potla the road is swept, and the windows and doors of the houses are adorned with fringes and purdahs and the terraces with flags. Any man omitting to do this, is severely punished.\n\nDated 12th of Bhadon badi Samvat 1936 (14th August, 1879).\n\nDr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra exhibited a collection of Jain N\u00e0ga Paintings lately obtained from Rajputana.\n\nDr. Mitra said,\u2014the collection comprised two sets of paintings, representing the twenty-four T\u00edrthankaras of the Jains, and the other forty-eight J\u00ednas or forms of Jina. Artistically they were of no value, and as regards age, he thought, they could not be much more than a hundred and fifty years old, though the seller represented that they were much older. The first set, moreover, was very monotonous. The pictures, the grouping, the details of ornamentation, and the colouring, were alike in all the paintings. The principal image is a nude male, standing in a standing posture on a lotus, and having the hands hanging by the side. Below the lotus there is a throne, and on the rim of it there is the distinctive emblem of the saint, and it is different in every case; the colour of the images varies in some of the paintings, but the prevailing colour is yellow or gold. On each side of the image there is an attendant waving an ox-tail chaddar. The likeness of this attendant is the same in all the paintings, so that it is a man standing with joined hands on the right side. This person is said\n\n* The Palace Monastery of the Dalai Lama on the plain of Lhasa.\n\u2020 Apparently the place where the present Lama was discovered.\n\u2021 1st August, 1879.\n\u00a7 I do not recognize the appellation. The other three great incarnations are the Tesu Lama of Tibet, the Taranath Lama of Urga and the Changai Lama of Pekin.\nbe the king in whose reign the saint flourished. The name of the saint and that of the king are written in golden letters. As the first twenty-one or twenty-two Tirthankaras are believed by Oriental scholars to be apocryphal, conjured up to cast a halo of antiquity on the system of religion which the last two or three disseminated, (the last alone is a historical character,) it is not to be wondered at that there should be so much sameness in their likenesses; but as the history of Jainism is a matter of considerable importance, the pictures are of interest as containing the ideas of the Jains on the subject.\n\nThe following is a descriptive list of the saints, their colours, their emblems and the names of the different kings in whose reigns they flourished.\n\n| No. | Name            | Colour | Emblem       | Name of king in whose reign he flourished |\n|-----|-----------------|--------|--------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 1   | \u0100din\u0101tha.*      | Yellow | Bull         | Bharata Chakr\u012b                           |\n| 2   | Ajitan\u0101tha.     | Yellow | Elephant.    | Sagara Chakr\u012b                            |\n| 3   | Sambhavan\u0101tha.  | Yellow | Horse        | Satyav\u012brya.                              |\n| 4   | Abhinandana.    | Yellow | Monkey       | Mitrabh\u0101va.                              |\n| 5   | Sumatin\u0101tha.    | Yellow | Curlew       | Mitrav\u012brya.                              |\n| 6   | Padmaprabha.    | Red    | Red lotus    | Yamady\u016bti.                               |\n| 7   | Sup\u0101rvan\u0101tha.   | Yellow | Svastika.    | Dharmav\u012brya.                             |\n| 8   | Chandraprabha.  | Lead.\u2020 | Crescent.    | D\u0101nav\u012brya.                               |\n| 9   | Pushpadanta.    | White  | Crocodile.   | Meghavata.                               |\n| 10  | S\u012btalan\u0101tha.    | Yellow | \u015ar\u012bvatsa.\u00a7   | Simandha.                                |\n| 11  | \u015arey\u0101n\u0101san\u0101tha.  | Yellow | Rhinoceros.  | Tripi\u1e63\u1e6dha V\u0101sudeva.                     |\n| 12  | Vasup\u016bjya.      | Red    | Buffalo.     | Dvipi\u1e63\u1e6dha V\u0101sudeva.                     |\n| 13  | Vimalan\u0101tha.    | Yellow | Boar.        | Svayambhu V\u0101sudeva.                      |\n| 14  | Anant\u0101n\u0101tha.    | Yellow | Ram.\u00a7        | Purushottama V\u0101sudeva.                  |\n| 15  | Dharm\u0101n\u0101tha.    | Yellow | Spike-headed club | Pundarika V\u0101sudeva.                    |\n| 16  | S\u0101ntin\u0101tha.     | Yellow | Black antelope. | Purushadatta.                           |\n| 17  | Kunthan\u0101tha.    | Yellow | Goat.        | Kun\u0101la.                                  |\n| 18  | Aran\u0101tha.       | Yellow | Fish.||       | Govinda.                                 |\n\n* Alias Rishabha.\n\u2020 White according to Stevenson in the Preface to his translation of the Kalpa.\n\u2021 Diamond ditto.\n\u00a7 Falcon ditto.\n|| Nand\u0101varta ditto.\n19.

In it each picture has a likeness of a Jina seated cross-legged like a Buddha in meditation, with devotees seated around, and a scene of a forest, a garden, a river, wild animals, wars, or a combat in front. The figure of the Jina is not always the same, the colour varies in some cases, and in two instances there are three heads. Whether these peculiarities are intended to imply that the Jinas are different personages, or the same personage in different characters, Dr. Mitra could not make out. To each picture is attached a page of mantras in Sanskrit, and interpretations and instructions in M\u0101gadhi for the mode of reciting them. In these each Jina has a distinctive name.\n\nThe following are the names given:\n\nList of 48 Jinas.\n\n| No. | Name.                  | No. | Name.                      |\n|-----|------------------------|-----|----------------------------|\n| 1   | Bhakt\u0101mara.            | 19  | Dyutidiptimanmukha         |\n| 2   | Suralokasa\u00f1stuta.      | 20  | J\u00f1\u0101namaya.                 |\n| 3   | Vibudh\u0101rchitap\u0101dapitha.| 21  | Toshitahridaya.            |\n| 4   | Subodhi.               | 22  | Satputrad\u0101t\u0101.              |\n| 5   | Munindra.              | 23  | Paramapurusha.             |\n| 6   | Mukharita-bhakta.      | 24  | \u0100yaya.                     |\n| 7   | P\u0101pakshaya\u1e45kara.       | 25  | Purushottama.              |\n| 8   | Arhat.                 | 26  | Tribhuvan\u0101rtihara.          |\n| 9   | Astasamastadosha.      | 27  | Vin\u0101\u015bagu\u1e47a.                |\n| 10  | Bhuvanabhusha\u1e47a.       | 28  | A\u015bokatarupratih\u0101rya.       |\n| 11  | Animesh\u0101vilokan\u012bya.    | 29  | \u015ai\u1e45h\u0101sanapratih\u0101rya.       |\n| 12  | Sur\u016bpa.                | 30  | Ch\u0101marapratih\u0101rya.         |\n| 13  | Subhavaktra.           | 31  | Chhatratrayapratih\u0101rya.    |\n| 14  | Sas\u0101\u1e45kasubhragu\u1e47a.    | 32  | Dundubhipratih\u0101rya.        |\n| 15  | Manovivekarahita.      | 33  | Pushpavrishtipratih\u0101rya.   |\n| 16  | Sury\u0101tis\u0101yimahim\u0101.     | 34  | Bh\u0101ma\u1e47\u1e0dalapratih\u0101rya.      |\n| 17  | Sury\u0101tis\u0101yimahim\u0101.     | 35  | Divyadhvanipratih\u0101rya.     |\n| 18  | Chandramukha.          | 36  | Padmoparadhishthitacharana.|\n\n* Blue according to Rev.

Crookes' High Vacuum tubes such as were produced by the inventor at the Sheffield Meeting of the British Association in August last. Two points of great interest were especially noticed: the first is that contrary to our usual views of the electric current, the flow in these high vacua evidently proceeds from the negative pole of the inductorium. This was prettily shown by two different electrical Radiometers: their delicately balanced vanes were set in rapid rotatory motion by the recoil caused by the matter projected from their surfaces when made the negative electrode of a large Rhumkorff's Coil, whereas they remained stationary when made the positive electrode. One of these radiometers very clearly showed the dark space of mean molecular free path mentioned in Crookes' lecture on \"Radiant Matter.\"\n\nThe second phenomenon showing a departure from the ordinary laws of electrical manifestations, pointed out by Father Lafont, was the apparent inactivity of the positive pole. The negative pole seems totally indifferent towards it. In ordinary Geissler's tubes the luminous track finds always its way through most complicated windings, from positive to negative, in Crookes' tubes the flow of luminous matter is darted in space straight in front of the negative pole without rejoining the positive pole. This was evidenced by two tubes in one of which a little concave mirror projected a distinct focus on the surface of the glass in front of it, showing no tendency whatever to the positive electrode placed quite close but above the mirror.\n\nIn a second tube a distinct shadow was visible on the surface of the glass opposite the negative pole: the shadow being thrown by little glass-screens placed on the path of the atoms projected by the negative pole.\n\nThese and similar facts bid fair, when properly investigated, to give us a better and more intimate notion of the nature of electricity and also of the constitution of matter. Crookes himself sees in these tubes, matter in something like a fourth state, which he calls, after Faraday, the ultragaseous state. Father Lafont remarked that the well-known and somewhat puzzling phenomenon of stratification of light in Geissler's tubes, seems to be simply explained, by admitting that these alternations of obscure and vivid bands, are the result of the high rarefaction of the gases, permitting\nthe atoms to move through appreciable spaces (Crookes' dark space), before collision and light being produced.\n\nThe Natural History Secretary (Mr. Wood-Mason) drew attention to a remarkably fine head of *Ovis Poli* which had that day been presented to the Indian Museum by Major Biddulph, who had just brought it down from Gilgit. The horns measured nearly 68 inches along the outer curve, that is to say, more than 4 inches more, though from the more closely wound spiral which they described they were rather less in expanse, than those of the great head of the same species presented to the National Collection by Colonel T. E. Gordon, who procured it when he took part in the Second Yarkand Mission. Mr. Wood-Mason also exhibited a head of the Suleman form (*Capra megaceros*) of the 'Markhor' (*C. Falconeri*) to show the difference between its horns and those of a fine head of the Cashmere variety (*Capra Falconeri*) exhibited by Major Biddulph.\n\nMajor BIDDULPH said,\u2014the head to which Mr. Wood-Mason has called attention was sent in to me last year by the Chief of Hunza, in the northern part of whose territories great numbers of *Ovis Poli* are to be found. I cannot conceive that it will be easily possible to find a finer head than this, which is several inches longer than the one presented in 1875 to the British Museum by Lieut.-Colonel T. E. Gordon, as the measurements given below will show. This head, however, has not the horns quite so thick at the base, and they taper more gradually than in the British Museum head. They also measure slightly less from tip to tip. The strength of the neck muscles* must be enormous to allow of so great a weight being easily carried, and it is doubtless owing to this weight that the *O. Poli* and other great wild Sheep that I have noticed have a very erect carriage. A tape passed across from tip to tip shows that the muzzle of the animal must project considerably beyond the straight line, so that the native legend of animals dying on account of their not being able to feed by reason of the projection of their horns, cannot be true.\n\n| O.

A Collection of Hindi Roots, with remarks on their derivation and classification.\u2014By Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis collection contains upwards of 500 roots. They are divided into two classes, Primary and Secondary. The former contains roots which are identical with Sanskrit ones, though more or less disguised by phonetic modifications. These disguises are produced by various cases; 1, by phonetic permutation; e.g., chal or char \"walk\" = Skr. chal; kh\u00e1 \"eat\" = Skr. kh\u00e1d; paros \"distribute\" = Skr. parivesh;\u20142, by incorporation of the \"class-suffix\"; e.g., b\u00fajh \"know\" = Skr. budh + ya; bhanj \"break\" = Skr. bhanaj (bhaj); sun \"hear\" = Skr. \u015bru + nu; j\u00e1n \"know\" = Skr. j\u00f1\u00e1 + n\u00e1.\u20143, by incorporation of the passive suffix ya; e.g., lag \"belong\" = Skr. lag + ya; s\u012bkh \"irrigate\" = Skr. stok-ya;\u20144, by change of \"class\"; e.g., p\u00e1va \"obtain\" (VIth) = Skr. prap-nu (Vth); kara \"do\" (VIth) = Skr. kar-u (VIIth); j\u00e1na \"know\" (VIth) = Skr. j\u00f1\u00e1 + n\u00e1 (IXth);\u20145, by change of \"voice\"; e.g., bhaj \"break\" (act.) = Skr. bhaj-ya \"be broken\" (pass.); de \"give\" = Skr. diya (d\u00e1 + ya) \"be given\";\u20146, by addition of the pleonastic suffix api; e.g., suh\u00e1v \"be pleasant\" = Skr. sukha. Secondary roots are those, as to which there are no identical roots in Skr., though ultimately they can be traced to Skr. roots. Such roots are either 1, derivative; e.g., nah \"flow,\" from nah\u00e1 \"bathe\" = Skr. sn\u00e1; or 2, denominative; e.g., jam \"germinate,\" from Skr. noun janma \"birth,\" of Skr. root jan \"be born\"; paith \"enter,\" from Skr. participle pravisha \"entered,\" of Skr. root pravis \"enter\"; or 3, compound; e.g., chuk \"cease,\" from Skr. chyut + kr, of Skr. noun chyut \"flowing away\" and Skr. root kr \"make\"; rok \"hinder, stop,\" from Skr. rut + kr, of Skr. noun rudh \"hindering\" and root kr; kasak \"pain,\" from Skr. kasha + kr. There remain a small number of roots, which it is not possible at present to bring under either of the two classes; e.g., dho \"carry.\"\n\nDr. R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra thought the paper laid on the table was worthy of special note. It treated of a subject of great importance in connexion with the philology of the Indian vernaculars, and, knowing how ably its learned author had discussed the comparative grammar of the Sanskritic dialects in his papers on the so-called Gaudian languages published in the Society's Journal, Dr. Mitra had no doubt that the contribution now\nreceived would prove equally interesting. He had no opportunity of reading the paper, and was not aware of the exact direction it had taken; but its title appeared to him misleading. It suggested to him the previous question, was there such a thing as a Hindi root distinct from Sanskrit roots? Of course there were in Hindi, as in other vernaculars, a great many nominal roots formed from nouns, in the same way in which in English the noun cane produced caning; but he did not refer to them. By roots he meant radicals of verbs originally implying action, and not names of things. In this sense he believed there were no Hindi roots as distinct from Sanskrit roots, or in other words, the roots of the Hindi, as of all other Aryan dialects of India, were derived from the Sanskrit. Even as the Sanskrit nouns and other vocables had, under climatic and other influences, gradually undergone wear and tear in different ways till they resulted in the vernaculars, so had the roots; and the transition was entirely governed by the laws of phonetic decay and dialectic regeneration. For instance the Vedic bhu 'to be,' changed to ho in the Hindi,\u2014the change commenced at a very early age and is still traceable, though rarely, in some Vedic and other ancient writings\u2014so did all the other roots which were required for the derivative dialects. In the course of his reading Dr. Mitra had not found a single Hindi root which could not be shown to be a decayed or regenerated Sanskrit radical, and he believed that an enquiry into Hindi roots for philological purposes must necessarily be the same as an enquiry into the decay and regeneration of the phonetic elements of a language. Whether this was the line of Dr Hoernle's enquiry or not he was not aware, but he thought it well to point out the misleading character of the title.\n\nDr. Hoernle explained that Dr. Mitra's remarks were founded on a misapprehension of the scope of his paper, the points of view in which did not materially differ from those expressed by Dr. Mitra. He understood by roots the constant element in any series of sense-related words; thus in the Hindi words bol\u00ee \"speech,\" bolat \"speaking,\" bolai \"he speaks,\" bolavat or bolav\u00e1 \"calling,\" bol is the constant element or root. Hindi, like every other language, had such roots. The object of the paper was to collect these Hindi roots, to discuss the various ways of their derivation from Sanskrit or elsewhere, and to classify them accordingly.\n\n2.
