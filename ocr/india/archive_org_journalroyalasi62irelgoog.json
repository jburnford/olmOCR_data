I.\u2014Chinese Translations of the Milinda Panho.\nBy J. Takakusu.\n\nI. The number of the Chinese translations in existence.\n   With a translation of the introduction contained in one translation.\n\nII. The date of the two translations.\n   With an examination of the existing catalogues of the Chinese Buddhist Books.\n\nIII. The story of the discussions between the King (Milinda) and Bhikshu N\u0101gasena found in a Buddhist s\u016btra called \"Samyukta-ratna-pitaka.\"\n\nThe above has been written to clear up the doubtful points concerning the Chinese translation as mentioned by Prof. Rhys Davids in his Introduction to the \"Milinda\" II, pp. xi\u2013xvii.\n\nThe Story of King Milinda and N\u0101gasena the Sage.\n\nThe \"Questions of Milinda\" is, according to Professor Rhys Davids, to whose labour the production of an authentic translation of the work is due, of its kind (that is, as a book\nof apologetic controversy), the best in point of style that had then been written in any country, and it is the masterpiece of Indian prose. This interesting book, originally written in Northern India, at or a little after the beginning of the Christian era, has been entirely lost in the land of its origin, but it has been translated into P\u0101li and Chinese, and from P\u0101li into Sinhalese, and much commented in Burma and Siam. For a study of the history of the \"Questions of King Milinda\" it is important to gather all the information about the work itself, about King Milinda, or Bhikshu N\u0101gasena, and to inquire as to how early the memory of the king goes back, or how long the same has survived in India. We have been very fortunate to have that interesting paper of MM. Sylvain L\u00e9vi and Ed. Specht on the Chinese translations of the Milinda. M. S. L\u00e9vi has further discovered that a reference to the Milinda was not only in the commentary, but also in the text of the Abhidharma-ko\u015ba-vy\u0101khy\u0101 of Vasubandhu. The actual words of the reference have been published by M. L\u00e9on Feer in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1891, p. 476. Mr. Schiefner has found a statement in a Tibetan work that a schism took place under a Thera N\u0101gasena 137 years after the Buddha's death. But it is not certain whether he is our N\u0101gasena.\n\nProfessor Serge d'Oldenbourg, of St. Petersburg, has pointed out that the two Cambridge MSS. of Kshemendra's Bodhisattvavat\u0101na-kalpalata mention incidentally the name Milinda (not \"Millinda,\" as given by R\u0101jendra L\u0101l Mitra).\n\n---\n\n1 See Rhys Davids, Introduction to Milinda I, p. xi, \"Sacred Books of the East,\" vol. xxxv; compare the same, pp. xxii, xxiii, \"Milinda must have reigned for a considerable time in the latter half of the second century B.C., probably from about 140 to about 115, or even 110 B.C.\"\n\n2 The Chinese may represent a different original, as MM. S. L\u00e9vi and E. Specht think, or a portion of a text of P\u0101li recension mixed with a comment or notes made in Siam or somewhere else. These points will become clear when the promised translation of the above two scholars has been laid before us.\n\n3 See the Proceedings of the Ninth Oriental Congress, 1892, vol. i, pp. 520-529.\n\n4 That a reference is in the commentary has been pointed out by Burnouf in his \"Introduction,\" etc., p. 570.\n\n5 See Milinda, part i, p. xxvi, and part ii, p. xvii.\n\n6 Note to his translation of T\u0101ran\u0101tha, p. 298.\nSome other important references by Buddhaghosa and others, and the relation of our work to the Kath\u0101 Vatthu, Brahma-j\u0101la sutta, and other books, have been minutely discussed by Professor Rhys Davids himself, and all are found well put together in his two introductions to the Milinda, parts i and ii.\n\nSeveral points, however, remain still to be cleared up. All those points relating to the Chinese translation of the work will, I hope, be further discussed by MM. S. L\u00e9vi and Specht in their forthcoming translation of the Chinese text, i.e. \"N\u0101-Sien-Bhikshu King.\"\u00b9\n\nIt is true that Bunyu Nanjio says in his catalogue, as pointed out by Prof. Rhys Davids, that it was \"translated under the Eastern Tsin dynasty, A.D. 317\u2013420\"; while MM. S. L\u00e9vi and E. Specht tell us that one of the two translations was inserted in the Korean collection made in that country A.D. 1010, and the other was printed in the Collection of Buddhist Books, published under the Sung, A.D. 1239.\u00b2 The difference of these statements, though it may seem very great, is not, after all, very difficult to be accounted for. But before we try to speak about the date of the translation we must decide how many translations now exist in Chinese.\n\nI. It is certain that we have two distinct translations of the Milinda among Chinese Buddhist Books. But have we a third?\n\nProfessor Rhys Davids has pointed out that there seems to be a third Chinese translation besides the two mentioned in the paper above referred to, and further doubts whether there must not be a fourth to explain all the different statements of Nanjio and Specht.\n\nNow as to the first two. The new Japanese edition (published in Tokyo, 1883\u2014Bodleian Jap. 65) of Chinese Buddhist Books contains two translations of the Milinda,\n\n\u00b9 Bunyu Nanjio's Catalogue of the Chinese Translation of Buddhist Books, No. 1358.\n\u00b2 Milinda, part ii, p. xii (S.B.E. xxxvi).\none in two volumes, the other in three. These two are, in all probability, the same as those mentioned in the paper of MM. S. L\u00e9vi and Specht. This edition was based on the Korean edition of A.D. 1010, and collated from five different editions published in China and Japan. The Japanese editors have recognized that these two translations were distinct works, and inserted the two together in their new edition. Whether the two texts in the Japanese edition are the same as those in Paris\\(^1\\) or not, it is certain that we have two different translations of the work in question.\n\nNow, have we a third translation, besides these two contained in the Japanese edition?\n\nProfessor Serge d'Oldenbourg told Professor Rhys Davids that the introduction contained in the Chinese translation of the Milinda, which was further translated into Russian by Mr. Ivanovsky, was a sort of J\u0101taka story, in which the Buddha appeared as a white elephant.\\(^2\\) The copy in the India Office Collection (Chinese Miscellaneous, Case 67\\(^4\\)) consists of three volumes, the first of which has an introduction relating to the former births of Milinda and N\u0101gasena.\n\nIn this introduction we have something about an Elephant-king representing Milinda's former birth, but not the Buddha's. As it is important to identify the India Office copy with one of the texts in Paris, or with the Russian translation just referred to, I have thought it best to give the introduction in question in the following pages, by means of which, perhaps, Professor Serge d'Oldenbourg or M. Ed. Specht will be able to see from a comparison with their own books whether or no the India Office copy is identical with one of theirs.\\(^3\\)\n\nIn any case, it would be very interesting to decide to which class the India Office copy belongs.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Very likely they are the same: see below.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Rhys Davids, Introduction, Milinda II, p. xi. He thinks that, as there is nothing about this curious introduction in either of M. Specht's papers, it seems possible that there are really three Chinese books on the \"Milinda.\"\n\n\\(^3\\) The importance of this identification has been emphasized by Professor Rhys Davids, Milinda II, p. xii, note.\nI here give a translation of the introduction contained in the India Office text of the Milinda.\n\nThe S\u016btra on the Bhikshu N\u0101-Sien.\u00b9\n\n(No. 1358 in Nanjio's Catalogue\u2014Chinese Miscellaneous, Case 67\u00b9 [26].)\n\n\"The translator's name is lost, and we register this work as belonging to the Easter Tsin dynasty (A.D. 317\u2013420).\"\u00b2\n\n\u00b3The Buddha (once) dwelt in \u015ar\u0101vasti, in the grove of Jeta, in the gardens of An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dada.\u2074 At that time all the Bhikshu Sa\u1e45gha, Bhikshun\u012bs, Up\u0101sakas, Up\u0101sik\u0101s, all the kings of heaven, great ministers, rich men and other people, and also those who pursue the (heretic) doctrines of 96 varieties, altogether to the number of more than 10,000, daily attended the Buddha to hear his religious discourse (s\u016btr\u0101nta). It occurred to the Buddha: \"The assembly of men here is great from day to day, and my body cannot be at ease.\" The Buddha's wish was to forsake the assembly of men and retire into a quiet place, where he could sit down, contemplate, and meditate on the path. The Buddha then deserted the assembly of men, and retired to a mountain in the thicket of Kiao-lo\u2075 trees.

Not far from the forest there were elephants to the number of more than 500. The elephant-king was wise and good, and able to judge what is good or bad; their manners resembling those of men. All the elephants used to surround the king; among them there were male and female, long-toothed, middle-toothed, and small-toothed.\\(^1\\) Whenever the elephant-king, being thirsty, wished to go and drink water, all the smaller elephants ran before the king and entered the water and drank it. After that, they would sport with water, running about, stirring up, or fishing in, the water, and make it turbid and impure, and the result was that the king could not drink any pure water. Whenever the king, being hungry, wanted to go and eat grass, all the small elephants used to run before him and eat all the beautiful grass, and sport, running about, jumping, treading on the grass, and the king himself could not eat fresh grass at all. The elephant-king thereupon thought to himself: \"My companions are too many, and I regret that all the elephants and their young ones would stir up water (before I drink), thereby making it turbid, or eat grass before me, making it impure (by treading on); and I have always to drink impure water and eat trodden-down grass. What if I abandoned all the elephants and retired to a quiet place where I can be happy?\" Thereupon the king abandoned the assembly, went to a mountain, and came to the thicket of the Kiao-lo trees. (As it happened to be the place where the Buddha was) he saw the Buddha there sitting under a tree. Then, greatly rejoicing in his heart, he came before the Buddha, bowed, knelt down, and worshipped the Buddha; and retired to one side and remained there. The Buddha then thought to himself: \"I have abandoned my companions and have come here in the forest; the elephant has also forsaken his retinue and is come here in the same place. Thus we have come here for exactly the same purpose.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) These may be \"advanced in age,\" \"middle-aged,\" and \"young.\"\nThe Buddha then gave a religious discourse (s\u016btr\u0101nta) for the sake of the elephant-king, and said: \"A Buddha is the most honoured among men, and the elephant-king is the most honoured among elephants.\" Further: \"My intention is similar to that of (you) the elephant-king; I shall be happy being together with the elephant in the forest.\"\n\nWhen the elephant heard the religious discourse his mind was enlightened, and he understood what the Buddha meant, and, looking towards the Buddha, he wandered about the Buddha's walking-place (Ca\u1e45krama).\u00b9 Now he would draw water with his nose and water the ground, then he would pluck some grass with his nose and sweep the place, or he would make the ground flat and good by treading on it. The elephant-king served the Buddha in this way every day from morning till evening. Some time afterwards the Buddha took the quiet path of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a\u00b2 and disappeared.\n\nThe elephant did not know where the Buddha was, and, therefore, he wandered about to look for the Buddha, but without success. Thereupon he wept, cried, and was full of sorrow, without any enjoyment; he did not even eat or drink.\n\nAt that time there was a Buddhist monastery on a mountain in the country. It was called \"Ka-la-y\u00fcan,\"\u00b3 and had 500 \u015arama\u1e47as living in it, who all were Arhats. They used to recite s\u016btras on the six fast-days, every month. (One day) at dawn the elephant-king was also on the mountain, and came near the monastery. He noticed that there was a recitation of s\u016btras on the six fast-days, and\n\n\u00b9 Ca\u1e45krama here, of course, cannot be a \"covered walk.\" I-tsing, a Chinese traveller in India (A.D. 671\u2013695), mentions \"Ca\u1e45krama\" of the N\u0101landa monastery in his \"Record of Buddhist Practices in India and the Islands of the Southern Sea,\" a translation of which will soon be published by the Clarendon Press in the Aneclota Oxoniensia series. For \"Ca\u1e45krama,\" see also Mah\u0101vagga v, 1, 14, note 2; \"Sacred Books of the East,\" vol. xvii.\n\n\u00b2 \u7121\u70ba\u6ce5\u6d39\u9053, lit. \"Actionless Nirv\u0101\u1e47a Path.\"\n\n\u00b3 K\u0101lavana?\ncame to the monastery every fast-day in order to hear s\u016btras recited.\n\nAll the \u015arama\u1e47as knew that the elephant was glad to hear the rehearsal, and waited each time until he came among them.\n\nWhile hearing the recitation of s\u016btras he would not sleep, or lie, or move, or tremble all the night. As the elephant often heard the exposition of the s\u016btras and served the Buddha, he was born, as a man, afterwards when his long life as elephant had come to an end. He was born in the family of a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a; he did not hear of the Buddha or of a s\u016btra, nor did he see any \u015arama\u1e47as. He left his family, went in a deep forest, and lived there learning the path of a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. At about the same time there was another hermit Br\u0101hma\u1e47a in the same forest; and the two visited each other and made acquaintance.\n\nOne of the two thought to himself: \"I am disgusted with the human life, with the district magistrate,\\(^1\\) with the conditions of sorrow, suffering, old age, sickness, and death; after death we are to fall into hell, or become a hungry spirit (preta), or an animal, or live a poor and miserable life when born as a man. Therefore, I will shave my hair and beard, and become a \u015arama\u1e47a, wearing a K\u0101sh\u0101ya (yellow robe), and seek after the quiet path (Nirv\u0101\u1e47a), which is (the means of) saving the world.\" The other Br\u0101hma\u1e47a also thought to himself: \"I wish to be a sovereign, possessed of might and power, and to let all the people under heaven follow me and obey my command and instruction.\"\n\nSome time after they both made these vows they died, and were reborn again in the world as men. The one, who had wished to become a sovereign in his former life, was born as the crown-prince to a king (in a country) bordering on the sea. His parents named him \"Mi-lan.\"\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This is very curious; \u7e23\u5b98 may be for \u7e23\u7a7a \"lodged in mid-air,\" as an adjective to the \"human life.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) \"Lan\" is never used for \"lin\" in transcribing a Sanskrit word, but used almost exclusively for \"lan\" or \"ran.\" This shows that the original had\nother, who had wished to pursue the quiet path of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, which is (the means of) saving the world, was born in Tien-chu (Sindhu as a name for India), in the district of Ka\u1e63m\u012bra. His parents named him \"Da-la\" (Dh\u0101ra?). He was born wearing a K\u0101sh\u0101ya (yellow robe), in consequence of his vow made in his former life. In his house there was an elephant which was born on the same day as he. As elephant is called n\u0101 (for n\u0101ga) in Tien-chu (Sindhu, India), the parents again named their son \"N\u0101-sien\" (N\u0101ga-sena).\n\nSo far about the former births of Milinda and N\u0101gasena. Then the introduction goes on relating something about N\u0101gasena's uncle \"Lo-han\" (Rohana).\u00b9 N\u0101gasena goes to his uncle and asks to be made a \u015arama\u1e47a. He becomes a \u015arama\u1e47era, and receives the ten precepts (\u015b\u012bla). In his 20th year he goes to a temple called \"Ho-shan\" (probably Vattaniya), and receives the great precepts (\u015b\u012bla) from the head of the 500 Arhats, the venerable O-pei (or A-pi). The assembly points out that N\u0101gasena alone among them is not yet an Arhat, and, therefore, N\u0101gasena intends to leave the assembly. O-pei exhorts him. Another teacher of N\u0101gasena, Ka-vi by name, 80 years old, orders the latter to go with water full in his mouth to the house of an Up\u0101saka, who asks him to preach a sermon. N\u0101gasena preaches the Law, having emptied his mouth against his teacher's order. As a result of his sermon, the Up\u0101saka as well as N\u0101gasena himself obtain the fruition of Sot\u0101panna\u00b2 (Srota\u0101panna, the first of the four stages of the Path). His teacher, Ka-vi, wants to expel him on the ground of his\n\nMi-lan or Me-lan as its first part, not Mi-lin or Me-lin. St. Julien's \"M\u00e9thode pour Transcrire les Noms Sanscrits en Chinoise\" also does not give any instance of \"lan\" being used for any Skt. syllable, but \"lam,\" \"lan,\" or \"ran\" (including \"la\" or \"ra\"): see p. 136.\n\n\u00b9 For Rohana, see Rhys Davids, Milinda I, p. 13 sqq.\n\n\u00b2 The four grades are\u2014(1) Sot\u0101panna, (2) Sakatag\u0101min, (3) An\u0101g\u0101min, (4) Arhat. See Childers, s.v. nibb\u0101nam, p. 268, and Max M\u00fcller's \"Diamond Cutter,\" IX (S.B.E. vol. xlix, part ii), p. 120, note 2.\ndisobedience to his teacher; the head of the assembly, O-pei (or A-pi), protests against the proposal, but in vain. N\u0101gasena, being sad, retires to a mountain and finally becomes an Arhat. He then appears once again before the 500 Arhats, who have expelled him, and apologizes for his former fault, but does not stay there. He makes a preaching excursion, and his fame spreads all over India. He comes to S\u0101-ga (S\u0101gala), of Tien-chu (Sindhu), and remains at the temple of I-ti-ka.\n\nMi-lan (Milinda), on the other hand, studies with diligence s\u016btras and also heretic systems, and afterwards succeeds to the throne, in a country bordering on the sea, and asks publicly if there is anyone who can discuss the doctrines of the s\u016btras with him. The ministers tell him that in the North there are \u015arama\u1e47as who are wise and learned, and can discuss with him. One of his courtiers, Chan-mi-li-wang-chun, introduces a \u015arama\u1e47a, Ya-ho-la (\u0100yup\u0101la). Milinda begins his question with the comparative merit of homeless life, and the life of a layman, as to the final result, i.e. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a. As the \u015arama\u1e47a has answered that both can produce one and the same result, the king further questions why then he (\u0100yup\u0101la) has become a \u015arama\u1e47a, seeing that a \u015arama\u1e47a is not different from an Up\u0101saka so far as the final result is concerned. Ya-ho-la (\u0100yup\u0101la) is silenced after one or two questions. Chan-mi-li again introduces N\u0101-sien (N\u0101gasena), whose knowledge included the twelve divisions of the Sacred Books and the ninety-six systems of heretics.\n\nWhen the two meet, the \"Questions of Milinda\" proper begin at folio 9b of the India Office text, so that the introduction occupies really nine leaves of the Chinese book.\n\nThis India Office copy has in all fifty-nine leaves, 22,651\n\n---\n\n1 See Milinda, part i, p. 30.\n2 Ibid., p. 31.\n3 Heretic doctrines are said to be ninety-six or ninety-five. In the Brahma-j\u0101la s\u016btra sixty-two views are enumerated, as can be seen in Rhys Davids' Milinda II, pp. xxiii\u2013xxv. Of its two Chinese translations, the one made in A.D. 222\u2013280 (Nanjio's Catal. 654) is called \"Brahma-j\u0101la s\u016btra on the 62 views\"; but the other, of A.D. 406 (Nanjio's Catal. 1087), is called simply Brahma-j\u0101la s\u016btra. The latter belongs to the Mah\u0101y\u0101na and the former to the H\u012bnay\u0101na.\n(besides the title and the editor's remarks) Chinese characters, and it is pretty clear that it is the same text as that in the Sung collection in Paris, which has, according to MM. S. L\u00e9vi and Ed. Specht, 22,657 characters.\\(^1\\) If this be the case, we can only reasonably assume that there are only two different texts among the five copies in France and England, two in Paris, two in Oxford, and one in London, as shown in the following table:\n\nA.\n\n1. The longer text in Paris, 22,657 characters, the Sung edition of A.D. 1239, mentioned by MM. L\u00e9vi and Specht. This would be the same as the following, if the above introduction and other points agree.\n\n2. The India Office copy (the old Japanese edition of 1681), the introduction of which is translated above, 22,651 characters, in three volumes. This copy is the same as the following.\n\n3. The longer text in the new Japanese edition of Buddhist Books of 1883 in Bodleian Library, Oxford, in three volumes.\n\nB.\n\n1. The shorter text in Paris, 13,752 characters, the Korean edition of A.D. 1010, mentioned by MM. L\u00e9vi and Specht. As the new Japanese edition is based on the same Korean edition of A.D. 1010, this will in all probability be the same as the following.\n\n2. The shorter text in the new Japanese edition of 1883 in Bodleian Library, Oxford, in two volumes.\n\nThus we have two different translations of the Milinda, though the originals may have been one and the same text. There only remains the Chinese original of the Russian translation of Professor Ivanovsky, which has something about a \"white elephant\" representing the Buddha's former\n\n\\(^1\\) See Rhys Davids' Introduction, Milinda II, p. xii.\nbirth, as told by Professor Serge d'Oldenbourg (Sergej fedorovi\u010d Oldenburg).\n\nIt is to be hoped that Professor d'Oldenbourg himself will clear up this point by comparing the text he has seen with the above translation of the Introduction contained in the India Office copy, and decide whether we have a third copy or not.\n\nII. The date of the existing Chinese translations of the \"Questions of Milinda.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, Chinese translators are very particular about the date of their translations; at least they give their own names, stating also to which dynasty they belong. And a subsequent collector of the Sacred Books will register exactly in which year and in what place the translations have been made, so far as he can ascertain. But the translation of the \"Milinda\" is unfortunately an exception. No authors of the fourteen or fifteen Catalogues of Chinese Buddhist Books, which have come down to us, know who has been the translator of the \"Milinda.\" When the first catalogue, whether Chinese or Korean, which inserted the translation, was made, the memory of the date of its production must have already been vague, and the authors of that catalogue must have stated that the translator's name had been lost. But as some catalogues seem to have been lost, we cannot say with certainty which catalogue inserted it for the first time. All the existing catalogues, in which the \"Milinda\" is mentioned, do not know the translator or the date of the translation, and all state that the translator's name has been lost, or omit the translator's name; and as the authors were not certain of the date, they \"registered it as belonging to the Eastern Tsin dynasty (A.D. 317-420).\" The authors of the earliest catalogue, in which the \"Milinda\" is inserted, may have had some ground in believing that it belonged to the Eastern Tsin dynasty. Mr. Bunyu Nanjio simply gives the above date\nwithout any remarks. But in any case this date is very questionable, for the first existing catalogue, made in A.D. 520, does not mention any translation of the Milinda, as may be seen from the following table, which has been made from my cursory inspection of all those catalogues in the new Japanese edition (1883) of the Buddhist Books.\n\nCATALOGUES OF CHINESE BUDDHIST BOOKS.\n\nThe 'Questions of Milinda.'\n\n| Name of Catalogues | Date of their Compilation |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|\n| 1. The Record of the Translations of the Tripitaka | A.D. 520. |\n| 2. The Kh\u00e2i-yuen Shih-chiao-lu | A.D. 730. |\n| 3. The Ch\u00eang-yuen Hsin-ting Shih-chiao mulu | A.D. 785\u2013804. |\n\nIn this earliest catalogue in existence we do not find any 'Milinda' which is said to have been translated in A.D. 317\u2013420. Had it then existed, it must have escaped from the compiler's notice.\n\nIn this it is said: \"N\u00e2-sien-Bhikshu S\u00fbtra, two vols. It is sometimes called 'N\u00e2-sien S\u00fbtra'; it is sometimes said to be 'three vols.'\" (See Bodleian, Jap. 65rd, No. 1485, vol. xx, p. 53b.)\n\nIt says: \"N\u00e2-sien Bhikshu S\u00fbtra, two vols., or simply called 'N\u00e2-sien S\u00fbtra'; sometimes said to be '3 vols.' The translator's name is lost, and we register it as belonging to the Eastern Tsin dynasty (A.D. 317\u2013420).\"\n\n---\n\n1 Bodelian Library. Japanese, 65rd.\n2 Nanjio's Catal., p. xxvii (1). All the contents of this Catalogue have been given by Nanjio in his Catalogue, pp. xiii\u2013xvii.\n3 Nanjio's Catal., p. xxvii (8).\n4 There seems to have been two translations, and the compiler of the catalogue may have taken them to be one and the same translation (the difference not being very great).\n5 Not in Nanjio's Catalogue.

Two other catalogues,\\(^3\\) the date of which is not at present certain, mention the \u2018Milinda,\u2019 one as \u2018two vols,\u2019 the other as \u2018three vols.\u2019 The two catalogues are not found in the India Office collection.\n\n7. In all the remaining catalogues I have not seen the \u2018Milinda\u2019 mentioned.\n\nThe result of the above examination is only this, that we possessed a translation of the \u2018Milinda\u2019 in A.D. 730, when the catalogue (above 2) was made. The catalogue of A.D. 520 does not know of the book, and the subsequent writers of the catalogues of A.D. 594, 597, 602, 664, and 695,\\(^4\\) do not seem to have had any translation of the \u2018Milinda.\u2019\n\nAs I have left Oxford for some time I cannot make a further examination of the Japanese edition of Buddhist books. At present we can only state with certainty that a translation of the \u2018Milinda,\u2019 either the one in two vols. or the other in three vols., must have been made before A.D. 730.\n\nSo far about the catalogues. Now we must examine those different editions of Buddhist books themselves.\n\nThe Chinese Buddhist Books (so-called \u2018Tripitaka,\u2019 though they contain a number of books outside the Tripitaka) existed\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Nanjio\u2019s Catal., p. xxvii (11).\n\\(^2\\) Ibid.

This first edition very likely contained a 'Milinda,' for an earlier catalogue mentions a translation of the 'Milinda' (as we have seen above).\n\nThe second printed publication was made in Korea in A.D. 1010, in which a translation of the 'Milinda' in a shorter form (13,752 characters in two vols.) was inserted, as M. Specht told us.\u00b9 The third edition of the Sacred Books was completed in A.D. 1239 in China under the Southern Sung dynasty (A.D. 1127\u20131280). In this there is a translation of the 'Milinda' in a longer form (22,657 characters, in three vols.).\u00b2\n\nAn old Japanese edition (the tenth publication, in A.D. 1678\u20131681), which is the India Office copy, has the 'Milinda' in three vols. (22,651 characters, in three vols.). This edition was copied from a Chinese edition of A.D. 1586\u20131606 (the eighth publication), which had also been copied from a still earlier Chinese edition of A.D. 1403\u20131424 (the sixth publication). All these must have had the same copy of the 'Milinda.'\n\nThe new Japanese edition (the thirteenth edition) of 1883,\u00b3 which can be read in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, has two copies of the 'Milinda,' one in two vols., the other in three, as we have seen before.\n\nThus we can see that not only the two editions which MM. S. L\u00e9vi and Ed. Specht mention, but also all the existing editions of the Chinese Buddhist Books published in China, Korea, or Japan, have a copy of the 'Milinda,' either short or long.\n\nAll I have given above may have come under the notice of the two able scholars of Paris. But as I know that we are often hampered by the inconvenience of not having all\n\n\u00b9 See Milinda, part ii, p. xii.\n\u00b2 See the same as above.\n\u00b3 For the thirteenth edition of Buddhist Books, see Nanjio's Catalogue, p. xxviii.\nthe existing texts before us, and as I happened to see the two Japanese editions existing in England, I thought it best to notice chiefly the point which Prof. Rhys Davids desired to be decided. Though I have often been tempted to go into the matters contained in the discussions of Milinda and N\u0101gasena themselves, I have nevertheless refrained from doing so, wishing not to encroach upon the work promised by MM. S. L\u00e9vi and Ed. Specht, whose fruitful research will soon be laid before us.\n\nIn conclusion, may I notice that there is a s\u016btra called \"Samyukta-ratna-pitaka-s\u016btra,\" or \"Ts\u00ea-p\u00e2o-Ts\u00e2ng-King\" (Nanjio's Catalogue, No. 1329), which gives a tale (avad\u0101na) about the King interlocutor and Bhikshu N\u0101gasena. This s\u016btra contains 121 different stories of every description, and is divided into eight volumes. Some of the avad\u0101nas are like J\u0101taka stories, while others are a curtailed form of the traditions relating to Buddha and his disciples.\n\nThe Avad\u0101na CXI in vol. viii gives the story of Milinda. The king is, however, called \"Nanda\"\u00b9 there, not Milinda; the Bhikshu, \"N\u0101-ka-ss\u016b-na.\"\u00b2 We have seen above that in the Chinese translation of the Milinda, the king is Milan, and the Bhikshu, N\u0101-sien. If the introduction in Chinese had not mentioned that in India an elephant is called n\u0101 (for n\u0101ga), we might have hesitated to identify n\u0101 with n\u0101ga (and n\u0101-sien with n\u0101gasena). But this avad\u0101na which I am now speaking of has an exact transcription, \"N\u0101-ka-ss\u016b-na,\" the identification of which no one can doubt. As to the king's name, it is very interesting to see its form represented in many ways. The original is Menander, and we have \"Mi-lan,\" \"Milinda,\" and here in our case \"Nanda,\" which, I think, represents \"Menander\" in its disguised form, or at any rate a part of the syllables \"Menander.\" In any case the variety of the representation of the name shows that the original was not a native name. Dr. Trenckner\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 \u96e3\u9640.\n\u00b2 \u90a3\u4f3d\u65af\u90a3.\n\u00b3 P\u0101li Miscellany, part i, p. 65.\nand Professor Rhys Davids have discussed the transition of Menander to Milinda, and the identification of the two names is now \"as clear as that of Candagutta with Sandrokottos.\"\n\n\"Nanda,\" of our book, again confirms the identification representing the original in quite a different way. This s\u016btra, having a comparatively early date, shows us that the memory of the story of the King Nanda-Milinda and the sage N\u0101gasena still survived in the time of the author of the Original Avad\u0101nas (which was translated into Chinese in A.D. 472), and induced him to bring their famous discussion in his tales.\n\nI give in the following pages a translation of the Avad\u0101na in question. The date of the Samyukta-ratna-pi\u1e6daka s\u016btra is, as we have just seen, as early as A.D. 472, and may be much earlier than the Chinese translations of parts of the \"Milinda\" itself.\n\nIII.\u2014The Samyukta-ratna-pi\u1e6daka s\u016btra.\n\nTranslated by Ki-\u1e33ia-ye (Kinkara), an Indian \u015brama\u1e47a, and Th\u00e2n-y\u00e3o, a Chinese priest of the Northern Wei dynasty (A.D. 386-534).

Avad\u0101na CXI.\n\nThe Discussion between King Nanda and N\u0101gasena.\n\nThe King Nanda of old was an intelligent and well-informed man, and there was nothing in which he was not skilled. He thought to himself that what he knew was (so wide that) no one could surpass. Thereupon he asked his ministers if there were a man of great wisdom, intelligence, and eloquence, who could answer any question that might be asked by him.\n\n1 Milinda, part i, pp. xviii, xix.\nAt that time there was a minister\\(^1\\) who was accommodating and supporting an old Bhikshu\\(^2\\) for some time. The Bhikshu was not of wide learning, but his conduct was very pure. He had then an interview with the king.\n\nThe King asked: Can one find out the truth (lit. \"win the way\") while living at home, or is it necessary to become a homeless one?\n\nThe Old Bhikshu answered: Yes, both can obtain the same path.\n\nThe King: If so, why have you left your home?\n\nThe Old Bhikshu was silent, for he did not know how to answer.\\(^3\\)\n\nThereupon Nanda became more proud and conceited than ever.\n\nThen the ministers told the king that there was a Bhikshu named N\u0101gasena, who was endowed with an unequalled intelligence and wisdom, who was at that time living in a forest. The king wished to try him. Accordingly he sent a messenger to him and presented him a jug which was \"full\" of ghee. The king meant that his own wisdom was so \"full\" that no one could add to it or excel him. N\u0101gasena on receiving the ghee understood what was meant by it. He then collected 500 needles from his disciples and put them into the ghee, without causing it to overflow. He sent the jug (with both ghee and needles in) back to the king, who also understood what was meant by the action. Again the king sent a messenger to invite N\u0101gasena, who soon came to the king according to his command. N\u0101gasena was tall and fat, and was above the average height, and consequently noticeable.\n\nThe king was proud and haughty (he would not receive the Bhikshu at home), and falsely declared that he would see him on the way, as he would be going a-hunting. But when he saw from afar that N\u0101gasena was gentle and tall, the king took another way (and shunned him). So he did not speak\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Chan-mi-li-wang-chun by name, according to the Chinese text of Milinda.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u0100yup\u0101la by name, according to the P\u0101li text, and Ya-ho-la (\u0100yup\u0101la) in the Chinese text.\n\n\\(^3\\) Compare Rhys Davids, Milinda, part i, p. 32 (S.B.E. vol. xxxv).\nwith the Bhikshu, and wished to defeat him by silence. No one (lit. \"no householder\") knew what was meant by him (in so avoiding the meeting). N\u0101gasena, however, said to himself, pointing to his own breast with his finger: \"I alone know it.\"\n\nNow King Nanda was about to call N\u0101gasena to his palace, and prepared a small room, and made its door very small and low so that Sena might, he hoped, bend his body and throw himself prostrate before the throne.\u00b9 But this Sena knew the king's wish of ensnaring him (and making him bow before the throne); and (to avoid this) Sena entered the room backwards.\n\nKing Nanda next prepared food and drink for him. First he gave him a roughly cooked food. Sena ate three or five spoonfuls of each course, and said: \"I had enough.\" Afterwards the king gave him a fine and delicious food, and N\u0101gasena ate it. The king thereupon questioned him, saying: \"You said that you had enough; why is it that you eat again as before?\" \"I had enough of the rough food, but not of the fine food,\" was the answer. Further, he illustrated his meaning to the king in this wise: \"Now let all the men in the Court come to the hall, so that no room is left there for anyone.\" So all the men in the Court were called together, the hall was filled by them, and there was no more room left for anyone. The king came afterwards and wanted to enter the hall. All those present were afraid of the king and made room for him by pressing one another (lit. \"by contracting their bodies\"); and then there was room for many more.\n\nSena said to the king: \"The rough food is like the subjects, and the fine food like the king: who among the subjects would not keep out of the way when they see the king coming?\"\n\nThe king then questioned: Which of the two, i.e. he who had gone forth from his home (pravrajita) and he who remains at home (up\u0101saka), will reach the path?\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps N\u0101gasena did not like to submit himself to the king.\nSena answered: Both can obtain the object.\n\nThe King: If so, why have you left your home?\n\nSena: Suppose we are going to a place 3,000 miles away from here. Can a young and strong man, on horseback, with provision and with all the necessary instruments and weapons, reach the place very quickly?\n\nThe King: Yes, he will.\n\nSena: What if an old man were to go there riding an old horse without provision?\n\nThe King: Even if he had provision, it would be difficult to reach the place of destination; how much less without provision.\n\nSena: Well, to reach the path by leaving one's home is like that young man's journey (easy), while to seek the path by remaining at home is like that old man's travel (difficult).\n\nThe King: I now turn to the matter concerning our bodies. Am \"I\" permanent, or am \"I\" impermanent? Answer me satisfactorily.\n\nIn reply Sena raised another question: If there were an an-ba-la (\u0101mra, mango) tree in the Royal Palace, would the fruit be sweet or sour?\n\nThe King: There is no such tree in my garden: how can you ask me if the fruit is sweet or sour?\n\nSena: Even so is your own question. None of the five skandhas (form, sensation, perception, discrimination, and consciousness) is \"I\"; there is no \"I\": then how can you ask me if \"I\" am (you are) permanent or impermanent?\n\nThe King: As to all the hells, we hear that the body of the dead is torn asunder by swords and thrown away here and there, and yet the soul lives. Is this possible or impossible?\n\nSena: Let us take a woman as an example. She eats cakes, meat, melon, vegetables, and also drink, but she assimilates them all. When she becomes pregnant, the embryo, while called \"kalalam\" (immediately after conception), is as minute as dust. Why does it grow large without being assimilated?\n\nThe King: That is the power of Karma.\nSena: So it is with the hells; the soul lives through the influence of Karma.\n\nThe King: The sun shines above, and its body is one. Why is it that the summer is so hot and the winter is so cold? And further, why is the summer day so long and the winter day so short?\n\nSena: The Mount Sumeru has two ways, above and below. In summer-time the sun passes through the higher way, which is longer than the lower, and therefore goes slow (i.e. the day is long). Moreover, it shines against the \"Gold Mountain,\" and therefore the summer day is so hot, besides being long. In winter-time the sun passes through the lower way, which is shorter, and therefore it goes down soon. Besides, it shines against the water of the \"Great Ocean,\" and therefore the winter day is so cold, besides being short.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Compare Rhys Davids, part ii, v, 7, 24 (S.B.E. xxxvi, p. 112), where there is no such answer as this given.\n\n[The following note arrived from the author just as we were going to press.\u2014R.H.D.]\n\nKrausnickstr. 4 IV,\nNov. 22, 1895.\n\nDear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014Professor d'Oldenbourg, of St. Petersburg, answered me as to the Russian translation of the Chinese text of Milinda as follows:\n\n\"Sir,\u2014I am only a few days back to St. Petersburg, and have asked my friend, Prof. Iwanowsky (the Russian translator), to compare our Chinese Milinda with your translation*\u2014it is the same text, etc.\u2014Yours truly,\n\nS. d'Oldenbourg.\"\n\nThis shows again that we have no third text in existence.\u2014Yours faithfully,\n\nJ.

II.\u2014Outlines of Tibeto-Burman Linguistic Palaeontology.\n\nBy Bernard Houghton, B.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nIt is proposed in the present essay to give a brief outline, based on linguistic evidence only, of the state of civilization attained by the Tibeto-Burman race previous to the migration of the great Southern branch, and also to throw some light on the probable time of that migration. Of course, in all such inquiries anthropological evidence is now, and rightly, held to be a much more trustworthy guide than facts derived from the comparison of two or more languages, but results obtained from philological data alone are by no means to be altogether contemned. In the present case the geological exploration of the two countries is practically in its infancy, whilst even in Burma physical measurements of the population have not yet been systematically undertaken. It is clear, therefore, that we shall have to wait a quite indefinite time before any anthropological data are forthcoming. So far as is known, however, both the physical type and the idiosyncrasy of the two peoples are remarkably similar, and thus there is little fear that in comparing their languages we shall be trespassing against the canons of ethnology, for language and race are here, I think, nearly coterminous. All Tibetan or Burmese speaking people are not, of course, ethnically Tibetans or Burmans, but there can be no doubt that the bulk of them are, and that formerly they constituted but one race on the high plateau north of the Himalaya. The anthropological evidence, so far as it goes,\npoints that way, whilst the linguistic evidence is overwhelming. I shall, therefore, take this conclusion for granted, regarding the Burmese tradition of descent from Indian Kshatriyas as either a myth pure and simple, like the corresponding one of the Manipuris, or at most, as being based on some small immigrations of warrior Hindus, who, after perhaps conquering the local tribes, became altogether absorbed in them.\n\nAs is well known, the pronunciation of Tibetan now differs considerably from the written character, phonetic decay having very much simplified, throughout a large portion of the country, the former harsh utterances so plentifully besprinkled with consonants. The researches of Jaeschke, however, make it probable that the words as spelt render accurately enough the sounds of the Tibetan language at the period it was reduced to writing (A.D. 632), though at the same time I am inclined to think that the vowels had formerly, as now, more gradations of sound than would appear from the alphabet.\n\nThe Burmese language, which was, I apprehend, first written about the same time, had then already suffered much from phonetic decay; indeed, in some cases the sounds had become remarkably similar to those of modern Tibetan. There is no reason to doubt that the written words represent truly their pronunciation at that time, except that final ach and an were pronounced as ats and an, the vowel sound approximating closely to i, as not infrequently happens before a palatal; and that the vowel pronounced now as \u014d when final and as ai otherwise, then represented the modified vowel \u016b. The arguments in support of these suppositions are rather elaborate, and would be out of place here. I must ask the reader, therefore, to take them for granted, as also the following table showing equivalent Tibetan and Burmese consonants. It is, perhaps, needless to state that in comparing the two languages the written character, as representing the oldest known pronunciation, is alone followed.\n### Tibetan\n\n| Tibetan | Burmese | Notes |\n|---------|---------|-------|\n| \\( k, k', g \\) (initial) | \\( k, k', h \\) | \\( k' \\) sometimes disappears. |\n| \\( g \\) (final) | \\( k \\) | \\( ig = ats \\) sometimes. |\n| \\( n, \u00f1, n \\) (initial) | \\( n, \u00f1, n \\) | \\( in = a\u00f1 \\). |\n| \\( n, n \\) (final) | \\( n, \u00f1, n \\) | |\n| \\( ch, ch', j, ts, t's, dz, z \\) (initial) | \\( ch, ch', j \\) | |\n| \\( t, t', d \\) (initial) | \\( t, t', d \\) | |\n| \\( d \\) (final) | \\( t \\) | |\n| \\( p, p', b \\) (initial) | \\( p, p', b, b', w \\) | |\n| \\( b \\) (final) | \\( p, t \\) | |\n| \\( m \\) (initial) | \\( m \\) | |\n| \\( m \\) (final) | \\( m, n, \u00f1 \\) | |\n| \\( s, \u00f1, s \\) (initial) | \\( s \\) | |\n| \\( s \\) (final) | \\( ats \\), or disappears | |\n| \\( y, r, l \\) (initial) | \\( y, r, l \\) | |\n| \\( r \\) (final) | \\( y \\) | \\( ar = \u011b \\) sometimes. |\n| \\( l \\) (final) | \\( y, n \\) | |\n| \\( h \\) | \\( h \\) | |\n| \\( b \\) (before \\( r \\)), \\( db, dr, sr \\) | nil | |\n| \\( ky, kr, kl, k'y, k'r, k'l, gy, gr, gl, dr, sr \\) | \\( ky, kr, k'y, k'r, hy, hr, hl \\) | |\n\nPrefixed consonants, as a rule, are not represented in Burmese, but occasionally they survive as an aspiration of the initial letter.\\(^2\\) \\( S \\) following a consonant is unrepresented. Initial \\( k' \\), besides being frequently softened to \\( h \\), in some cases has disappeared altogether. It will be noticed that the final sonants \\( g, d, \\) and \\( b \\) had already become surds, just as they now have in modern Tibetan, whilst the palatals and sibilants had suffered considerable diminution in number. There is undoubtedly a connection\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Final \\( p \\) is now pronounced as \\( t \\) or \\( k \\).\n\n\\(^2\\) Especially when this is a nasal.\nbetween these two series both in Tibetan and Burmese, that is, in both languages there are allied stems, one commencing with a palatal and the other with a sibilant, whilst a palatal in one language is sometimes represented by a sibilant in the other.\\(^1\\) I have hesitated, however, to use herein as identical any such words, as the possibilities of error are considerable. Occasionally a final consonant has disappeared altogether in Burmese, in which case the preceding vowel is generally lengthened, and the word takes one or other of the tones.\n\nWhere the form of the word differs dialectically in Tibetan, the Burmese almost invariably follow that in use in Western Tibet, and, as in that district, the perfect root of the verb is evidently the one utilized. These, together with several minor peculiarities, show that the home of the Burmese was in the western part of Tibet, supposing that the present inhabitants of that district were at the time of the departure southward in their present location, which was probably the case. It may be also noticed that of the sub-Himalayan dialects, those of the Gurung, Magar, and Murmi, who live immediately south of Western Tibet, present the closest resemblances to Burmese.\n\nAs regards the time of this migration, the Burmese and Arakanese historians, of course, place it in an altogether fanciful antiquity. However, after making every allowance for exaggeration, and disregarding as such those lists of supposititious kings who are supposed to have reigned in untold ages B.C., and in the early centuries of our era, it seems hardly probable the period was subsequent to that (A.D. 632) when the Tibetan language was reduced to writing. A powerful argument against this is the fact that \\(dr\\), \\(sr\\), and \\(sr\\) in Tibetan are equivalent to \\(ky\\), \\(kr\\), etc., in Burmese. The existence of this equation shows that \\(d\\), \\(s\\), and \\(s\\) in these combinations are softenings of original gutturals,\\(^2\\) and that the Burmans must have left the\n\n\\(^1\\) In modern Burmese the old palatals have now become sibilants, whilst \\(ky\\), \\(k'y\\) are becoming palatals.\n\n\\(^2\\) The tendency to soften \\(kr\\), etc., to \\(sr\\) still continues, in W. Tibet at least.\ncountry at a time anterior to their phonetic corruption, and therefore *a fortiori* to the reduction of Tibetan to writing. For the whole life-history of Burmese shows that it would have been impossible for gutturals in these combinations to have been evolved from sibilants or dentals. It is worthy of note, also, that since the separation, apart from grammatical peculiarities, Burmese has developed very considerably certain stems or has made an extended use of them. Thus the stem *tan:, tan* or *tan* (T. *\u03b3tan*), with the original meaning of 'a bar,' appears in a very large number of compounds, whilst in the Northern language it has shown little or no power of growth. Again, the single Tibetan word *nug*, 'to project,' is represented in Burmese by *n\u016b, n\u014d, nok, n\u014d, n\u0101, nyon, nu\u010d:,* in all of which that signification is apparent. It is evident that a considerable lapse of time must be assumed for the development of growths such as these. And the same remark applies to the grammatical divergences, though here the subject becomes very intricate, as the influence of the different foreign languages with which Burmese has come into contact must be considered.\n\nIt is right, however, to place in evidence one or two curious facts on the other side. The word for 'book' is the same (T. *dpe*, B. *pe*) in the two languages, though in the first it means originally a 'form,' whilst in the second it signifies also a certain kind of palm, the leaves of which are used for writing on. (It is not clear whether the palm was named from 'book' or vice-versa.) The analogy is carried so far as the compounds, T. *dpe-ch'a*, B. *pe-ch\u0101,* meaning 'book' or 'writings.' The word 'to write' (T. *bri*, B. *r\u0113:) is also the same, but as in each case it means originally 'to draw,' this proves nothing, whilst 'paper' (T. W. *suggu*, B. *chakku*) seems to have been independently introduced into the two countries.\n\nThere is only one Burmese word which begins with a\n\n1 It is, of course, open to doubt whether *ch\u0101* here is *ch\u0101=* 'writing,' or *ch\u0101* (T. *ch'a*) 'a thing.'\n\n2 This is also probably the case with 'plaster' (T. *'arka*, B. *aiga-te*).\nlingual, te 'to have abundantly,' 'be rich.' Supposing this to be an indigenous word, it certainly tallies most curiously with the corresponding Central Tibetan word ti, (old pronunciation, k'rigs).\n\nThe above two coincidences may, however, be subsequently explained away, and by themselves they are certainly insufficient to prove anything. It is not impossible, however, from other facts, that there may have been two migrations into Burma, the first and principal from Western and the second from Central Tibet. The evidence as to the latter being very slight its possibility will be disregarded in the following essay, nor does it seem probable that, even granting its existence, the conclusions obtained would be modified to any extent.\n\nBefore discussing the Tibeto-Burman palaeontology proper, I propose to show briefly how much light is thrown by Tibetan on questions of Burmese etymology and grammar.\n\nFalse etymologies.\u2014In no respect, perhaps, is a comparison of the Tibetan and Burmese languages more instructive than in showing the exceeding danger which exists in attempting any deductions, either as regards etymology or sematology, in a tonic language like the latter, which has suffered much from phonetic decay. Nothing seems easier than to deduce connections between words which are spelt identically or, at most, differ only in tone, more especially when they have all the appearance of representing primitive roots. If many such exist in Burmese, where phonetic decay is comparatively moderate, how much more must it be the case in extreme cases like Chinese, (even the re-construction of the old sounds in this language barely brings it to the same stage as modern Burmese,) and Sgaw-Karen, in which latter every final consonant, even nasals, has been elided. In effect we must always remember that the modern smooth-sounding tonic languages were originally harsh and discordant, and, therefore, that the rule to go back to the earliest form of a word before making etymological deductions applies to them with especial force. It is true that comparisons of names of the commoner objects,\nparts of the body, etc., are fairly safe, (e.g. Hodgson's lists), but as regards anything beyond these we are on extremely treacherous ground. To what an excess fallacious comparisons, based on the modern sounds of words, can be pushed, may be easily seen in Latter's \"Burmese Grammar,\" whilst many will know of similar attempts as regards the Chinese language.\n\nMr. Stevenson, in his new dictionary, has practically followed Dr. Judson as regards the classification of the different meanings and the sub-grouping of words, so that remarks in this respect will apply equally to both works.\n\nUnder the heading acha is the following: \"From cha, to begin, a beginning . . . ; . . a piece; ability,\" the evolution of the meanings from each other not being, on the face of it, very clear. A reference to Tibetan shows that in reality there are four distinct words grouped here from (1) ch'as= 'to begin,' and rtsa= 'root,' 'beginning'; (2) ch'a= 'a piece'; and (3) rtsal= 'ability.'\n\nIt might seem a safe deduction to derive ach\u0101 'chips' from ach\u0101 'food,' as being 'what is consumed in any operation' (the italics are mine). Unfortunately the former meaning comes from sas= 'food,' or za= 'to eat' (probably the former), whilst the latter is the ordinary Tibetan word tsal. Nor does this word (cha= 'to eat') reappear, as alleged, in cha-y\u014d= 'the anus,' the first syllable being the Tibetan lcha= 'excrement,' which word may be seen also in the Burmese cha-mra\u00f1.\n\nTo infer that lun= 'to be all entire, as if in a ball,' is a secondary meaning of lun= 'round,' might also seem a legitimate exercise in sematology, were it not that these really represent two quite different words, the first being from the Tibetan yons, (which has got nothing to do with balls), and the second from slum= 'round.' Further, lun: in the sense 'to wrestle' (lun: tu\u0113:, napan: lu\u00f1:) has obviously nothing in common with the above meanings, and is probably\n\n---\n\n1 The slight difference in the meaning of these two words is reproduced exactly in the Burmese, showing acha or cha in the first signification to be a coalescence of two roots.\nderived from the Tibetan len (pf. blons or lons), in the sense 'to seize,' 'grasp.'\n\nUnder the heading of se we have again three distinct words, namely (1) 'to die,' (2) 'to be settled,' 'immovable,' 'slack,' (as water at the time the tides turn), and (3) in se-k'ya\u2014'be exact,' 'well finished,' the three corresponding Tibetan words being, respectively, si, si, and zib.\n\nPerhaps, however, the word ar\u00fc: furnishes the best example of how totally different words have, through phonetic decay, come to be spelt and pronounced the same way, and consequently jumbled up together under the same heading. The meanings given are as follows, the corresponding Tibetan words being placed opposite:\n\n(1) A bone rus(-pa)\n(2) A stalk ?\n(3) The handle of an instrument yu\n(4) A ridge } ri\n(5) A range of hills\n(6) The course of a brook yur\n(7) A lineage rus\n(8) Customs ?\n\nSpelling.\u2014Owing to the ease with which consonants of the same class, or varga as the Sanskritists term it, interchange, a comparison with Tibetan affords but little help in disputed spellings of Burmese words. In a few cases, however, it can help us to a decision, though as regards the most numerous class of cases, i.e. whether words should be spelt with y or r, it is unable to afford much assistance.\n\nAs an example may be mentioned ala\u00f1 or alay\u2014'middle,' both of these words occurring, (though the latter is by far the most common), and their pronunciation being the same. The corresponding Tibetan word is bri\u00f1, which coincides with the first and not the second method of spelling, and shows that the latter was probably introduced after the sound of the word had been corrupted from ala\u00f1 to ale.\n\n1 When immediately preceded by k or k'.\nThe late Spelling Committee in Rangoon have thought fit to change \u1e47an-ba (=\u2018to have a settled dread of\u2019) to \u1e47yan-ba. The former of these spellings has, at least, good authority in support of it, and as the Tibetan equivalent is smens=\u2018to fear,\u2019 \u2018dread,\u2019 it is presumably the more correct. Similarly the Tibetan smin=\u2018ripe\u2019 shows hma\u00f1, the old spelling of the Burmese word, to be correct, not km\u00eb, the new one ordered by the Committee.\n\nThe word for \u2018body\u2019 and \u2018self\u2019\u00b9 is always spelt koy in Burmese, though pronounced k\u014d as if derived from the Pali or Sanskrit k\u0101ya. Apart from the intrinsic improbability of Burmese having to borrow such words from the Pali, there are several equivalents in Tibetan and elsewhere of this root. In Tibetan we find both sku and sgo, in Chinese, k'\u00fc or k'u, (old sound k'\u014d), in Kachin, kum, and in Sgaw-Karen, na-k'\u014d, all meaning \u2018body.\u2019\u00b2 On the face of this it would seem highly improbable that the Burmese equivalent, (which was originally pronounced k\u016b), should have been borrowed from the Pali, and that the sound should have been so corrupted as to harmonize with the Tibetan or Chinese.\n\nIn Mon there is tsa-ku, meaning indifferently \u2018body\u2019 or \u2018self,\u2019 (k\u0101yya is added for the sake of clearness in the first signification), which is curiously like the Tibetan. There are a sufficient number of such similarities in Mon to induce one to the belief that the Mons were formerly in juxtaposition with some of the Tibeto-Burman tribes, perhaps in Central Asia, as De Lacouperie\u2019s investigations render probable.\n\nKo is, it may be remarked en passant, by no means the only word in Burmese which is misspelt owing to a supposed Pali or Sanskrit origin. In this connection\n\n\u00b9 It is difficult to know the reason why the two meanings are given separately as if from two different words. Both in S. Chin and in Kachin the words for \u2018body\u2019 and \u2018self\u2019 are the same, and I have no doubt many other instances could be given from allied languages.\n\n\u00b2 This word does not occur in B. H. Hodgson\u2019s lists, the only information we have concerning many of the Tibeto-Burman dialects.\nmight it be suggested that the well-known Burmese exclamation *amay* or *amay-l\u00ea:*\u00b9 is, after all, not an apostrophe to one's mother? At any rate, there is a Tibetan interjection, *\u0113-ma*, which is suspiciously like the Burmese, and from the interpretations given in the dictionary certainly coincides exactly in its use with the latter. There is, indeed, no reason why the Burmese in particular should signalize them by calling in season and out of season on their maternal ancestor.\n\n**Grammar and Etymology.**\u2014It is not intended here to enter at length on these subjects, which would, indeed, be sufficient in themselves for a small treatise. As I have remarked elsewhere,\u00b2 a really scientific grammar of the Burmese language has yet to be written. Such a grammar would presuppose a knowledge of Tibetan at least, because the different grammatical forms are so different from those in use amongst the Aryan languages, whence alone we get our nomenclature, that a person who has not studied the whole subject comparatively, is almost certain to fall into mistakes arising from the totally different ideology of the two systems. Even in the Dravidian languages, despite the magnificent work of the late Dr. Caldwell, there are not a few points of grammar, i.e. the correct way of classifying certain forms, which remain at present very open subjects. The unfortunate death of Professor de Lacouperie has deprived the languages of the Far East of the services of one whose logical insight and clear apprehension of the more salient points, were in no way hampered by a too slavish adherence to the grammatical terminology and theories of purely European scientists.\n\nA few words in which Tibetan gives some elucidation of grammatical forms in Burmese are now given merely by way of example, as anything further would be out of place here.\n\n*B\u00ea* usually means, (with the negative *ma* prefixed to the\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Pronounced *am\u0113-l\u00ea:* *L\u00ea:* is the Tibetan *l\u00ea*.\n\u00b2 \"Professor Sayce and the Burmese Language,\" J.R.A.S. 1893, p. 149.\nverb,) 'without,' as *ma su\u0101 b\u0113* = 'without going,' though Judson also gives a meaning 'before.' The usage in Tibetan is similar, e.g. *ma t'ob-pai bar-du* = 'as long as it has not been obtained,' but in this language *bar* is still used without a negative, and, in fact, the evolution up to its present meaning in Burmese can be clearly traced.\n\nThe similar Burmese word *m\u0113*, which has now dwindled to a simple affix, meaning 'without,' is seen to be the Tibetan *med*, (a contraction of *mi yod*), which, though still used with the meaning 'not to be,' has also come to be applied in exactly the same way as the Burmese equivalent. The verb *yod*, by-the-bye, is not otherwise represented in the latter language.\n\nThe word *la\u1e45-kon* denotes when reduplicated 'both\u2014and,' i.e. 'also\u2014also,' and when alone 'the aforesaid.' A comparison with Tibetan shows that in the former case it possesses simply the meaning of its first syllable *la\u1e45* (T. *ya\u1e45*), whilst in the latter the second syllable (T. *gon*) has similarly usurped the pre-eminence to the exclusion of the first.\n\nIn the dictionary *a-s\u016b* = 'who?' is said to be merely a contraction of *a-b'ay-s\u016b*. It seems more probable that it has retained its old meaning (T. *s\u016b*), which in the modern Burmese *s\u016b* has become altered to 'he.'\n\nThe verbal affix *ch'an* = 'merely,' 'just,' is the Tibetan *tsam*, meaning first 'so much' and then, *inter alia*, 'only.'\n\n*Ch\u014dk* and *ch'og* mean now, both in Burmese and in W. Tibetan, 'to be allowed,' 'suitable,' but the original meaning is found to be 'to suffice.'\n\nThe Burmese affix *n\u016b*:, which has no substantive meaning now, but when reduplicated denotes 'probably,' is evidently the same as the Tibetan *mno*, 'to think,' 'fancy.'\n\nIt is needless, however, to enter further here on these exercises in sematology, and I must even refrain from that tempting subject, the origin of the Burmese aspiration of\n\n---\n\n1 In reality it has almost become a merely euphonical affix, since the sense is complete in the two words *ma su\u0101*.\nthe initial consonant of certain intransitive verbs in order to give them a transitive signification.\\(^1\\) A few specimens of etymology generally will suffice to conclude this part of the subject.\n\nThe three Burmese words \\(an\\), \\(an\\), and \\(a:\\), meaning 'strength,' 'force,' all come from one stem, the Tibetan \\(d\\bar{b}a\\bar{n}\\), which in the colloquial has now reached the same stage of corruption as the first of these words at the time that Burmese was reduced to writing. It is noteworthy that \\(d\\bar{b}a\\bar{n}\\) has also the same meaning of 'regard,' 'consideration' as \\(a:\\) in the phrase \\(a:\\ n\\bar{d}\\) 'to be deterred by feelings of courtesy.'\n\nThe only common name for a quarter of the compass in the two languages is 'west' (T. \\(nub\\), B. \\(nok\\)), which, it appears, meant originally to 'sink' or 'set,' (of the sun). In Burmese it also means 'behind,' thus bearing significant testimony to the general eastward movement of the race for a considerable period of time. It is natural also that they would particularly remember that direction from which they came.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe origin of the Burmese \\(mak\\) 'to dream' is T. \\(dmigs\\) 'to imagine'\u2014a sufficiently obvious change of meaning.\n\nA phrase for 'early in the morning' is \\(m\u00fc sok\\), which is generally taken to be when 'the sky is drinking.' It is possible, however, that \\(sok\\) is the Tibetan \\(zogs\\), with the former signification, though the change from \\(z\\) to \\(s\\) is irregular.\n\nThere seems little doubt that gold was practically unknown to the two races before they divided. The Burmese word \\(hrwe\\) is probably from the stem \\(k'rol\\) (T.), meaning 'to glitter.'\n\nShame is said by the students of anthropology to be a simple development of the emotion of fear, and it\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Tibetan shows that this uniform aspirate is really a coalescing or weakening of several different consonants.\n\n\\(^2\\) The burial-grounds in Burma are placed on the west side of the villages, the original idea being doubtless to give the spirits of the departed a clear way to the home of their forefathers, without passing through the village and thus disturbing the living.\nseems probable that the Burmese *hrak* has been evolved from the stem (T.) *skrag* 'to be frightened.'\n\n*T\u00f6* 'a wood' evidently meant originally 'a crowd,' i.e. of trees (T. *du*), though the two meanings have been carefully transposed in the dictionary. As regards changed meanings, it will suffice to notice T. *lus*, B. *lu*, which denotes in the first language 'a body' and in the second 'a man'; and *le-na* meaning 'downy goat's wool' in Tibetan, whilst the corresponding Burmese *l\u00e9* is applied to the downy wool of the silk cotton tree.\n\nPerhaps the commonest words which differ entirely in the two languages are those for 'tree,' 'earth,' 'water,' 'sky,' and 'night'; but it is nevertheless true that none of the old Tibetan words for these have become entirely lost. Thus, the Tibetan *sin* appears as *san* in the names of several trees, and *sa* 'earth' in the Burmese *sa-rucat* 'mortar,' *sa-lan* 'a crystal,' *sa-l\u00e9* 'sand,' and *sa-lw\u00e8* 'lead.' The Burmese *chucat* 'moistened' is probably the same as the Tibetan *behud*, and certainly goes back to the same ultimate root *chu=* 'water'; whilst *mt'san* 'night' appears in the first syllable of the Burmese *cha\u00f1:-ch\u0101* 'twilight,' and *dgun* 'sky' in that of *kon-kan*.\n\n**Natural Products, etc.**\u2014The flora and fauna of their former and present home differ so widely, that the comparative paucity of common names preserved in Burmese need afford no matter for surprise. The appearance of so many animals and plants, even when they belong to the same genera, differ largely in a tropical and in a cold climate, and thus emigrants from the latter to the former would, in many cases, naturally adopt the local names for them.\n\nOf trees, by far the most familiar to them would be the pine or fir, which also occurs on the higher slopes of many of the mountains of Burma. This tree (T. *t'an*, B. *t'an-r\u016b*) is, in fact, almost the only one I have been\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. Forbes, \"Languages of Further India.\" The words for 'liquid' generally (T. *rlan*, B. *ara\u00f1*) are the same.\nable to identify in the two languages, though doubtless a few more names could be obtained by a skilled botanist. A plant far commoner in Burma than in Tibet is the bamboo (T. spa, sba, B. wd:), its great utility serving, doubtless, to preserve the name, whilst another Tibetan word for 'bamboo,' smyig, occurs in the Burmese (hmyats) for its sprout. 'Mushroom' (T. samo, B. hmi) is the only other word I identify.\n\nOf birds there is the goose (T. na\u00f1, B. nan), but not the duck, whilst as regards the ordinary domestic or jungle fowl, the Burmese seem to have used a word for it meaning 'grouse' or 'water-hen,' according to the word prefixed, (T. skyegs, B. krak). This, taken with the existence of radically different words for 'egg' (T. sgon, B. \u00fc:), points to the conclusion that the domestic fowl was not kept by the Burmans in Tibet, since the fowl shares with the dog the distinction of being the most widely utilized of all beings in the Far East.\n\nThe Burmese cha=\u2018sparrow\u2019 is probably the same as the Tibetan cha-chir=\u2018lark,\u2019 and is connected with cha-cho=\u2018twittering,\u2019 the bird thus being the \u2018twitterer.\u2019\n\nThe words both for \u2018plover\u2019 (T. ti-bo, B. li-ti-twat), and \u2018crane\u2019 (T. kru\u00f1-kru\u00f1, B. kro-kra), though onomatopoeic in imitation of the cries of these birds, are probably the same, whilst, although the words for \u2018owl\u2019 are different, the Tibetan ti-tug=\u2018bad\u2019 suggests an etymology for the ti: tut=\u2018the large horned owl,\u2019 birds of this kind usually having an evil reputation, (cf. B. hnak-chii).\n\nAmongst animals we find, of course, the dog (T. kyi, B. kiwe), a word somewhat corrupted, the pig (T. p'ag, B. wak), and cattle, i.e. the genus Bos (T. nor, B. nic\u00e4). The latter word has, as already remarked, now come to mean usually \u2018wealth\u2019 in Tibetan, just like the Latin pecunia came to mean \u2018money.\u2019\n\n1 In point of fact the water-hen is still called in Burmese re-kra\u00e7, as is natural, its appearance in both countries being the same.\n\n2 The Burmese, it may be noted, have, apparently, called the peacock (do\u00f1) after its tail feather (T. mdon), leaving aside the regular word (rm\u00e4) for it.\nMore doubtful is the word for 'yak,' the tails of which animal are, or were, used in Burma as ornaments for certain spears. The Tibetan is \u1e63br\u014d\u1e47, so that properly the Burmese should be r\u014d\u1e47 or y\u014d\u1e47, instead of o\u1e47:, the actual word, which, therefore, may either be slightly corrupted or else introduced afresh into Burmese, through the Northern hill-tribes. On the whole I think the former supposition more probable, the yak being the characteristic animal of Tibet.\n\nIt is possible that the Burmese kran=\u2018rhinoceros\u2019 is the same as the Tibetan glan, a word of doubtful signification, meaning either an ox or an elephant; but this is by no means certain, as is also the case with the word for \u2018hare\u2019 (T. yos,\u00b9 B. yun). There is a local word for \u2018otter\u2019 in parts of Burma, which is not met with in the dictionary, kram or kran (the spelling is doubtful), and this is etymologically the same as the Tibetan tram. It is curious that the Burmese have completely lost the old word for \u2018horse\u2019 (rta), though retaining that for \u2018saddle\u2019 and perhaps \u2018bit.\u2019 Their present word mra\u1e47: is probably a compound of the Chinese-Shan ma and some syllable ra\u1e47. It is probable that, having to buy all their ponies from the Shan country, they have come by degrees to adopt a local word for them.\n\nThe ordinary word for insect in general (T. bu, B. p\u016b:), has been retained, as well as that for the common house-fly (T. sbran, B. yan), whilst the word for \u2018butterfly,\u2019 though transposed, is still the same (T. p'ye-ma-leb, B. lip-pya). (The derivation of this word is probably from py\u0101=\u2018to fly,\u2019 \u2018a flier,\u2019 and leb=\u2018flat.\u2019)\n\nAmongst reptiles the \u2018frog\u2019 (T. sbal, B. p'\u0101:) is the only word recognizable in the two languages, unless san:, which occurs as a prefix in two Burmese names of lizards, be, as seems probable, a corruption of T. rtsans. It is difficult to understand why the Burmese should have preserved the word for \u2018soap-stone\u2019 (T. k'ar-gon, B. kan-ku) in particular, except that its peculiar softness may have rendered it useful in times when proper graving tools were practically\n\n\u00b9 A word of very rare occurrence.\nunknown. Silver (T. d\u00f1al, B. \u1e37u\u1e63e), so much used for ornaments, is the only mineral\u2014excepting salt (T. rtsura, B. ch\u2019d)\u2014we find with a common name in both languages, for the words for \u2018lead\u2019 (T. \u1e63a-\u1e47e, B. sa-luc\u0113\u00b9), though similar, are not the same.\n\nThe question, however, as to what metals were known by the Burmese on quitting Tibet is discussed in another part of this article.\n\nReligion.\u2014The worship of demons or fairies, (whichever we like to call them), is almost as intimate a part of the religious life of the Burmans as of their Northern congeners, though both profess the Buddhist faith. It has, indeed, been argued,\u00b2 with some show of plausibility, that the latter, owing to its want of a controlling guardian, affords especial ground for the cult of the fairies, magic, etc.; but after seeing the marked manner in which this cult survived amongst the Celts and Iberians after many centuries of nominal Christianity, the vigour with which it still subsists in both Burma and Tibet at the present day need cause no surprise.\n\nA careful and scientific study of fairy or demon worship amongst the Burmans and people of Western Tibet, (Waddell\u2019s papers apply principally to the parts on the Sikkim frontier), has, I believe, yet to be made. When done, many close parallels of belief, custom, and ritual will doubtless be discovered; it will suffice now to point out a few coincidences from the vocabulary. In the first place, there are the subaqueous beings who frequent wells and springs (T. klu, B. k\u2019r\u016b). They may be styled water-fairies, and are doubtless similar to the apocryphal mermaids of Europe. Other beings said to be allied to those are called in Tibetan sman, and in Burmese hma\u1e45.\n\nIt is curious that, although the ordinary fairy or demon of Tibet (/ha) coincides so closely to the Burmese nat, the names should be so radically different. The former word\n\n\u00b9 The probable (Tibetan) derivations are\u2014sa = \u2018earth\u2019 + s\u00f1i = \u2018soft,\u2019 and sa = \u2018earth\u2019 + rul = \u2018rotten\u2019 (cf. B. k\u2019\u00e8-ma-pup).\n\u00b2 Campbell, \u201cSpirit Basis of Belief and Custom.\u201d\nseems in fact to have disappeared from Burmese, though possibly *kra* in *kra-h\u00f1an*, the name of a certain house-post, (these are all called after fairies), may be a survival of it. It would be interesting to ascertain in which, if any, of the Himalayan languages the term *nat* occurs for these spirits.\n\nWitchcraft was and is practised, of course, by both peoples (*cf.* T. *rol* = 'practise sorcery,' and B. *rua* = 'witchcraft,' etc.). The Burmese *apa* in *apa-hmi* 'to possess' is also probably the same word as the Tibetan *ba* = 'sorcerer' or 'witch,' whilst in both countries people can, with equal ease, be bewitched (T. *p'ru\u0142*, *sprul*, B. *pru-ch\u0101*). It would appear from the identity of the Burmese *ch'icam* with the Tibetan *mt'sun* that what was formerly food offered to the manes of the dead has now, amongst the former people, come to mean food offered to the (Buddhist) priests. Similar changes of signification are, of course, common enough amongst other peoples.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the stone cairns and rags, (the latter more rarely), found in many of the more outlying parts of Burma, invariably at one end of a bad bit of jungle path, occur similarly in Tibet at the tops of passes, etc.\u00b9 In the latter country, Buddhism being more impure and imperfect, it appears that there is no concealment as to their connection with spirit worship, but in Burma the people are rather ashamed of this practice, and usually prevaricate when asked concerning it.\n\n**War.**\u2014Although the words for 'bow,'\u00b2 'arrow,' 'spear,' 'sword,' and 'shield,' the usual weapons of war in the East, are different in Burmese and Tibetan, there is by no means such a dearth of common military terms as to suggest that fighting was completely unknown before the emigration of the former people. At the same time it is unlikely that they were constantly in the habit of using these weapons, for were this the case, some, at least, of the names would have survived; in fact, few words would\n\n\u00b9 Dr. Waddell's \"Demonolatry in Sikkim Lamaism.\"\n\u00b2 Burmese *l\u00f2* 'bow' is probably corrupted from the Tibetan *ru*, but this is the respectful and not the ordinary term.\nbe more likely to do so amongst an essentially warrior race. Taken then with the state of civilization reached by the Burmese in their Northern home, this hiatus seems to point to the conclusion that they were there, on the whole, a fairly peaceful people, taking more interest in the culture of the ground and in petty commerce than in the fierce raid and counter-raid which fill up so large a part of the existence of the wilder hill-tribes.\n\nThe very first move south seems to have supplied them with the word for 'arrow' (hmra), which occurs in Murmi, Gurung, Magur, etc. (mya), and 'bow' (Chepang l\u016b-i\\(^1\\)). These tribes, if not then inhabiting the southern slopes of the Himalaya as now, were probably on the northern parts of that range of mountains, and a glance at the map will show that it would be precisely with these hill-men that a tribe emigrating south-east from W. Tibet would first come in contact. The ordinary Burmese word for 'sword' or 'chopper,' (\u1e6d\u0101, pronounced d\u0101), seems to be the Bengali dhao.\n\nThere is, in fact, every probability that the Burmese would, like most other emigrating tribes in those parts, have to make their way literally sword in hand, and that in their progress south-east they would have the fullest opportunity of investigating the make and effect of the different weapons used at that epoch. Sparsely peopled as the plains were then, it is probable that many a savage fight and massacre took place ere the advance-guard of the Mongoloid tribes, called Mramma, debouched on the Kubo Valley from the plateau of Manipur.\n\nThe Tibetan dmag=\u2018war\u2019 or \u2018army\u2019 occurs in Burmese only when conjoined with r\u0113 and chats (chats-mak), and thus forms one of those couplets known in Chinese as \u2018male and female words.\u2019 Chats, the usual word in everyday parlance, is perhaps the Tibetan rtsod, pf. brtsad, meaning \u2018to quarrel\u2019 or \u2018fight.\u2019 An allied word is ran=\n\n\\(^1\\) This word, as well as \u2018spear,\u2019 \u2018sword,\u2019 \u2018shield,\u2019 does not occur in most of Hodgson\u2019s lists.\n'enmity,' 'quarrel,' which has the signification of 'war' in Lushai (ral), but only, I believe, occurs in the word for 'sword' (ral-gri= 'war-knife') in Tibetan.\n\nAlthough the Burmese have presumably abandoned their old word for 'arrow,' they have retained that for 'quiver' (lon, T. do\u00f1), not improbably for the reason that their quivers were of superior excellence to those possessed by the more savage tribes which they encountered.\n\nAgain, the Tibetan rmog= 'helmet' is undoubtedly the same as the Burmese mok,\\(^1\\) which occurs in mok-t\u00fc and mok-r\u00fc, described as two kinds of 'caps,' and in k'a-mok, which is a hat similar to that worn by the Chinese peasantry, (hence san-k'emok=[iron] 'helmet').\n\nUnless, however, it turns out that these 'caps' were originally in the form of or served for helmets, it would be unsafe to conclude that the emigrant Burmans wore helmets, as the Tibetan rmog may be merely a specialized meaning of a word for 'hat' or 'cap.' Similarly the words for 'mail' (B. k'yap, T. k'rab) are the same, but each word denotes originally a flat, thin thing or scale, and hence they come to mean 'scale-armour.' It is, of course, possible that this was possessed by the Burmans in Tibet, but, on the other hand, it is equally probable that the words have been applied independently on the introduction of this particular kind of armour, (? from China). The Tibetan rma= 'a wound' survives only in the Burmese ama-rucat= 'a scar,' and the word f'ab= 'to fight' has lost its original signification, and come to mean first a body of fighting men, and thence a stockade (cf. Tib. C. f'ab-rags= 'stockade'), the mode of alteration being sufficiently apparent.\n\nIt is possible that the Burmese chak= 'target' may come from the Pali chakka= 'a wheel,' as supposed, but it may, on the other hand, be allied to W. Tibetan tsag-ge, the black mark or bull's-eye in a target, i.e. always supposing\n\n\\(^1\\) Connected with smok= 'crest' and mok= 'elevated in the centre,' probably the original meaning of the word.\nthe latter to be an indigenous word. At any rate, it is curious that the Southern Chins still preserve their old word *bon* (T. *ben*) for a target.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014From the retention of two separate words, meaning \u2018plough\u2019 or \u2018to plough\u2019 in Burmese, it is evident that when the latter left Tibet they were no mere nomads or wild hill-men, but people who were acquainted with the art of agriculture. Amongst not a few of the related hill-tribes the plough is to this day either unknown or but a recently introduced instrument, implying as it does a fairly settled mode of life, so that this point is especially important in connection with the state of civilization reached at the above-mentioned time.\n\nThe first word is T. *t'on*, B. *t'wan*. The latter instrument is generally a kind of a harrow, used instead of a plough, but it also means \u2018to plough,\u2019 being, in fact, the ordinary verb with that signification. The second word is the Tibetan *rmon* (B. *hmun:*), apparently used in the former country with the general sense of \u2018ploughing,\u2019 but in Burma merely \u2018to plough a field of young plants in order to loosen the soil,\u2019 etc.\n\nAlthough the commonest words for \u2018field\u2019 (T. *zin*, B. *lay*) are different in the two languages, we find the Tibetan *kluns*, another word with that meaning in the Burmese *k'yon:*\u00b9, a word which occurs only in conjunction with *lay*, just the same as *mak* with the meaning of \u2018war\u2019 only occurs now when in union with *chats*.\n\nAs with animals so in the crops grown, the difference of species has been the cause of losing most of the old names. The Burmese for \u2018radish,\u2019 however (*mun-l\u0101*), I take to be the same as the Tibetan *la-p'ug* (in composition *la*). *Mun* may either denote that it was the species cultivated by the people to the south of the Himalayas, called generally Mon in Tibetan, or that it was that cultivated by the Mons, or Talaings, who were undoubtedly in Burma\n\n\u00b9 Spelling doubtful, as the word is not found in the dictionary. It usually occurs in the phrase *lay-k'yon* *lup-ch\u0101-sa\u00f1*=\u2018I am a worker of the fields\u2019 (i.e. an agriculturist).\nat the time of the arrival of the Burmese. Although the former is the national appellation of these people, the Burmans have, so far as is known, always called them Talaings, so that the first of these two hypotheses seems the more probable. Similarly the Burmese for 'mustard' (mun-\u00f1a\u00f1) is probably mun and T. yunis or \u014bu\u00f1. It seems probable, however, that the same word occurs in 'turmeric' (B. nan-nicain, sa-nwan), \u014bu\u00f1 being admittedly often used for yun in Tibetan, and this crop was probably better known to the undivided Tibeto-Burmans. I am inclined to think, therefore, that both radishes and turmeric were cultivated, and subsequently also mustard, before the departure of the Burmans. It is also possible that suan, in the Burmese krak-swan = 'onion,' is a corruption from T. btsan, in which case this plant also must be added to the list.\n\nThe Burmese lu:, a certain kind of millet,\u00b9 would seem to be identical with the Tibetan obru, meaning grain in general; probably the only kind of grain grown in ancient times in Tibet being an inferior kind of millet or something similar.\n\nThat the Burmans in Tibet were accustomed to the cultivation of grain and the preparing of it for food is shown by the existence, in both languages, of common words for 'husks' or 'chaff' (T. sbur, B. p'ue), for 'tossing up' or 'sifting' grain (T. p'yar, B. pya), for 'cleaning' (T. p'ad, B. p'wap), and for 'pounding' it (T. rdu\u00f1, B. t'on). But it is probable that these operations were performed on millet alone, and that rice was, at that time, not cultivated in Tibet.\n\nThe common beast for cultivating was, of course, the bullock (T. nor, B. nic\u0101), but we may note that the Tibetan word, although still retaining its primitive signification in some contexts, has now come to mean 'wealth' or 'money,' affording thus a close parallel to the Latin pecunia.\n\nThe House, Domestic Articles, etc.\u2014The number of common\n\n\u00b9 Lu:-nat-k\u00f6k is \"the classic name for wheat.\"\nwords relating to the house (T. k'yim, B. im\\(^1\\)) and its appurtenances is not small, and they show a state of things very similar to what prevails in the less civilized parts of Burma at the present day. Before adverting to them it is worthy of notice that two other Tibetan words,\\(^2\\) each with the meaning of 'house,'\\(^2\\) are still retained in Burmese, though with specialized meanings. The first of these is nan, which in Burmese (nan:) has come to mean merely the house of the king, i.e. a palace, and the second, groi, is similarly applied to a house inhabited by priests (kyon), i.e. a monastery. We may observe that nan, with the meaning of 'house' (it also denotes an interior, household, etc.), is found especially in Central Tibet.\n\nWe find kyon, however, again in a single obsolete word in Burmese, s\u016b-kyo\u00f1, meaning 'cook-house.' The first syllable is probably the Tibetan sol in sol-k'an= 'cook-room' or 'kitchen,' and, from the close analogy between these two words, it is not too much to infer that rooms especially used for cooking were known to the Burmans before quitting Tibet, an important fact in considering the stage of civilization they had then reached. Although the style of building in the two countries is very dissimilar, owing to climatic and other considerations, yet we find common words for 'room' (T. k'an, B. k'an:), for 'floor' (T. skyan, B. kram:), and for 'door' (T. sgo, B. tan\\(^3\\)-k'\u0101), whilst the Tibetan lcham= 'a rafter' is probably the same as the Burmese ch'\u0101n= 'a joist,' used in the same way as a rafter to support the floor of a house, which, as everyone knows, is in the latter country raised above the ground on posts.\n\nIt may be noted that there are common words (T. rtsog, B. ch'ok) for building houses, words ultimately connected with that 'to erect,' 'make fast' in the ground (T. yug, B. ch\u00fck).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This word has suffered considerably from phonetic decay. Its connection with the Tibetan is easily traced through Manipuri, Lunbu, etc.\n\n\\(^2\\) Further, the Tibetan rdzo\u00f1= 'castle' probably reappears in the Burman tan-ch'o\u00f1i: = 'a kind of tower,' and ach'o\u00f1= 'a building.'\n\n\\(^3\\) Tan, tan, or tan: simply means anything long and straight, and is a common prefix in Burmese (cf. T. gian).\nTurning now to the utensils in the house (T. ts'og-chas, B. a-ch'ok l-a-\u00fb), the most obvious are those used for storing or carrying food, for, of course, anything in the way of chairs or tables is in these countries entirely of modern introduction. We find that at least one kind of basket was known (T. dro\u00fb, B. k'yo\u00fb), this being a long cylindrical one carried on the back. There would also appear to have been in existence, as might be supposed amongst an agricultural people, small granaries (T. rdza\u00f1, B. cha\u00f1) and even casks (T. zem, B. cha\u00f1), but these latter were merely rudimentary, being formed by hollowing out portions of tree-trunks. The Burmese tan 'a pannier' would also appear to be the same as the Tibetan lta\u00f1\u2014'a bale of goods for carriage by an animal.' In a country where carts were unknown, it is obvious that pack bullocks or ponies would be used by a people who had attained any moderate degree of civilization.\n\nThe common Tibetan word for 'pot,' rdza, although superseded by another root in Burmese, may still be seen perhaps in the two words cha-l\u00f4n 'the cover of a pot,' and ja-lun 'a large basin.' The ordinary Burmese word is \u00f2;, and although this has evidently suffered much from phonetic decay, it can, I think, be yet identified with the Tibetan k'og, since k' is sometimes elided (see supra), and there is a very analogous case in the Tibetan k'ogs, Burmese \u00f2, meaning 'old.' The existence of other earthenware before the separation of the two races is evidenced by a word for a 'large pitcher' (T. p'in, B. p'yan\u00f1), and for 'cup' (T. skyogs, B. k'wak).\n\nOther articles were ropes (T. rgyud and allied words, B. kr\u00f6:) and ladders (T. skra\u00f1-ka, B. hl\u00ea-k\u00e2:), the latter being, however, but notched logs, as are still commonly to be met with in the less civilized parts of Burma.\n\nFishing is carried on to no great extent in the more northern country, and hence it must not be expected that\n\n1 I doubt whether ch'ok in this signification is from the root ch'ok 'to build.'\n2 T. \u00f2ben is probably merely another form of this word.\nmany of the names for nets in Burmese would be found in Tibetan. As a matter of fact, only the commonest, the kwan or casting net (T. rkon), can be identified, and in Tibet it is used apparently not for fishing but for catching birds.\n\nThe Burmese have adopted the Mon word for 'hearth' (p'au), but those for 'charcoal' (T. sol, B. mi:-su\u0113), and 'cooking' (T. sregs, \u0101rog, B. k'yak), still survive, while naturally with the change of habitat the word for 'fat' (T. ts'ib) has come to signify 'oil' (B. ch'\u0113). As above pointed out, it is evident that the kitchen had already been formed into a separate compartment.\n\nIt seems probable that the undivided race had already emerged from the skin-clothing stage; test\u0113 the words for 'clothes in general' (T. ydin, B. a-\u0165an),\u00b9 and those for 'a spindle' (T. p'an, B. na\u00f1-r\u014d).\u00b2 At the same time, as almost all Burmese words connected with the loom and weaving are radically different from the Tibetan, it is probable that this art was practised to a very limited extent only. Possibly clothes were as yet chiefly imported, and were obtained by barter. This is one of the grounds for supposing the Burman migration to be anterior in time to those, for example, of the Chins and Karens.\n\nPaint, or rather colouring matter (T. rtsi, B. ch'\u0113), must of course have been known from very early times. The Burmese word means also 'medicine,' but this is undoubtedly, in spite of the dictionaries, a secondary meaning of the word.\n\nIt remains to mention three words which point to the existence of a somewhat high stage of civilization before the departure of the Burmans, namely 'fan' (T. yab, B. yap), 'tassel' (T. \u0101bod, B. pw\u0101), and 'cushion' (T. \u0101bol, B. p'un). It is, of course, not improbable that the tassels\n\n\u00b9 The Tibetan \u014dwa 'a hat' is possibly the same as the Burmese s\u016b:\n\u00b2 The existence of a common word for 'needle' (T. k'ab, B. ap) proves nothing, since needles are employed by all races who consider expedient garments of any kind whatever. Similarly as regards 'thread' (T. dran-bu, B. k'ra\u00f1), and 'to sew' (T. \u0101drub, B. k'yup).\nwere merely the barbaric appendages to spears; that the cushions consisted but of a few skins sewn together; whilst the fans were almost certainly rude arrangements made from particular kinds of leaves. Nevertheless, the existence of such common words, together with the others already cited, goes far to show the existence of a state of things not very dissimilar to what prevails in the less civilized parts of the respective countries at the present day.\n\nMedicine, etc.\u2014The fact that the ordinary Burmese for 'medicine' (ch\u00eb:) is merely a secondary meaning attached to 'pigment,' and that all words relating to drugs, curing, etc., are different in the two languages, points to but a slight knowledge of medicine at the time of the migration southwards\u2014indeed, the only common word to be found is that for 'plague' or 'pestilential disorders' (T. y\u00f1an, B. \u00f1an). This is, of course, precisely the word one would, on d priori grounds, expect to survive.\n\nThere are, nevertheless, numerous common words for parts of the body, of which I give a few of the more unusual for sake of example only: 'waist' (T. rk\u00ebd, in composition ska, B. k'\u00ebd), 'marrow' (T. rkan, B. k'ran-ch'i), 'mucus of nose' (T. snab\u00eb, B. hnap), 'the nose' (T. sna, sna-k'an, B. hna, hna-k'\u00ebi), 'womb' (T. bu-sned, B. hnut), 'knee' (T. pus, B. pu-chats), 'breast' (T. bra\u00f1, B. ra\u00f1), 'the iris of the eye' (T. nig-bras, B. myek-rats), 'hair' (T. lcha\u00f1,\u00b9 B. ch'\u00e4n), 'wen' (T. rmen, B. mra\u00f1), and 'mole' (T. sme, B. hm\u00eb). The ordinary Burmese words for 'to be hungry' or 'thirsty' (ch'\u00eb, \u00f1at) are merely specialized from the Tibetan tsal 'to want,' and rnab 'to crave.'\n\nTerms of Relationship.\u2014I hope in a future paper to discuss the evidence relating to the existence of a former maternal family amongst the Burmese and allied tribes. The paternal family is now well established amongst these, whilst the Tibetans are still in that intermediate stage between the two systems where the wife is shared amongst brothers, though the elder has the predominance. (It is\n\n\u00b9 This properly means 'matted hair,' a significant distinction.\nstated, however, that that system has now begun to crumble away and monogyny to take its place, at any rate amongst the higher classes.) The common terms of relationship, besides 'father' and 'mother,' are a man's 'elder brother' (T. *ajo*, B. *ats-k\u00fc*\u00b9), a man's 'younger brother' (T. *\u00f1u*, B. *\u00f1i*), a woman's 'elder sister' (T. *ache*, B. *ats-ma*), a woman's 'elder brother' (T. *min*, B. *mo\u00f1*), and a 'son-in-law' (T. *mag*, B. *sa-mak*). The omission of certain terms must, in view of the different family systems now prevailing in the two countries, be regarded as of some significance.\n\nIn addition to these it appears that an old Burmese term for 'elder brother' (*anon*) simply meant 'first-born' (T. *snon-kyes*), whilst the second syllable of *kan-puran*: 'a friend' or 'spouse,' is the Tibetan *spun*\u2014'brothers' or 'cousins.'\n\n**Political Organization.**\u2014The long Shan domination to which the Burmans were subject after their arrival in their present country, the possible existence of a Kshatriya dynasty at one time, and the undoubted tendency to use Sanskrit and Pali words for royal functions as being more high-sounding and imposing than the vernacular, have all tended to obliterate the political terms brought from Tibet. And as regards some such words, although apparently capable of explanation from the Tibetan, their etymology is of too problematical a nature to be worth insertion here.\n\nIt has been already pointed out that the word *rwa*, which means 'village' still in Burmese, has in Tibetan (*yul*) come to mean 'country' in general, but it does not necessarily follow that at the time of separation the village was the political unit, as amongst the Nagas and other wild tribes at the present day. For *yul* still means village as well as country, and *rwa* in the expression *nat-rwa*\u00b2 means rather country than village. The existence of a common word for 'kingdom' (T. *nan*, B. *n\u00fcn\u00b3-nan*) is, however, decisive on this point, and, indeed, apart from the king (T. *rgyal*,\n\n\u00b9 Probably a reduplicated word (cf. Chinese *k\u014d*).\n\u00b2 Fairy-land.\n\u00b3 Means 'to conquer.'\nthere would appear to have also been subordinate governors or ministers (T. dpon, B. wau).\u00b9\n\nTheft (T. rku, B. k'\u00fc), at least, was a recognized crime, and it is just possible, though not very probable, that the Burmese t'on 'a prison' is a shortening of the Tibetan dom-gan-gru-bzi, with the same meaning. Taxes seem to have been levied (T. k'al, B. k'we), thus showing a considerable degree of political organization.\n\nAs regards slavery, the Burmese and Tibetan words are quite different, and it seems probable that the word for 'slave' (k'ywan) in the former language originally meant 'foreigner' (T. groi). This would indicate that slaves were prisoners taken in war, and that slavery as a domestic institution was probably little, if at all, known.\n\nOther quasi-political terms are 'to appoint' as an official (T. gel, pf. bkal, B. k'an) and possibly 'to punish' (T.\u00b2 god, B. kuap).\u00b3 Although there is no common name for 'court' or 'justice,' the Tibetan throws some light on the Burmese terms. Thus, k'un 'a petty magistrate' seems to be the same word as the Tibetan mgon\u2014'lord'; and the chief court of Burma formerly, the hlwat-ta,\u2074 was originally merely 'the assembly' (T. k'rod), similarly to ruq:, the ordinary word for 'court,' which also means 'to assemble.' That courts of some kind were known appears also from words such as 'to engage in a suit' (T. ytag, B. tw\u0119), 'to suspect of a crime' (T. yus, B. y\u00fc), and 'to accuse falsely' (T. rdsab, B. chwap), though justice would, of course, be of a very rough and ready kind.\n\nWith regard to the existence of private property, it is observable that boundary lines (T. mt'sams, B. cha\u00f1) were evidently known.\n\nThe Arts.\u2014It may be premised at once that the names of the different handicrafts are in Burmese apparently of\n\n\u00b9 The Burmese dis 'a petty chief' is probably connected with T. mt'on 'high in rank.'\n\u00b2 Central.\n\u00b3 Note also the Central Tibetan jags 'to make a present,' and B. ch'ak 'to present to a superior.'\n\u2074 Ta is the royal affix.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nmodern introduction, or, at any rate, have been invented since the departure from Tibet. Until men have segregated in large masses it is rare, at any rate amongst these races, to find persons who give up their whole time to a particular craft. One person may be clever at carpentry and another at smith's work, but they will still continue to carry on the customary pursuit of agriculture, doing the various jobs required of them in the intervals of such work. The latter are not, in fact, sufficiently important to tempt them to break altogether from tradition, and the result is that, even when society has considerably advanced, we fail to find anything like the specialization of labour which prevails amongst ourselves.\n\nBefore alluding to any common names of tools there is to be settled the very important question: Was the undivided Tibeto-Burman race acquainted with iron? The chief argument for a negative answer to this question is the fact that the words for this metal (T. lchags, B. san) are quite different in the two languages. This does not, of course, absolutely preclude a knowledge of the metal before leaving Tibet, though it throws the burden of proof very much on the other side. It is not quite clear to me from what language the word san has been taken.\n\nPro contr\u00e2 it may be first noticed that a name for 'thunderbolt' in Tibetan is lchags or ynam-lchags, i.e. 'iron' or 'sky-iron.'\u00b9 The Burmese similarly call it chak or m\u00fc-kr\u00fc-chak. Chak, in the dictionary, is put down as the Pali word meaning 'a wheel,' because it 'whizzes round,' a rather obvious piece of folk-etymology. It seems more probable to identify chak here with the Tibetan lchags. Again, the Tibetans call the bit of a horse\u2014riding was undoubtedly known at the time of the separation\u2014srab-lchags, the corresponding Burmese term being jak, so that here again we seem to see the old term for 'iron' cropping up.\n\nIt may be postulated that if the Burmans on leaving Tibet were only in the Bronze age\u2014there is, I think, a\n\n\u00b9 The Tibetans are not alone in giving it this designation. See Tylor, \"Early History of Mankind.\"\ncommon term for bronze\u2014words denoting cutting, etc., will in general differ in the two languages, since the use to which bronze tools can be put is relatively small. This, however, is not the case, the number of common words being as many as can be reasonably expected with a people mainly agricultural and yet in the Iron age. For example, it would appear there were punches (T. \u03b3zon, B. ch\u00fc) and chisels, the Burmese ch'\u00f6k being the same word as the Tibetan \u03b3tsup 'to scoop out,' whilst there are common words for 'chiselling' (T. \u1e63bru, B. ruc), 'cutting off small pieces' (T. \u03b3tub, B. twap), 'cutting off' (T. grum, B. k'y\u00fcn), 'mowing' and 'shaving' (T. \u1e63breg, B. rit), and for 'chips' (T. t'sal, B. ch\u0101).\u00b9 The ordinary Tibetan word for 'sword' or 'knife' (gri) has been supplanted by another (t'\u0101) in Burmese, but it survives in the word for 'scissors,' kat-ky\u0113: (= 'lever-knife'), and hli: 'to cut' is undoubtedly from the same root.\n\nThe existence of common words for 'hammer' (T. t'o, B. t\u016b) and 'bellows' (T. spud, B. p'\u016b), does not perhaps prove much, but I think that the number of such for 'cutting,' etc., taken with the other evidences of a fairly high state of civilization attained by the Burmans before leaving Tibet, is sufficient to justify a belief that they were at that time acquainted with iron. This, of course, furnishes an anterior limit to the time of the migration.\n\nAs regards other metals, besides silver (T. dhiul, B. nuc\u0113), it seems probable that some kind of bronze was known, that is, if the Tibetan k'ar be the same as the Burmese k'\u0113, a word of doubtful signification, meaning now either lead or tin, according to the word affixed to it.\n\nThe art of dyeing was also unquestionably known (T. \u1e63'sod, pf. b't'sos and allied words, B. ch'\u016b:).\n\nCulture.\u2014The point up to which a semi-civilized people can count is always some index of the state of culture obtained by them. In the case of the Tibeto-Burman race the amount is one thousand (T. ston, B. ton)\u2014an unusually\n\n\u00b9 Possibly also T. dmyal 'to cut up' and B. myw\u0101 'to gash obliquely' are the same.\nhigh number. Most of the lower numerals are closely alike in the two languages, but 'one,' 'four,' and 'seven' are different, and 'ten' and 'a hundred' are much corrupted in Burmese. A word for 'counting' (T. bgr\u0101n and allied words, B. k'yan) has also been retained.\n\nAs regards measures (T. ytos, B. t\u016bn), 'a span' (T. mto, B. t'wa) is the only one that can be certainly identified. It is not likely that regular shops, such as we know, existed before the separation of the two races, but there is evidence that some kind of traffic, probably petty peddling, was not altogether unknown. Tan in tan-b'\u016b: 'value' is evidently the Tibetan t\u0101n or c\u0101n. There are two words for 'borrowing' or 'hiring' (T. skyi, br\u0101n, B. k'y\u0113, hna), and the ideas of 'repaying' (T. tsat, B. ch'ap) and 'redeeming' (T. blus, etc., B. ruc:) were certainly known. Again, the Burmese ch'\u016bn 'a shop' is evidently connected with the Tibetan c'son 'to sell,' and ron 'to sell' with rin 'price,' whilst 'scales for weighing' (T. sran, B. k'yin) were known, thus showing that matters had probably got beyond mere 'barter' (T. sdeb, B. t'ap). In addition we have a regular word for 'business' (T. brel, B. ar\u0113:), and probably also 'to carry on business' or 'to trade' (T. t'son, B. ch'oi). It would seem, therefore, that there was a regular class of traders. Although, as has been already pointed out, the words for 'horse' in the two languages are quite different, yet these animals were certainly known and used for riding. This is evident from the words for 'saddle' (T. sga, B. ka), for 'to mount' (T. chib, B. chi:), and probably also for 'bit' (T. srab-lchags, B. jak).\n\nA few ideas as evidenced by common words may here be noticed, which would be either altogether unknown or, at any rate, but slightly noticed amongst half-savage people such as the hill-folk of Burma. The existence of common words for them is, I think, proof that they were\n\n1 The Burmese here is the same as the Gyarung, and is possibly a relic of counting on the hands.\n2 T'son 'to trade' is a closely allied root. Cf. t'son-sa 'a market.'\n3 If the Burmese chap and Tibetan ts'ad 'a standard' are the same, some considerable advance in the arts must be assumed.\nwidely understood and often thought of amongst the undivided Tibeto-Burman race. Such are a 'memorial' (T. tems-yig,\\(^1\\) B. \\(t\\)im-hmat), showing that it was customary to remember specially the more heroic or notable ancestors, and 'to draw,' 'picture,' etc. (T. bri, B. re). As regards the latter word, it is curious that in each language it has also the meaning 'to write'; but from the historical data available this meaning would seem to have been independently evolved. The very close parallel is noteworthy, and shows the caution necessary in endeavouring to ascertain the limits of a former system of civilization from philological evidence only.\n\nOther words are 'pride' (T. \\(\\gamma\\)chom, B. chon-man), a 'belief' or 'sentiment' (T. blo, B. ay\u016b), a 'fault' or 'crime' (T. dpyas, B. aprats),\\(^2\\) and 'to feel remorse' (T. \\(\\gamma\\)non, B. non-ta). They seem to have paid attention to a man's character (T. grags, B. krak-sar\u0113), whilst there are several words for 'respect,' 'trust,' or 'reverence' (T. rim-gro, gus, bkur, B. r\u00fc-ky\u016b, k\u0101-y\u0101d, k\u016b), such as would be paid to the elders or to good men, as well as one for 'affection' or 'tender regard' (T. \\(\\gamma\\)chags, B. cha). Mere affectation (T. k'ens, B. in) was distinguished from a proper regard for one's appearance (T. mdans, B. ta\u00f1), and by proper examination (T. \\(t\\)sir, B. chi-chats), they were accustomed to ascertain what was done secretly (T. gya-gyu, B. hly\u016b), or what was merely feigned (T. sgru\u00f1, B. kyuan). The only common words denoting colour are 'black' (T. nag, B. nak) and 'parti-coloured' (T. \\(k\\)ra, B. ky\u0101:). Would these be the words most in use for denoting the colours of the Tibetan cattle?\n\nMiscellaneous.\u2014There is no reason to suppose that dancing and music were less popular formerly than now amongst the Burmese. There are, in fact, common words for 'singing,' or rather 'chanting' (T. glu, dbya\u00f1s, B. ky\u016b:, ra\u00f1), and for 'dancing' (T. gar, B. ka). I have not,\n\n\\(^1\\) Yig = 'writing,' hmat = 'mark.'\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. also T. \\(o\\)tsan = 'error,' and B. ach\u0101 'faulty.'\nhowever, been able to clearly identify any musical instrument.\\footnote{The Burmese \\textit{p\u016b-p\u016b} 'tootingly' is, however, obviously allied to the Tibetan \\textit{bud}, pf. \\textit{p'u} 'to blow a trumpet.'}\n\nThe names of the Burmese months are altogether different from the Tibetan, as might, indeed, be expected from the relatively late date at which calendars were introduced, nor are the seasons similarly called. \\textit{Ku}\u2014'year,' used only in certain dates, is probably, however, the Tibetan \\textit{dgun}. The Burmese have naturally retained the old words for 'cold' (T. \\textit{gr\u0101n}, B. \\textit{kyam}), for 'hoar-frost' (T. \\textit{zil-dkar}, B. \\textit{ch'i-k'\u0113}), and 'to warm oneself at the fire' (T. \\textit{sro}, pf. \\textit{sros}, B. \\textit{hlun}), but none to express heat, which sensation is not experienced to any vivid degree in the bleak uplands north of the Himalayas.\n\n\\textbf{Conclusion.}\u2014It is inevitable that many of the results obtained, and opinions arrived at, in a first essay such as this, in a comparatively little known subject, will require hereafter to be considerably modified, if not altogether rejected. The actual truth in most antiquarian matters is only to be arrived at after a long series of discussions, and the reiterated scrutiny of all the evidence available. I venture to hope, however, that the following main conclusions, at least, will not be shaken.\n\nThe Burmans, when quitting their home in Western Tibet, were already considerably advanced in civilization\u2014were, in fact, on very much the same plane as that of peasants now-a-days who inhabit the more sequestered parts. Whatever improvement they may have made mentally since is probably largely due to the introduction of Indian and particularly Buddhist ideas, which have to a considerable extent obliterated their original fairy or demon worship. At the time of the immigration, the Burmans were acquainted with some kind of regular government under a king, and had entered into the agricultural stage of society. They were acquainted with iron and other metals, though this was probably obtained\nby trade which was carried on to no inconsiderable extent. Before starting on their migrations they were not a very warlike race, but, on the other hand, had attained a degree of culture much in advance of the fiercer hill-tribes of cognate race who dwelt in their vicinity. Their language, after leaving the Northern uplands, suffered considerably from decay before being reduced to writing.\n\nIt is possible, though not proved, that a smaller migration from Central took place after the main one from Western Tibet, which latter, taking all circumstances into consideration, would seem to have taken place during the present Christian era. The numerous kings who are stated to have reigned in Burma B.C. may be dismissed as entirely apocryphal, or, at least, they did not reign over a people who can be linguistically identified with the present Burmese race.\nART. III.\u2014Chao Ju-kua, a new source of Medi\u00e6val Geography.\n\nBy F. HIRTH, Ph.D.\n\nThere is probably no study more fascinating to the student of historical geography during the period preceding Marco Polo than that of the Oriental maritime trade, which made Arabic enterprise the ruling element in the commercial world for centuries before the rise of the Portuguese. The ocean-trade of almost every port in those waters, which may be said to reach from the coast of Morocco in the west to that of Japan and Corea in the east, was in the hands of Arab merchants. We need not be astonished, therefore, to find that Arabic authors are the principal source of what we know, not only about the navigation of that period, but also about the ethnography of the nations with whom their countrymen had come into contact.\n\nI do not propose here to review the well-known reports, dating from three different centuries, in which Arabic authors have handed down, I may almost say, our entire knowledge of the Oriental sea-trade of those days. The Abbaside period, the epoch following Mahmud's conquest of India, and the Mongol era, have each contributed their share. The accounts of Soleiman and other Arab seafarers, edited by Renaudot and Reinaud, belong to the ninth century. Arab geographers have since monopolised the field down to the time of Marco Polo.\n\nThankful though we may be for these efforts of Arab industry, we are bound to admit that, while receiving from them powerful encouragement in extending our knowledge of this branch of historical geography, we have to lament many a gap where information is most urgently wanted. Our curiosity being once roused, we should like to complete\nthe picture by a few bold but realistic dashes from a contemporaneous brush. Such a desire will probably never be satisfied. The value of the work done by such writers as Reinaud's Arab travellers, Ma\u00e7oudi and Ibn Batuta, has been doubled and trebled by the acumen of their interpreters; and further efforts may succeed in eliciting additional information from these texts in parts where they still remain a mystery to us. In the meantime new matter, information collected at the period concerned, is of the greatest importance wherever it may be found. Such new matter I am now able to contribute from a source scarcely thought of by the friends of Arabic geography\u2014a Chinese author who wrote at the beginning of the thirteenth century. I have before me a critical digest regarding the author and his work, and an English translation of the latter which, with the most essential points of interpretation, has occupied me for the last ten years. I have gone through the translation several times, in order to be as sure of the exact sense of all the details as a fair knowledge of the Chinese language in an enthusiastic European will admit; I have then examined every sentence in company with a student of Chinese, thoroughly capable of tracing an oversight if any should have crept in\u2014Mr. E. H. Fraser, lately H.B.M. Consul at Chungking\u2014to whose critical interest I am indebted for many a valuable improvement in my translation.\n\nThe Chinese author of whom I speak may almost be called an Arab authority, inasmuch as we have reason to believe that he collected his information from the Arab traders with whom he came into contact.\n\nChao Ju-kua, whose work, the Chu-fan-chih, i.e. \"Record of Foreign Countries,\" I have attempted to translate and, to a limited extent, to interpret, is an author quite undeservedly unknown, both among his countrymen, the Chinese, and among foreigners. Neither Schott nor Wylie seem to have known his name. Bretschneider, in his Botanicon Sinicum, mentions the work as quoted in the abbreviated edition of the \"Catalogue of the Imperial\nLibrary of Peking\"; but he, too, has apparently never seen the book, since, had this been the case, with the well-known speculative talent which has helped him to select valuable sources of information out of endless lists of Chinese works, he could not have failed to discover its importance in the history of Oriental trade. I am bound to assume that L\u00e9on de Rosny, with all his diligence in searching for Chinese texts throwing light on this subject, has handled the book for a short time only. For, while communicating a few highly useful extracts, in the Journal Asiatique of 1861, regarding Japan and the Loo-Choo Islands, he does not avail himself of the information contained in the Chu-fan-chih in his later work on the Oriental nations known to the ancient Chinese (Les peuples orientaux connus des anciens Chinois), a revised third edition of which appeared in 1892. Pauthier, in 1857, published a translation of Ju-kua's chapter on Ta-ts'in in his well-known treatise De l'authenticit\u00e9 de l'inscription nestorienne de Si-ngan-fu; and I conclude from certain notes furnished by St. Julien to Renan, published in Renan's Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des langues s\u00e9mitiques, that the former had read, though misunderstood, the same chapter. A French version of this short part of Chao Ju-kua's text appears also in Huc's Le christianisme en Chine, though I am not able to say at present by whom it was prepared. My own version of the same chapter appears in China and the Roman Orient, published in 1885. Some notes, with a short extract, introducing the Chinese author, have appeared in vol. i of my Chinesische Studien (Leipzig, 1890), and I have recently, in a supplementary fascicule of the T'oung-pao (Leiden, 1894), published a German version of Ju-kua's chapters on the Arab possessions as a first instalment regarding \"Die L\u00e4nder des Isl\u00e2m nach chinesischen Quellen,\" and an extract on the Kingdom of Malabar, pp. 149 seqq. in vol. vi of the same periodical. I am not aware that, apart from the few instances just mentioned, the work of Chao Ju-kua has been referred to by Western writers.\nIn China, too, the book is very little known, and copies of it are exceedingly rare; in fact, the only two copies I have seen formed part of an expensive collection of reprints. The numerous biographical works of the Chinese, with all their comprehensiveness, are perfectly silent on its author, whose name is neither mentioned among the biographies of the Sung-shih, the national history of the period, nor apparently in the minor records of those, and later times, which would have been collected in such works as the Wan-hsing-t'ung-p'u, the biographical Thesaurus of the Ming dynasty and the first collective biographical record published after the probable lifetime of our author.\n\nThe Chu-fan-chih, though decidedly the most important source on the Oriental sea-trade of the Sung period, is but seldom quoted in later works. It has had the misfortune of being copied, though incompletely, by T'o-t'o, the author of the official history of the period, the Sung-shih. The result is that later authors, when referring to the foreign nations, quote the latter in preference to the older work. Ma Tuan-lin, whose cyclopaedia appeared about a century after Chao Ju-kua, borrows from him without a word of acknowledgment. Unfortunately this is the rule, or at least a very common occurrence, in Chinese literature. The existence of the Chinese national histories, such as the two Han-shu, the T'ang-shu, etc., has to atone for the loss of many a special work on ancient or medi\u00e6val geography. It may be some sort of consolation in view of the entire disappearance of the great Chinese explorer Chang K'ien's work (if it were at all written by himself), the Chang-ch'ien-ch'\u00fc-kuan-chih, that we may point to the account of his expeditions in the Shih-ki by Se\u00fc-ma Ch'ien; possibly the loss of another very important work, the Hsi-y\u00fc-t'\u00fc-chi, an account of Central Asia early during the seventh century, by Pei Ch'\u00fc, may be made up for by certain unacknowledged portions of the Sui-shu, the official history of the period, as Von Richthofen assumes (\"China,\" vol. i, p. 530). But a comparison of the text furnished by Chao Ju-kua, with the extracts made from it with and without acknowledgment\nby later authors, clearly shows how much we would have lost as regards matter-of-fact information, had the Chu-fan-chih shared the fate of Chang K'ien's and Pei Ch'\u00fc's works, which we know were still kept in the Imperial Library in A.D. 618.\n\nAnd a narrow escape the Chu-fan-chih has had from being lost to the memory of man. It must have been a rare book at any time. It is well known that the Chinese do not print editions, as we do, of 100, 500, or 1000 copies at a time, when a book is published; but the wooden blocks being preserved in the publisher's library, merely as many copies are struck off as are required to satisfy immediate demand. If perchance the printing-blocks get lost or destroyed, the entire edition rests on the number of copies which happen to have been taken. To reprint such a work as the Chu-fan-chih would have required stronger demand on the part of the public than probably ever made itself felt during the Sung period. Geographical studies, though extensively applied to every part of China proper, were treated with a certain amount of indifference where foreign countries were concerned. Whatever enthusiasm we may admire in a few single individuals of the Chao Ju-kua kind, the public taste was not given that way. Chang K'ien and Pan Ch'ao, the early explorers, had become national heroes, it is true; Fa Hsien and Hs\u00fcan Chuang, the Buddhist travellers, had in their time occupied public attention to a high degree. But Confucian learning was the order of the day at the end of the twelfth century, when Chu Hi wrote his great commentaries: the antiquities of China, the history of its art; the philosophy of the classical and the Taoist schools, with their mystical degenerations; Buddhist cosmology, the poetry of the past and present\u2014all were studied with an ardour worthy of a period which may be called the age of renaissance in China, while the knowledge of foreign countries was merely an obscure branch taken up by a few amateurs. Confucian philosophers actually threw discredit on what was then known of foreign geography,\nand I can at least quote one of the well-known essayists of the period, Ch'\u00eang Ta-ch'ang, who died in 1195, and who in his antiquarian work, the *K'ao-ku-pien*, tries to make out that foreign geography is absolutely untrustworthy. The arguments he uses in support of his assertion, however, show that the untrustworthiness lies entirely with himself, who, to judge from his remarks, must have been altogether destitute of geographical sense.\n\nThe *Chu-fan-chih* is mentioned in the descriptive catalogue of the library belonging to the celebrated bibliophile Ch'\u00ean Ch\u00ean-sun, who furnished the greater part of the bibliographical portion of Ma Tuan-lin's cyclop\u00e6dia, published in 1319. Ch'\u00ean Ch\u00ean-sun was appointed Prefect of Kia-hing-fu in Ch\u00eakiang in 1234\u20131237; this is the only date I can discover regarding his lifetime. Probably the *Chu-fan-chih* had then existed for a number of years, though all the evidence therefore rests with what we learn from the text itself, which cannot have been concluded before the year 1205, owing to an Arab embassy being mentioned in it as having come to China during the years 1205\u20131208, nor after the year 1258, because Baghdad is described in it as being governed by rulers who called themselves the lineal descendants from the prophet Muhammad. The book is quoted in the *Ch\u00ean-la-f\u00eang-t'u-chi*\u2014the description of an embassy to Cambodja terminated in 1297, written by Chou Ta-kuan, a member of that mission, of which there is a French translation by R\u00e9musat in the first volume of his *Nouveaux M\u00e9langes Asiatiques*.\n\nIt appears that, during the Mongol period, Chao Ju-kua's work fell into entire oblivion, and it must have been very rare indeed in A.D. 1407, when it was received into that gigantic collection of manuscripts published under the name of *Yung-lo-ta-tien*. Thereby the work has actually been saved to us, for I doubt whether we shall ever succeed in finding a copy printed previous to that date. There, too, the work remained buried for centuries, inaccessible to the public and exposed to the danger of being annihilated by fire, until in 1783 it was unearthed again with other\nliterary treasures by a great lover of his native literature, Li T'iao-y\u00fcan, whose biography will be found in the provincial gazetteer, the Ssu-ch'uan-t'ung-chih. Born in Lo-chiang-hsien, in Szechuen, he followed his father\u2014who, like most high officials, was ordered about from one province of China to another\u2014and, after a good education, showed considerable literary taste. Having taken his degree as Chin-shih in 1763, he tried to combine a student's life with his official career, which brought him to the neighbourhood of Peking. Here, as a member of the Academy (Han-lin), he had, of course, access to the Academy library, where, according to Mayers, in his instructive paper on the \"Bibliography of the Chinese Imperial Collections of Literature,\" in the sixth volume of the China Review, the Yung-lo-ta-tien is said to have been preserved down to our days. The existence of so many highly important works being buried in the chambers of the Academy was a trouble to a public-spirited man of Li T'iao-y\u00fcan's order. He, therefore, copied what seemed to him the works best worthy of being introduced to the general public, and printed them afterwards with his own works and some other matter in the collection known as Han-hai, first published in 1783, of which two further editions are known in Szechuen. From this, the first printed copy as far as I am aware, another edition has been received into the collection of reprints published by Chang Hai-p'\u00eang in Chao-w\u00ean, near Soochow, in 200 p\u00ean, under the name of Hsiao-tsin-t'ao-y\u00fcan, which appeared in 1805, previous to the second edition of the Han-hai, published in 1809. I have compared the two texts and found none but trivial variants, such as would in no case affect the translation, for which reason I shall not notice them.\n\nThese are the only editions I have fallen in with after many years' ransacking of the Chinese book stores at Shanghai and Yang-chow, the latter place being an important market for literary curiosities as well as antiquities, whence even the curio dealers at Shanghai draw much of their ancient porcelain. A copy of the Chu-fan-chih must\nbe, or have been, among the Chinese books of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale in Paris, since Pauthier quotes from it in his work on the Nestorian inscription. I am not aware that the British Museum has a copy, at least it was not enumerated in Dr. Douglas' Catalogue of 1877.\n\nAll we know about the author's life is a very scanty notice of his book in the bibliophile Ch'en Ch\u00ean-sun's descriptive Catalogue, written some time during the early part, or the middle, of the thirteenth century. It says, by way of explanation, after the title Chu-fan-chih: \"the Inspector of Foreign Trade in Fukien, Chao Ju-kua, records [in this book] the several foreign countries and the merchandize which come from them.\"\n\nThis is very little indeed; and yet it speaks volumes towards the elucidation of our subject, if we try to read between the lines. The Inspector of Foreign Trade, in Chinese T'i-ch\u00fc-shih-po, i.e. \"Shih-po by special appointment,\" or simply Shih-po, or Shih-po-shih, was during the Sung dynasty an official whose functions corresponded to the combined position of the present Superintendent and Commissioner of Customs. Indeed, in the Li-tai-chih-kuan-piao, a tabular list of the names of all the public offices of the present Empire and their equivalents during the various former dynasties, compiled in 1780, though not published in book form until 1844, the Shih-po-shih of the Sung dynasty is identified with the modern Kuan-shui-chien-tu, i.e. the Superintendent of Customs.\n\nIn the Sung-shih we are repeatedly told that this officer had to superintend the collection of taxes on the trade carried on by the sea-going vessels laden with foreign goods, especially those being brought from afar by the inhabitants of distant countries.\n\nThe history of this office may for this reason be said to represent the history of foreign sea-trade in China. Foreign trade had for a long time been covered by the name, inseparable from the early foreign enterprise of Chinese Courts, of \"tribute.\" The word \"tribute,\" in Chinese Kung, was nothing but a substitute for what\nmight as well have been called \"exchange of produce\" or \"trade,\" the trade with foreign nations being a monopoly of the Court. The latter would refuse to trade unless it was done under its own conditions, viz. the appearance of the offering of gifts as a sign of submission and admiration on the part of a distant monarch. In each case the full equivalent was paid for these offerings in the shape of counter-gifts presented to the so-called ambassadors by the Chinese Court. If these counter-gifts had not made it worth their while to submit to all the trouble and even humiliation imposed on the tribute-bearers, we should not see such a long list of distant nations recorded as regular tribute-countries, such as India, Persia, and Arabia, who had nothing to gain or to lose by the friendship of China. I am inclined to believe that, with exceptions of course, these tribute-bearers were in reality nothing better than private merchants who purchased the counter-gifts of the Court under the pretext of bringing tribute in the name of some distant monarch. The description and quantity of goods returned to such tribute-bearers as a reward for the submissive feelings expressed by them on behalf of their monarchs have in many cases been placed on record by the court historians, and if measured by our present estimation of their value, point to a trade as lucrative as any carried on under modern treaty regulations. Such relations had existed between China and the neighbouring countries from the oldest times; they had assumed larger dimensions under the Han, when certain nations were compelled by force of arms to send in tribute, while others, like Parthians and Syrians, volunteered it as a matter of speculation. The regularity with which these transactions took place led, of course, to the creation of court officers connected with their management. We read in the Sui-shu that an office called Ssu-fang-kuan was established under the Emperor Yang-ti during the period 605-617 at the Chinese capital, for the special purpose of receiving the ambassadors of the countries in the four directions of the compass (ssu-fang), viz. those\nin the east, principally Japan; in the south, represented by the southern barbarians on the continent and the Archipelago (nan-man); in the west, represented by the Central Asiatic tribes (hsi-jung); and in the north, represented by the pei-ti (Tartars, Hsiung-nu, Tunguses, etc.). For each of these four classes of traffic a special officer was appointed, whose duty it was to superintend the \"exchange of produce\" (hu-shih, lit. \"mutual marketing\"), besides the duties connected with the reception of the mission. This shows clearly enough that, even in those early days, the embassies received at Court were not purely political or complimentary, but have to be looked upon as representing the official form in which trade was then conducted. The superintending officers were then stationed at the capital; but later on, when trade by sea assumed larger dimensions, the necessity arose to appoint Special Commissioners, precursors as it were of the modern Superintendents and Commissioners of Customs, at the places where foreign merchandise was imported in exchange for native produce.\n\nOf all the ports open to trade during the several periods of Chinese history, Canton, or some locality near Canton, is probably the oldest. We have seen that ocean-trade between China and the countries of Western Asia had its terminus in some port of Tonkin or Annam on the southern frontier of China, and I have ventured to identify this port, wherever it may have been situated, with the eastern terminus of Roman navigation, Kattigara, adding some arguments in support of a suggestion made by Baron von Richthofen. This port was apparently the terminus of Western trade as late as A.D. 226, when Ts'in Lun, a native of Ta-ts'in (Syria) landed there; but Canton, or some place in its neighbourhood, must have been opened to foreign trade in the same century, since we read in a work of A.D. 300, the Nan-fang-ts'ao-mu-chuang, that foreigners from Western countries introduced the cultivation of the jasmine-plant into Nan-hai, i.e. the Canton district. I am inclined to believe that this port,\nthe cradle of foreign trade in recent days, has ever since\nthe third century been one of the main channels of ocean\ncommerce.\n\nPositive evidence is on record in the eighth century.\nI read in the *T'ang-kuo-shih-pu*, by Li Chao, a work of\nthe beginning of the ninth century, purporting to record\nhistorical facts concerning the period 713\u2013825, that \"the\nsea-going ships of Canton were foreign vessels (*Nan-\nhai-po wei-kuo ch'uan yeh*); that they made annual trips to\nAnnam, Kuang-chou [probably a place in the Gulf of\nTonkin], and Ceylon.\" \"These ships were of the greatest\nsize, so that, for going on board, ladders several chang in\nlength had to be used. The skippers would collect cargoes\nof valuable goods, and when the ship was about to leave,\nthe local inspector submitted a report to the provincial chief,\nwhich was styled 'beating the alarm drum.' The ship\nwas in charge of a foreign captain (*yu fan-ch'ang wei chu*),\nwhose name had to be registered by the Shih-po-shih, and\nthe latter collected the taxes on the goods as well as the\nship's freight. The exportation of precious and rare articles\nwas forbidden, and if a foreign trader [apparently a Chinese\nmerchant trading to foreign countries] became guilty of\nsmuggling them, he was put into prison. During the\nvoyage white pigeons had to be kept on board to serve\nas messengers, as they would return to their home, though\nseveral thousand li away from it, in case the vessel should\nbe lost.\" The author goes on to say that \"the skippers\nmaintain that even rats have souls; for, if the rats on\nboard should flock together and leave the ship, shipwreck\nis bound to occur within ten days.\" It is evident from\nthis account, the authenticity and antiquity of which is\nnot subject to the slightest doubt, that foreign ships were\nin the eighth century chartered by the Chinese Government,\nand that the modern China Merchants Company had its\nprototype over a thousand years ago. The mention of white\npigeons being kept on board these ships may contain a\nhint as to their nationality, since I have strong reason to\nbelieve that the use of carrier pigeons was introduced into\nChina by Persian traders. Carrier pigeons are mentioned as a familiar Persian institution by Ma\u00e7oudi, and, during the Mongol rule in Persia, important news was entrusted to the flying messenger, as I conclude from two occurrences mentioned in Hammer-Purgstall\u2019s \u201cHistory of the Ilkhans.\u201d Their earliest mention in China is connected with the biography of the well-known statesman Chang Chiu-ling, the faithful minister of the Emperor Hs\u00fcan-tsung, who, as a boy, tied letters to the feet of pigeons returning home. Chang Chiu-ling was born in 673; the anecdote referred to, which is told in the K'ai-y\u00fcan-i-shih (or \u201cHistorical Gleanings of the K'ai-y\u00fcan Period,\u201d i.e. 713 to 742), therefore, belongs to the end of the seventh century. Carrier pigeons cannot then have been in general use in China, or else the anecdote would not have been worth telling. But we are assured in another old work, the Yu-yang-tsa-tsu, of the eighth century, that \u201cpigeons are sent home from on board the Persian ships at distances of several thousand li as messengers of peace.\u201d I am not able to say how the superstition about rats leaving a ship has originated, but to judge from the record quoted, it must have been current among Persian skippers over a thousand years ago.\n\nThe history of the office of Shih-po has been compiled by Ma Tuan-lin in his sixty-second chapter; fuller details, however, will be found in the Sung-shih. The interest we may take in such an abstruse subject as the history of a Chinese Government office in its early phases is fully justified, if we consider its close connection with the development of foreign trade in China. Ma Tuan-lin refers us to the biography, contained in the history of the T'ang dynasty, of the statesman Liu Ts\u00ea, who, during the K'ai-y\u00fcan period (713 to 742), held among other offices that of Shih-po-shih at Canton, then called Ling-nan. This appears to be the oldest mention of the office held by Chao Ju-kua five hundred years later. For centuries Canton must have been the only channel through which foreign trade was permitted; for it is not before the year 999 that\nwe read of the appointment of Inspectors of Trade at Hang-chou and Ming-chou. The latter name is identical with Ningpo. Ma Tuan-lin adds: \"at the request and for the convenience of foreign officials\" (ting fan-kuan ts'ung-pien), which may involve that foreign, probably Arab or Persian, or Indian, communities then existed at those ports, and that they were under the jurisdiction of judges of their own nationality. According to a passage in the Sung-shih (ch. 186), the trade superintended by the Shih-po during the early part of the Sung dynasty was carried on with the following countries: Ta-shih (Arabia); Ku-lo (probably Kalah, on the Malayan Peninsula); Java; Cochin China; Borneo; Ma-yi (probably the Philippines); and San-fo-ch'i (Palembang, Sumatra).\n\nAn important change took place in the Hsi-ning period (A.D. 1068 to 1078), when the ocean-traders of Ch'\u00fcan-chou-fu were obliged to put into Canton (probably one of its revenue stations on the sea-coast) on their return journeys for payment of duty, before they were permitted to sail farther east, failing which their cargoes became liable to confiscation. If they made their escape home by sailing in a wide circle around the station, the penalty was enforced all the same, even though more than six months might have elapsed since the offence was committed. The Prefect of Ch'\u00fcan-chou, therefore, submitted to the Throne the desirability of a Shih-po being appointed at that port; but these representations remained unheeded till the accession of the Emperor Ch\u00ea-tsung, who, in the second year of his reign (A.D. 1087), ordered the desired office to be established at Ch'\u00fcan-chou.\n\nVarious changes are on record regarding this post which, suiting the exigencies of trade, was either represented by\n\n---\n\n1 This is in my opinion the principal reason why the port of Khanfu, mentioned by the earliest Muhammadan travellers, or authors (Soleiman, Abu Zeid, and Ma\u00e7oudi), cannot be identified with Hang-chou. The report of Soleiman, who first speaks of Khanfu, was written in 851, and in those days Canton was apparently the only port open to foreign trade. Marco Polo's Ganfu is a different port altogether, viz. Kan-fu, or Kan-pu, near Hang-chou, and should not be confounded with Khanfu.\na special officer, or administered in connection with some other office, or abolished altogether temporarily and re-established when required. In 1144 the levy of a duty of forty per cent. on all \"fragrant drugs\" was introduced; in 1147 this duty was reduced to ten per cent. on the so-called \"fine fragrant drugs,\" which comprised cloves, eaglewood, nutmegs, and camphor. In 1166 the inspectorate in Ch\u00eakiang was transferred to the local officials at the ports. \"Squeezes\" and other malpractices led to the temporary abolition of these posts here and there during the Sung dynasty, but we find them again under the Mongols.\n\nMa Tuan-lin's sketch of the history of the inspectorate is somewhat condensed; we find much fuller information in the Sung-shih, but I must admit that it is not always smooth sailing trying to find one's way in these ancient records. It appears from this fuller account that, originally, the entire foreign trade had to pass through the official treasuries, and that the importation at least of all incenses and other goods of intrinsic value was a State monopoly. Later on this monopoly was confined to pearls, tortoiseshell, rhinoceros horns, ivory, steel, turtle-skin, corals, cornelian stones, and frankincense. Towards the end of the tenth century (984 to 988) the Chinese Court fitted out a commercial expedition with a view to encourage trade with \"the foreign nations in the south of the sea.\" Eight officers of the Imperial Palace were placed in charge of that mission, and provided with credentials and funds for the purchase of goods. These funds consisted of gold bullion and piece goods. The result of this revival of foreign trading relations was that the people were allowed to share in this traffic, but merchants engaging in ocean-trade had to apply to the inspectors in Ch\u00eakiang and the Shih-po-ss\u00fc for an official license, on pain of the confiscation of their goods. Moreover, a scale of fines held out certain penalties for clandestinely trading with a foreigner even to a very limited extent, exchange of produce to the extent of merely a hundred cash being\nthreatened with punishment. Whoever bought fifteen strings' worth of goods without a license had his face branded, and was banished to an island of the sea. We read that in 994 these laws were modified by a liberal change in the scale of penalties, and it appears that the Court soon came to the conclusion that the monopoly system could not be upheld with its original strictness. Since the T'ien-sheng period (1023 to 1032), the Sung-shih says, large stocks of ivory, pearls, jadestone, incenses, medicines, and precious stones had been hoarded up in the Imperial Treasury; and since the Court was not in need of all this, the surplus was sold to the people in exchange for gold, piece goods, straw, and paddy, for the benefit of the provincial district administration, which was a real help to them. If, in explaining the early tribute missions as mere pretexts for trade under Court monopoly, we must admit that, nominally, produce may have been purchased to cover the consumption of the Court, this sale of surplus stocks to the people certainly stamps Court purchases as trading transactions pure and simple.\n\nAt this stage of its account the Sung-shih inserts what may be considered an early specimen of commercial statistics. It makes the accumulation of goods in the Treasury responsible for a stagnation in the importation of foreign merchandise observed in 994, and, in order to show how the recent measure had caused the trade to recover, quotes the following comparative figures:\n\n\"In A.D. 1049 to 1054 the annual importation of ivory, rhinoceros horns, pearls, jadestone, incenses, and medicines exceeded 530,000 [strings, I presume, worth about a dollar each nowadays]; this amount had increased by a hundred thousand during the period 1064 to 1068.\"\n\nIn 1072 private merchants were allowed a share in the profit out of the foreign trade, and it appears from the Sung-shih that the appointment of a Shih-po at Ch'\u00fcan-chou was then applied for, which Ma Tuan-lin tells us was not made before the year 1087.\n\nThe further history of the Shih-po office as described in\nthe *Y\u00fcan-shih*, the history of the Mongol dynasty in China, is particularly interesting, as it affords us an opportunity to check by it various statements made by Marco Polo as to the Great Khan's revenue. I propose to return to this subject on some future occasion, and now merely mention that about the time of Marco Polo's departure from Zaitun, the Shih-po-ss\u00fc was stationed at Ch'\u00fcan-chou, and not at Chang-chou or any other place of the neighbourhood, which is in my opinion a very strong argument in favour of the identity of Ch'\u00fcan-chou with Zaitun. We read in the *Y\u00fcan-shih* that in 1293 a Shih-po-ss\u00fc was stationed at each of the following seven ports, viz.: Ch'\u00fcan-chou, Shanghai, Kan-pu (near Hangchow), Wenchow, Canton, Hang-chou, and Ch'ing-y\u00fcan (*i.e.* Ningpo).\n\nThe port of Ch'\u00fcan-chou, in the east of Amoy, has always been considered as identical with that of Zaitun, described by Arab travellers, Marco Polo and others, as the chief trading-place in those waters; recently, however, Chang-chou, in the west of Amoy, has been mentioned as a place possessing greater claims to having been a resort of foreign trade. This may be true as far as the Ming period is concerned. I cannot, however, agree to this view in connection with Sung and Mongol trade, whatever praise I may feel disposed to bestow on the pains-taking researches of Mr. George Phillips, the originator and defender of the Chang-chou theory. It seems natural that the place where the chief officer for collecting the customs revenue from foreign trade is stationed is identical with the place where, according to foreign accounts, that trade was principally carried on, and Abulfeda (Yule, *Cathay*, exciii) distinctly says: \"It is also stated that Shanju, known in our time as Zaitun, is one of the ports of China, and with them the ports are also the places of customs.\" Moreover, Chao Ju-kua looks upon Ch'\u00fcan-chou as the starting-point for the distant journey to foreign countries, such as Arabia, and that this was so at the time of Marco Polo's arrival in China may be seen from an extract from the *M\u00eang-liang-lu*, a description of the city\nof Hang-chou, issued in 1274, which I published in the December number of the *T'oung-pao* of 1894, and whose author distinctly says that while Tai-chou, Wen-chou, etc., are ports resorted to for local trade, \"those who wish to make the journey across the distant ocean start at Ch'\u00fcan-chou and sail through the straits of Tai-hs\u00fc.\" If Chang-chou had been identical with Zaitun it would have been enumerated among the seven ports \"open to foreign trade in 1293,\" if we may thus interpret the establishment at them of Foreign Trade Inspectors.\n\nA number of other facts, too, which I shall deal with more fully on some other occasion, point to the port of Ch'\u00fcan-chou as a resort of foreign traders long before Marco Polo. Chao Ju-kua informs us on good authority that a foreign merchant, by name of Shih-na-wei (Sena\u00ef?), a native of Ta-shih, i.e. Arabia, took up his residence in the south of Ch'\u00fcan. \"Taking pleasure in charitable acts, he made a burial-place in the south-east outside the city for the interment of the remains of foreign traders.\" Chao Ju-kua quotes one Lin Chih-ch'i, a predecessor of his in the office of Shih-po, as having placed this fact on record. The biography of Lin Chih-ch'i happens to be preserved in the *Sung-shih*, and shows that he died in 1176. The burial-place referred to by him must, therefore, have existed before that year, and we are probably quite justified in assuming that a colony of Arab traders existed at Ch'\u00fcan-chou as early as the middle of the twelfth century. I am strengthened in this assumption by what the local chronicles, quoted in the *T'u-shu-chi-ch'eng* (section 6, chapter 1500), place on record in connection with a temple or mosque called Ch'ing-ching-se\u00fc, which was built at Ch'\u00fcan-chou by certain Muhammadans (*hui-j\u00ean*) during the Shao-hsing period, i.e. between the years 1131 and 1163. Among the antiquities of the place we find quoted in the same cyclopaedia (*ibid.*, ch. 1045) from the *Ch'\u00fcan-chou-fu-chih* that on the Ling-shan, lit. the Hill of Souls, in the south-east of the city, there were preserved the Muhammadan tombs or \"Tombs of\nthe Medina-men,\u201d as they were styled. These I shall be able to show were the tombs of the Muhammadan apostles, supposed to be the first who brought this faith to Ch\u2018\u00fcan-chou. According to an account given in the Min-shu, which, from the way in which foreign names are transcribed in it, I conclude to have been written down from verbal communications during the Ming or Mongol period, \u201cthe Muhammadans (hui-hui-chia) say there was in Medina a saint Ma-han-pa-t\u00ea (Muhammad), born in the first year of K\u2018ai-huang of the Sui dynasty, i.e. A.D. 581.\u201d This is exactly ten years later than the birth date calculated by Sprenger, viz. the 20th April, A.D. 571. \u201cThe saint having become conspicuous as an admirable man, the king of the country invited him to the royal seat. In the 20th year [of K\u2018ai-huang, i.e. A.D. 600, perhaps \u2018for twenty years\u2019] he was inspired to make known the classical books, teaching how to love what is good and hate what is bad, and spread the religion he had received from Heaven. The sun did not scorch him, the heaviest rain did not wet his clothes, he walked into a fire without dying, and kept under water without drowning. He had as disciples four wise men who came to our Court during the period Wu-t\u00ea (618 to 627) of the T\u2018ang dynasty, and in the sequel became teachers of their religion in China. One of them taught Canton, the second taught Yang-chou, the third and fourth taught Ch\u2018\u00fcan-chou, and upon their death were buried on this hill. The two men to whom these tombs belong were thus men of the Y\u2018ang period. Since these two bodies were buried there, a glory appears on this hill at night which is considered a great wonder by the people, who call it \u2018the Holy Tomb,\u2019 or \u2018the Tomb of the Western Saints.\u2019\u201d\n\nI do not think for a moment that much more historical value need be attached to this account than to any religious legend of the kind; but the story seems to show that, among the natives, Ch\u2018\u00fcan-chou was considered the cradle of Muhammadanism in this neighbourhood.\n\nIn his description of Nan-p\u2018i (Nambi, Namburi?), a\ncountry which I have identified with the kingdom of Malabar, Chao Ju-kua refers to two foreigners, father and son, who came from Malabar, and who lived at his time \"in the south of the city of Ch'\u00fcan.\" The southern suburbs of that city probably contained the foreign settlement, which, moreover, is most likely to have occupied a site facing the harbour, or as near as possible to the anchorage, which is actually in the south of the city. Here, indeed, stood a Buddhist temple, the Pao-lin-y\u00fcan of Ju-kua's time, which had been built by an Indian devotee, by name of Lo-hu-na (R\u0101hula?), at the end of the tenth century. It appears from Chao Ju-kua's description of T'ien-chu (part of India) that foreign merchants even then frequented the port; for when the devotee had come, \"they vied with each other in presenting him with gold, silks, jewels, and precious stones,\" which the disinterested monk invested in the building of a temple. However, the term standing here for \"foreign merchants\" (fan-shang) may possibly mean \"Chinese merchants trading to foreign countries.\" Such, however, is not the case with the \"foreign traders\" who, according to the Ch'\u00fcan-chou-fu-chih, in 1211, petitioned the Court, through the local prefect, for permission to put into thorough repair, from funds raised by a subscription list among themselves, the city wall of Ch'\u00fcan-chou. Ibn Batuta says that in Zaitun \"the Muhammadans have a city by themselves,\" and it is probably for the safety of the Muhammadan settlement that these subscriptions were raised. The year 1211 is probably just about the time when Chao Ju-kua collected his notes. The relations between natives and the foreign residents must have been particularly good then, and the foreign community must have seen palmy days indeed if they could afford to build city walls for the Chinese. Such times would naturally be favourable to friendly intercourse between an official in the Shih-po's position and the prominent Arabian and Indian merchants; for the Shih-po was not only, as we have seen, the chief authority for all matters connected with foreign shipping, but even\nperformed functions resembling those of a foreign consul. Certainly shipwrecked strangers, whose nationality could not be ascertained, were sent to him to be dealt with. I am able to quote an instance in the case of a lengthy account of a shipwreck, which occurred in 1150 near Foo-chow, when a Chinese adventurer, who had spent many years somewhere in the Archipelago, was thrown on shore with some dark natives, including his, probably Malay, wife, and who were sent on by the local authorities to the Shih-po in Ch'\u00fcan-chou, who was to provide them with a passage to their native country.\n\nI could easily multiply the number of arguments which speak in favour of the identity of Ch'\u00fcan-chou with the Zaitun of Western authors. But I shall take it for granted that the prominence given by the Chinese authorities quoted to the connection of the Shih-po of Ch'\u00fcan-chou with the foreign ocean-trade, and the fact of our author's introducing his accounts of various countries by the words, \"ships start at Ch'\u00fcan . . . ,\" etc., is quite enough to indicate Chao Ju-kua's connection with that city. I have dwelt at some length on this point, because it seems to throw more light on the probable origin of his work than any amount of detail regarding his personal history would have done. Of the latter I have only succeeded in tracing the following facts.\n\nChao Ju-kua was a member of the imperial family of the Sung dynasty, whose name was Chao; and Chao is the family name of all the members, whatever their titles may have been as emperors or princes. But while all the lineal descendants of the founder of the dynasty, the Emperor T'ai-tsu, had this common family name, the personal name, or ming, varied, of course, but was given to each new-born member according to fixed regulations, under which the ming is to consist of two characters, the first being common to all belonging to the same generation, while the second was peculiar to the individual bearing it. Thus the name Chao Ju-kua, as belonging to this family name system, may be interpreted to mean Kua of the Ju generation of the Chao family.\nThe Chinese have at all ages been very careful about their pedigrees. The family name (hsing) is a sacred institution; every respectable family has its ancestral hall; many well-to-do houses preserve the history of their pedigree in printed books, and look with a certain pride upon these records. The former Mixed Court Magistrate Huang in Shanghai once presented me with two volumes devoted entirely to the history of his ancestors. During the Mongol period numerous Chinese families abandoned their old names in exchange for Mongol names, but soon after his accession to the throne the Emperor Hung-wu, the founder of the Ming dynasty, issued an edict by which Mongol names were forbidden to all except Mongols by blood. On the other hand, the family name of the ruling emperor was bestowed as a special honour to the representatives of powerful hordes having tendered their submission. Thus the chief of a Mo-ho tribe occupying the Djurdshen country, bounding the sea north of Corea, who had allowed his country to be incorporated into the empire under the name of Hei-shui-fu, was rewarded by his son being named Li Hsien-ch'\u00eang in 722, Li being the family name of the T'ang emperors. As far as I can judge, however, such extensions of the Imperial House \"by adoption,\" as it were, do not affect the pedigree, inasmuch as the genealogical tables compiled by the official historians after the close of a dynasty appear to contain none but the names of natural descendants. If I am not mistaken in this assumption, i.e. if the boon of bearing the emperor's family name has not been extended to the children of daughters and other relatives, the genealogical tables of the Imperial House of Chao, which occupy a series of, say, 400 years, and which are printed in twenty-seven chapters (Nos. 215 to 241) of the Sung-shih, constitute one of the most extensive family records ever published. The Emperor T'ai-tsu had four sons, two of whom left no progeny. The remaining two, T\u00ea-chao and T\u00ea-fang, stand at the apex of a large pyramid of descendants. The first part of the name of each male child born in the \"House\"\nor fang, of which T\u00ea-chao was the head, denoted the generation. The sequence of these generation names was as follows: T\u00ea, Wei, Tsung, Shih, Ling, Tz\u016d, Po, Shih, Hsi, Y\u00fc, M\u00eang, and Yu. It is this branch of the Chao family which produced the greatest painter of the Mongol period, Chao M\u00eang-fu, also known as Tz\u016d-ang, who lived from 1254 to 1322, and who, from his personal name, M\u00eang-fu, may be seen to have belonged to the M\u00eang, or eleventh, generation after T\u2019ai-tsu. Since the founder of the dynasty left the empire to his brother, who reigned under the name of T\u2019ai-tsung, the latter became actually the ancestor of the greater part of the Sung emperors and their descendants. He had nine sons, each of whom stands at the head of a fang or \u201cHouse,\u201d but the first part of the ming in each of these nine genealogical divisions is uniform for the several generations. These generation names follow each other thus: Yuan, Y\u00fcn, Tsung, Chung, Shih, Pu, Shan, Ju, Chung, Pi, Liang, and Yu. Chao Ju-kua, whose name appears in the Genealogical Records, is therefore, a descendant of T\u2019ai-tsung in the eighth generation. The name occurs twice in the Sung-shih, viz. once on p. 58 of chapter ccxxxii, and again on p. 23 of chapter ccxxxiii. I do not know whether there is any special reason for the \u201cCatalogue of the Imperial Library\u201d in two places (lxxi, p. 10, and cxxxv, p. 42) identifying the author of the Chu-fan-chih with the first mentioned, or if the bibliographer of the \u201cCatalogue\u201d was at all aware of the twofold occurrence of the name in the Sung-shih tables. The first name, however, has this point in its favour, that its bearer had a son who distinguished himself as an author. Taking it for granted that the \u201cCatalogue,\u201d for reasons unknown to us, is right in its identification, Chao Ju-kua was a lineal descendant of the Prince of Shang, a younger brother of the Emperor Ch\u00ean-tsung (A.D. 998 to 1023). He was the youngest of four brothers; his father, Shan-tai, was the son of Pu-jou, on whom posthumous rank as Kuang-lu-ta-fu had been bestowed. He, again, Ju-kua\u2019s grandfather, was the son of a Prince of Chung-hu, a grandson of Prince Shang\nabove mentioned. The Chao Ju-kua thus traced in T'o-t'o's genealogical table had two sons, the younger of whom, Chung-hs\u00fcn, became the author of a small cyclop\u00e6dia, the Chi-li (Wylie, Notes, etc., p. 148). Both Ju-kua's sons had children, but his descendants do not reach beyond this, the Pi generation. Apart from our author and his son, I cannot trace any literary or political excellence among his nearer relatives, but several Chaos have become famous as statesmen and politicians, their biographies being preserved in the Sung-shih, and the Imperial Catalogue contains the names of a respectable number of authors, being members of the family, who have created works bearing witness to industry rather than to genius. The Chu-fan-chih is certainly the most interesting to us.\n\nThe methodical arrangement prevailing in these Genealogical Records, as in those of many other Chinese families down to the present day, in connection with the vast material furnished by T'o-t'o in his Sung-shih, gives us an opportunity to compare notes as to the extent of a generation in China. The late Chancellor of the University of T\u00fcbingen, Dr. R\u00fcmelin, in his interesting study \"On the definition of the word and the duration of a generation\" (Reden und Aufs\u00e4tze, T\u00fcbingen, 1875, pp. 285 seqq.), fixes the average duration of a generation for Germany at $36\\frac{1}{2}$ years, for England at $35\\frac{1}{2}$, for France at $34\\frac{1}{2}$; but he adds that lower figures must be assumed for nations, rich in children, where early marriages are customary, and he quotes China as an instance. We have seen that the Ju generation was the eighth after T'ai-tsung, who ascended the throne in 976, being born in 939. If we give the generation in China an average duration of, say, 31 years, which would probably quite answer the learned statistician's theories, the eighth generation should have been born about 1187. I have traced the biographies of some of Ju-kua's cousins, and find that two of them took a degree in 1184, and another died as late as 1261. From a statistical point of view, therefore, the probabilities are that our author flourished during the early part of the thirteenth century,\nsay between 1210 and 1240. This would certainly not contradict the generation theory, which is further illustrated by the painter Chao M\u00eang-fu, born in the year 1254, in the eleventh generation after T\u2019ai-tsu (born in 917). In this instance the average duration of a generation amounts to $30\\frac{2}{3}$ years.\\footnote{It may be of interest to statisticians of human life to compare with this average the duration of life of a number of Chinese national celebrities, both political and literary. The biographies of China\u2019s great men are mostly contained in the twenty-four Dynastic Histories, but it is not in every case that the exact year of birth and death of a man is given; the former especially is usually omitted, perhaps rightly so. The year of his death is certainly more important in a man\u2019s career than that of his birth; for one man may be fifty years old before he does the chief work of his life, while another may do it at the age of twenty-five and then die. Chinese biographers, therefore, often merely tell us that \u201che died in such and such a year at the age of so much,\u201d or even let us infer the death year from some other fact, as if we were to say of Gustavus Adolphus, \u201che died in the battle of L\u00fctzen, thirty-eight years old,\u201d leaving it to the reader to calculate therefrom the years of his birth and death. It was not till the beginning of the present century that the desirability of being informed on the duration of life as described in the various sources of Chinese biographical literature resulted in practical labour. Ch\u2019ien Ta-hsin, a native of Chia-ting-fu, took the trouble to calculate from the biographical records the duration of hundreds of lives from the Han dynasty down to his own time, the last death recorded in his list being one in A.D. 1796. His work was published in 1812 under the title I-nien-lu, and was followed by a supplement in 1814, written by a native of Ch\u00eakiang, the two works being embodied in the collection of reprints called Y\u00fceh-y\u00e0-t\u2019ang-tsung-shu. Though these dates will scarcely help us to determine the length of a generation in China, the results possess some interest to the life statistician, who may wish to compare the following averages with our Western experiences. An abstract from the Chinese work referred to shows that out of 748 individuals whose lifetime could be ascertained by means of their biographies, there died\u2014}\n\n| Age Range | Number |\n|-----------|--------|\n| 24\u201329     | 5      |\n| 30\u201339     | 18     |\n| 40\u201349     | 67     |\n| 50\u201359     | 138    |\n| 60\u201369     | 200    |\n| 70\u201379     | 195    |\n| 80\u201389     | 111    |\n| 90\u201397     | 13     |\n| 106       | (doubtful) |\n\nThe following special abstract, scanty though the material may be, will give us a clue as to the duration of life in China during ancient, as compared with modern times. It certainly does not confirm what Strabo reports of his Seres, if this name can at all be applied to the Chinese, viz. that they were a race\nThe Chao family, whose pedigree has been carried down to the end of the Sung dynasty, continued to flourish, though deprived of official influence, under the Mongols. We read in the Yuan-shih (xv, p. 25), under the year 1289, that its descendants then lived scattered about in the provinces south of the river, and that they were held in high esteem among the people. By this time there must have existed quite a little nation of Chaos. I have not counted the names appearing in the great Genealogical Table of the Sung-shih, which makes up six volumes out of a hundred of the Palace edition of 1739; but at a rough estimate I should say that the number of male individuals registered there as having descended from the first Sung emperor, who bore his name Chao, and were born during the Sung period, i.e. within less than four centuries, amounts to some thirty or forty thousand.\n\nof extraordinary longevity, said to exceed two hundred years (cf.

On the other hand, many of the heroes of Chinese biography were generals who died in battle, or statesmen who lost their lives by punishment or crime.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nSuch as it is, Chao Ju-kua's work must be regarded as a most valuable source of information as regards the ethnography of the nations engaged in the sea-trade carried on by the Arabs in Oriental waters. His notes may be called second-hand information, inasmuch as he places on record the accounts made to him by Arabs, Persians, Indians, or other traders; but, taking this into consideration, we must admit that the percentage of clear and simple matter of fact we find in his work, as compared to the improbable and incredible admixtures which we are accustomed to encounter with all the Oriental authors of his time, gives him a prominent place among the medi\u00e6val authors on the ethnography of their time.\nART. IV.\u2014Notes on Akbar's S\u00fabahs, with reference to the Ain-i Akbar\u00ed. By John Beames, B.C.S. (ret.).\n\nNo. I.\n\nBENGAL.\n\nFor upwards of twenty years the late Professor Blochmann's translation of Abul Fazl's monumental work, the Ain-i Akbar\u00ed, has remained a splendid fragment, and students have longed in vain for its completion. It is, therefore, cause for congratulation that this has at length been effected. Colonel Jarrett's scholarly translation of the remainder of the work, which has recently appeared, is fully equal in accuracy, while it is superior in grace of language, to that of his predecessor. Only those who have laboured over the intricacies of Abul Fazl's detestable style, at one time turgid and overloaded with meaningless phrases, at another so curt and jejune as to be obscure, can fully appreciate the skill and learning which Colonel Jarrett has brought to bear on the supremely difficult task of rendering his author intelligible to European readers.\n\nThe translation, moreover, is illustrated by notes, which, if not so copious as Blochmann's, are sufficient\u2014and more than sufficient\u2014for all practical purposes. It is not given to everyone to possess such stores of learning as the late Professor Blochmann, who was as familiar with the Court and times of Akbar as we are with those of Victoria, and who, in fact, sometimes rather overdid his note-making, giving us treatises instead of notes. Colonel Jarrett's sense of proportion has led him to restrain his notes within reasonable limits, though he is rather unequal in this respect, some subjects being far more generously illustrated than\nothers. Of course there is good reason for this, some subjects being more abstruse and requiring more light thrown upon them than others. The only subject on which the translator can be charged with giving insufficient assistance is the geography; and this is peculiarly unfortunate, because perhaps the most practically useful and interesting portion of the work is the geographical account of the twelve S\u00fabahs at p. 129 of vol. ii, and here the editor leaves us almost entirely without notices. The elucidation of this important section calls, it is true, for minute local knowledge, such as few men possess. No amount of scholarship is here of any use, for the text cannot be relied upon. The Persian character is notoriously the worst in the world for expressing words foreign to the Persian or Arabic languages. The omission of vowels and the fact that nearly half the letters are distinguished from each other merely by dots, which are always carelessly applied and often omitted altogether, introduces an amount of confusion which baffles the most acute student. It is only by knowing beforehand what word is meant that one can be sure of transliterating the original correctly, and this knowledge can only be obtained by careful local enquiry. Colonel Jarrett's authorities seem to be Tiefenthaler, Gladwin, and the Gazetteer of India. But neither of the two former were sufficiently well acquainted with the interior of the country to be trustworthy guides for the spelling of places unknown to fame, and the numerous compilers of the last-named excellent publication were not in any way concerned with the A\u00edn or its geography. No one, as far as I know, has worked out the details of all the twelve S\u00fabahs, though several writers have published partial identifications, and have attempted more or less successfully to reconstruct some of them. The following may be mentioned as the principal, and, indeed, to the best of my belief, the only hitherto published sources of information.\n\n1. Mr. \"Serishtadar\" Grant's \"Analysis of the Finances of Bengal,\" being Appendix iv to the Fifth Report of the\nSelect Committee of Parliament on the Affairs of the East India Company. Mr. Grant was the official appointed to take over the revenue and financial accounts of the three Provinces of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa when the Dewani was conferred on the Company, and had, therefore, exceptional opportunities of studying the details of the Moghul administration. His \"Analysis,\" masterly in all respects but style, was written in 1786. It examines in minute detail, and sets forth in ponderous sentences half a page long, all the systems of revenue administration from the days of Raja Todar Mal down to his own time. It has long been known as a mine of the most accurate and valuable information on this very intricate subject, but it is, of course, useful for our present purpose only as regards the S\u00fabahs of Bengal (including Orissa) and Behar.\n\n2. Sir H. M. Elliot's \"Races of the North-western Provinces,\" vol. ii, p. 82 (my edition), gives a map and elaborate reconstruction of the S\u00fabahs and parts of S\u00fabahs which in his day (some fifty years ago) were included within the limits of the North-western Provinces. Sir H. Elliot's official position, his personal knowledge of the people and places concerned, and the copious assistance he was able to command from experienced officials of all classes, both European and native, render his statements in the highest degree reliable. Colonel Jarrett hardly seems to accord to them the confidence they deserve, as he appears to have adopted the spellings only when supported by MSS., though they are, in fact, far more likely to be correct than those of MSS., copied again and again, with a fresh crop of errors on every occasion.\n\n3. The late Professor Blochmann's learned articles entitled \"Contributions to the Geography and History of Bengal (Muhammadan Period),\" in the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society. Article I is in vol. xlii, p. 209 (1873), and contains, among other things, a description of the extent and position of all the Sark\u00e1rs included in the S\u00fabah of Bengal. Article II is in vol. xliii (1874), p. 280, and Article III in vol. xliv (1875), p. 275.\n4. Two articles by myself in the same Journal entitled \"On the Geography of India in the reign of Akbar.\" Article I, containing a reconstruction of the S\u00fabah of Oudh (Avadh), is in vol. liii (1884), p. 215. Article II, containing the S\u00fabah of Behar, is in vol. liv (1885), p. 162. Each article is accompanied by a map.\n\n5. There have also appeared in the same Journal during the last twenty years articles, too numerous to specify seriatim, identifying individual places. These, being mostly written by officers stationed on the spot, are worthy of the highest credit. Specially valuable are those by Messrs. Westmacott and Beveridge and Dr. Wise, of Dacca.\n\nIt is to be regretted that it did not enter into Colonel Jarrett's plan to consult the above-mentioned authorities, with the exception of Elliot, and it may, therefore, now be useful to note the corrections and alterations which should be made in the names of places as they stand in his translation by the light of these researches. I propose also to make use of a considerable mass of materials referring to S\u00fabah Bengal collected by me in the course of my service in India, but not yet published; as well as two MSS. which I have obtained from the India Office Library, and which I shall quote as I.O. 6 and I.O. 1114. All the MSS. of the A\u00edn, however, repeat the same mistakes so slavishly that very little assistance can be obtained from them. It will be convenient to begin with the lists for Bengal (see vol. i, p. 394 of Blochmann's Persian text and vol. ii, p. 129 of the translation).\n\n---\n\n1 The following abbreviations are used:\u2014J.

For this there are several reasons.\n\nIn the first place, at the time of Todar Mal\u2019s settlement the ancient kingdom of Bengal was not yet fully conquered. His lists must have been compiled from materials supplied by the local revenue authorities, which, though for a short time Governor of the Province, he had not sufficient means of controlling or verifying. They are, therefore, not worthy of the same confidence as those of the S\u00fabahs actually under the Imperial Government. It will be seen further on that there is good reason to suspect serious mistakes in many instances: places mentioned twice over\u2014parganahs placed in the wrong Sark\u00e1rs\u2014mis-spellings of the most extraordinary nature\u2014omissions, incorrect insertions, and careless misplacements of the dots which mark the Persian letters\u2014whole tracts of country included in the S\u00fabah, with their revenue duly noted, which had never been conquered by the Kings of Bengal, and paid no tribute to them.\n\nSecondly, Todar Mal\u2019s settlement, such as it was, did not remain in force for many years. It is dated 1582, but was probably not completed till 1589. Fifty years later Sult\u00e1n Shuj\u00e1\u2019, son of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, revised it, adding several newly-conquered territories. His settlement was completed in 1658 on the accession of Aurangzeb, and lasted for about sixty years. Then came a radical change. Naw\u00e1b Ja\u2019far Kh\u00e1n in 1722 introduced a new division of the whole province into thirteen chaklas or circles, abolishing the old Sark\u00e1rs, and mixing up the various parganahs, dismembering and readjusting them, and increasing their number from 684 to 1,660. Thus a number of new names were introduced into the map, with a considerable reduction of the old ones.\n\nThis was the beginning of a series of changes, which lasted for another fifty years, till the country came under\nBritish rule. Successive Naw\u00e1bs tampered with the revenues, as well as with the boundaries of all the political divisions, in order to defraud the Imperial Government and fill their own pockets. They imposed numerous abw\u00e1bs, or illegal cesses and exactions, and they created the immense Zamind\u00e1ris or estates, which are so striking a feature in the Bengal of to-day. I am not, however, writing a history of the revenue administration of Bengal, and I therefore confine myself to this cursory notice, and refer those who wish to realize the extent of the confusion thus introduced into the geography of Bengal to Grant's \"Analysis,\" where he will find it worked out in almost bewildering detail.\n\nIt may be asked if Todar Mal's lists are open to the suspicion of inaccuracy at starting, and if his settlement remained in force so short a time, what is the use of laboriously striving to trace and locate in its proper place on the map each petty division of so transitory an arrangement? The answer is, that the materials which Todar Mal used must from the necessities of the case have been the ancient records of the Kingdom of Bengal. The Bengal officials who handed them to him would of course have been quite capable of altering the amounts of revenue due from each parganah if such a course had seemed advantageous to themselves, but they are not likely to have falsified to any great extent the names of those divisions. Very great carelessness and stupid blundering there have undoubtedly been in transcribing the lists, but there does not seem to have been deliberate falsification. The very uncouthness of many of the Hindu names\u2014old Pr\u00e1krit corruptions, most of them\u2014is an argument for their genuineness, even when not still extant, and the Persian or Arabic names can, in most cases, be traced to kings or governors known to history. We have, therefore, in these lists the last surviving fragments of the medi\u00e6val geography of the province before peculating revenue officers and extortionate Naw\u00e1bs tampered with it and manipulated it for their own base purposes. As we\nbecome more and more acquainted with the early history of India, which in the present day is being gradually and painfully pieced together from inscriptions, copper-plate grants, and other recondite sources, by earnest students, we shall more and more appreciate the advantage of possessing in Todar Mal\u2019s lists information of a genuinely ancient and reliable character.\n\nIn the face, however, of all the confusion that was rampant in the revenue administration of the province during what I may call the \u201cNaw\u00e1bi period,\u201d A.D. 1722\u20131793, it is a matter of the very greatest difficulty to place on the map in their proper position all the mahals or parganahs of the A\u00edn. The boundaries of all the nineteen Sark\u00e1rs can, indeed, be more or less accurately ascertained, and I have indicated on the map that accompanies these notes what I believe to be their real position. The Sark\u00e1rs on the western side of Bengal\u2014Purniah, Audambar, Shar\u00edf\u00e1b\u00e1d, Sulaim\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d, S\u00e1tg\u00e1on, and Mad\u00e1ran\u2014have suffered less than others; but when we come to Central Bengal the difficulty of identification becomes greater, and in three of the largest Sark\u00e1rs\u2014Mahm\u00fad\u00e1b\u00e1d, Ghor\u00e1gh\u00e1t, and Son\u00e1rg\u00e1on\u2014a great majority of the mahals have not been identified. Perhaps officers stationed in those parts of Bengal may by means of local enquiries be able to trace them. The maps give very little assistance. The following note, printed on many of the Revenue Survey District Maps, speaks for itself:\u2014\u201cIn consequence of the great intermixture of pergunnahs in this district the areas of the separate or local fiscal divisions could not be recorded, nor their exact limits shown on this scale (1 inch=4 miles). For such information the lithographed maps published on the scale of one British mile to the inch must be consulted.\u201d If one consults these latter, the detached villages of the parganahs are found to be jumbled together in such confusion that it would be impossible to show them on any map of reasonable dimensions. Besides which the mahals of the A\u00edn have in a great number of cases been taken up and amalgamated into\nthe large Zamind\u00e1ris created in the Naw\u00e1bi period; the old names have given place to new ones. Every successive Naw\u00e1b, and many of their officials, as well as the greater landholders, took a pleasure in \"calling the lands after his own name.\"\n\nBlochmann's articles mentioned above are a mine of information, and, in addition to the articles by other writers, there is a mass of casual notes buried in the Proceedings of the Bengal Asiatic Society to which I have occasionally referred. My own notes have also been incorporated, together with such readings of the MSS. as throw light on the subject.\n\nThe arrangement of the Sark\u00e1rs in the A\u00edn is neither alphabetical nor geographical. It will be more convenient to follow a geographical order, taking first the better preserved Western Sark\u00e1rs from north to south, then those of Central, and lastly those of Eastern Bengal, in the same order, thus:\n\n1. Purniah.  \n2. Au\u1e0dambar.  \n3. Shar\u00edf\u00e1b\u00e1d.  \n4. Sulaim\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d.  \n5. S\u00e1tg\u00e9on.  \n6. Mad\u00e1ran.  \n7. T\u00e1jpur.  \n8. Lakhnauti.  \n9. B\u00e1rbak\u00e1b\u00e1d.  \n10. Mahm\u00fad\u00e1b\u00e1d.  \n11. Khal\u00edfat\u00e1b\u00e1d.  \n12. Panjr\u00e1.  \n13. Ghor\u00e1gh\u00e1t.  \n14. B\u00e1z\u00fah\u00e1.  \n15.

Cha\u1e6dg\u00e1on.\n\n**Sark\u00e1r Purniah.**\n\nThis Sark\u00e1r comprised only the central portion of the present district of the same name (not \"the greater and chiefly westerly,\" as stated by Bl. xlii, 215). Parganah Dharmpur\u2014a long strip on the west and south\u2014belonged to S\u00fabah Bihar; another long strip on the south was divided between Sark\u00e1rs Au\u1e0dambar, Lakhnauti, and T\u00e1jpur; all the lands east of the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 river (often, but erroneously, called Mah\u00e1nadi) were in T\u00e1jpur; and the northern part of the district was as yet unconquered. It is therefore impossible to define precisely the northern limit. The\nlimits of Muhammadan power towards the submontane country of northern Bengal in the reign of Akbar, and for long afterwards, were very uncertain and variable. For a long time the fort of Jal\u00e1lgarh, only some ten miles north-east of the town of Purniah on the old bed of the Kosi river, was the frontier, and beyond were wild tribes\u2014Kichak, Mech, Kochh, and the like. See Bl. xli, 49 for an account of the expansion of Moghul power towards the north and east of Bengal.\n\nOf the nine mahals in this Sark\u00e1r, one is rather a tax than an item of land revenue. It represents duties levied on the capture of wild elephants, which were common in the sub-Himalayan forests of the Morang. J. omits to translate the word \u0647\u0631 in this entry, and Bl. seems not to understand it, for he gives several impossible variants. It is a mistake for \u0647\u0631 arn\u00e1, Hindi \u0905\u0930\u0923 'a wild buffalo.' The MS. I.O. 6 has correctly \u0647\u0631. The word is also used for wild elephants, rhinoceroses, and other large game. It is the Sanskrit \u0906\u0930\u0923\u094d\u092f\u0915 from \u0906\u0930\u0923\u094d\u092f 'forest.' These duties existed till quite lately, for in 1862-6 a large estate was held revenue-free in the parganah of Sult\u00e1npur by Mir Muhamad K\u00e1sim and his brother H\u00e1ji Muhamad Taki on the tenure of maintaining an establishment for the capture of wild elephants. There was a lawsuit about this tenure, but, as I left the district before it was decided, I cannot say how it ended. I believe, however, that the tenure has been resumed.\n\nThe remaining eight mahals are, with one exception, still in existence under their old names, and are shown in S.M. and Atlas of India. Jair\u00e1mpur no longer exists; it has, in all probability, been absorbed into Haveli.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 In a note on p. 168 J. comments on an explanation of this term given by me in a note on p. 83, vol. ii, of Elliot in these words: \"Mr. Beames in a note... distinguishes between Haveli and Baldah, the former alluding to the district close to the capital and the latter to that at a distance. It would have been more satisfactory if he had determined the limits of the distance.\" The \"limits\" of a parganah, if by this is meant its extent, are as hard to define as those of an English county. Rutland contains 148 square miles, Yorkshire over 6000. So the Haveli parganah of Purniah is some fifty miles\ndisappeared before 1722, and in the subsequent Naw\u00e1bi changes the name does not occur, nor could the revenue officials of the district trace it for me in 1885. Dolm\u00e1lpur lies about twenty miles north-east of Purniah town, and has been incorporated into Sr\u00edpur. Sr\u00edpur-Dolm\u00e1lpur was the name of the whole district during most of the Naw\u00e1bi period. Asonj\u00e1, or As\u00fanj\u00e1, is now pronounced Asjah \u0627\u0633\u062c\u0627\u0647, and Kadw\u00e1n is known as Kadbah \u06a9\u062f\u0628\u0647.\n\n**Sark\u00e1r Audambar, alias T\u00e1nd\u00e1.**\n\nStretches from the southern boundary of the preceding Sark\u00e1r, southwards across the Ganges, all along the right bank of that river down to the city of Murshidabad on the one hand, and through nearly the whole of the Birbh\u00fam district on the other. How far it may have penetrated into the hilly country on the west it is impossible to determine, but probably some, at least, of the parganahs, now no longer traceable, represent territory claimed and assessed (on paper) in these hills, though not actually conquered (Bl. xlii, 222; Bea. liv, 164\u20139).\n\nUdner, J., p. 129. This reading is apparently based on Tieffenthaler, who, however, probably wrote down the word from the dictation of an up-country munshi, who knew as little about Bengal as he did himself. Bl. also, by a printer's mistake, has \u0627\u0648\u062f\u0646\u06cc\u0631 at p. 394 of the Persian text, but in the list of errata at p. 3 he gives the correct spelling \u0627\u0648\u062f\u0646\u06cc\u0631. The mistake is easily caused by putting two dots long by twenty broad, while that of Khalfatabad is less than two square miles. The fact seems to be that the parganah in which the capital of each Sark\u00e1r lay, no matter how large it might be, was called the Haveli parganah (the 'home county' we might say; G. calls it the 'household county'), because its revenues were devoted to the maintenance of the household (haveli) and establishments of the governor. When the revenue of only a portion of the parganah was so applied, that portion was called haveli, and the other portion, whose revenues were paid into the public treasury, was called 'baldah,' or country. This, at any rate, appears to be the original meaning of the terms, though, of course, during the changes and confusion of the Naw\u00e1bi period the real meaning was often lost sight of.\nunder the last letter but one, instead of one, thus changing into . Bl. throughout his articles writes Audambar; so also does Gladwin; and G. writes everywhere \"Oudember\" or \"Audimber.\" I have always heard the word pronounced Audambar, or Adambar, by the native revenue officials and landed proprietors in the Birbhum district. It is said to be derived from Sanskrit \u0914\u0926\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0930 from \u0909\u0921\u0941\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0930, a species of fig-tree (Ficus glomerata), which may or may not be the case. MS. I.O. 6 and I.O. 1114 have \u0627\u0648\u062f\u0645\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0648\u0648\u062f\u0645\u0628\u0627\u0631 without dots respectively, which, though wrong, shows that the writers heard the sound audh or avadh in the first syllable, and erroneously connected it with the Subah of Audh, or Avadh (Oudh).\n\nAk mahal. Should be Ag mahal, the old name of Rajmahal, a famous ancient city, once the capital of Bengal, and still a flourishing place (Bl. xlii, 217). The parganah of Rajmahal was in the Nawabi period absorbed into the immense estate of Kankjol: vide infra. Under the name Akbarnagar it was the capital of one of Ja'far Khan's chaklas (G. 254). In all the MSS. \u0915 is everywhere written for \u0915. I.O. 6 sometimes writes \u0915 for \u0915.\n\nAchal\u00e1. } I have not been able to find these two.\nDarsanp\u00e1ra. } I.O. 6 has \u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0633\u067e\u0627\u0631\u0627.\n\nAshraf Nih\u00e1l. G. calls it Ashraf Chag, p. 374, and Chog, p. 384. The correct name is given by Beveridge (J.A.S.B. Proc., June 1892) as Ashraf Bh\u00e1g. It is not in S.M. or Atlas of India.\n\nIbrahimpur. Now Jow\u00e1s Ibrahimpur in Birbhum. The name occurs over again in Sark\u00e1r Sharifabad.\n\nAjial gh\u00e1ti. G. \"Uji\u00e1l kahly,\" 374, i.e. Ujiy\u00e1l kh\u00e1li. Not in the maps. The word ujiy\u00e1l, which occurs so often in names of parganahs, means, I believe, 'high land,' and should be written with initial u, not a.\nAng\u00e1chhi. G. 374, Amg\u00e1chhi, and so in all MSS. It is not in S.M. or other maps.\n\nBarhgangal. Should be Burh\u2014. It is now known as Budh\u00edgangal, and is a small parganah in the south of Purniah.\n\nBhat\u00e1l. Should be Buit\u00e1l or Baht\u00e1l in Birbhum.\n\nBah\u00e1durp\u00far. In S.M. a little south of Rajmahal.\n\nBahr\u00e1ri. G. 378, Baherai. Situation not known to me.\n\nI.O. 6 \u0628\u0627\u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc.\n\nPhulw\u00e1ri, Bah\u00e1dursh\u00e1hi, T\u00e1jpur, Ta'alluk Barbh\u00e1kar. These four are not traceable.\n\nT\u00e1nda b\u00e1 haveli. Has been washed away by the Ganges. The extant parganah of Ambar may possibly represent the word Audambar, but this is doubtful (Beveridge, J.A.S.B. Proc., Jan. 1893).\n\nTan\u00e1uli. This name has several variants in the Persian text. I suppose the correct reading to be \u062c\u06cc\u0641\u06cc Chitauli. The parganah of that name (Chetowleah in S.M. and A. of I.) is close to Rajmahal.\n\nJ\u00fan\u00e1gh\u00e1ti. Should be Ch\u00fan\u00e1kh\u00e1li, the parganah in which the city of Murshidabad is situated. Not in S.M. or A. of I.\n\nCh\u00e1ndp\u00far. A large parganah in the north of Murshidabad.\n\nNas\u00edbi. There are many variants, and a word beginning with n is not in its proper alphabetical order here. Bl. text reads \u062c\u06cc\u0641\u06cc J\u00edfat\u00ed, and other readings are \u0628\u0642\u06cc\u062a\u06cc Bak\u00edt\u00ed and \u067e\u0641\u0633\u06cc Pafasi. I think the name meant is \u062c\u0645\u0648\u0646\u06cc Jam\u00fani, a small parganah at the bend of the Ganges north of Rajmahal. \u062c\u06cc\u0641\u06cc written without dots is very like \u062c\u0645\u0648\u0646\u06cc, especially if, as often happens in Shikastah writing, the tail of the w\u0101w were accidentally carried on to the next letter. I.O. 6 has \u0647\u0633\u062a\u06cc and I.O. 1114 \u0646\u0635\u062a\u064a!!\n\nCh\u00fangnadiya. Still extant. Bev. loc. cit. I do not know its position.\n\nH\u00e1jipur. Absorbed in parganah Gankar. The village is near Suti in North Murshidabad.\nHusainabad, about eleven miles east of English Bazar.\nBl. xliii, 293.\n\nKh\u00e1npur, Sulaim\u00e1nsch\u00e9hi, Sulaim\u00e1nabad. Not found, and\nthe last two probably entered by mistake. They\nreally belong to Sark\u00e1rs Sharif\u00e1b\u00e1d and Sulai-\nm\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nDh\u00e1w\u00e1. Still extant in North Birbhum. In S.M. and\nA. of I.\n\nDeviy\u00e1p\u00far. Should be Diw\u00e1napur. Not in S.M. Beveridge,\nloc. cit.\n\nDaudsh\u00e9hi. Not in S.M., but mentioned in G. and\nBeveridge.\n\nDug\u00e1chhi. Absorbed into Gankar; the village is a little\nsouth of K\u00e1mkjol.\n\nR\u00e1mp\u00far. G. 380. Perhaps R\u00e1mpur H\u00e1\u1e6d, but the name\nis almost too common for identification.\n\nR\u00fabasp\u00far. This name is written with many variants.\nI.O. 6 and I.O. 1114 have both \u0631\u0648\u0628\u0627\u0633\u067e\u0648\u0631. It is\nprobably the Ras\u00falp\u00far of G. 375, but I do not know\nwhere it is situated.\n\nSar\u00fap Singh. In S.M. and A. of I. in North Birbhum.\n\nSult\u00e1npur Ujiy\u00e1l. In S.M. and A. of I. in North Birbhum.\n\nSal\u00edmpur. In G. 375, but not otherwise traceable.\n\nSambal\u00e1. This name is written with many variants, and\nI can trace no parganah corresponding to any of\nthem.\n\nShersh\u00e1hi. On the left bank of the Ganges, south of\nMaldah. S.M.\n\nShamskh\u00e1ni. In North-east Murshidabad. S.M.\n\nSherpur. There are hundreds of places so named. This\none is probably the village in the north of Gankar.\nThere does not seem to be any parganah of this\nname still extant.\n\nFirozpur. In G. 375; not otherwise traceable.\n\nKunwar Part\u00e1b. Still extant; a large parganah in North\nBirbhum. Beveridge suggests, with much proba-\nbility, that the name refers to Prat\u00e1p Singh, nephew\nof the celebrated Raja M\u00e1n Singh.\nKanakjok. Should be K\u00e1nkjol. The old town of this name lies near the East Indian Railway, about twenty miles south of Rajmahal. The parganah has been immensely extended in the Naw\u00e1bi period, swallowing up not only Rajmahal but many other parganahs. It now stretches from the south of Purniah, down both sides of the Ganges, into the Rajshahye district, with many scattered portions in other districts. In Ja\u2019far Kh\u00e1n\u2019s settlement it gave name to one of the largest estates in Bengal. G. 322, 441, et passim.\n\nK\u00e1thgarh, K\u00e9shipur, Kachl\u00e1, Kafurd\u00ed\u00e1. Not traceable. Not in S.M.\n\nGankarah. Now Gankar. A very large parganah in North Murshidabad, which has apparently absorbed many smaller ones.\n\nMudesar. Should be Molesar. In Central Birbhum. Bl. xlii, 223. The original name is Sansk. May\u00fareshvara. There is a temple of that name still in the village of Molesar or Moresar, on the banks of the river Mor (Sansk. May\u00fara).\n\nMangalpur. So in Bl. text, but I suspect the real name was Mandalpur, now pronounced Maralpur, and by the East Indian Railway officials metamorphosed into Mollarpur, in which guise it figures as the name of a railway station in Central Birbhum.\n\nNasibpur. This parganah has been absorbed by Ch\u00e1ndpur. The village lies about twenty miles north of Murshidabad.\n\nSark\u00e1r Shar\u00edf\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nThis Sark\u00e1r extends from a point close to the northern end of the Birbh\u00fam district to the southern boundary of that of Bardw\u00e1n, embracing portions of the districts of Murshidabad, Birbh\u00fam, and Bardw\u00e1n. With one or two exceptions all the mahals in this Sark\u00e1r are still extant or identifiable.\nBardw\u00e1n. The well-known parganah and town, headquarters of a Commissioner's Division, a district, and one of the largest Zamind\u00e1ri estates in Bengal.\n\nBharor. Should be Bahrol. It is partly in Murshidabad and partly in Birbh\u00fam.\n\nB\u00e1rbaksail. Should be B\u00e1rbaksingh. G. 408. Still extant, in south of Birbh\u00fam.\n\nBharkonda. Should be Bhark\u00fandah, in Birbh\u00fam (Bl. xlii, 223). Apparently very much shrunk from its former extent.\n\nAkbarsh\u00e1hi. Adjacent to the last named.\n\nB\u00e1gh\u00e1. On the Damodar river, south-west of Bardw\u00e1n town.\n\nBhatsela. G. writes Bhut Salah, 379, 380, 384. The name is Bhats\u00e9l\u00e1 (Bea. MS.\u00b9). It has been subjected to mudd\u00e1khil wa mukh\u00e1r\u00edj, and is now scattered in several places, principally in Murshidabad district.\n\nJanki. No place of this name is known; it is probable that J\u00e1nkib\u00e1t\u00ed, about fifteen miles south-east of Bardwan, is meant. It is now included in the parganah of Chu\u1e6dipur, in Sark\u00e1r Sulaimanabad (Bea. MS.).\n\nKhot Makand. Should be Jot Mukund. This is also a scattered parganah, chiefly south of the Damodar river (Bea. MS.).\n\nDhaniy\u00e1n. Now Dh\u00e1iy\u00e1n, or Dh\u00e1iny\u00e1n. In Hindi characters \u0927\u093e\u0908\u092f\u0928\u094d or \u0927\u093e\u0908\u092f\u093e. North-east of Bardwan.\n\nSulaimansh\u00e1hi. Now called Sal\u00edms\u00e1hi. In Bardw\u00e1n and Birbh\u00fam.\n\nSoniy\u00e1. Should be Sotiy\u00e1. No parganah of that name now exists, having apparently been dismembered during the Naw\u00e1bi changes, but the village is still in existence near Khandghosh (Bea. MS.).\n\nSuburban district of Sherpur At\u00e1i. The Haveli parganah of Sherpur is about twenty miles west of Murshidabad town, but in the Birbh\u00fam district (Bl. xlii, 218).\n\n\u00b9 The information thus marked consists of the report of an enquiry made at my request by the Sarishtadar and Record Keeper of the Bardwan Collectorate in 1865.\n\nJ.M.A.S. 1896.\nUzmatpur. Should be 'Azmatskh\u00e1hi. A very large parganah occupying the centre of the Bardw\u00e1n district.\n\nFath Singh. A large parganah in the south of Birbh\u00fam.\n\nHusayn Ajiy\u00e1l. Should be Ujiy\u00e1l, in Birbh\u00fam. Shown in S.M. and A. of I. under the local corruption Zainujal or Zynoojal.\n\nKargaon. Should be Kharg\u00e1on. It is in East Birbh\u00fam, immediately south of Haveli Sherpur.\n\nKiratp\u00far. Should be Karatp\u00far. The village is near Ganguria, south-east of Bardwan. The parganah has been absorbed (Bea. MS.).\n\nKhand. Now called Khand Ghosh. It lies south of the Damodar river, opposite Bardwan. S.M.\n\nKhanga. I.O. 6 reads Khatang\u00e1, which is correct. G. 408. There are two places of this name. One is now included in Manoharsh\u00e1hi. The village is near Keog\u00e1on, or, as the present Sanskritizing generation of Bengalis persist in calling it, Ketugr\u00e1ma, in the north-east corner of Bardwan (Bea. MS.). The other is on the western frontier of Birbhum.\n\nKodl\u00e1. Now included in parganah Jahangirabad, East Bardwan (Bea. MS.).\n\nMahland. A large parganah on the west side of the Bh\u00e1girathi, opposite the towns of Murshidabad and Berhampur. S.M.\n\nManoharsh\u00e1hi. A large parganah on the northern bank of the Ajay river, partly in Bardwan, partly in Birbhum. S.M.\n\nMuzaffarsh\u00e1hi. This large parganah has been much dismembered. The 150 mauzahs which it contains are scattered all over the central and eastern parts of the Bardwan district (Bea. MS.).\n\nNasak. Should be Nisank or Nishank. It is scattered over the south of the Bardwan district (Bea. MS.).\n\nNatr\u00e1n, or Nabr\u00e1n, or Hatr\u00e1n. Not traceable. Both the I.O. MSS. have \u0646\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0646.\nSARK\u00c1R SULAIM\u00c1N\u00c1B\u00c1D.\n\nThis is a somewhat scattered and ill-arranged Sark\u00e1r. The bulk of it lies in the southern part of the Bardwan and the northern part of the Hughli districts. But a large portion lies to the east of the Hughli river in the Nadia district, and it is much mixed up with the Sark\u00e1rs of S\u00e1tg\u00e1on (which it cuts in two) and Mad\u00e1ran. Nearly all of the mahals which it contains are still traceable, and the others can be located conjecturally. The name, as far as it has been preserved, has been generally shortened to Sal\u00edm\u00e1b\u00e1d, either, as Bl. suggests, because it was too long, or in honour of Prince Sal\u00edm, afterwards the Emperor Jahang\u00edr.\n\nIndar\u00e1in. Should be Indr\u00e1\u00edn. It is in the north-east corner of Bardwan.\n\nIsm\u00e1\u2019ilpur. Now included in the modern parganah of Jahangirabad (Bea. MS.).\n\nAnliya. Should be Ambi\u00fd\u00e1; \u0627\u0646\u0628\u06cc\u0627, as in I.O. 1114, not \u0627\u0646\u0644\u064a\u0627. It is now Sanskritized into Ambik\u00e1, and is situated near Kalna in South-east Bardwan. It is also locally pronounced Ambow\u00e1.\n\nBasandhari. Should be Basundhari. It is now included in parganah Bali\u00e1 in Central Hughli. G. 478, where it is called \u201cBellia Bassenderi.\u201d\n\nU\u2019l\u00e1. The village of this name is now known as Birnagar. The parganah is now called M\u00e1mjo\u00e1ni. It is in the Nadia district. S.M. and A. of I.\n\nBhosat. Should be Bhursut, a large parganah in Central Hughli. S.M. and A. of I.\n\nPandwah. Should be Panduah, in Hughli, a well-known town, with ancient tower and other ruins, also a large railway station. S.M. and A. of I.\n\nPachnor. Now written P\u00e1chn\u00far, a parganah in West Nadiya.\n\nB\u00e1l\u00edbhanga. Should be B\u00e1lidhang\u00e1. There are at least five places of this name in the Nadiya district alone, and\nI know not how many in other parts of Bengal. Which of all of them is meant here, is not certain. Both the I.O. MSS. have\n\nChhotipur. A parganah in South Bardwan.\n\nCh\u00famh\u00e1. Should be Chaum\u00fah\u00e1, west of Panduah in Hughli.\n\nJaip\u00far. A small parganah in Central Nadiya.\n\nHusaynpur. Probably a portion of the parganah now known as Husaynpur-Kalar\u00fa\u00e1, the remainder of which belonged to Sark\u00e1r S\u00e1tg\u00e1on. It is in the Nadia district.\n\nDh\u00e1rs\u00e1. In Hughli. The well-known town of Serampoor is in it.\n\nR\u00e1cs\u00e1t. Probably R\u00e1\u00edn\u00e1, now in Haveli Sulaim\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nSuburban district of Sulaim\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d. Now called Haveli Salim\u00e1b\u00e1d, the name having been shortened as stated above. The town of Salim\u00e1b\u00e1d is on the left bank of the D\u00e1modar, about twenty miles below Bardwan; at the point where the K\u00e1n\u00e1 nad\u00ed takes off.\n\nS\u00e1ts\u00edka. Now spelt Satsoika. A parganah in East Bardwan.\n\nSabspur. There are several places named S\u00e1haspur; I do not know which is here meant. There is no parganah of that name, as far as I know.\n\nSanghauli. Should be Singholi, now spelt Sing\u00far. It is a small parganah in Central Hughli.\n\nSultanpur. In Central Nadiya.\n\nAmarpur. In Central Nadiya.\n\nAlampur. In Central Nadiya.\n\nKab\u00e1zp\u00far. Should be Kub\u00e1zpur. In Eastern Bardwan. The seventy villages comprised in this parganah are scattered all along the right bank of the Hughli river above and below the town of P\u00farbosthal\u00ed (Bea. MS.).\n\nGobinda (Kosada). The name is Kosda. It is a parganah in Central Nadiya.\n\nMuhammadpur. Now absorbed into parganah \u00c1rs\u00e1 of Sark\u00e1r S\u00e1tg\u00e1on. Under the name of Muhammad Aminpur it was a large zamind\u00e1ri in the Naw\u00e1bi period (G. 457).\nMolghar. Should be M\u00falghar, a parganah in Central Nadiya.\n\nNag\u00edn. No place of this name is known to my local informants, but they are probably right in suggesting that the place meant is the large village of Nigun, or Nigun Sar\u00e1i, twenty-two miles north-west of Bardwan town. There is no parganah of the name; it has, apparently, been absorbed into parganah Dhaiy\u00e1n of Sark\u00e1r Shar\u00edfabad. (Bea. MS.)\n\nN\u00e1ir\u00e1. No place of this name is known. In spite of its being against the alphabetical order, I am convinced that the place meant is B\u00e1ir\u00e1, a parganah in North Hughli adjacent to the Haveli parganah of this Sark\u00e1r. B\u00e1ir\u00e1, though a very ancient place, is not mentioned in the \u00c1\u00edn, unless this is it, and the parganah remains otherwise unaccounted for. Instances of places put out of their proper order are not infrequent in these lists. We shall come to several others further on.\n\nNasang. Should be Nisank. It has been already mentioned under Shar\u00edf\u00e1b\u00e1d: see above. Perhaps part of the parganah was in one Sark\u00e1r and part in the other. Instances of this kind are not uncommon. But as there are only seven mauzas in the parganah this is improbable, and I incline to think that this is another instance of repetition, a common fault in these lists.\n\nNabi\u00e1. Probably Nalahi is meant, a small parganah some fifteen miles east of Bardwan. The Mymaree railway station is in it. If the name was originally Nalah\u00e1, \u0646\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0647, it might easily be corrupted into \u0646\u0628\u06cc\u0627 or \u0646\u0628\u06cc\u0627. I.O. 6 has the former reading, while I.O. 1114 has \u0646\u0628\u06cc\u0627 or \u0646\u0628\u06cc\u0627, Nab\u00e1 or Ban\u00e1\u2014the dots are so placed that it may be read either way. The dots are very loosely placed throughout this MS., and frequently omitted altogether.\nSARK\u00c1R S\u00c1TG\u00c1ON.\n\nThe parganahs in this Sark\u00e1r have retained their ancient names and positions, with very few exceptions, unchanged to the present day. The Sark\u00e1r, which is cut up into two portions by mahals belonging to Sark\u00e1r Sulaim\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d, lay principally on the east of the Hughli river in the modern districts of the Twenty-four Parganahs and Nadia. The town of S\u00e1tg\u00e1on itself, however, was on the west side of the river, and there are several parganahs on that side also. The once celebrated town and port of S\u00e1tg\u00e1on has now almost disappeared. Only a few insignificant ruins mark its position. For a description of it see Bl. xxxix, 280. As so many of the old parganahs are still extant and shown on the S.M. and Atlas of India, it will be sufficient to refer the reader to those maps.\n\nThe following will be found in the district of the Twenty-four Parganahs on the east or left bank of the Hughli, above, below, and eastward of the city of Calcutta. I give J.'s spelling, with the correct form where necessary in brackets.\n\nAnwarp\u00far, Bodhan (B\u00fadhan), B\u00e1lin\u1e0d\u00e1 (B\u00e1landa), Baliya, Phalk\u00e1 (Bh\u00e1luk\u00e1), Baridhati, Suburban district (Haveli Shahr, nowadays generally corrupted into Hali-shahr: Bl. xlii, 216, note \u2020), Dhaliy\u00e1pur (Dh\u00fali\u00e1pur), Calcutta, Kh\u00e1rar (Kh\u00e1ri), Magor\u00e1 (Magur\u00e1), Mednimal, Mundg\u00e1chh\u00e1 (Mund\u00e1g\u00e1chhi or Mur\u00e1gachh\u00ed), Mahihatti (on the maps Myehatty), Helki (Hilki).\n\nThe following are in the district of Nadiya, adjacent to the Twenty-four Parganahs on the north:\n\nUkr\u00e1, Bagw\u00e1n, Bang\u00e1b\u00e1r\u00ed (Patk\u00e1b\u00e1r\u00ed), Husaynpur, Kal\u00e1r\u00fa\u00e1, Matiy\u00e1r\u00ed, Nadiy\u00e1, S\u00e1tanp\u00far (S\u00e1ntipur). The two last are large, well-known towns; the parganahs have now been absorbed into Ukra, of which they constitute tarq\u00e1s or subdivisions.\nThe following are in the district of Hughli, on the right or western bank of the river, opposite to the Twenty-four Parganahs:\n\n\u0100rs\u00e1, Panw\u00e1n (in the maps Pownan) Sal\u00edmpur, Purah (Boroh), Balia (a part of this parganah is in Hughli and two other parts in the Twenty-four Parganahs), Muzaffarpur, H\u00e1thikandh\u00e1.\n\nFor the remaining parganahs some explanations are necessary:\n\n\u0100rs\u00e1 and Taw\u00e1l\u00ed S\u00e1tg\u00e1on. \u0100rs\u00e1 is the parganah in which are situated the towns of Hughli and Chinsurah. The town of S\u00e1tg\u00e1on was at Tribeni Gh\u00e1t, about six miles north of Hughli. \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0644\u06cc means 'extremities,' 'remainders.' It will be observed that the greater part of the Haveli parganah of this Sark\u00e1r is on the opposite side of the river. Apparently those small portions of it which lay on the western side are here indicated by the term taw\u00e1l\u00ed, in the sense of 'remaining portion' or 'the rest of\u2014'.\n\nBanw\u00e1, Kotw\u00e1l\u00ed, and Far\u00e1satghar. These three items do not appear to be territorial divisions, but represent taxes levied on various quarters of the town of S\u00e1tg\u00e1on. The term \"Kotw\u00e1l\u00ed\" or Police Station either meant fines levied in criminal cases, or more probably rents of the quarter of the town where the Kotw\u00e1l\u00ed was situated. Far\u00e1satghar I should be disposed to read Far\u00e1s\u00edghar, and interpret it as the town now called Chandernagore, occupied by European traders. Far\u00e1s\u00ed (i.e. Fran\u00e7ais) was the old name in Bengali for the French, while Firingi denoted the Portuguese. Banw\u00e1 is probably a mistake for Bandar, the port of S\u00e1tg\u00e1on. \u0628\u0646\u062f\u0631 would easily be miscopied \u0628\u0646\u0648\u0627 in Persian current hand.\n\nAkbarpur has been absorbed into the large parganah of Sh\u00e1h Ujiy\u00e1l in Nadia.\nBarmhattar should be Brahmuttar, more correctly Brah-\nmottara, rent-free lands assigned to Brahmins,\nscattered in small patches over the country.\n\nM\u00e1nikhatti is probably P\u00e1igh\u00e1ti in the Twenty-four Par-\nganahs, \u067e\u0627\u06cc\u06af\u0647\u200c\u062a\u06cc for \u0645\u0627\u0646\u06a9\u200c\u0647\u062a\u06cc. In both I.O. MSS.\nthe reading is \u0645\u0627\u0646\u06a9 without dots.\n\nBelg\u00e1on. Now dismembered and scattered in Bagw\u00e1n and\nPlass\u00ed parganahs in Nadia.\n\nTortariya. No place of this name can be found; my local\ninformants suggest with some probability that the\nplace meant is T\u00e1r\u00e1g\u00fan\u00eda, now dismembered, in the\nnorthern portion of parganahs R\u00e1jpur and Sh\u00e1h\nUjjiy\u00e1l of Nadia district (Bea. MS.).\n\nH\u00e1jipur and B\u00e1rbakp\u00far or B\u00e1r\u00edkp\u00far. Not found; both\nnames are extremely common.\n\nR\u00e1n\u00edh\u00e1t is a large parganah in the south of the Bardwan\ndistrict.\n\nSadgh\u00e1t\u00ed has been absorbed into parganah Mahatpur of\nNadia (Bea. MS.).\n\nSakota. Should be Sig\u00fan\u00e1. G. 432. I.O. 6 has distinctly\n\u0633\u06af\u0648\u0646\u0627 and I.O. 1114 \u0633\u06af\u0648\u0646\u0627. Its position is not\nindicated.\n\nSrir\u00e1jpur. Should be Sarafr\u00e1zp\u00far in Twenty-four Parganahs.\n\nSair dues from Bandarb\u00e1n and Mandavi. For Bandarb\u00e1n\nI would read bandari\u00e1n\u2014rents levied from the\nbandaris or persons frequenting the port (bandar);\nand mandavi, I think, indicates the temporary booths\nerected during the dry season on the sandy bed\nof the river for trading purposes, and removed\nwhen the river rises in the rains. It is from \u0645\u0627\u0631\u06a9\n'a market.'\n\nS\u00e1kh\u00e1t. Probably to be read s\u00e1g h\u00e1\u1e6d 'vegetable market,'\nor as it would be in Bengali, s\u00e1ka h\u00e1\u1e6d. I.O. 6 has\n\u0633\u0627\u0644\u06a9\u0627\u062a, the \u0644 probably repeated by mistake from\nthe next word.\n\nK\u00e1ts\u00e1l. Properly K\u00e1ths\u00e1l, or warehouse for storing timber.\nIn my notes I find it stated that it was on the\nJabuna river, in parganah M\u00e1hihatti in Twenty-four Parganahs. It was, therefore, probably a station for taking toll on timber brought from the Sundarban forests.\n\nFathpur. Not traceable.\n\nKandali\u00e1. Properly Kundali\u00e1. Part of this mahal is in Sark\u00e1r Mahm\u00fad\u00e1b\u00e1d. It is in Nadiya district.\n\nHaiy\u00e1g\u00e1rh. Should be Hathi\u00e1g\u00e1rh, as pointed out by Bl. in a note to the Persian text. It lies in two parts, south of Calcutta, on the edge of the Sundarbans.\n\nSark\u00e1r Mad\u00e1ran.\n\nA very long straggling strip of territory running from Birbhum in the north to the junction of the Hughli and R\u00fapnar\u00e1y\u00e1n rivers in the south. As G. quaintly but truly expresses it, \"forming a broken frontier on the west of the two last-mentioned circars (Shar\u00edfabad and Sal\u00edmabad), and enclosing them in a semicircle from Beerbboom to Mundleghat . . . . . . serving them as a barrier against the incursions of the neighbouring unsubdued Rajahs, sheltered in the jungles of Pachet and Bishenpoor or the low marshy lands of Hidgellee\" (p. 242).\n\nAll but three of the mahals are still identifiable, and shown on the ordinary maps.\n\nAnhatti. May perhaps be Hatia in the Bankura district south of the Damodar, but this is not certain, though rendered probable by the fact that it is written \u0627\u0646 \u0647\u062a\u0649 as two words in both I.O. MSS. These words mean 'corn market.'\n\nB\u00e1lgarhi. Now pronounced B\u00e1ligarhi\u00e1; in Central Hughli.\n\nBirbh\u00fam. A parganah in the district of the same name, once much more extensive than now.\n\nBhaw\u00e1lbhum. My informants agree with me in holding that this is a mistake for Gw\u00e1lbhum. The parganah of that name, now Sanskritized into Gopbhum= 'cowherd land,' is in Western Bardwan (Bea. MS.).\nNo trace can be found of there having ever been a parganah named Bhaw\u00e1lbh\u00fam in this neighbourhood. G. 478 also calls it 'Gowalbh\u00fam.' G has been mistaken for B by omission of the markaz, a common error in all MSS.\n\nChatwa. Should be Chitu\u00e1, in Midnapur, near Ghatt\u00e1l.\n\nChamp\u00e1nagari. In Bardwan, a short distance west from Bardwan town.\n\nSuburban district of Mad\u00e1ran. Haveli Mad\u00e1ran, or, as the country people round about call it, Mand\u00e1ran, lies near Gogh\u00e1t, five miles west of the Darkesar river. It was a large fortified place, and the ruins of the fortifications still exist. The place is now known as Bh\u00edtargarh Mand\u00e1ran, or \"Inner Fort,\" and the local pandits derive the name from Sanskrit \u092e\u0926\u0941 'bad' and \u092c\u0930\u0938 'forest.' That the whole of that country-side was anciently and down to comparatively modern times a very evil forest\u2014the wide-stretching legendary forest country of the Jh\u00e1rkhand, where the Kali Yuga first began, and where mlechhas and wild beasts abounded\u2014is undoubted. So the pandits may be right. See Bl. xlii, 223, and his identification of Mad\u00e1ran with Bhitargarh in Proc. A.S.B., April 1870. The parganah is no longer called Haveli, but Jah\u00e1nabad. Bl. gives some of the legends of this strange, haunted, interesting neighbourhood, but a complete collection of them would fill a book.\n\nSainbhum. Now Senbhum. It lies on both sides of the Ajai river, partly in Bardwan and partly in Birbhum. The southern portion is now called Senpah\u00e1ri.\n\nSamar S\u00e1nhas. Should be Samarsh\u00e1hi. It is in the south of Bardwan, across the Damodar, opposite Bardwan town.\n\nShergarh, commonly called Sakharbhum. Should be Sikharbh\u00fam, i.e. \u0938\u093f\u0916\u0930\u092d\u0942\u092e\u093f\u2014'peak-land,' a name the appropriateness of which must strike anyone who\nhas seen the numerous peaked hill-tops of Pachet from Raniganj or Asansol. It is an immense parganah, occupying the whole western angle of Bardwan between the Damodar and Ajai rivers\u2014a land of coal-mines.\n\nSh\u00e1hp\u00far. A detached parganah lying in the middle of the Midnapur district.\n\nKet. Should be Kait, or, as it is now pronounced, Kait\u00ed. It is now absorbed in Samarsh\u00e1hi.\n\nMandalgh\u00e1t. A very large parganah forming the extreme south angle of the Hughli district, and occupying all the tongue of land between the Hughli and R\u00fapnar\u00e1yan rivers, together with some lands on the western or Midnapur side of the latter river.\n\nNagor. The extensive ruins of the fortifications at this place on the western frontier of Birbhum show that it was once a place of great importance. It is the Lakhnor, i.e. Nagar Lakhnor, of the Muhammadan historians. Bl. xlii, 211, 212.\n\nMinab\u00e1k. Probably Mainap\u00far in East Bankura.\n\nHisuli. The variant Misduli suggests that this may be Maisadal in Midnapur, which lies only a little way from the western boundary of Mandalgh\u00e1t.\n\nSark\u00e1r T\u00e1jpur.\n\nThis is a large but compact territory, stretching eastwards from the Mahananda river nearly to the Purnobh\u00e1ba. It includes all eastern Purniah and the western half of Din\u00e1jpur. The boundary to the north ran up into the sub-Himalayan forests, and is not susceptible of accurate definition. Probably several of the northern mahals, such as Surj\u00e1pur, Debhatta, and S\u00e1lb\u00e1ri, were only partly under Muhammadan sway at the date of the \u00c1\u00edn. Of the twenty-nine mahals one is the Zak\u00e1t or Poor-tax, leaving twenty-eight territorial areas.\n\nBankat. There is no trace of any mahal of this name, and as the revenue of this one mahal is more than half\nthat of the whole Sark\u00e1r, so large an area can hardly have disappeared without leaving any trace. The name, however, apparently gives a clue. Banka\u1e6d means 'forest clearing,' and evidently points to the great forests of the Tar\u00e1i which covered so much of the northern part of this Sark\u00e1r. In the present day this area is comprised in a very large parganah called S\u00e1lb\u00e1ri, or 'S\u00e1l-wood tract,' and G. 405 states that S\u00e1lb\u00e1ri was in T\u00e1jpur. As no such name occurs in the \u00c1\u00edn, nor in G., it is reasonable to suppose that Banka\u1e6d and S\u00e1lb\u00e1ri are identical.\n\nBadokhar. Should be Badoghar.\u00b9 This must, I think, be meant for the extensive parganah now known as Bador or Badaur. The present name is probably shortened from Badohar, a transitional form of Badoghar. It lies along the eastern side of the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 in Purniah. In its wide circuit are contained numerous detached portions of other parganahs.\n\nBandol. G. 410. It is absorbed in Haveli T\u00e1jpur.\n\nBobar\u00e1. Probably Bh\u00fapar\u00e1 in the north-west corner of Bador.\n\nBho\u1e47har\u00e1. Absorbed partly in Hatinda, partly in Dhanjar (Sark\u00e1r Lakhnauti), and partly in Bador. Scraps of Hatinda also lie within Bador, and bits of Bador in Hatinda, while lands of both are found in Kadba and Asjah (Sark\u00e1r Purniah)! It is spelt Bhooih\u00e1r\u00e1 in the parganah map of Dhanjar.\n\nBadg\u00e1on. There are hundreds of villages of this name in Bengal. There is not, as far as I know, any parganah of that name now extant. It is not in G.'s lists.\n\nB\u00e1sig\u00e1on. Absorbed in Hatinda (Bea. MS.).\n\nPang\u00e1on. Should be Bang\u00e1on. A dismembered parganah scattered over various parts of the Sark\u00e1r.\n\nBah\u00e1durp\u00far. In Hatinda.\n\n\u00b9 Report of enquiries made at my request by the Record Keeper of the Purniah Collectorate. I was also myself Collector of Purniah for four years, and have, therefore, personal knowledge of this neighbourhood.\nBah\u00e1nagar. Should be Bh\u00e1ngar, now in Akbarp\u00far parganah in Maldah (Bea. MS.).\n\nBad\u00e1lk\u00e1. Probably Bad\u00e1l in parganah B\u00e1ish\u00e1zari in Maldah.\n\nT\u00e1ldw\u00e1r. In spite of its place in the alphabetical order, there is little doubt that M\u00e1ldw\u00e1r is meant. This is a large and well-known parganah on the west border of Dinajpur. No place named Taldwar is traceable.\n\nChh\u00e9part\u00e1l. Now known as Jh\u00e1partoil and so spelt in S.M. and A. of I. It is in Central Dinajp\u00far. I.O. 6 has \u062c\u0647\u067e\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0627\u0644.\n\nSuburban district and town of T\u00e1jp\u00far. There is not, as far as I know, any town of this name now, though it is shown on the old maps. It is not in S.M. or A. of I. The parganah is still extant on the west border of Dinajp\u00far, adjacent to M\u00e1ldw\u00e1r on the south.\n\nDil\u00e1wp\u00far. In the south-west corner of Dinajp\u00far.\n\nDabhat. Should be Deha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u00e1 or Debhatt\u00e1, a parganah in the north-west of Din\u00e1jp\u00far. Bl. gives the variant Dehat in a note on the Persian text.\n\nSesahr\u00e1. Probably Susihra, now included in Haveli Tajpur.\n\nS\u00faj\u00e1pur. Should be Surj\u00e1p\u00far, the large parganah about sixty miles long which occupies the north-east corner of the modern district of Purniah. Probably the greater part of it was unconquered in the reign of Akbar.\n\nSh\u00e1hp\u00far. A small parganah about ten miles north of the town of Purniah, separated from the rest of the Sark\u00e1r.\n\nKuw\u00e1rpur. Now called Kum\u00e1ripur (which is the same thing), in the south of Purniah, forming a small projecting strip between Sark\u00e1rs Purniah and Au\u1e0dambar.\n\nKas\u00e1rgaon, Gop\u00e1lnagar, N\u00edlnagar, N\u00edl\u00fan, Y\u00fasuf. I have not been able to identify these. I.O. 6 has for N\u00edl\u00fan \u0646\u06cc\u0644\u0648\u0646 with vowel points, reading Niblaun or Niblon. Both MSS. have Y\u00fasufp\u00far.\n\nGoghra. Absorbed in Hatinda.\n\nMahon. Should be Mahas\u00fan. It is mixed up with Haveli T\u00e1jpur.\nSark\u00e1r Lakhnauti.\n\nAlso known as Jannatabad, but this title, said to have been conferred by the Emperor Hum\u00e1yun, is only used in official documents, and does not seem to have come into common use among the people.\n\nThis Sark\u00e1r is divided into six subdivisions entitled Jaw\u00e1rs. The word jaw\u00e1r means originally \u2018neighbourhood,\u2019 and J. has therefore translated it \u2018neighbouring villages of.\u2019 But this translation is misleading, for the mahals in each Jaw\u00e1r are, as a matter of fact, by no means \u2018neighbouring,\u2019 being often widely scattered, and the term used obscures the fact that we have here official divisions of territory, each with its Haveli. It is somewhat surprising that so many mahals should be included in so small an area; but, in the first place, many of the entries refer not to territorial areas, but to taxes on markets, customs, transport duties, and the like; and in the second place an unusually large number of mahals belonging to this Sark\u00e1r are scattered amongst the lands of adjacent Sark\u00e1rs. Identification is peculiarly difficult owing to the creation of the large estate of Ruknp\u00far, which has absorbed many of the smaller estates, and to the devastations caused by the Ganges, which has washed away large tracts of land. The old names have in many cases perished with the places to which they belonged, and new towns and villages with new names have arisen in their stead. One searches the S.M. and A. of I., and even the parganah maps on the large scale of 1 inch=1 mile, in vain for these ancient names. It is only from old inhabitants who have preserved the traditions of the sites of these lost towns and estates that one can sometimes obtain a trace or a clue.\n\n\u201cJannatabad, commonly known as Gaur. It has been a brick fort.\u201d\u2014J. D\u00e1rad means \u2018it has,\u2019 not \u2018it has been.\u2019 The fort is still there, though in ruins. I translate Jaw\u00e1r by \u2018circle.\u2019\nCIRCLE OF AGRA.\n\nAjor. Now usually written Ajhor. An extant parganah in North-east Maldah. The name is correctly given in S.M., but incorrectly as A\u00edhour in A. of I.\n\nB\u00e1zkhokhra. Not traceable. I.O. 1114 has \u0628\u0644\u0646\u0628\u0631 Balambar, also unknown.\n\nBaler. Probably Bikar in North-east Maldah: \u0628\u06cc\u06a9\u0631 for \u0628\u0644\u0646\u0628\u0631. A common type of error in Persian MSS. caused by omitting the sloping stroke or markaz of the k\u00e1f.\n\nHaveli Akra. Probably Agra on the P\u00farnabh\u00e1ba river, now absorbed in the Shik\u00e1rp\u00far parganah of B\u00e1rbak\u00e1bad.\n\nDhanp\u00far. Probably Dhanjar, a large parganah in South Din\u00e1jp\u00far, which is much intermixed with other mahals of this Sark\u00e1r.\n\nDeviya. Probably Deoriya, in parganah Kasimpur, in South Dinajp\u00far.\n\nSerhwar. The text should probably be read Sirh\u00far. Parganah Sirhur, spelt in S.M. and A. of I. Surhur, is in South Dinajpur, adjacent to Dhanjar.\n\nMadn\u00e1w\u00e1t\u00ed. A scattered parganah in South Dinajpur; most of it is in Dhanjar. Spelt in S.M. Mudnabattee.\n\nN\u00e1hat. Now Naet. In parganah Dhanjar.\n\nThe other mahals of this circle I have been unable to trace.\n\nCIRCLE OF DARSHIRAK.\n\nSeven out of the sixteen mahals are cesses and imposts on markets; e.g.\u2014\n\n\u00c1ch\u00e1r\u00edkh\u00e1nah is pickle-market.\n\nK\u00e1th\u00e1chh\u00e1p\u00e1 means 'wood-stamp.' Probably a place by the river-side where timber floated down the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 from the forests of Nepal was taxed and stamped.\n\nModi Mahal. The market of grain and sweetmeat sellers.\n\nMewa Mahal. Market for dried fruit, such as is annually brought from Kabul: nuts, walnuts, pistachio nuts, dried apricots, etc.\nOf the territorial areas I can identify only\n\nR\u00e1ekamati, which should be R\u00e1ngam\u00e1ti, now in parganah Shik\u00e1rpur.\n\nGangapat and neighbourhood of Hindui. I.O. 6 reads Gang\u00e1b\u00e1t; G. 374, 380, etc., has Gang\u00e1nat. The place is not traceable. For Hindui both the I.O. MSS. have \u0645\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0649 mand\u00e1v\u00ed or 'market,' which is more intelligible.\n\nG. spells Dar Sarak\u2014Dershirak\u2014a spelling which I have adopted; the area of this circle was probably nearly all within or close to the city of Gaur, and must have suffered great changes from the action of the river.\n\nCIRCLE OF DEBIKOT.\n\nDebikot is in both the I.O. MSS. the distinct reading of the word which J. reads as Dihikot, and seems to be the correct name. No place bearing the latter name can be traced, while on the other hand we have in the north of this Sark\u00e1r the celebrated ancient city and frontier fortress of Debikot or Debkot, now known as Damdamah, on the Purnabh\u00e1ba river, in the south-west of Din\u00e1jpur. The identity of the ruins and remains known as Damdamah with Debikot has been fully established by Dr. Buchanan and Mr. Westmacott. The only identifiable names in this circle lie in the same neighbourhood.\n\nPakor. The correct reading is evidently that of both the I.O. MSS., viz. N\u00e1kor, which is in parganah R\u00e1jnagar, on the boundary between Dinajpur and Maldah, sixteen miles south-west of Damdama. In the S.M. and A. of I. it is spelt Nokore.\n\nDahlgaon. Should be Dakhingaon. Four miles north-west of Damdama. S.M. and A. of I.\n\nMaligaon. Now absorbed in Dhanjar.\n\nModipur. Probably Mahdipur. Two miles south of the last-named place.\nCIRCLE OF RAMAUTI.\n\nThe only place I have been able to identify in this circle is\n\nM\u00e1hinagar. A small parganah in the north of the Maldah district.\n\nSangdwar may perhaps be the ancient city of Panduah, which is sometimes mentioned as Bardw\u00e1r.\n\nCIRCLE OF SARSABAD.\n\nThe name of this circle suggests a curious bit of diplomacy. The full name is Shersh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, so called from the famous Afghan Sher Kh\u00e1n, who drove the Emperor Hum\u00e1yun from the throne of Delhi and ruled in his stead. On the restoration of the Moghul dynasty Sher Sh\u00e1h, as he was called during his reign, was of course regarded as an usurper, and his regal title was not acknowledged; he is always mentioned as Sher Kh\u00e1n. When Todar Mal, a courtier and trusted councillor of Hum\u00e1yun\u2019s son, came to draw up the financial account of the empire, such a name as Shersh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d would present a difficulty. As the name of a large fiscal division of the country it could not be ignored, while it would be disrespect, if not treason, to speak of Sher Sh\u00e1h. He would get over the difficulty by using the popular corruption of the name Sars\u00e1b\u00e1d, which conveyed no meaning, and was therefore unobjectionable. This is merely a conjecture, but, I think, a probable one. All the mahals of this circle are still extant and shown on the maps.\n\nAkbarpur. A large parganah in the north-west of Maldah lying along the Ganges.\n\nP\u00e1rdiy\u00e1r. Now absorbed in Shersh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d in the extreme south of Maldah.\n\nKhizrpur. Shown on the maps as Khidurpoor on the Kalindri River in Akbarpur, north of the large town of Hayatpur.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nSars\u00e1b\u00e1d. Now restored to its proper form, and shown in S.M. and A. of I. as Shersh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d. It is an extensive parganah covering all the south-west of Maldah, and including the ruins of the ancient capital, Gaur, as well as the modern capital, Angrez\u00e1b\u00e1d, or English Bazar.\n\nKotw\u00e1l\u00ed. In Akbarpur, close to Hayatpur.\n\nGarh\u00e1nd. A parganah in the north-west of Maldah. Spelt Gorhund in S.M. and A. of I.\n\nGarh\u00ed. The small parganah south of the Ganges, now in the Sonthal Parganahs district, in which was the celebrated frontier fortress of Teliagarhi, the key of Bengal. It lies a long way from the rest of the Sark\u00e1r, but its importance perhaps led to its being attached to the headquarters Sark\u00e1r.\n\nMakr\u00e1\u00edn. A parganah in N.W. Maldah, adjacent to Akbarp\u00far.\n\nM\u00e1nikpur and Hatanda. These two constitute the large parganah of Hatinda in the north of Maldah.\n\nCIRCLE OF MALDAH.\n\nThe eleven mahals of this circle are given without any revenue, and are mostly unrecognizable from the materials at my disposal. This part of the list is probably corrupt, but the means of correcting it are not available. The following are still recognizable:\n\nHaveli M\u00e1ldah is the town of Old M\u00e1ldah at the junction of the Kalindri and Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 rivers.\n\nSarbadahlpur is probably Sarbadhikpur in Shik\u00e1rpur, six miles north-east of Old Maldah.\n\nSh\u00e1hmandawi is on the Mahanand\u00e1, two miles south of Old Maldah.\n\nFattihpur is four miles north of the same place.\n\nThe general distribution of the circles is shown by the identified places:\n\nDebikot occupied the north-eastern part of the Sark\u00e1r.\nAgra to the south and west of Debikot.\nRamauti the north centre.\nDarshirak the city of Gaur and its neighbourhood.\nSars\u00e1b\u00e1d the west and south.\nM\u00e1ld\u00e1h the environs of the town of that name.\n\n**Sark\u00e1r B\u00e1rbak\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\n\nCalled after B\u00e1rbak Sh\u00e1h, king of Bengal A.D. 1460\u20131474 (Bl. xliv, 289). It comprises the greater part of the modern district of R\u00e1jsh\u00e1hi (officially spelt Rajeshahye!), and parts of Maldah, Dinajpur, and Murshidabad. Most of the mahals are still extant and shown on the S.M. and A. of I. A list of them is given by Bl. xliv, 290, which J. has apparently not seen. The two large estates of Lashkarpur and Bhaturia have absorbed many of the smaller ones, as usual.\n\nAmrol. In N. Rajshahi. S.M. and A. of I.\nCity of above-mentioned (Barbakabad). There is no evidence that there ever was any city of this name,\u00b9 and the amount of revenue shows that we are dealing here not with a town, but a large tract of country. As mentioned before, *baldah* in Indian revenue phraseology more usually designates a district than a town. This *baldah* probably indicates the unassigned portion of the Haveli, which will be discussed later on.\n\nBasdol. These two mahals are now combined; the latter B\u00e1lt\u00e1pur. name is properly Palt\u00e1p\u00far. In N.E. Maldah.\nPol\u00e1rh\u00e1r. I have not found these.\nBarbari\u00e1.\nBastol. Now united; the former word is Past\u00fal. In S. Chaur\u00e1.\nBang\u00e1on. Absorbed in Chandlai. W. Rajshahi. S.M.\nChhandiy\u00e1 B\u00e1z\u00fa. So Bl. loc. cit., but the correct name is Chhedia: G. 451. Now absorbed in Bhaturi\u00e1.\nJah\u00e1sand and Jok\u00e1. Correct names Ji\u00e1sindh and Chaug\u00e1on. The latter is given as a variant in the Persian text.\n\n\u00b9 See, however, Bl. xliv, 291 and my remarks on the Haveli below.\nJiasindh is in North-west Rajshahi, Chaug\u00e1on in Bhaturi\u00e1. S.M. and A. of I.; G. 459 under the head of Zamind\u00e1ri parganah\u00e1-e mutafarrak\u00e1t.\n\nJandlai. Correct name Chandl\u00e1\u00ed; partly in Rajshahi, partly in Maldah.\n\nJan\u00e1s\u00fa. Correctly given as Chin\u00e1s\u00fa by Bl. loc. cit., and by G. 376, 381 as Chinasun. Absorbed in Bhaturi\u00e1. Suburban district of S\u00edkh Shahar. This being the Haveli, we must look for the capital of the Sark\u00e1r in it. The word here rendered S\u00edkh occurs again in Ghor\u00e1ghat, in both places with numerous variants, as Sabtakh, etc. In both the I.O. MSS., though the dots are rather wildly placed, there is a distinct dot above the line making a reading Sankh, and in Sark\u00e1r Ghor\u00e1gh\u00e1t the entry looks very like Santakh. The place meant is, I have no doubt, the celebrated old city and fortress of Santosh, so often mentioned by the Muhammadan historians. It is written in Sanskrit \u0938\u0902\u0924\u094b\u0937, and \u0936 in Hindi and all the western Indian languages is invariably rendered by kh. To Todar Mal and his up-country clerks the natural transliteration would be \u0633\u0646\u062a\u0648\u06a9\u0647, which would easily be corrupted into Santukh \u0633\u0646\u062a\u0648\u06a9\u0647.\u00b9 The parganah still exists in South Dinajpur, adjacent to the other mahals of this Sark\u00e1r, and the baldah above mentioned must have formed part of it. The site of the city is still traceable by extensive ruins at the village of Mah\u00ednagar on the Atr\u00e1i (Maenuggur in S.M. and A. of I. See Westmacott in J.A.S.B. xliv, 190; Bl. ibid. 290). The place is still known locally as Mahi Santosh. On a line between the one frontier post of Ghor\u00e1gh\u00e1t and the other of Debikot, it would be a suitable place for the capital of one of the northern Sark\u00e1rs, and at one time must have been almost a frontier\n\n\u00b9 It is noticeable throughout the Ain that Abul Fazl always transliterates the Sanskrit \u0936 by kh, as in mekh \u092e\u0947\u0916, birkhab \u092c\u093f\u0930\u0916\u092c, etc.\npost itself. This identification, if correct, explains how the inscription given by Bl. xlv, 291 came to be found at Mahi Santosh, and the inscription itself confirms my view.\n\nDh\u00e1rm\u00e1n. Probably the Dhaurim of G. 383. It has been dismembered.\n\nDa\u00fadp\u00far, Sank\u00e1rdal alias Nizampur, Sherpur, Bahrampur, and K\u00e1zih\u00e1tt\u00ed. I have not identified these.\n\nShik\u00e1rp\u00far. In East Maldah; has absorbed several mahals from Sark\u00e1r Lakhnauti.\n\nT\u00e1hirp\u00far. Absorbed in Lashkarp\u00far.\n\nKardah\u00e1 and Khar\u00e1l (now Khar\u00e1el). Combined together in South Dinajpur.\n\nGuzrh\u00e1t. Along the Ganges in Maldah and Rajshahi. Wrongly spelt Gururhat in S.M. and A. of I.\n\nKh\u00e1s. Correctly Gub\u00e1s. Now spelt Go\u00e1s. South of the Ganges in Murshidabad.\n\nGanj Jakdal. Jagdal in North-east Maldah.\n\nGobindpur and Lashkarpur. These two parganahs occupy all the centre of Rajshahi district.\n\nK\u00e1l\u00edg\u00e1i and K\u00e1l\u00edg\u00e1\u00e9 Kothia. There is only one parganah called K\u00e1l\u00edg\u00e1i; it is in Central Rajshahi.\n\nKod\u00e1nagar. Should be God\u00e1nagar. Probably God\u00e1gari on the Ganges in Guzrh\u00e1t.\n\nM\u00e1ljipur. Should be M\u00e1lanchi (Bl. xlv, 292) in Bhaturi\u00e1.\n\nMasdh\u00e1. Should be Masidha in South Dinajpur adjoining Santosh.\n\nMansamala. G. 467 writes Malsemanny. It seems to have been absorbed in Jahangirpur.\n\nMahm\u00fadpur. Now called Muhammadpur. It lies north of Rampur Boaliy\u00e1. Bl. loc. cit., S.M., and A. of I.\n\nWaz\u00edrp\u00far. In South-east Maldah.\n\nThe parganah of Jahangirpur, intermingled with Masidha, is not mentioned in the \u00c1\u00edn. Its name shows it to be a later creation, but I cannot find to which mahal of the \u00c1\u00edn the area covered by this name belonged. G. 467 ascribes it to this Sark\u00e1r.\nSark\u00e1r Mahm\u00fad\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nThis very extensive Sark\u00e1r includes one parganah of the Murshidabad district, all the northern part of Nadia and Jessore, and a portion of Pabna and Far\u00eddpur. The headquarters may still be traced at the ruined fort of Mahm\u00fad\u00e1b\u00e1d on the Madhumati river on the eastern frontier of Jessore (see Westland\u2019s Jessore, p. 25). The number of mahals is very large\u2014eighty-four; but a great majority of them appears to have been absorbed in the larger parganahs, especially Naldi. As these smaller, and for the most part now extinct, parganahs are not shown on the S.M. or A. of I., it is impossible for me to assign them their proper position. In this, and several other Sark\u00e1rs in this part of Bengal, all I am able to do, even after consulting local revenue officials, is to indicate the positions of such of the mahals of the \u00c1\u00edn as I am able to identify. The identification of the rest I must leave to more favourably situated enquirers.\n\nIndarkalli. Probably Andarkotha, now absorbed in parganah Rajpur in North-west Nadia (Bea. MS.).1\n\nB\u00e1zu R\u00e1st } i.e. \u201cRight and left wing.\u201d By the name B\u00e1zu Chap } these ought properly to belong to Sark\u00e1r Baz\u00fah\u00e1, by which, indeed, they are almost surrounded. They are in the Pabna district north of the Podda or Ganges. The town of Pabna is in B\u00e1zu Chap: S.M. and A. of I. I.O. 6 has \u0628\u064e\u0627\u0632\u064f\u0648\u0652\u062c\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0652\u062d\u0652 and I.O. 1114 \u0646\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u062f\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0633\u0652\u062a for the first, and for the second \u0628\u064e\u0627\u0632\u064f\u0648\u0652\u062c\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0652\u062d\u0652 and \u0628\u064e\u0627\u0632\u064f\u0648\u0652\u062c\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0652\u062d\u0652 respectively. This instance shows how blindly the copyists erred, not taking the trouble to understand what they wrote, even when the words are pure Persian.\n\nBetbariya. B\u00ed\u0163bariya in Rajpur on the Kum\u00e1r river.\n\n1 Report of enquiries made at my request by the Record Keeper of the Nadia Collector\u2019s Office. It is surprising how few places this local official can identify. This shows how completely the parganah as a local unit has fallen out of use in Central Bengal.\nBandw\u00e1l. Probably B\u00e1onw\u00e1l; \u0628\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0648\u0627\u0644 not \u0628\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0644. In Rajpur near the last-named.\n\nP\u00e1tik\u00e1m\u00e1ra. P\u00e1tik\u00e1b\u00e1ri in parganah Ghaznabipur in North-east Nadia.\n\nBarmahpur. Now written Brahimp\u00far. In North Nadia on the Podda, a large extant parganah. S.M. and A. of I.\n\nPatk\u00e1m\u00e1ri. This is probably Patk\u00e1b\u00e1ri. Though the greater portion of this parganah is in northern Satg\u00e1on, the scrap given here (only Rs. 88 revenue) was apparently in this Sark\u00e1r. As we go on we shall find several other instances of mahals partly in one Sark\u00e1r and partly in another.\n\nBelkasi. It has been suggested that the correct reading is Pal\u00e1s\u00ed, and this is not improbable. G., indeed (pp. 375, 431, 432), places Pal\u00e1s\u00ed (or Plassey, to use the historically famous name) in Satg\u00e1on, but in this, as in the last-mentioned mahal, a portion may have been in this Sark\u00e1r. In both I.O. MSS. the dots are so loosely placed that no reading can be made out.\n\nTarak\u00edna. Bl. text reads T\u00e1r\u00e1kania. The place meant is probably T\u00e1r\u00e1gunia, which has already been mentioned under Satg\u00e1on, another case of a mahal in two Sark\u00e1rs. I.O. 6 reads T\u00e1r\u00e1kan\u00eda or T\u00e1r\u00e1k\u00edn\u00e1\u2014the word may be read either way; so also in I.O. 1114.\n\nJediya. Probably Jh\u00e1odiya, in parganah Ghaznav\u00edpur, in Nadiya (Bea. MS.).\n\nHaveli. Haveli Mahm\u00fadabad, now corrupted to Muhamma-dabad (see on this point Bl. xlii, 216 et seqq.), is on the Madhumati in North-east Jessore. Near it is the village of Bh\u00fasna, the name of which was often used for the whole Sark\u00e1r, being the residence of the powerful Zamindars, who owned the greater part of the country round about.\n\nDak\u00e1s\u00ed. Probably Dug\u00e1chh\u00ed, now absorbed in R\u00e1jpur (Bea. MS.).\nDahlat Jal\u00e1lpur. The variant Dahkat suggests that we have here Dh\u00e1k\u00e1 Jal\u00e1lpur, the old name of Faridpur. If so, one would have expected to find it in Sark\u00e1r Fath\u00e1b\u00e1d, which joins this Sark\u00e1r on the east.\n\nSator. Now written Shatoir and mixed up with the Haveli parganah of Fathabad in Far\u00eddpur. S.M. and A. of I.\n\nShah Uj\u00edyal. A very large parganah in North-east Nadia and West Jessore. S.M.\n\nSherpurbari. Probably Shahrb\u00e1ri, now absorbed in Rajpur.\n\nGhaznipur. Now known as Ghaznavipur, which was probably always the real name. It is an extant parganah in North-east Nadia.\n\nKand\u00e1liya. Should be Kundalia, a part of which is also in S\u00e1tg\u00e1on.\n\nKolbariya. Should be Kulberia, in South Murshidabad.\n\nMihm\u00e1n Shahi. The parganah of this name is far away north of the Ganges, and belongs to Sark\u00e1r B\u00e1z\u00fah\u00e1. Unless this is an instance of an erroneous double entry some portion of that extensive parganah may have lain south of the Ganges, or from some other reason may have belonged to this Sark\u00e1r.\n\nMahm\u00fadshahi. A very extensive parganah in Nadia and Jessore.\n\nNaldai. Now known as Naldi, in Jessore. It covers an immense area, and as it was one of the large Zamind\u00e1ris created in the Naw\u00e1bi period (G. 259, 320) it has probably swallowed up a large number of smaller mahals, whose names have in consequence been consigned to oblivion.\n\nNasrat Sh\u00e1hi. Another very large parganah, now in N. Faridp\u00far.\n\nHald\u00e1. Still extant in E. Nadiya.\n\nThe remaining mahals of this Sark\u00e1r I am unable to identify.\nSARK\u00c1R KHAL\u00cdFAT\u00c1B\u00c1D.\n\nNot a very large Sark\u00e1r; bounded on the north by Mahmudabad, on the east by Fathabad, on the west by Satg\u00e1on, and on the south by the Sundarban. Identification is here also rendered difficult by the Naw\u00e1bi creation of the extensive Zamind\u00e1ri of Jessore, divided into two estates, Yusufp\u00far and Saidp\u00far, both of which were made up of numerous tracts of land, which, on being thus absorbed, appear to a great extent to have lost their ancient names (G. 447). The Sark\u00e1r comprises the modern district of Khulna, with portions of Bakirganj, Nadia, and Twenty-four Parganahs. The following are still identifiable:\n\nBh\u00e1lk\u00e1. Should be Bh\u00e1luk\u00e1, a portion of the still extant parganah, the rest of which is in Twenty-four Parganahs.\n\nB\u00e1gh M\u00e1r\u00e1. Written as one word, B\u00e1ghmar\u00e1; in the Nadia district, on the Kob\u00e1dak river.\n\nT\u00e1l\u00e1. A town on the Kob\u00e1dak, in Khulna, with parganah now included in Ramchandrap\u00far. S.M.\n\nJesar, alias Ras\u00falp\u00far. A very large parganah, but it is doubtful whether it corresponds to the mahal of the A\u00edn, and the modern town of Jessore was not founded till a century later. (Bl. xlii, 217; Westland\u2019s \u201cJessore,\u201d p. 23.)\n\nCharaula. Now Charulia, in S. Khulna.\n\nSuburban district of Khalifatabad. The Haveli town was near the town of Bagerh\u00e1t, on the Bhairab river. It is now in ruins (Bl. xlii, 227).\n\nKhalispur and S\u00e1has. Both intermingled. In Khulna. S\u00e1has is spelt Shahosh in S.M.\n\nD\u00e1niy\u00e1. Probably Datiya, in Twenty-four Parganahs. Spelt Datteah in S.M. and A. of I.\n\nIm\u00e1dpur. Should be Itim\u00e1dp\u00far. It is now in Aurangp\u00far in the Bakarganj district. See Bev. Bak. 155.\nRangdia. In S. Khulna. Wrongly spelt Sangdia in S.M. and A. of I (Bl. xlii, 227). It lies just above Morellganj.\n\nSulaimanabad. In E. Jessore and W. Backerganj, on both sides of the Madhumati river. In S.M. spelt Selimabad.\n\nMund\u00e1g\u00e1chh\u00e1. A portion of this parganah is in Satg\u00e1on. How much of it belonged to Khalifatabad and where that portion was situated is not known.\n\n**Sark\u00e1r Panjr\u00e1.**\n\nWe now again return to the northern end of the province, where we find the small Sark\u00e1r of Panjra occupying the eastern half of the modern district of Dinajp\u00far.\n\nThe proper name of this Sark\u00e1r is Panjra\u2014not Pinjarah, as J. gives it. It is true that G. writes it Pinjra, but his spelling is no guide; the first Europeans in India had a curious habit of changing the short *a* into *i*, as in Chittagong for Chatg\u00e1on, Chinsurah for Chanchur\u00e1, and the like. Mr. Westmacott\u2019s suggestion in J.A.S.B. xliv, 8 that the word represents the old Hindu local name Paundra is, at any rate, highly probable, if not actually proved. Nearly all the mahals of this Sark\u00e1r can be identified. It comprises the western half of Dinajpur, with some outlying mahals further south. How far it extended to the north into the wild, half-conquered, submontane tracts cannot be ascertained with any certainty.\n\nAnbel. The variants give Ambil and Ampol. I.O. 6 has Amb\u00edl very distinct. I.O. 1114 is indistinct. G. 405 calls it Appol. No parganah of any of these names seems traceable, though Appol existed down to British rule, and is probably still extant in some part of the immense area of Dinajpur and Rangpur, such as Salb\u00e1ri.\n\nAub\u00e1ri. Misprint for Anb\u00e1ri, i.e. Amb\u00e1ri. The ruined fort of Amr\u00e1b\u00e1ri, now in parganah Sar\u00fappur in S.E. Dinajpur, probably represents it.\nAugochah. Misprint for Angocha (G. 405). Situation not known to me.\n\nB\u00e1rangp\u00far. Should be B\u00e1rbakp\u00far, a parganah in Rajshahye divided between Sark\u00e1rs Panjra, B\u00e1rbak\u00e1bad, and Ghor\u00e1gh\u00e1t.\n\nBij\u00e1nagar. All still extant in Central Dinajpur. Shown in S.M. and A. of I. under the names of B\u00e1y\u00e1z\u00eddpur. Bejoynuggur, Bajitpoor, and Behinuggur respectively. The town of Dinajpur is in the first-named.\n\nBaharnagar. Not identified. G. 405 has Cheparypoor. Both I.O. MSS. have the word inverted, Gherb\u00e1ri, which is more like a Bengali place-name than Barigher.\n\nBad\u00faghar. Probably part of Bador in T\u00e1jpur.\n\nTakasi. Should be T\u00e9g\u00e1chhi, just as Dukasi stands for Dug\u00e1chhi in Sark\u00e1r Mahm\u00fadabad. In many parts of Bengal chh is pronounced s. It is a detached parganah in the Rajshahye district. G. 376 writes Teggachee, at 381 Teygachee, and at 383 Teygachy.\n\nH\u00e1lon. This cannot be right, as there is no \u1e0d in Hindi words. G. 405 has Chipalun, and there is Chalun in parganah Sashb\u00edr, which I suspect is the place meant.\n\nSuburban district. Haveli Panjra is a large parganah still extant on the north-east frontier of Dinajpur. Panjra was for a long time used for the whole province of Dinajpur. G. 320 and 402.\n\nDekha. More probably D\u00edkha or Dh\u00edka, which is the reading of both I.O. MSS. G. 376 writes it Dhiha. It is not now traceable.\n\nDeora. A large parganah south of the Haveli. S.M. and A. of I.\n\nSadharb\u00e1ri. Not found. I.O. 1114 has \u0633\u0628\u062f\u06cc\u0627\u0631\u06cc, which, if read Sibdi\u00e1ri, is a very likely name for an island in a river.\n\nSankat\u00e1. Probably Sagun\u00e1, a parganah in North-west Bogra, which G. places in this Sark\u00e1r, p. 467. S.M. and A. of I. I.O. 6 has \u0633\u06af\u0627\u062a\u0627 Sugat\u00e1; I.O. 1114 \u0633\u06af\u0646\u0627, which may be Sagun\u00e1.\nSultanp\u00far. South-east of Dinajpur. A portion is also in Sark\u00e1r Ghoraghat.\n\nSasber. South of Dinajpur.\n\nSulaimanabad. Not found.\n\nKha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u00e1. A large detached parganah surrounded by mahals of Sark\u00e1r Bazuh\u00e1, in south of Bogra.\n\nKed\u00e1bari. Should be Gil\u00e1b\u00e1ri, a parganah in South-east Dinajpur.\n\nSark\u00e1r Ghor\u00e1gh\u00e1t.\n\nAt first sight this appears a very large Sark\u00e1r, having no less than eighty-four mahals. But on closer inspection it will be seen that twenty-three of these are very small, having a revenue of less than 300 rupees each, which would, roughly speaking, represent an area of 100 acres. Then there are four ta'alluks, which would be merged in parganahs. So that, these deductions made, there are only fifty-seven mahals to account for, and many even of these are very small. The country lying to the north-east of the Karatoya river, and comprised in the modern district of Rangpur, was not fully conquered till the reign of Aurangzeb (Bl. xlii, 235). At the time of the compilation of the lists in the Ain, it was for the most part independent, and when conquered was settled under different names from those in our lists. The area really under Musulman rule must have been comparatively small, and a large number of the entries in the lists must be nominal merely. G., indeed, p. 454, speaks of the Zamind\u00e1ri of \"Edrackpoor,\" which comprised the greater part of this Sark\u00e1r, as \"this little territorial trust.\" It contained sixty parganahs, nearly the same number as those of this Sark\u00e1r after the deductions above made. It lies in the Rangpur, Dinajpur, Pabna, and Maimansingh districts.\n\nI have identified, either certainly or conjecturally, the following, which, from their situation, suffice to fix the boundaries of the Sark\u00e1r, and from their extent very nearly fill up the whole of the area included within those boundaries.\nAnwarb\u00e1n. I would read Anwri\u00e1n or Aonr\u00ed\u00e1n, and identify it with Aonr\u00e1 in North Bogra.\n\nAlgaon. G. 454, \"Alygaon.\" Aligaon is in North-west Bogra.\n\nB\u00e1z\u00fa Zafar Shahi (two mahals). A large parganah still extant on both sides of the Brahmaputra, which in Akbar's reign was much smaller at this point than it is now. The two mahals probably mean the two portions one on each side of the river.\n\nB\u00e1z\u00fa Faul\u00e1d Sh\u00e1hi. In North Bogra. The Persian word for 'steel' is generally pronounced *ful\u00e1d* in India (as it is also in Persia) and *pul\u00e1d*. In Bengal the latter would be the more natural pronunciation, as there is no *f* in Bengali. The name got corrupted very early. G. writes it Folad-dessy, p. 454, and in S.M. and A. of I. it appears as Pulladassee.\n\nP\u00e1gdw\u00e1r. There is a ta'alluk B\u00e1gdw\u00e1r in parganah Boda in North Rangpur, but this seems to be too far north, unless it were an outlying tract, an enclave in Panjra. There are many such tracts, as we have seen already.\n\nB\u00e1rbakp\u00far. Part of the parganah in North Rajshahi, other parts of which belong to Panjra and Barbakabad.\n\nTown of Nasrat\u00e1b\u00e1d. Baldah here, again, must mean a district; the revenue is too large for a town. Bl. xliii, 293 says Nusrat (not nasrat) -\u00e1b\u00e1d is a synonym for Ghoraghat itself. In the Royal Asiatic Society's beautiful MS. of the Ain, this Sark\u00e1r is entered as Sark\u00e1r Nusrat\u00e1b\u00e1d. This Baldah will, therefore, be the country adjacent to that town.\n\nBarsal\u00e1. Should probably be Barbill\u00e1, a parganah adjacent to Ghoraghat, on the opposite or north-east side of the Karatoya.\n\nBari S\u00e1bakb\u00e1l\u00e1. G. 454 writes this \"Bery Shanurkfallah,\" perhaps in modern spelling S\u00e1nkphal\u00e1. The position is not indicated. Both I.O. MSS. read \u0633\u0627\u0645\u06a9 S\u00e1mak.\nBari Ghor\u00e1gh\u00e1t. The town of this name is still existing on the Karatoya in South-east Dinajp\u00far.\n\nB\u00e1y\u00e1zitpur. The parganah of this name has already been noticed under Panjra. A portion of it appears under this Sark\u00e1r also.\n\nP\u00e1t\u00e1ldeh. North of Zafar Shahi, on both sides of the Brahmaputra. In S.M. and A. of I. it is spelt Pateeladoha.\n\nB\u00e1lk\u00e1. In South Rangpur. Spelt in S.M. Palika; in A. of I. wrongly Paieka.\n\nBajpat\u00e1ri. G. 454 writes Taji-puttary, but does not say where it is. The dots are vague in both I.O. MSS.\n\nH\u00e1mil\u00e1. Cannot be right, there being no \u062d in Hindi words, and the Arabic \u062d\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627 is not to be thought of. I suspect this is Ch\u00e1pil\u00e1, a parganah in East Bogra south of Zafarshahi. All the MSS. have H\u00e1mil\u00e1, blindly copying one another.\n\nKh\u00e1sb\u00e1r\u00ed. Probably the parganah now known as Khas Ta'alluk, near the town of Ghoragh\u00e1t.\n\nSultanpur. In South-east Dinajpur.\n\nSikhshahr. A portion of Santosh, as explained under Sark\u00e1r Barbakabad, supra.\n\nS\u00edrhat\u00e1. Sarhatta in South-east Dinajpur.\n\nSiriy\u00e1 Kandi. In East Bogra, on the Bang\u00e1li river, between Zafarshahi and Chapila.\n\nFathpur. Fathjangp\u00far in Bogra.\n\nKandibari. Probably Kundi in North-west Rangpur.\n\nK\u00e1nak Sakhar. I suspect this is a copyist's error for K\u00e1ngor, though the I.O. MSS. read \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0643 \u0633\u0643\u0631. This was a well-known place in ancient times, and from its situation must have been either in Panjra or Ghoraghat, most probably the latter. Yet the name does not appear in the A\u00edn lists at all, unless this be it. \u0643\u0627\u0646\u06af\u0648\u0631 is not very unlike \u0643\u0627\u0646\u06a9\u0633\u0648\u0643\u064a\u0631. The second stroke of the markas of the g\u00e1f was probably taken for another k\u00e1f.\nMagatpur. Should be Mukutp\u00far. A parganah in South Rangpur. In A. of I. Mukuteepoor. The three words beginning with w are rather puzzling; as there is no w in Bengali they must be Persian or Arabic. The second of the three Wachhi is probably the Aunchi of G. 454, which seems to be Uchai in parganah Kangor in North Bogra. In A. of I. Kasbah Oochai.\n\nSark\u00e1r Baz\u00fah\u00e1.\n\nThe name of this Sark\u00e1r is wrongly written by J. B\u00e1zh\u00e1. It is surprising that he did not recognize the well-known Persian plural of B\u00e1zu, 'an arm or wing,' which is added as a termination to almost all the mahals of this very extensive Sark\u00e1r. It comprises nearly all the very large district of Maimansingh, parts of Dacca, Pabna, Bogra, and Rajshahi. The immense area of this Sark\u00e1r is to a great extent accounted for by the fact that much of it\u2014as, for instance, the great Bhowal jungle\u2014was uninhabited. A majority of the mahals are still known under the names they bear in the Ain, and are shown in the S.M. and A. of I. maps.\n\nAl\u00e1peh\u00e1h\u00ed (Alapsingh in the maps), Bakhari\u00e1 B\u00e1zu (should be Pukhari\u00e1), Husain Shahi, Das Kh\u00e1dia (should be Daskah\u00e1oni\u00e1), Manmani Singh (should be Maiman Singh), Husain Singh, Nusrat Ujial\u2014are all in the Maimansingh district.\n\nBadm\u00e1r (should be Barb\u00e1z\u00fa), Sonab\u00e1z\u00fa, Kat\u00e1rmal, Khat\u00e1b\u00e1zu\u2014are in the Pabna district.\n\nBhoriya B\u00e1zu (should be Bhat\u00faria) is in Rajshahi district.\u00b9\n\nBahw\u00e1l B\u00e1zu (should be Bhaw\u00e1l\u2014the great 'Bhowal jungle'), Dhak\u00e1 B\u00e1zu, Ch\u00e1ndpart\u00e1b B\u00e1zu\u2014are in the Dacca district.\n\n\u00b9 This identification is due to Mr. Beveridge, J.A.S.B. lxi, 120. There can be little doubt as to its correctness. Bhaturiya was too important a place to have been omitted from the Ain, and there is no name but this which can indicate it. There is no place called Bhoriya Bazu, and Bhaturiya is just in the right place at the western extremity of the Sark\u00e1r.\nPart\u00e1b B\u00e1z\u00fa, Son\u00e1 B\u00e1z\u00fa, Silbaras, Y\u00fasufsh\u00e1hi (in the maps Esupshahee), and Mihm\u00e1nsh\u00e1hi\u2014are in the Bogra district.\n\nThe other names are probably the older names of several modern parganahs which do not appear in the list of the A\u00edn.\n\nDaskah\u00e1onia is the old name of Sherpur (Bl. xliii, 283). Shushang, the parganah which occupies the north-east of Maimansingh, does not appear to have been conquered till the reign of Aurangzeb (G. 444).\n\nSark\u00e1r Fath\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nIs adjacent to Baz\u00fah\u00e1 on the south, and includes parts of the Dacca, Far\u00eddpur, and Bakirganj districts. It is fairly identifiable, though the extent of many of the mahals appears to have altered considerably, owing chiefly to the action of the great rivers by which it is everywhere intersected. The Record Keeper\u00b9 writes: \"Sarkar Fath\u00e1b\u00e1d included a larger area before, and at present the portion of land bounded by the rivers Kum\u00e1r, Padma (Ganges), and Ari\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n is called Fath\u00e1b\u00e1d. Several places have lost their former names in full or partly, and are known by new names.\" For the southern portion of this Sark\u00e1r and for Sark\u00e1r B\u00e1kl\u00e1 we have the valuable aid of Mr. Beveridge's work on Backergange\u00b2 (B\u00e1karganj).\n\nBholiya Bel. Bel should everywhere be read B\u00edl. It is the Bengali for 'a swamp.' A great part of the Faridpur and Bakarganj districts consists of vast morasses, or b\u00edls. The Bhulia Bil is in the north of Faridpur.\n\n\u00b9 Report of enquiry made at my request by the Record Keeper of the Faridpur Collector's Office, 1885. Referred to as Bea. MS.\n\u00b2 \"The District of B\u00e1karganj: its History and Statistics,\" by H. Beveridge, B.C.S., Magistrate and Collector of B\u00e1karganj. London: Tr\u00fcbner, 1876. Referred to as Bev. B\u00e1k.\nBh\u00e1gelp\u00far was in the north-west of Faridpur; it has now been washed away by the Ganges (Bea. MS.).\n\nBelor. Should be B\u00e1lf\u00f3r. It is in Faridp\u00far, but its precise position is not stated by my informant.\n\nB\u00e1dhadiya. B\u00e1rh\u00e1di\u00e1, alias Bh\u00e1\u1e6ddi, is now included in the Shatoir parganah of Sark\u00e1r Mahm\u00fadabad.\n\nTelhati. A parganah in S.W. Faridabad.\n\nSuburban district, etc. There is no town of Fat\u1e25abad. The Haveli parganah lies round the civil station of Far\u00eddp\u00far.\n\nHazratpur. On the north side of the Ganges, in the Dacca district.\n\nRas\u00falp\u00far. Also on the north of the same river, adjoining Bikrampur.\n\nS\u00fand\u00edp. A large island far away from the rest of this Sark\u00e1r, being the easternmost island in the Gangetic Delta. The name is Sanskrit \u0936\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0930 'empty island.' It was uninhabited till the reign of Shah Jahan, when it was peopled by Afghans, whose descendants still live there.\n\nSarh\u00e1kal. Should be Sund\u00e1rkul, or bank of the Sund\u00e1, a river which formerly existed in W. Bakarganj, near Nalchiti; it has now dried up (Bea. MS. and Bev. Bak. 24, 43).\n\nSadhw\u00e1. Should be Sidhu\u00e1. I suspect, however, that we have here two words run into one, Sidhi and Bidu, two islands separated from each other by a very shallow channel, and lying close to the northern end of S\u00fand\u00edp.\n\nSaw\u00e1il, alias Jal\u00e1lp\u00far. A large parganah in Central Faridpur. The whole district was formerly known as Dacca Jelalpoor.\n\nShahb\u00e1zp\u00far. A portion of the large island of that name, the greater part of which belongs to Sark\u00e1r Son\u00e1rgaon.\n\nKhatakpur. Now known as Kharakpur, a small parganah absorbed in Haveli.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nKasodiya. A village in Thana Bh\u00e1ng\u00e1, in Faridpur. My informant does not state what parganah it has been included in (Bea. MS.).\n\nHaz\u00e1rha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u00ed. Now called Hazr\u00e1ha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u00ed, in Thana Bhanga; the parganah is not mentioned.\n\nY\u00fasufp\u00far. A large parganah in the Jessore district, detached from the rest of this Sark\u00e1r.\n\nI have not succeeded in identifying the remaining parganahs. Naw\u00e1bi changes have been particularly active in this part of Bengal. (See Bev. Bak., pp. 51\u2013158, for a history of all the parganahs at present existing.)\n\nSark\u00e1r B\u00e1kl\u00e1.\n\nJ. erroneously writes Bogla. The references to this Sark\u00e1r by Blochmann in the three articles in J.A.S.B. so often referred to, are so numerous that I cannot give them all. The place is constantly mentioned by the Muhammadan historians and by early European travellers. It had a curious and interesting history, which it would lead me beyond the limits of my subject to go into.\n\nThe Sark\u00e1r had only four mahals. It lay along the eastern side of the present Bakarganj district\u2014the mainland, that is to say.\n\nIsm\u00e1\u00edlpur, alias B\u00e1kl\u00e1. Is identified by Bev. Bak. 50, 70, et passim, with the ancient estate of Chandradv\u00edp, the name of which still survives, and in this view Bl. and my informant also agree. The identification seems to me unassailable. If there ever were a town called Bakla, which seems doubtful, it was probably at Kach\u00faa, on the Titulia river, near Bauphal.\n\nSrir\u00e1mpur. A small parganah, very little of which now remains, most of it having been washed away by the Meghn\u00e1 river (Bev. Bak. 147).\n\nSh\u00e1hz\u00e1dahp\u00far. A small parganah near Nalchiti (Bev. Bak. 153).\nA\u00e1d\u00edlp\u00far. Now corrupted into Idilpur (on the maps 'Edilpur'), a large parganah occupying the north-east corner of Bakarganj and adjacent portions of Far\u00eddp\u00far (Bev. Bak. 125).\n\nSark\u00e1r Silhat.\n\nThis frontier Sark\u00e1r lay very far to the north-east, beyond the furthest limits even of the great Sark\u00e1r of Baz\u00faha. In Akbar's time it was probably not under Muhammadan sway, and probably at no time prior to that had there been more than temporary occupation of outposts. In the Naw\u00e1bi period its dense forest supplied timber for the royal navy or Naiv\u00e1ra, and its revenues were devoted (minus peculations) to the support of that arm. The eight mahals of the A\u00edn were increased to 146, and a crowd of petty landholders arose, whose existence forms a peculiar feature in the revenue administration of the district. G. 444.\n\nAfter such violent changes it is hardly to be expected that much of the original division into mahals should still be identifiable. The following is all I can identify:\n\nPart\u00e1bgarh, also called P\u00e1nchkhand. Is probably the country round P\u00e1nchgaon fort in Sushang, in Mymensingh.\n\nBani\u00e1n Chang. A large parganah still extant in the southwest of Silhat.\n\nJes\u00e1. The reading Jaintiya suggested by both Bl. and J. is probably the correct one. The town of Jaintiya is in the north-east corner of Silhat, just at the foot of the Jaintiya hills.\n\nSuburban district. Lies round the town and civil station of Silhat.\n\nSarkhandal. Said by Bl., xlii, 236, to be a misprint for Satarkhandal, but he does not say where it is, and I cannot find it on the maps.\nL\u00e1d\u00fa, var. L\u00e1t\u00fa, which latter is correct. It is a very large tract of country occupying all the south-east part of the Silhat district. Bl., loc. cit., confuses it with L\u00e1ur, which is a different place in the north-west of the district.\n\nHarnagar. I cannot find this place.\n\nSark\u00e1r Son\u00e1rg\u00e1on.\n\nBy the situation of the identifiable mahals, this Sark\u00e1r is shown to be a long straggling stretch of territory extending from the north of the Dacca district to the Phani (Fenny) river and the large islands at the mouth of the Ganges. How far it extended to the east is not known. Most of the present district of Tipperah was under independent Rajas (Bl. xlii, 236). To the west it approached within a few miles of the town of Dacca, which had not yet risen to its subsequent importance. The Survey maps of the districts comprised in this Sark\u00e1r do not, unfortunately, indicate the parganahs, and I am, therefore, unable to identify much of it. This and Ghoraghat remain the most obscure of all the Sark\u00e1rs to me. There is an interesting article by Dr. J. Wise on Sonargaon in J.A.S.B. xliii, 82.\n\nUttar Sh\u00e1hp\u00far. Should be Shahb\u00e1zp\u00far. A well-known island in the Bakarganj district. Uttar (or northern) Shahb\u00e1zp\u00far is smaller than Dakhin (or southern) Shahb\u00e1zp\u00far, from which it is separated by the Ilsh\u00e1 river.\n\nUttar and Dakhin Usmanp\u00far. In Tipperah.\n\nBikrampur. A large and well-known parganah occupying the eastern end of the island formed by the Ganges (here called Podda and K\u00edrtin\u00e1s\u00e1) and Dhaleswari. It is a place famous in history, and now celebrated for the learning of its pandits.\n\nBhalw\u00e1 jow\u00e1r (two words, not one as J. writes it). Bhalu\u00e1 circle. In Noakhalli district, which was formerly\nknown as the Bhal\u00fa\u00e1 district. In S.M. and A. of I. wrongly spelt Bullooah, omitting the h. See also Bl. xli, 49.\n\nBald\u00e1kh\u00e1l and Bardia, both in West Tipperah.\n\nTora. Probably Thorla on the Gumti, in Central Tipperah.\n\nJogidiya. In the east of the No\u00e1khalli district, near the little Phani (Fenny) river. Bl. xlii, 232. Once a celebrated frontier post, now a large and an important estate.\n\nEnvirons of port. The port of Sonargaon, the town itself being situated a little way back from the river. See Wise, loc. cit., and his map.\n\nChand Y\u00e1har. This entry only wants three dots below the \u03b6 to make it quite intelligible. It reads Chand\u00eda Char, as it is distinctly written in both I.O. MSS. A char, as most people familiar with India know, is a sandy island in a river. There are several hundreds, not to say thousands, of them in the Brahmaputra and Ganges. This particular one seems no longer to exist, which is not surprising, for chars are perpetually being swept away and new ones formed in the vast estuary known as the Meghn\u00e1.\n\nChandpur. On the east bank of the Meghn\u00e1, in South-west Tipperah.\n\nSuburban district. The Haveli of Son\u00e1rgaon lies about twelve miles east of Dacca. See Dr. Wise\u2019s article above quoted.\n\nKhizrp\u00far. About one mile north of Nar\u00e1yanganj, at the mouth of the Lakhya; nine miles or so east of Dacca. There is a description of the fort and ruins by Dr. Wise in J.A.S.B. xliii, 211.\n\nD\u00e1ndr\u00e1. In Tipperah.\n\nDakhin Shahb\u00e1zp\u00far. The large island on the western side of the estuary of the Ganges. It belongs to the Bakarganj district.\n\nR\u00e1ipur. On the Megna, at the extreme western point of the Noakhally district.\nS\u00e1l\u00edsari. This name occurs also in Sark\u00e1rs Jannatabad and Khalifatabad. I do not think it is the name of a territory. It seems to me to be a term, under some copyist's corruption, indicative of yearly assessments or assignments of revenue, such as were made to officials or employ\u00e9s. S\u00e1l\u00edanah, or s\u00e1l\u00ednah, is what one would expect, but the variants are so numerous that it is difficult to guess what is the actual word meant.\n\nSakhw\u00e1. In West Tipperah, near Tubkibogra.\n\nShamshp\u00far. Probably Shamsp\u00far, in Northern Tipperah.\n\nMu'azzimpur. Between the Brahmaputra and Lakhia rivers, fifteen miles north-west of the village of Sonarg\u00e1on. Bl. xlii, 236; Wise, xliii, 85.\n\nMah\u00e1r. In South Tipperah, a short distance from the Dakatia river. On S.M. shown as Mehar Nij.\n\nManoharpur. Now known as Manohardih\u00ed, about ten miles north of Sonarg\u00e1on, on the western side of the Meghna.\n\nNar\u00e1enpur. This must be the flourishing port of Nar\u00e1yanganj, nine miles east of Dacca, on the Lakhy\u00e1.\n\nNawakot. Probably Naw\u00e1kh\u00e1li (culgo Noakholly), the present capital of the district of that name. It was a fortified place in Akbar's reign, though very far from being so now. Bl. xlii, 232. I.O. 6, however, reads \u0646\u0648\u0627\u06a9\u0648\u062a Nalw\u00e1kot, and I.O. \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0648\u06a9\u0648\u062a 1114 Malw\u00e1kot, both of which seem wrong.\n\nH\u00e1tgh\u00e1ti. Probably the large island of Hatiy\u00e1, east of Dakhin Shahbazp\u00far, which, unless meant by this entry, is not mentioned in the A\u00edn.\n\nSark\u00e1r Ch\u00e1\u1e6dg\u00e1on.\n\nThis Sark\u00e1r was not conquered till the reign of Aurangzeb (Bl. xli, 49), about the year A.D. 1665 (G. 494). The present names of the parganahs, dating from the conquest only, do not in any way correspond with those given in the\nA\u00edn, and to those, like myself, familiar with the district do not recall any of the local names now current. Grant is therefore probably correct in his opinion that it was \"very imperfectly conquered under Akbar from the state of Arakan or Mogg (sic), to which it was adjoining and tributary, therefore probably rated only by estimation, not from any certain knowledge of the country\" (p. 242). It is impossible, therefore, to identify any of the mahals. I have roughly indicated on the map the northern and western boundaries. As much of the country, even close down to the sea, is still covered by dense forests, and as we know that a large portion of the cultivated area was only brought under cultivation at the beginning of British rule, Todar Mal's names and figures must be regarded as almost entirely imaginary, and the eastern and southern boundaries cannot be indicated. A large proportion of the inhabitants are still Maghs, of the same race as the people of Arakan, but they are slowly receding before enterprising Bengali cultivators.\n\nIn order to bring these notes within reasonable limits, I have purposely omitted all but the most summary references to the numerous interesting legendary, mythical, antiquarian, and historical associations that cluster round many of these ancient names. \"What shall be said for the obscurer roll of names which the above list preserves?\" asks Colonel Jarrett in a note on p. 129. A large proportion of these names are far from being obscure to those who know the province of Bengal. If I had allowed myself to put down only a selection of the interesting facts connected with these places my notes might easily have been expanded into a bulky volume.\n\nNote.\u2014I have inserted accents wherever I think them necessary. My practice is to spell the words on the usual Jonesian (or Hunterian) system, but where the name of a place is very well known\u2014as e.g. Bengal, Calcutta, Murshidabad, Bardwan, etc.\u2014I do not put any dots or accents, but follow the popular method of spelling. So also in the very common terminations -abad, -pur, -gaon, -ghat, -nagar, I have not always inserted accents.\nTHE MAP.\n\nThe Map has been compiled by taking careful tracings from the District S.M., and occasionally also from the 1 inch = 1 mile parganah maps of all identifiable parganahs of the Ain. These were then joined together into one large map for the whole province, and reduced to the scale of 1 inch = 16 miles. It was impossible to insert the names of all the parganahs on a map of this size without overcrowding it, but most of the large parganahs have been given. The blank spaces here and there represent tracts from which the ancient names appear to have died out altogether. The names and boundaries of modern British districts, with the rivers and some of the principal towns, have been inserted to facilitate identification.\nART. V.\u2014Arabic Inscriptions in Egypt. By Henry C. Kay, M.R.A.S.\n\nII.\n\nA public mosque and the tomb of the founder represent at the present day what was once a khanka, or, as it may be described, a conventual establishment for the use of \u0160\u016bf\u012bs, erected at Cairo in the early years of the fourteenth century, by Sultan Baybars, second of the name. An earlier foundation of the same character, the first seen in Egypt, owed its existence to Saladin, who adapted to his purpose a house or mansion built in the days of the Fatimites, and known as the house of Sa\u02bf\u012bd as-Su\u02bfada, a designation which the existing mosque bears to the present day. Both foundations have for a long period ceased to serve the purposes for which they were erected, and, as has likewise happened to the numerous mad\u0101ris or colleges founded by the Egyptian Sultans and nobles, their original destination is well-nigh forgotten. They are now simply classed among the public mosques of Cairo, a change from their original purpose largely due to their impoverishment, and not unlike that which has befallen many old abbey churches in England.\n\nThe Khanka of Baybars, as well as a madrasah adjoining it on the south, founded some years later by the Amir Kara Sungur (the Black Falcon) surnamed al-Chug\u0101ndar (Bearer of the Sultan's Polo Clubs), stood on part of the extensive site of the old D\u0101r al-Wiz\u0101rah, of which Baybars's Khanka\nand Rib\u0101\u1e6d alone occupied an area of upwards of an acre and a third.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe erection of the Khanka was commenced in A.H. 706 (A.D. 1306\u20137), and it was completed after the Amir\u2019s accession to the throne in A.H. 708. The Sufite brotherhood installed by the Sultan numbered no less than 400, for all of whom ample accommodation was provided. Adjoining the Khanka, and with access from the interior, a Rib\u0101\u1e6d, or Refuge, was built with quarters for 100 persons, members of the civil and military classes whom the vicissitudes of fortune had reduced to a state of want.\n\nBesides free lodging, the occupants of the Khanka and Rib\u0101\u1e6d received ample supplies of food and raiment. The foundation was richly endowed with the rents of property situated at Cairo, at old Mi\u1e63r, in Upper and Lower Egypt, and even at Damascus and \u1e24am\u0101h. Lectures on the religious traditions were delivered under the dome, which surmounts, as customary, the tomb of the founder, and the Kur\u2019\u0101n was there perpetually chanted throughout both day and night. The mosque was devoted to the exclusive use of the occupants of the Khanka and Rib\u0101\u1e6d, the outer public being rigidly excluded.\n\nThe mosque and tomb form one building, which faces the thoroughfare leading to the city gate, the B\u0101b an-Na\u1e63r.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The D\u0101r al-Wiz\u0101rah was the official residence of the Waz\u012brs, who during the later years of the Fatimite dynasty were the real and irresponsible rulers of the empire. It stood close to the north side of the Great Palace in which the Khalifahs lived completely secluded from the world, treated, it is true, with every outward mark of veneration, but none the less in a state of virtual though splendid captivity. The description handed down to us by William of Tyre of the interview with the young Khalifah al-\u02bf\u0100did, which the blunt-mannered Latin envoys of King Amalric compelled the wounded Waz\u012br Sh\u0101war to agree to, is not only an exceedingly curious account of the incident and of its surroundings, but one also in complete accord with the information we derive from the native historians on the conditions under which the Fatimite dynasty was then hastening to its fall.\n\nThe D\u0101r al-Wiz\u0101rah consisted of numerous buildings, and it included a large garden. It was built by Malik al-Afdal Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h (A.H. 487\u2013515), son of Badr al-Jam\u0101l\u012b.\n\nThe house of Sa\u02bfid as-Su\u02bfada was shortly before the advent of Saladin occupied by the Waz\u012br al-\u02bf\u0100dil Ruzzayk (A.H. 556\u2013558), who built an underground passage communicating with the D\u0101r al-Wiz\u0101rah immediately opposite. Remains of the passage, of more or less importance, are, it may be, still in existence.\nA frieze adorned with a long decorative inscription is carried along the entire front of the building. It commences with a passage from the Kur'\u0101n (S. xxiv, v. 36\u201338) which frequently occupies a conspicuous position in places of worship\u2014\n\nIn temples which God hath commanded to be raised, and His name therein to be extolled, men will therein praise Him in the early morning and at eve, whom neither trading nor selling will divert from the celebration of His name, from the practice of prayer, and from bestowing alms, (men) who dread the day when hearts and eyes shall be overwhelmed with terror, that God may requite them with a reward (measured by) their best works and add thereto out of His bountifulness. And (verily) God bestoweth His gifts without reckoning.\n\nThe inscription continues as follows:\n\n\u0627\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0646\u0634\u0623 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0642\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0648\u0642\u0641\u064b\u0627 \u0645\u062a\u0648\u064b\u062f\u064b\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0641\u064a\u0636 \u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0648\u062c\u0632\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0631\u0627\u062c\u064a\u0627 \u0628\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0639\u0641\u0648\u0629 \u0648\u063a\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0647\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u064a\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0649 ......... \u0631\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0631\u0649\n\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u062c\u064a \u0631\u062d\u0645\u062a\u0647 \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0636\u0627\u0639\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\n\u062b\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0647 \u0648\u0631\u0632\u0642 \u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u064a\u0633\u0631 \u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0633\u0637 \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641\n\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0628\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u0648\u0643\u0631\u0645\u0647 \u0648\u0641\u0636\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0648\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0633\u064a\u062f\u0646\u0627 ..........\n\nThe erection of this auspicious Khanka, to be a perpetual foundation for the use of the brotherhood of \u0160\u016bf\u012bs, (and provided for) out of the great abundance of the gifts of God, the Most High, and of His ample favours, was ordered, hoping thereby to obtain His pardon and forgiveness, by the servant of God and needer of His help ............... Rukn ad-d\u012bn Baybars al-Mans\u016bry, the servant of God and dependent upon Him, who hopeth for His mercy on the day when he shall come before Him. May God enhance his reward and cause his pious works to abound, and facilitate unto him the attainment of the things productive of the\ndivine benefits which his hopes have spread forth before Him, through His goodness and beneficence and bountifulness. And may God bless our Lord (Mu\u1e25ammad, etc.).\n\nThe concluding words are concealed by the walls of a neighbouring building.\n\nA few words at the precise point where the regal titles of the Sultan ought to be found have been roughly but thoroughly obliterated, a thing common enough under the Pharaohs of old, but of exceeding rarity under Muhammadan rule.\n\nBaybars was originally a mamluk slave of Sultan al-Mans\u016br Kala\u02bfun, by whom he was raised step by step until he was numbered among the high dignitaries of the State, and who bestowed upon him the honorary office of J\u0101shnik\u012br (Ch\u0101shnig\u012br, the King\u2019s Taster), to which was attached a military command of 100 men.\n\nWhen the youthful Sultan Mu\u1e25ammad, son of Kala\u02bfun, abdicated in A.H. 708, and for the second time sought refuge in the fortress of Karak (the Montreal of the Crusaders), Baybars, who then held the rank of Atabek or Commander-in-Chief, was elected to succeed him, and he ascended the throne with the honorific titles of al-Mu\u1e93affar, Rukn ad-d\u012bn, the Triumphant, the Pillar of the Faith.\n\nBefore his elevation to the throne, Baybars was exceedingly popular among all classes. In the building of his Khanka he won general approval by his scrupulous abstention from all acts of oppression, carefully providing for the payment of his artificers and labourers and for the acquisition of materials by honest purchase. But a complete change in public feeling took place soon after his accession, and to his great misfortune, there occurred immediately afterwards an insufficient rise of the Nile. Prices of provisions rose, and great distress soon prevailed. Disorderly crowds assembled in the streets, and lines of doggerel were sung, in which the Sultan and his wazir, Sayf ad-d\u012bn Sal\u0101r, were denounced under insulting nicknames. \u201cGive us back the Cripple,\u201d was the burden of the song, \u201cand the Nile\nflood will come down in torrents.\" The Sultan's anger was raised to the highest pitch, and by his orders some 300 persons were seized and punished with utmost cruelty.\n\nAn-N\u0101\u1e63ir recovered the throne before the end of the year. Baybars was captured, under circumstances, it must be said, far from creditable to the young king, and after a reign which had lasted not quite twelve months, the bow-string put an end to his life. The body was not allowed to be buried in the tomb which Baybars had prepared for himself in his Khanka, to which, however, his remains were eventually carried. The Khanka itself was closed, and the words of the inscription attributing to Baybars the honorific titles and designation of Sultan were obliterated. The rents of the foundation were confiscated and it continued to be disused until A.H. 726, when it was re-opened and its endowments restored. It was also probably at that time that the body of the founder was allowed to be laid in its destined resting-place.\n\nMalik an-N\u0101\u1e63ir retained possession of the throne until his death in A.H. 741. During the greater part of his\n\n---\n\n1 Al-A'traj was the nickname of Malik an-N\u0101\u1e63ir, derived from his lameness. Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6dah mentions another instance in which it was publicly applied to the Sultan, on that occasion in a hostile spirit (\"Defremery,\" i, p. 86). The lines referred to in the text have been preserved by Ibn Iy\u0101s, and are as follows:\n\n\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646\u0646\u0627 \u0631\u0643\u064a\u0646 * \u0648 \u0646\u0627\u062b\u0648\u0631 \u062f\u0642\u064a\u064a\u0646 * \u064a\u062c\u064a\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u064a\u0646 *\n\u0647\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0627 \u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0631\u062c * \u064a\u062c\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u064a\u062f\u062d\u0631\u062c *\n\nThe unflattering epithet Rukayn may be rendered wretched little mouse, and is a play upon the Sultan's title, Rukn ad-din. The nickname Du\u1e33ayn or Scant-beard is derisively applied to the Wazir Sal\u0101r, who was a Tartar and, like most of his race, almost beardless. \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0648 is for \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0647, and Du\u1e33ayn is written as vulgarly pronounced in Egypt, with D\u0101l.\nreign he had to deal with the arduous duty, bequeathed to him by his predecessors, of defending his dominions against the aggressive designs of his powerful neighbours, the descendants of Hulagu. The task of the Egyptian Sultans had, it is true, been gradually lightened by the jealousies and dissensions between the Ilkhanian princes and their kinsmen, the Kipchak Khans of the Golden Horde, and Malik an-N\u0101\u1e63ir neglected no means of cultivating the good will and friendship of the great northern Rulers and of their nobles. Envoys frequently passed to and fro between the two Courts, charged with complimentary messages; and in the mutual exchange of presents, the wealth and profuse liberality of the Egyptian Sultans were always conspicuous.\n\nIn A.H. 716 a mission was despatched from Cairo to Uzbeg Khan, but entrusted on this occasion with a somewhat delicate duty, that of soliciting on behalf of Malik an-N\u0101\u1e63ir the hand of a Tartar princess, of the illustrious house of Jingiz Khan.\n\nSir Henry Howorth has included in his valuable work on the history of the Mongols an account of the singular negotiations that ensued, as recorded by the contemporary Egyptian writer Nuwayri, who, it is almost needless to say, treats the subject with becoming gravity. The story, which is reproduced in Ma\u1e33r\u012bzi's Khit\u0101t, may also be read in D'Ohsson and in Von Hammer\u2014how the Tartar nobles professed to be utterly startled, and declared that such a thing could not be; how, \"having received their presents,\" they somewhat relented, but still raised interminable difficulties, culminating in a demand for the payment by the Sultan of an enormous sum as dowry; how, finally, but only at the end of four years' time, everything was satisfactorily settled.\n\nThe Princess, a great-grand-daughter of Baraka, son of J\u016bshi, son of Jingiz Khan, started on her journey from the banks of the Volga, attended by a brilliant retinue of Tartar nobles. They were detained, so Ma\u1e33r\u012bzi tells us, for five months by contrary winds at Min\u0101 Ibn Mishta (?), where they abode as the guests of the Byzantine emperor,\nwho is said to have expended 60,000 dinars on the entertain-\nment of the Princess and her followers.\\footnote{I have failed in my attempts to identify the port of Ibn Mishta. Professor De Goeje has, with his habitual kindness, looked up for me the MS. of Nuwayri preserved in the library of the University of Leiden; but it makes no mention of the place, nor does it give any information on the Princess's route. Ibn Mishta must have been a contemporary, since Makrizi tells us that he bore his part in showing hospitality to the Princess, and the words used by Makrizi indicate, as Professor De Goeje points out, that the port must have been very distant relatively, from the Bosphorus. It may, indeed, be understood to have been the place of embarkation.} They finally arrived at Cairo in the month of Rabi' Awwal, A.H. 720. Here the Princess met with a splendid reception, and the wedding was celebrated on a scale of corresponding magnificence.\n\nOf the Princess's subsequent life little or nothing is known. She appears to have had no children. She survived her husband for twenty-four years, during which time no less than ten of his sons and grandsons succeeded one another on the throne.\n\nThe tomb built by the Princess for herself near B\u0101b al-Barkiyah (which now bears the name of B\u0101b al-Ghar\u0101yib), though little known, still exists;\\footnote{It stands close to the tomb of Khuanda Tughay, the favourite wife of an-N\u0101\u1e63ir, and mother of his favourite son, An\u016bk, who died eight months before the Sultan. The tomb of Tughay is in even a worse condition than its neighbour: only fragments of its mosque are visible. The cenotaph has disappeared from below the dome, and with it every trace of a mortuary inscription. The Princess Tughay died in A.H. 749.} but it retains little or nothing in its appearance to attract the attention of a passer-by. The Princess's remains lie under a lofty dome, from which every trace of decoration has disappeared. The entrance appears to have been from a small mosque, of which absolutely nothing remains, and the open space is occupied by a few modern tombs. The grave under the dome is surmounted by the usual stone-built cenotaph. Running along three of its sides, beginning on the western, is inscribed in ornamental Cufic characters, a verse from the Kur\u0101n (S. iii, v. 16)\u2014God beareth witness that there is no God but He, and (so also) the angels and the possessors of knowledge. (And that) He ruleth with righteousness. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the All-wise.\nThe word \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 has been omitted. On the south end is the following inscription in the Naskhi character:\n\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645 \u0628\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0648\u0641\u0627\u0629 (sic) \u062e\u0648\u0646\u062f \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u0645\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u062d\u0645\u062a\u0647 \u062a\u0648\u0641\u064a\u062a \u0641\u064a \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0639\u0629 \u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639 \u0648\u0639\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u0629 (sic)\n\u0633\u0646\u0629 \u062e\u0645\u0633 \u0648\u0633\u062a\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0633\u0628\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0629\n\nof which the following is, I think, as near a translation as the sentence will admit:\n\nOn the date of the death of the Lady T\u016blbiyah may God surround her with His mercy. She died on Friday, twenty-seventh Rabi\u2018 \u0100khir of the year 765.\n\nAn outer doorway, leading from the road into the open space already mentioned, and from which entrance is obtained into the tomb, is still in existence, though now walled up and in a dilapidated condition. It has been roughly rebuilt, and two stones, as is shown by the inscriptions, have been misplaced. The inscriptions in question are engraved in the usual manner on a broad band which crosses the jambs on either side. On the right is the passage from the Kur\u0101n (S. xxiv, v. 36) which I have already had occasion to mention (supra, p. 139). It begins with the words \u0627\u0630\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 (which) God hath commanded, and ends with and at eve. On the left are the following words:\n\n\u0627\u0646\u0634\u0623 \u0647\u0630\u0627 (sic) \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0631 (\u061f) \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u062e\u0648\u0646\u062f \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u0645\u062f\u0647\u0627\n\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 .... \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u062e\u0645\u0633 \u0648\u0633\u062a\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0633\u0628\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0629\n\nThis auspicious tomb was erected by the noble lady the Princess (Khuanda) T\u016blbiyah. May God surround her ........... the year 765.\n\nIt is not difficult to imagine the position in which the Princess was placed during the latter period of her life. She had outlived the friends of her early years. Her husband\u2019s descendants were but distantly connected with her, and when she died their chief, or indeed only concern would\nbe in the division of her property. The arrangements for her funeral would be very much left to the care of her eunuchs and slaves, and so no doubt it would come about that no proper person was employed to draw up, or at least to revise, the inscriptions on her tomb.\n\nThere is considerable uncertainty as to the Princess's precise name. The form in which it appears upon her tomb is probably not more correct than the numerous other versions. Nuwayri, according to the information Professor De Goeje has been good enough to give me, offers us, among other alternatives, \u0644\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0629\u064c (probably for \u0644\u0628\u0646\u064a\u0629) and \u0637\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0629\u064c. Maqrizi gives us the choice of \u0637\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651 or \u062f\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651 or \u0637\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064c or \u062f\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064c, and elsewhere, speaking of the house she inhabited (vol. i, pp. 376 and 439), \u0637\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651. He there calls her wife of an-N\u0101\u1e63ir \u1e24asan, son of Mu\u1e25ammad, clearly an error.\n\nThe Mahkamah or Kadi's Court at Cairo stands almost exactly in the centre of the space once occupied by the Great Palace of the Fatimites. It is generally described as a remnant of the old buildings, or again, by other writers, as part of a palace built and inhabited by Saladin. Both these statements are erroneous, as indeed may be shown by the architecture of the existing building, as well as by its inscriptions.\n\nOn the deposition of the Fatimites the numerous members of the Imperial family were removed from the Palace and kept closely confined in a house or mansion near the smaller or Western Palace. The Great Palace was made over to the use of Saladin's Amirs, and he himself established his residence in the D\u0101r al-Wiz\u0101rah. The latter continued to be occupied after him by his successors until his nephew, al-K\u0101mil Mu\u1e25ammad, removed to the citadel, which then became also the place of confinement of the Fatimite family.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nIn A.H. 660 (A.D. 1261-2) Sultan Baybars I compelled its then existing members to execute, in binding and legal form, a transfer of the family property, including the buildings which composed the Great Palace, to the *Bayt al-Mal* (the Public Treasury), by whom the property was put up for sale and gradually but soon disposed of. The buyers demolished the old buildings, which had by this time fallen into a state of general disrepair, and the arrangements of which, we may easily conceive, could not be well suited to private occupation. New buildings, consisting chiefly of ordinary dwelling-houses, took the place of the old ones, and, we are expressly told (*Khita\u1e6d*, i, 385), were of an entirely different description. In Makrizi's time (end of the fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth centuries) only a few odd fragments of the old buildings were still in existence, and nothing is to be seen of them at the present day.\n\nThe existing court of the Mahkamah stands on one side of a square, or of what was perhaps once an extensive courtyard, and it consists chiefly of a large and lofty *Mak\u02bfad*, that is to say, a spacious apartment, of which the open front, which faces the north, is a stately arcade of columns and pointed arches. On a level with the ground is a door, whence a staircase gives access to the *Mak\u02bfad*. Across the two jambs of the door runs a broad band, on which is carved an inscription in interlaced characters. The stone is somewhat worn and otherwise defaced, but the essential parts of the inscription, and indeed the greater portion, can be deciphered without much difficulty:\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0650\u064a\u0641\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651 \u0645\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0627\u064a\u064f \u0639\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064f \u0645\u064e\u0642\u0652\u062f\u0650\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e (sic)\n\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f \u0628\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0652\u062f\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0635\u0652\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0643\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0631\u0650 \u0641\u064e..... \u0627\u062d\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0649 (\u0623\u062d\u062f\u0649)\n\u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u0647\n\nWe have here, therefore, the name of the builder, *M\u0101m\u0101y*, described as chief among the military Commanders of a Thousand in the Egyptian dominion, and the date, A.H. 901,\nor A.D. 1495\u20136. The remainder of the inscription consists of high-sounding titles, of which it is unnecessary to say more than that the words al-Ashrafy and as-Sayfy indicate that M\u0101m\u0101y was originally a maml\u016bk of Sultan al-Ashraf Sayf ad-din K\u0101it-Bay.\n\nOn the cornice in the interior of the Mak'ad is an inscription to all intents the same as the preceding, but it expressly tells us that the hall was built by command of the Am\u012br M\u0101m\u0101y\u2014\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0634\u0641\u064a\n\nOn the front of the building, above the arcade, is sculptured a circular shield, bearing the renk or armorial badge of the Am\u012br, borrowed, according to a not uncommon practice, from his old master, K\u0101it-Bay, namely, on a Fess, a cup between two cornucopi\u00e6 (?). Above, a rectangular lozenge; below, a cup.\n\nThe house, as built or designed by M\u0101m\u0101y, must have covered a large extent of ground. Some forty yards west of the Mahkamah, bordering on the new street recently opened out from the main thoroughfare, is a ruined K\u0101'ah, or saloon, which for many years was occupied, and is perhaps still occupied, by a corn-mill and as stabling for the cattle that work it. The liw\u0101ns are separated from the central portion of the saloon by lofty pointed arches of solid masonry. On the base of the arches the following inscription is carved:\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0639\u0630\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0646\u0635\u0631\u0629\n\nShortly after copying these inscriptions, chance unexpectedly led me to the tomb of the Am\u012br in the Kar\u0101fah\u2014a square building of moderate size surmounted by a cupola.\n\n1 Cf. S. Lane-Poole, \"The Arts of the Saracens,\" p. 230.\nThe inscriptions, following the \u0100yat al-Kursy, are similar to the preceding, and the same renk is represented.\n\nThe name M\u0101m\u0101y is met with in the History of the Mongols; but I am informed by my friend His Excellency Yacoub Artin Pasha, that it is also in use in Circassia. Ibn Iy\u0101s calls the Am\u012br M\u0101m\u0101y son of Khud\u0101d, and I am indebted to Artin Pasha for the further information that this last word is an Arab corruption of \u062e\u0648\u062a\u0627\u062a Khut\u0101t, the name of a subdivision of the Circassian tribe of \u0642\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0637\u06cc Kabartay.\n\nM\u0101m\u0101y was originally a maml\u016bk of K\u0101it-Bay. In A.H. 899 he was sent as envoy to the Sultan of the Ottoman Turks, an office he is stated to have fulfilled once or twice before.\n\nK\u0101it-Bay died towards the latter end of A.H. 901 (A.D. 1496), and was succeeded by his son an-N\u0101\u1e63ir. Within six months an insurrection broke out, headed by the powerful Am\u012br \u1e32ans\u016bh, surnamed Khamsu-mi\u2019ah, with a numerous following of nobles, among whom was the Am\u012br M\u0101m\u0101y. The rebels met at the outset with complete success, and \u1e32ans\u016bh was proclaimed Sultan. But in a few days fortune turned against him, and he had to fly for his life. Soon afterwards he was defeated and killed near Gaza. M\u0101m\u0101y was taken prisoner, and there and then beheaded. His head and the heads of thirty-three other Am\u012brs were brought to Cairo, where they arrived on the fourth of Rajab, A.H. 902. They were borne through the streets of the city on lances and carried to the Zuwaylah Gate and Bab an-Na\u1e63r, upon which they remained exposed to public view. We are not told whether the body of M\u0101m\u0101y was ever brought to Cairo and buried in the tomb he had prepared for himself.\nART. VI.\u2014The Sword of Moses. An ancient book of Magic, published for the first time, from an unique Manuscript (Cod. Heb., Gaster 178), with Introduction and Translation. By M. GASTER, Ph.D.\n\nI. Introduction.\n\nMagic has exercised the deepest influence upon mankind from remote antiquity unto our own days. It either formed part of the religion of the country, as it was the case in ancient Egypt and Babylon and as it is now in some forms of Buddhism (Tibet), or lived an independent life side by side with the recognized religion. In some instances it was tolerated, or rendered less obnoxious, by a peculiar subdivision into white or beneficial and black or evil magic, or was downright persecuted. Wherever we go, however, and especially if we turn to the popular beliefs that rule the so-called civilized nations, we shall always and everywhere find a complete system of magical formulas and incantations. The belief in the witch and wizard, and their powerful filters and charms, holds still stronger sway upon human imagination than appears at first sight.\n\nIt is remarkable that we do not possess a good work, or exhaustive study, on the history and development of Magic. It is true that we find allusions to it, and sometimes special chapters devoted to the charms and incantations and other superstitious customs prevailing among various nations in books dealing with such nations. But a comprehensive study of Magic is still a pious (or impious) wish. One cannot gainsay that such an undertaking would present extreme difficulties. The material is far too vast, and is scattered over numberless nations and numerous literatures. Besides, much of ancient\ntimes has disappeared; in fact, there is a profound gap between antiquity and modern times which is not by any means bridged over by the literature of the Middle Ages. In these times magical art and practice were ruthlessly persecuted by the Church, and the Councils teem with denunciations against the work of the Evil One. Moreover, it was connected in a certain degree with the teachings and practices of the various heretical sects, and the pursuit was anything but harmless. Thus it comes about that an exhaustive study of the origin and development of Magic is still a wish for the future, and the full influence which it has exercised upon mankind cannot be investigated in such a manner as to have a scientific value until at least a portion of the ancient literature will again have come to light.\n\nThe syncretistic character of the Gnostic teachings shows itself also in the adoption of Magic, and in the spiritual interpretation with which they invested the forms and formulas of Magic. The adherents of the various teachings of the Gnostics, and especially those that lived in Egypt and Palestine, adopted all the ideas that were floating about and transferred them into their system of superior Gnosis.\n\nIf anything of the teachings of the Gnostics has survived, it is the thaumaturgical portion of it. This has always been popular with the masses, as it afforded them those means which they wanted to defend themselves against the attacks of unseen evil spirits, and to the more speculative minds it afforded a clue to the mystery of the universe. It gave them the means to subdue and to put to their service the unknown forces of nature. This lies at the root of the general acceptance of magic formulas and enchantments, and gives to this practice the popularity which it still retains.\n\nBeing the most formidable sects that assumed an anti-Christian character, although some are anterior to Christianity, the Gnostics were the first to be attacked by the Fathers of the Church. Most of the ancient writings of the Fathers are filled with polemics against heretics, of\nwhich these are the foremost. The result of this campaign, which lasted for centuries, has been the absolute destruction of all the writings of the Gnostics. Sparse and incoherent fragments only have come down to us, and we are now compelled to study their systems and superstitions, if we may call them so, from the writings of their antagonists, Irenaeus and Hippolytus, Tertullian and Epiphanius. A single exception is the work known as \"Pistis Sophia,\" the date of whose composition is variously assigned to the second or fourth century. It certainly seems to belong to a later stage in the development of the Gnosis, as it contains some of the later ideas. It has come down to us in a very bad state of preservation.\n\nWithin the last few years the soil of Egypt has rendered some more fragments of this kind of literature, and magic Papyri have now enriched our hitherto very scanty stock of genuine ancient literature. These belong to the second and third century, and, being exclusively of Egyptian origin, throw an unexpected light upon the form which Magic assumed under the influence of the new order of ideas. It is a fact that nothing is so stable and constant than this kind of mystical literature. The very nature of a mystic formula prevents it from ever being radically changed. As there is no other reason for its efficacy than the form in which it is pretended to have been fixed or revealed to the Select by the Divinity itself, any change of that form would immediately destroy its efficacy. Dread preserved the form intact, at least as long as the practitioner stood under the influence of those divinities whose power he invoked for protection, or as long as he believed in the power of those demons whose malignant influence he tried to avert by means of that form of enchantment. This explains the uniformity of a number of such charms in whatever language we find them and almost to whatever time they may belong; as long as they are the outcome of one and the same set of religious ideas, which is the determining factor. But with the change of religion the charms also undergo changes, not in the form but\nin the names of the divinities invoked, and these bring other changes with them. To take a modern example, the charm against the Evil Eye will contain the name of Christ or of a Saint in a Christian charm, the name of Muhammed in the Muhammedan, and that of an angel or a mysterious name of God in the Jewish formula, though all the rest would be identical. The same process happened also in ancient times, and the Papyri mentioned above assist us in tracing the change which the new order of ideas had introduced in the magical formulas of the Christian era.\n\nIf we trace the first impulse of these changes to the Gnostics, we must at once associate it with the sects of Essenes and Theraupeuts that swarmed in Egypt and Palestine, and with the most important sect of Gnostics which produced the greatest impression, i.e. that represented by Valentin. His is the one against whom most of the polemics of the Fathers of the Church were directed. He is the author of the most profound and luxuriant, as well as the most influential and the best known, of the Gnostic systems. He was probably of Egyptian-Jewish descent; and he derived his material from his own fertile imagination, from Oriental and Greek speculations, and from Christian ideas. In his system entered also the mystical combinations of letters and signs known under the name of cabbalistic formulas, and he moreover favoured the permutations and combinations of letters to express divine names and attributes. To him we owe the theory of \u00c6ons and the Syzygies, or divine creative pairs, of which the two first form together the sacred \"Tetraktys.\" I believe this to be the Gnostic counterpart of the sacred \"Tetragrammaton,\" and not, as has hitherto been assumed by others, the Tetraktys of the Pythagoreans. For one can see in his system, and more so in the mystical part of it, the direct influence of the Jewish mystical speculations of the time. Valentin lived, moreover, in Palestine, and nothing would suit him better than to\n\n1 P. Schaff, \"Anti-Nicene Christianity,\" ii, Edinburgh, p. 472 ff.\nmanipulate that mystical, Ineffable Name of God, round which a whole system had been evolved in the service of the Temple. Angelology and mysterious names of God and His angels are, moreover, intimately connected with the above-mentioned sects.\n\nThe mysterious Ineffable Name of the divinity which is invoked seems to be the centre of most of the ancient and even modern Magic. By knowing that Name, which is assumed to be the name by means of which the world was created, the man or exorciser in Egypt pretended to constrain the god to obey his wishes and to give effect to his invocation if called by his true name; whilst in Chaldea the mysterious Name was considered a real and divine being, who had a personal existence, and therefore exclusive power over the other gods of a less elevated rank, over nature, and the world of spirits. In Egyptian magic, even if the exorcisers did not understand the language from which the Name was borrowed, they considered it necessary to retain it in its primitive form, as another word would not have the same virtue. The author of the treatise on the Egyptian mysteries attributed to Jamblichus maintains that the barbarous names taken from the dialects of Egypt and Assyria have a mysterious and ineffable virtue on account of the great antiquity of these languages. The use of such unintelligible words can be traced in Egypt to a very great antiquity.\u00b9\n\nIt is necessary to point out these things in order to understand the character of the new formulas which take now the place of the old. To the old and in time utterly unintelligible names, new names were either added or substituted, and the common source of many of these names is Jewish mystical speculation. The Ineffable Name of God and the fear of pronouncing it can be traced to a comparatively remote antiquity. We find in those ancient writings that have retained the traditions of the centuries before the common era, the idea of a form of the\n\n\u00b9 Lenormant, \"Chaldaean Magic,\" p. 104 ff.\nIneffable Name composed of 22, 42, or 72 parts, or words, or letters, of which that consisting of 72 was the most sacred. It is still doubtful what those 22, 42, and 72 were\u2014either different words expressing the various attributes of God, or letters in a mystical combination; but whatever these may have been they took the place of the Ineffable mystical name and were credited with the selfsame astounding powers. By means of these every miracle could be done and everything could be achieved. All the powers of nature, all the spirits and demons could be subdued, and in fact there was no barrier to human aspiration. The heavens were moreover peopled at a very early age with numberless angels arranged in a hierarchical order and each endowed with a special Name, the knowledge of which was no less desirable for working miracles. I need only allude to Dionysius Areopagita to have mentioned a complete treatise of such a divine economy recognized by the Church, but we can go much higher up and find these divisions and subdivisions of the celestial hosts recorded in books that belong to the second era before Christ. In the Book of Enoch (ch. vi) we have a long list of such names of angels, and in a book, the date of which has been differently put, the names of angels are still more numerous, to which there are added also various names of God. The book in question pretends to be a vision of the High Priest Ismael, and is a description of the heavenly Halls. Modern scholars who knew nothing of the Gnostic and other heretic literature put it as late as the ninth century, simply and solely because they could not find early traces of it in the old literature, and because it seemed to appear first in those times. A comparison of it with the Ascensio Iesaiae, and still more with a chapter in the \"Pistis Sophia,\" easily convinces us, however, of the fact that absolutely similar treatises were known as early as the first centuries after Christ, if they were not, in fact, later remakings of still more ancient texts. The Greek Papyri already alluded to have also this peculiarity in common with these texts, that they abound in similar\nlists of names of angels and demons borrowed from Egyptian, Christian, and Jewish sources. Among these we find also numerous forms of the Name of God consisting also of a number of letters, 7, 27, and others, and also most curious combinations of letters.\n\nThe Jewish idea of a mystical Name of God rests thus upon the interpretation of the Tetragrammaton, or the word JHVH, that stands for God in the Hebrew text, which from very ancient times the priests first and then the whole people refrained from pronouncing in the way it was written. A substitute was found for it, so as to avoid a possible profanation of the sacred Name. But it is an object of millenary speculation what that substitute really was. As already remarked, it is represented by a changing number of elements, letters or words. The original miraculous, powerful Name, however, was the Tetragrammaton known as the \"Shem ha-meforash.\" This word has presented great difficulties to the following generations. It can be translated either as meaning explicit, the \"explicit\" Name of God, whilst the others are merely substitutes, or separate, the name which is used exclusively for the designation of the Divinity. These two are the best known and most widely accepted interpretations of the \"Shem ha-meforash.\" In the light, however, of our study it will appear that another translation will henceforth be found to be the only true one, at any rate for ancient times. Later on the true meaning of this expression was lost, and one or the other of the first-mentioned philological translations was adopted. So we find in the Testament of Solomon, e.g., \"the angel called Aphoph, which is interpreted as Rafael.\" [This expression proves that it is based upon a Hebrew original, and that the word \"perush\" was taken to mean \"interpretation.\"] Considering that this name was believed to be the only true Name of God, the all-powerful name which was never pronounced, \"Shem ha-meforash\" can only mean the Ineffable, as we find it also in the \"Pistis Sophia,\" and all\n\n1 A. Dieterich, \"Abraxas,\" p. 185 (Papyrus Leyden).\nthroughout the ancient tradition. It is an euphemism; instead of saying: it is the \"Ineffable\" unutterable name, they used the word which meant: it is the \"explicit\" name, just as they said for a \"blind\" man\u2014he is \"full of light\"; other examples can be easily adduced. In this way an ancient mystery and a stumbling-block for the translator of such texts disappears.\n\nAs the Tetragrammaton, or \"Shem ha-meforash,\" was the Ineffable Name, and could by no means ever be uttered, others were substituted and were used by the priest when blessing the people. These also were endowed with a special sanctity, and were revealed only to the initiated. These substitutes were considered to be no less effective for miracles, and the knowledge of these mysterious Names was no less desirable than that of the true Tetragrammaton, for they were believed to represent the exact pronunciation of the forbidden word, and thus to contain part, if not the whole, of the power with which the Tetragrammaton itself was invested. Rab, a scholar who had studied in Palestine towards the end of the second century, says of these substituted names, and more especially of that of forty-two elements (Tr. Kiddushin, fol. 71a): \"That this Name is to be revealed only to a man who stands in the middle of his life, who is pious and modest, who never gives way to anger and to drink, who is not obstinate. Whoever knows that Name and preserves it in purity is beloved in heaven and beloved upon earth; is well considered by man and inherits both worlds.\"\u00b9 What these forty-two may have been has thus far been the object of speculation. When comparing the ancient tradition with the new texts in the Papyri, and in the mystical texts of Hebrew literature, there can no longer be any doubt that the Name of forty-two, or more or less, elements could not have been originally anything else but words consisting of that number of letters, which were substituted in the public pronunciation for the Ineffable Name consisting of one word and only four letters\u2014the Tetragrammaton! In time these\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Bacher, \"Agada d. Babylonischen Amoraer,\" pp. 17, 18.\nsubstitutes were also forgotten, or not divulged, and thus arose a series of new substitutes and variations for the divine Name. There was also the fear of profaning the name of God when writing it down in the way it occurred in the Bible, and therefore they resorted to manifold devices on the one hand to avoid a possible profanation, and on the other to obtain sacred or mysterious substitutes for the Ineffable Name.\n\nAnother element that came within the purview of this activity of coining new names was the new and greatly developed angelology that flourished at that time in Palestine and Egypt. The angels had to be provided with appropriate and powerful names, and the authors resorted to the same devices, of which I mention the most prominent, and which are the cause of many of the barbarous forms and names that abound in the magical rites and formulas and in the so-called practical Cabbalah. The biblical names of Michael, Gabriel, and others with the termination -el=God, served as a model for some of the new angels, such as in the Book of Enoch and in other similar writings. The first part was, as a rule, taken from the characteristic attribute connected with the activity of that new angel: so Raphael=the healing angel, in the Book of Tobit; Rasiel=the angel of the mysteries; and in the same manner a host of similar names. Then came into requisition the system of permutation of the letters of the divine name: one standing first was placed at the end, and so on. Much more extensively were the change in the order or the substitution of other letters resorted to. In the Alphabet of R. Akiba no less than five different systems of this kind of substitutions are enumerated; either the last letter of the alphabet stands for the first (A-t; b-s, \u05d0\u05b8\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05e1, etc.), or one letter stands for the one immediately preceding such, as b for a; or the eighth and fifteenth stand for the first, and so on (A-h-s; b-t-a, \u05d0\u05b8\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05e1 \u05de\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9), or first and twelfth are interchangeable (A-l; b-m, \u05d0\u05b8\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05e1 \u05de\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9). One can easily see how differently the same name could be written and employed in the same amulet, and all these\nvarious forms representing only one and the same name. The Tetragrammaton appears, therefore, either as \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4, or \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05da\u05b0, or \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05da\u05b0 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4, etc. The number of such permutations and substitutions is not limited, however, to these four systems enumerated; they are innumerable, and it is almost impossible to find the key for all met with in these mystical writings, and especially on the amulets.\n\nOther means employed for the purpose of devising new variations and protections for the sacred name, belonging to the very oldest times, were the combination of two words into one, of which one is a sacred name and the other an attribute, but the letters of these two words are intermingled in such a manner that it is not always easy to decipher them. An example, which has hitherto not been understood, we have already in the Talmud. The High Priest Ismael is said to have seen Iah \u05d0\u05b2\u05db\u05b9\u05e8\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b7\u05e7\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc in the Temple. This word, which stands for the mysterious name of God, is nothing else than the combination of the two words \u05db\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e8 Ktr=Crown and Ariel, from Isaiah xxix, 1. In the text, which I publish here, we have the name \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05e7\u05b5\u05d3\u05b6\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc Shk'dehu=Saddai and \u05d7\u05b9\u05d6\u05b6\u05e7 Hzk=mighty, powerful. Names were further formed by leaving out one or two letters from the Tetragrammaton or from other sacred names of the Bible, the primary reason always being to avoid the possibility of profanation, as the profane utterance of the divine name brought heavy penalty upon the culprit. In this manner is the obscure exclamation in the Temple to be understood, \u05d0\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05e8\u05b0\u05d7\u05d5\u05bc Ani rhu, instead of the usual \"O Lord\" (help us): in each of these two words one letter has been left out\u2014the d in the first, Adni, and the second h in the second word. On other occasions strange letters were inserted between those of the divine name, and thus we get the puzzling form (Tr. Synhedrin, 56a=vii, 5) which is mentioned when the blasphemer who had blasphemed God was brought before the judges. The judges ask the witnesses to repeat the\nblasphemy uttered by the accused, and they say, instead of mentioning the Divine Name, the words \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d9\u05b4\u05e1\u05b0\u05d3\u05b6\u05bc\u05da\u05b8 \u05d9\u05b9\u05dd, which may have obtained this form in our printed texts through popular etymology, meaning \"Jose beat Jose!\" But originally we have here clearly the Tetragrammaton \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4, and a strange letter inserted after each letter of that word, viz. \u05d9, \u05d9, \u05d5, and \u05e0.\n\nThis process continues still unto our very days, but from the thirteenth or fourteenth century onwards a change has taken place in the system of the formation of these mysterious words, considered to be so efficacious in amulets. The initials of the words of a biblical verse are combined into a new word without any meaning, or the letters of a verse are so arranged as to form uniform words of three letters without meaning, the commencement of each of these words being the letters of the Hebrew words arranged consecutively. The most celebrated example is the use to which Exodus xiv, 19\u201321 has been put for many a century. But these are a mark of more recent origin, and not a trace is to be found throughout the whole ancient mystical literature, and also not in our text.\n\nIf we should apply these principles to the Greek Papyri, there is no doubt that a key might be found for the innumerable curious names which crowd these fragments of a literature that at one time must have been very rich. Traces of it we find also in the \"Pistis Sophia,\" where special stress is laid upon that Ineffable Name, communicated only to the initiated. The knowledge which a man acquires through the \"Nomen Ineffabile\" is described at some length (pp. 131\u2013153). In another place we read that Jesus spoke the Great Name over the disciples whilst preaching to them, and blew afterwards into their eyes, by which they were made to see a great light (p. 233). The mysterious names of God and of the Powers are enumerated on pp. 223 and 234\u20135, whilst the following passage explains the power of that Name:\u2014\"There is no greater mystery than this. It leads your soul to the light of lights, to the places of truth and goodness, to the region of the most holy, to\nthe place where there is neither man nor woman nor any definite shape, but a constant and inexpressible light. Nothing higher exists than these mysteries after which ye seek. These are the mysteries of the seven voices, and their forty-nine Powers, and their numbers, and no name is superior to that Name in which all the other names are contained, and all the Lights, and all the Powers. If anyone knows that Name when he goes out of the material body, neither smoke nor darkness, neither Archon, angel, or archangel, would be able to hurt the soul which knows that Name. And if it be spoken by anyone going out from the world and said to the fire, it will be extinguished; and to the darkness, and it will disappear; and if it be said to the demons and to the satellites of the external darkness, to its Archons, and to its lords and powers, they will all perish, and their flame will burn them so that they exclaim: 'Thou art holy, Thou art holy, the Holy of all the Holy.' And if that Name is said to the judges of the wicked, and to their lords and all their powers, and to Barbelo and the invisible God, and to the three Gods of triple power, as soon as that Name is uttered in those regions they will fall one upon the other, so that being destroyed they perish and exclaim: 'Light of all the Lights, who art in the infinite lights, have mercy upon us and purify us.'\"\u00b9 This is almost identical with the saying of Rab, with the difference that in the \"Pistis Sophia\" the Egyptian influence is not yet wholly obliterated. These examples suffice to show the character of the central point in the new Magic adopted by the Gnostics, viz., the mysterious Divine Name and its substitutes derived from the mystical speculations of Palestine, and also the general tendency of syncretism and absorption of various forms and invocations in that form of Magic which henceforth will have the deepest influence upon the imagination and belief of the nations of the West.\n\nFrom that period, then, up to the twelfth or thirteenth century there is a gap which neither Psellus nor the Testament of Solomon fill sufficiently. All those ancient\n\n\u00b9 \"Pistis Sophia,\" ed. Schwartze, p. 236.\nmagical books, being declared the work of the evil spirit, were successfully hunted up and destroyed. The link which binds the literature of the second half of the Middle Ages with the past is missing, and we find ourselves often face to face with the problem whether a book that appears after that period is of recent origin, or is an ancient book more or less modified? Such a book is, for instance, the so-called Sefer Raziel, or the book delivered to Adam by the angel Raziel shortly after he had left Paradise. It is of a composite character, but there is no criterion for the age of the component parts. The result of this uncertainty is that it has been ascribed to R. Eleazar, of Worms, who lived about the middle of the thirteenth century. One cannot, however, say which portion is due to his own ingenuity and which may be due to ancient texts utilized by him. I am speaking more particularly of this book as it seems to be the primary source for many a magical or, as it is called now, a cabbalistical book of the Middle Ages. Trithemius, the author of \"Faust's Hoellenzwang,\" Agrippa, and many more, are deeply indebted to this book for many of their invocations and conjurations, although they must have had besides similar books at their disposal, probably also the Clavicula Solomonis, the Great Grimoyre, etc.\n\nI must still mention one more fragmentary relic of that literature, viz. the inscribed cups and bowls from ancient Babylon with Aramaic inscriptions. These belong partly to the Lecanomantia, and are another example of the constancy of these formulas; for centuries these remain almost unchanged, and even in their latest form have retained a good number of elements from the ancient prototype.\n\nIt so happened, then, that some inquisitive men living in Kairouan, in the north of Africa, should address a letter to the then head of the great school in Babylon, Haya Gaon (d. 1037), asking him for information on various topics connected with magic rites and the miraculous powers ascribed to the Ineffable Name. I give here the gist of some of their questions, which date therefore from the second half of the tenth or the commencement of the\neleventh century. They ask first, what it is about that Ineffable Name and other similar mysterious Names of angels through the means of which people can make themselves invisible, or tie the hand of robbers, as they had heard from pious men from Palestine and Byzantium that if written upon leaves of reeds (Papyri!) or of olive trees and thrown in the face of robbers would produce that effect; and if written on a potsherd and thrown into the sea, calms it; or placed upon a corpse, quickens it to life; and, further, that it shortens the way so that man can travel immense distances in no time. They have also books with these terrible, awe-inspiring Names, and with the seals of those celestial powers of which they are terrified; as they know that the use of these mysterious Names, without due and careful preparation, brings with it calamity and premature death. To these and other questions the Gaon gives a sensible and philosophic reply, warning them, in the first instance, not to place too much credence on the statements of people who pretend to have seen, but to try and see with their own eyes. Then he goes on to tell them that such books with mystical names are also to be found in his college, and that one of his predecessors was known to have been addicted to these studies, and to the writing of amulets and the knowledge of incantations, but, he adds, \"only a fool believes everything.\" As for the books with formulas, he goes on to say: \"We have a number of them, such as the book called 'Sefer ha-Yashar,' and the book called 'The Sword of Moses,' which commences with the words, 'Four angels are appointed to the Sword,' and there are in it exalted and miraculous things; there is, further, the book called 'The Great Mystery,' besides the minor treatises, which are innumerable. And many have laboured in vain to find out the truth of these things.\" In the course of his reply Haya touches also upon the Ineffable Name and the name of seventy-two (elements), which, according to him, was the result of the combination of three biblical verses (cf. above, p. 159, where reference is made to Exodus xiv, 19-21), but he neither knows which\nthey are nor how they were uttered; as to the other of forty-two, he says that it consisted of forty-two letters, the pronunciation of which was, however, doubtful, resting merely upon tradition. This name commenced, according to him, with the letters \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b0\u05d2\u05b4\u05d9\u05b5\u05bc\u05e9\u05c1 Abgi\u1e63, and finished with \u05e1\u05b0\u05e7\u05bb\u05e9\u05c1 Skusit. He mentions further the books\u2014\"The Great and the Small Heavenly Halls\" and \"The Lord of the Law,\" full of such terrifying names and seals which have had that dreaded effect upon the uncalled, and from the use of which those before them had shrunk, lest they be punished for incautious use.\n\nThese abstracts suffice to show that the mystical literature had not come to an end with the third or fourth century, but had continued to grow and to exercise its influence throughout the whole intervening period. The reasons why so little is mentioned in the contemporary literature is, that each period has its own predilections, subjects which absorb almost exclusively the general interest, and are therefore prominently represented by the literature of the time, whilst other things, though in existence, are relegated to an obscure place. The best example we have is the modern folklore literature, that has assumed such large proportions, no one pretending that the subject did not exist throughout the centuries, although neglected by scholars. It must also not be forgotten that we have only fragments of the literature that flourished in Palestine and among the Jews in the Byzantine empire, to which countries this mystical literature belongs. Christian literature leaves us also in the dark for this period, for the reasons stated above; only Syriac might assist us somehow to fill up that gap, but as far as I am aware very little is to be expected from that quarter, as in the whole magnificent collection of the British Museum I have not found a single MS. of charms or magical recipes, except one single, rather modern, Mandaic text. Two very small, and also rather modern, Syriac MSS. of charms are in the possession of the Rev. H. Gollancz.\n\nOf those books now mentioned by Haya Gaon in his\n\n1 Taam Ze\u1e33enim, f. 54b ff.\nreply\u2014all of which, by the way, seem to have been irretrievably lost\u2014I have had the good fortune to discover one, viz. that called \"The Sword of Moses,\" of which he gives us the first words. From the answer of Haya it is evident that he considered this book to be old and to be the most important, for he is not satisfied with merely giving the title as he does with the other books, but he makes an exception for this to indicate the commencement and to add that it contained \"exalted and wonderful things.\" A glance at the contents of the newly-discovered text will justify the judgment of Haya, for it is a complete encyclopaedia of mystical names, of eschatological teachings, and of magical recipes.\n\nBefore stating the contents I must first give a short description of this MS., now Cod. Hebr., Gaster, 178. This text has come to me with a mass of other leaves full of magical formulas, all in a very bad state of preservation and apparently hopelessly mixed up. Happily there were custodes at the ends of the leaves, and by their means I was enabled, after a long toil and careful handling of leaves falling to pieces on account of old age and decayed through dampness, to recover a good portion of the original MS. and the whole of this text, which occupies twelve small quarto leaves. The number of lines varies. The writing belongs to the thirteenth or fourteenth century, and is in Syrian Rabbinical characters. It is evidently a copy from a more ancient text, and the copyist has not been very careful in the transcript he made. Many a letter is written wrongly, having been mistaken for another similar, such as \\( \\text{D} \\) (D) for \\( \\text{R} \\) (R) and \\( \\text{M} \\) (M) for \\( \\text{S} \\) (S). In many a place there are evident lacun\u00e6, and the copyist has often not understood the text. The language is a mixture of Hebrew and Aramaic, Hebrew prevailing in the first part, which I call the Introductory or historical, as it gives the explanation of the heavenly origin of this text, and deals with all the preliminary incidents connected with the mode of using the text in a proper and efficacious manner. In the last, which I call the theurgical or magical\npart, Aramaic prevails. All the diseases are mentioned in the language of the vulgus, and so also all the plants and herbs, and the other directions are also in the same language. To no language, if I may say so, belongs the middle part, which is the real text of the \"Sword.\" This consists of a number of divine and mysterious Names, a good number of which are the outcome of all those modes of manipulations with the letters briefly indicated above. It would be a hopeless task to try and decipher these names, and to transliterate them into the original forms of which they are the transformations and mystical equivalents. In this section we can recognize besides the unchangeable character of some of the magic formulas. What I said before of the Egyptians, who would not change any sacred Name, however barbarous it may sound, for fear of destroying its efficacy, holds good also for another number of Names found here in a bewildering variety. Almost every religion must have contributed to the list that makes up the \"Sword.\" Eclecticism would be a mild word for this process of general absorption, that has made the \"Sword\" thus far the most complete text of magical mysterious Names which has come down to us. A small encyclop\u00e6dia of a similar character is the Greek Papyrus of the British Museum, No. cxxi, and the Leyden Papyrus (J. 395), with which our text shows great similarity, but these Papyri mark as it were the first stages of this process of growth by the assimilation of various elements and combination into one single complete vade-mecum for the magician or conjurer. In the \"Sword\" we have the full development of that process, which must have run its course at a very early period.\n\nNothing is more fallacious than to try etymologies of proper names. The omission or addition of one letter by a careless copyist suffices to lead us completely astray. It is, therefore, difficult to advance any interpretation of even a few of the names found in this text that have a familiar appearance. If we were sure of the reading, we might recognize among those in No. 6, Isis (Apraxia,\nVeronica), Osiris, Abraxas, and others; but, as already remarked, such an identification might easily lead us astray, and the coincidences might only be the result of mere chance. No doubt can, however, be entertained as to the complex character of this text, and to the astounding form of many of the names which it contains. It is a systematically arranged collection; in the apparent disorder there is order; and the names are placed according to certain leading features which they have in common. Thus we have a long string of names that are composed with the word Sabaoth (Nos. 24\u201337); others that are the components of the divine -el (Nos. 102\u201334). More startling still is a list of supposed names of heavenly powers that are represented as sons of other powers. These are undoubtedly derived from many sources, the author welding smaller texts and lists into one comprehensive list. The third part contains the directions for the application of these various Names. These are also arranged according to a certain system. The diseases follow, at any rate in the first portion, the order of the members in the human body, commencing with the head and its parts, then descending to the lower members; after which follow recipes for ailments of a different nature, to be followed by the directions for performing miracles and other remarkable feats.\n\nEach of these 136 items (numbered by me) corresponds with a certain portion of Part II, the words or the mystical Names of those portions in Part II being the mysterious words that alone were the proper to have the expected magical result. In order to facilitate research, I have subdivided Part II into such corresponding portions to which I give the same number. There is thus an absolute parallelism between the two parts\u2014one the text and the other its magical application. We see that the book has been very methodically arranged by one who intended to prepare as complete a magical book as possible. By this parallelism, and by the partial repetition of the mysterious words in Part III, we have the means to satisfy ourselves as to the accuracy of the copyist, who does not\ncome out very satisfactorily from this text. It may be that the original from which he copied was already partly corrupt, and the fear which such books inspired prevented him from attempting to correct what are obvious mistakes in the spelling of those Names. It not seldom happens that the same Name is written in two or three different forms in one and the same recipe. I have also not attempted any correction, as we have no means to decide which of these variae lectiones is the true and which the corrupt. Another reason why the copyist may be exonerated from at least some of these inconsistencies, is the fact that he gives in many places what are intended to be different readings. He starts his copy with the marginal note, unfortunately half gone, the paper being destroyed in that place, that \"there are differences of opinion as to the readings of the text and of the Names,\" or, as I would interpret this mutilated gloss, \"the marginal readings are variae lectiones.\" For, in fact, there are a good number of marginal glosses throughout Parts I and II.\n\nThere also are some in Part III, but these are of a totally different character. They are purely philological, and furnish one powerful proof more both for the antiquity of the text with which we are dealing and for the country where the MS. has been copied. Most, if not all, these glosses are, namely, Arabic translations of the Aramaic words of the original. By the mistakes that have crept into these Arabic glosses, it is evident that they have not been added by the copyist, who surely would have known how to write his own translation, but who would make mistakes when copying another MS., especially if it were in any way badly written or had suffered in consequence of age. The translation further proves that the original was written at a time when Aramaic was the language of the people, and that at a certain time when the copy was made from which this MS. is a transcript the language of the original had begun to be forgotten and required a translation, which, by the way, is not always exact. The Aramaic of this text is, in fact, not easy to understand; there occur in it many words\nof plants and diseases which I have not found in any dictionary in existence, and many of the grammatical forms present peculiar dialectical variations, which point to Palestine as the original home of our text, and deserve a special study. Here again we have to lament the fact that we deal with an unique manuscript and have no means to test the accuracy of the text. But even as it is, this text will prove an extremely valuable contribution to Semitic philology, and would enrich even L\u00f6w's book on Aramaic names of plants, where I have in vain searched for the names and words occurring in our text. I have therefore added a translation, which, however, in some places, does not pretend to be more than an attempt to grapple with a very recalcitrant text.\n\nThe title of the book seems to be derived from the last words spoken by Moses before his death. He concludes his blessing of the Children of Israel with these words (Deuter. xxxiii, 29): \"Who is like unto thee, a people saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and that is the Sword of thy excellency,\" or \"thy excellent Sword.\" The figurative \"Sword\" spoken of here must have been taken at a later time to signify more than a figure of speech. Under the influence of the mystical interpretation of Scripture flourishing at a very early period, it was taken to denote a peculiar form of the divine Name, excellent and all-powerful, which served as a shield and protection. It therefore could be made to serve this purpose in magical incantations, which did not appeal to the assistance of demons but to the heavenly hosts obeying the command of the Master of that \"Sword.\" There is no wonder, then, that it came to be connected with the name of Moses, the very man who spoke of it, and whose last words were of that \"Sword.\" In the Greek Papyri, Moses is mentioned as one who keeps divine mysteries (Brit. Mus., Pap. xlvi, of the fourth century, lines 109 ff., ed. Kenyon, in Catalogue, 1893, p. 68, and note to it); and again, in another Papyrus, cxxi, of the third century (ibid. p. 104, l. 619 and note), a reference to one of the magical books ascribed to Moses, called \"The Crown of Moses.\" But what is\nmore important still, the Leyden Papyrus calls itself the eighth Book of Moses. It resembles very much our text, which has thus preserved the old name by which many of these magical books went. Dieterich, who published the Leyden Papyrus (Abraxas, Leipzig, 1891), looks to Orphic origins for that magical composition and lays too great stress on the Cosmogony in it. In the light of our text it will become evident that these go all back to one common source, viz. to the mystical speculations of those sects, which he himself enumerates (pp. 136 ff.) ; and the \"Logos ebraikos\" quoted by him from the Paris Papyrus (ibid pp. 138\u2013141) shows more clearly still the same sources for all these compositions. The overwhelming importance assigned in these texts to the \"holy Name\" consisting of a number of letters, and the book calling itself \"The Work of Moses on the Holy Name,\" justify us in seeing in it an exact parallel to the Hebrew text, recovered now by me. There is much internal similarity between the Hebrew \"Sword\" and the Greek Papyri. The order of subjects is similar; all commence with an eschatological part, which in the Greek is more in the nature of a Cosmogony, in the Hebrew that of the description of the heavenly hierarchy. In both follows the \"Name,\" and after that a list of magical recipes which refer back to that Name. The constant refrain of the Leyden Papyrus after each recipe is: \"Say the Name!\" Here the Name is still simple; in the Hebrew text it is represented by the rich variety which I have pointed out, but an intimate connection between these various texts cannot be doubted.\n\nThere exists besides another small treatise (B), also unique, that goes under the same name as \"The Sword of Moses\" (Cod. Oxford, 1531, 6). It is a short fragment of a different recension, and has only a remote resemblance with the first text (A). It consists of a list of mystic Names, different in their form from the other text, and has only sixteen recipes, which do not correspond with portions only of the first part, but, as in the Leyden Papyrus, the whole of this was to be repeated\nafter each recipe. Immediately upon this short text follows an invocation of the heavenly Chiefs, attributed to Ismael, the High Priest, the reputed author of the \"Heavenly Halls.\" This addition corresponds to a certain extent with the first part of the \"Sword\" (A). In none, but very few exceptions, of B is there any trace of Aramaic, and a totally different spirit pervades the whole text. It is in the first place doubtful whether we have here the whole of it or merely a fragment. In two places we find the letters \u039d\u0393 (NG) and \u039d\u0394 (ND), which taken as numerals mean 53 and 54. If they stand for such, then we have here only the last two or three portions of a long text, of which the preceding 52 are missing. Again, on the other hand, as it is regularly recommended to repeat the whole of the \"Name\" after each recipe, an operation that would be well-nigh impossible for the inordinate length of that text, those NG and ND may not stand as numbers of paragraphs. This text presents besides many more peculiar traits that make it rather remarkable. We find here thus far the only trace in Hebrew literature of the \"Twins\" or \"Didymoi\" which appear in the Gnostic hymns of the apocryphal Acts of the Apostle Thomas,\u00b9 and are brought into connection with the system of Bardesanes. The heavenly Powers mentioned in the \"Sword\" (A) under the form of sons of other Powers, point also to the same system of Bardesanes, of whom Ephraem Syrus said: \"He invented male and female beings, gods and their children.\"\u00b2 He may have taken these ideas from older sources. However it may be, this coincidence is none the less remarkable. We find further angels with double names, the one of which I translated \"Kunya,\" i.e. the proper name, and the other the explicit, i.e. Ineffable unutterable name, corresponding entirely with that of the Testament of Solomon, where we find \"the angel called Apharoph interpreted Raphael\" (\u03c4\u1f78 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f08\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u1f7c\u03c6, \u1f41 \u1f10\u03c1\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u1fec\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u1f74\u03bb.\u2014Orient, 1844, col. 747).\n\n\u00b9 Ed Bonnet, pp. 36\u201338. Cf. Lipsius, \"Apokryphe Apostelgeschichten,\" i, pp. 313 and 318 ff.\n\u00b2 Lipsius, l.c., p. 310.\nIn the Gnostic prayer from the Acts of the Apostle Thomas, the Sophia is spoken of as the one \"who knows the mysteries of the Chosen,\" or, according to the Syriac version, \"reveler of the mysteries of the Chosen among the Prophets.\" With this the passage in the Hebrew text (B) may be compared, where the same idea is enunciated; and one feels almost tempted to see in the inexplicable word \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05e7\u05b8\u05df (\"Kinn\") the Greek \"Koin\u00f4n,\" the companion or partaker of the mystery; although it seems rather strange to find the very word in the Hebrew text. But there are many words that have a peculiar appearance in this text, and they look like transliterations of Greek words in Hebrew characters, such as \"Chartis Hieratikon,\" etc. I have added, therefore, this second text also, making thus the publication of the \"Sword\" as complete as possible.\n\nAs a second Appendix I have added two conjurations found in the MS. of the \"Sword\" (A), both in Aramaic, and extremely interesting also for their similarity with the inscriptions inside the bowls brought from Assyria and Babylon. A detailed study of some of these magic bowls and their inscriptions has been published by M. Schwab.\u00b9\n\nI have reproduced all these texts as closely and accurately as possible, without attempting any corrections or emendations, except in the case of obvious mistakes, which are pointed out by me as corrections. The glosses are given as notes, and the few corrections of obvious mistakes. I have refrained from referring to inscriptions on Gnostic gems and amulets, where we find \"Ephesia grammata\" similar to those of Part II of the \"Sword\" (A) and to some of Appendix I, and to the magical formulas in the terra-cotta bowls, which present a striking similarity with some portions of \"The Sword.\" One cannot exhaust a subject of this kind, and the utmost one can attempt to do is to place as ample a material as possible at the disposal of those who make the study of Magic and theurgy and of the so-called practical Cabbalah the object of special enquiry. I have limited myself to\n\n\u00b9 Proc. Bibl. Archaeology, 1890, pp. 292\u2013342.\ndraw attention to the relation that exists between these, the Greek Papyri, and the Hebrew texts which I publish here for the first time, and to point out the important fact that we have now at least one fixed date from which to start in the enquiry of a subject in which dates and times have thus far been very doubtful. It is, moreover, a contribution to Semitic philology, and by the addition of a facsimile of the first page a contribution to Semitic pal\u00e6ography.\n\nThe origin of the \"Sword\" is none the less somewhat difficult to fix. From the letter of Haya Gaon it is evident that it must have been at least a few centuries older than his time (tenth century). But it must be much older still. As the Leyden Papyrus belongs at the latest to the third century, and those of the British Museum to the third or fourth century, we are justified in assigning to the first four centuries of the Christian era the origin of our Hebrew text, which throws so vivid a light upon those remnants of Greek Magic buried hitherto in the soil of Egypt. Herein lies also one side of the importance of our text, that it shows how the connection between antiquity and the later ages was maintained. The Greek texts had become inaccessible and practically lost to the world, whilst the Hebrew text, written in a language which was considered sacred, the knowledge of which was never allowed to be extinguished, preserved the ancient magical texts, with their curious mystical names and formulas, and carried them across the centuries, keeping up the old tradition, and affording us now a glimpse into a peculiar state of the popular mind of those remarkable times. The careful study of those Greek fragments side by side with the Hebrew will assist very materially in the understanding also of those often very obscure texts, and lift the study from the narrow groove in which it has hitherto been kept by the classical scholars who have devoted their attention recently to them. It will also help us in laying bare the fountains from which flowed the whole of the magical arts of the Middle Ages.\nII. Translation.\n\nI. The Sword of Moses.\n\nIn the name of the mighty and holy God!\n\nFour angels are appointed to the \"Sword\" given by the Lord, the Master of mysteries, and they are appointed to the Law, and they see with penetration the mysteries from above and below; and these are their names\u2014SKD HUZI, MRGIOIAL, VHDRZIOLO, TOTRISI. And over these are five others, holy and mighty, who meditate on the mysteries of God in the world for seven hours every day, and they are appointed to thousands of thousands, and to myriads of thousands of Chariots, ready to do the will of their Creator, X,\u00b9 the Lord of Lords and the honoured God; these are their names\u2014X. And the Master of each Chariot upon which they are appointed wonders and says: \"Is there any number of his armies?\" And the least of these Chariots is lord and master over those (above) four. And over these are three chiefs of the hosts of the Lord, who make every day tremble and shake His eight halls, and they have the power over every creature. Under them stand a double number of Chariots, and the least of them is lord and master over all the above Chiefs (rulers); and these are their names\u2014X. And the name of the Lord and king is X, who sits, and all the heavenly hosts kneel, and prostrate themselves before Him daily before leaving X, who is the Lord over all.\n\nAnd when thou conjure him he will attach himself to thee, and cause the other five Chiefs and their Chariots, and the lords that stand under them, to attach themselves to thee just as they were ordered to attach themselves to Moses, son of Amram, and to attach to him all the lords that stand under them; and they will not tarry in their obeisance, and will not withhold from giving authority to\n\n\u00b9 X stands for the mysterious names, which have not been transliterated. N for the name of the person who conjures.\nthe man who utters the conjuration over this \"Sword,\" its mysteries and hidden powers, its glory and might, and they will not refuse to do it, as it is the command of God X saying: \"Ye shall not refuse to obey a mortal who conjures you, nor should you be different to him from what you were to Moses, son of Amram, when you were commanded to do so, for he is conjuring you with My Ineffable names, and you render honour to My name and not to him. If you should refuse I will burn you, for you have not honoured Me.\"\n\nEach of these angels had communicated to him (Moses) a propitious thing for the proper time. These things (words) are all words of the living God and King of the Universe, and they said to him:\n\n\"If thou wishest to use this 'Sword' and to transmit it to the following generations, (then know) that the man who decides to use it must first free himself three days previously from accidental pollution and from everything unclean, eat and drink once every evening, and must eat the bread from a pure man or wash his hands first in salt (?), and drink only water; and no one is to know that he intends using this 'Sword,' as therein are the mysteries of the Universe, and they are practised only in secret, and are not communicated but to the chaste and pure. On the first day when you retire from (the world) bathe once and no more, and pray three times daily, and after each prayer recite the following Blessing:\n\n\"'Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who openest the gates of the East and cleavest the windows of the firmament of the Orient, and givest light to the whole world and its inhabitants, with the multitude of His mercies, with His mysteries and secrets, and teachest Thy people Israel Thy secrets and mysteries, and hast revealed unto them the \"Sword\" used by the world; and Thou sayest unto them: \"If anyone is desirous of using this 'Sword,' by which every wish is fulfilled and every secret revealed, and every miracle, marvel, and prodigy are performed, then speak to Me in the following manner, read before Me this\nand that, and conjure in such and such a wise, and I will instantly be prevailed upon and be well disposed towards you, and I will give you authority over this Sword, by which to fulfil all that you desire, and the Chiefs will be prevailed upon by you, and my holy ones will be well disposed towards you and they will fulfil instantly your wishes, and will deliver to you my secrets and reveal to you my mysteries, and my words they will teach you and my wonders they will manifest to you, and they will listen and serve you as a pupil his master, and your eyes will be illuminated and your heart will see and behold all that is hidden, and your size will be increased.\u201d Unto Thee I call, X, Lord of the Universe. Thou art He who is called X, King of the Universe. Thou art called X, merciful king. Thou art called X, gracious king. Thou art called X, living king. Thou art called X, humble king. Thou art called X, righteous king. Thou art called X, lofty king. Thou art called X, perfect king. Thou art called X, upright king. Thou art called X, glorious king. Thou art called X, youthful king. Thou art called X, pleasant king. Thou art called X, and thou listenest to my prayer, for Thou hearkenest unto prayer; and attach unto me Thy servants the lords of the \u201cSword,\u201d for Thou art their king, and fulfil my desire, for everything is in Thy hands, as it is written: \u201cThou openest thine hand and satisfiest every living being with favour.\u201d\n\n\u201cI conjure you, Azliel called X; I conjure you, Arel called X, Ta\u2019aniel called X, Tafel called X, and the most glorious of these Yofel Mittron called X, the glory from above. With the permission of my king (I conjure) Yadiel called X, Ra\u2019asiel called X, Haniel called X, Haniel called X, Asrael called X, Yisriel called X, A\u2019shael called X, Amuhael called X, and Asrael called X, that you attach yourselves to me and surrender the \u201cSword\u201d to me, so that I may use it according to my desire, and that I find shelter under the shadow of our Lord in heaven in the glorious Name, the mighty and awe-inspiring X, the twenty-four letters from the Crown; that you deliver unto me with this\n\"Sword\" the secrets from above and below, the mysteries from above and below, and my wish be fulfilled and my words hearkened unto, and my prayer (supplication) received through the conjuration with the Ineffable name of God which is glorified in the world, through which all the heavenly hosts are tied and bound; and this is the Ineffable Name\u2014X, blessed be he! (I conjure you) that you shall not refuse me nor hurt me, nor frighten and alarm me, in the tremendous Name of your king, the terror of whom rests upon you, and who is called X. Fulfil for me everything that I have been conjuring you for, and serve me, for I have conjured you not with the name of one who is great among you but with that of the Lord over all, whose name ties and binds and keeps and fastens all the heavenly hosts. And if you should refuse me, I will hand you over to the Lord God and to his Ineffable name, whose wrath and anger and fire are kindled, who honours his creatures with one letter of his name, and is called X; so that if you refuse he will destroy you, and you will not be found when searched after. And you preserve me from shortness of spirit and weakness of body in the name of X, the guardian of Israel. Blessed art Thou, who understandest the secrets and revealest the mysteries, and art king of the Universe.\"\n\nA voice was heard in the heavens, the voice of the Lord of heavens, saying: \"I want a light (swift) messenger (to go) to man, and if he fulfils my message my sons will become proud of the 'Sword' which I hand over to them, which is the head of all the mysteries of which also my seers have spoken, that thus will my word be, as it is said: 'Is not my word like as fire?' saith the Lord'\" (Jer. xxiii, 29). Thus spoke X, the lord of heaven and earth; and I, Assi Asisih and Apragsih, the light (swift) messenger, who am pleased with my messages and delighted with my sending, ascended before Him, and the Lord over all commanded me: \"Go and make this known to men who are pious and good and pure and righteous and faithful, whose heart is not divided and in whose mouth is no duplicity, who do not lie with their tongues and do not deceive with\ntheir lips, who do not grasp with their hands and are not lustful with their eyes, who do not run after evil, keep aloof from every uncleanness, depart from every defilement, keep themselves holy from contamination, and do not approach woman.\" When the Lord over all commanded me thus, I, X, the swift messenger, went down to earth, and I said on my way: \"Where is the man who possesses all these that I should go to him and place this with him?\" And I asked myself, and thought in my heart that there is no man who would do all this that I wished; and I found none, and it was heavy unto me. And the Lord over all conjured me by His mighty right arm, and by the lustre of His glory and His glorious crown, with an oath of His mighty right arm, and He conjured me, and the Lord over all strengthened me and I did not fall. I thus stood up, I, X, to put NN in the possession of the desired covenant, in the name of X.\"\n\n\"This is the great and glorious Name which has been given as a tradition to man\u2014X, holy, glorious, glorious, Selah. Recite it after thy prayers.\u2014And these are the names of the angels that minister to the son of man\u2014Mittron, Sgrdtsih, Mqttro, Sngotiqtel, etc., etc., etc. (28 names).\" \"In a similar manner shall you serve me NN; and receive my prayer and my orisons, and bring them to God X, blessed be He! for I adjure you in His name, and I extol you (to ascend), like unto the bird that flies from its nest, and remember my meritorious deeds before Him and (make Him) forgive now my sins on account of my words of supplication, and you may not refuse me in the name of X, blessed be He! Sabaoth, Sabaoth, Selah. His servants sanctify Him and praise Him with sweet melody, and say: \"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of holy name; the whole earth is full of His glory\"; and do not refuse me, in the name of X, who lives for ever, and in the name of Ditimon, etc., X, and in the name X of the great One from whom nothing is hidden, who sees and is not seen, and in the name of Him who is the chief over the heavens and is called X. And the King of the\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nUniverse utters (this name) also in a different manner, thus\u2014X. You swift messenger, do not tarry and do not frighten me, but come and do all my wants in the name of X, the great One, who sees and is not seen, AHVH, whose Ineffable Name is revealed to the heavenly hosts; and I conjure you by this Ineffable Name, such as it was revealed to Moses by the mouth of the Lord over all, X, the Lord Sabaoth is His name. Blessed art thou, O God, lord of mighty acts, who knowest all the mysteries.\"\n\nAnd which are the letters which X communicated to Moses? He said to him: \"If thou wishest to get wise and to use the 'Sword,' call me, and conjure me, and strengthen me, and fortify me, and say: 'X, with the great, holy, wonderful, pure, precious, glorious, and awe-inspiring secret Name X, with these letters I conjure thee to surrender to me and make me wise and attach to me the angels which minister to the 'Sword,' in the name of the Revealer of mysteries. Amen.'\"\n\nWrite with ink on leather and carry about with you during those three days of purification, and invoke before and after prayer the following Names communicated to Moses by Mrgiiel, X, by Trotrosi, X, etc. (the 13 Chiefs mentioned at the beginning, and a long string of other mysterious names which are said to have been communicated to Moses). \"And they have not hidden from him any of these sacred Ineffable names or letters, and have not given him instead the Substitutes of any of these sacred letters, for thus were they ordered by the Lord of all mysteries to communicate to him this 'Sword,' with these Names which constitute the mysteries of this 'Sword'; and they said to him: 'Command the generations which will come after thee to say the following blessing prior to their prayer, lest they be swept away by the fire': 'Blessed art Thou, X, who wast with Moses; be also with me, Thou, whose name is X. Send me X, who is the cover of the Cherubim, to help me. Blessed art Thou, Lord of the Sword.'\"\n\nWhoever is desirous of using this 'Sword' must recite his\nusual prayers, and at the passage \"Thou hearkenest to prayer\" say: \"I conjure you four princes, X, servants of Hadirion, X, that you receive my invocation before I pray, and my supplication before I entreat, and fulfil all my wishes through this 'Sword,' as you have done to Moses, in the glorious and wonderful name of the Lord of wonders, which is interpreted thus\u2014X.\" He must then call the five superior Chiefs and say: \"I conjure you, X, that you accept my conjuration as soon as I conjure you, and you attach to me those four princes and all the hosts of Chariots over which you preside, to fulfil all my wishes through this 'Sword' by this beloved name X.\" He must then call the three angels that are superior to these, and say: \"I conjure you, X, the beloved of X, who is Hadiririon, that you attach yourselves to me and attach to me X, who are standing under your rule, to fulfil all my wishes through this 'Sword' by this unique name X.\" And then he must lay hold of the highest Chief over all and say: \"I conjure thee, X, strong and powerful Chief over all the heavenly hosts, that thou attachest thyself to me, thou and not thy messenger, and attach to me all the Chiefs that are with thee, to fulfil my wishes through this 'Sword,' by the name X, which has no substitute, for thou art beloved and he is beloved, and I am from the seed of Abraham called the beloved. Blessed art thou, King of the mysteries, Lord of the secrets, who hearkenest unto prayer.\"\n\nAnd he is not to touch this \"Sword\" ere he has done all these things; afterwards he will be able to do whatever he likes, everything being written here following in its proper order.\n\nII. This is the \"Sword.\"\n\n[It consists of a series of mysterious names of God or angels, to which the recipes in Part III refer. The first list commences with Tobat, Tsbr, etc. (1\u20135). These numbers are added by me to make the formulas run parallel with their magical applications in Part III, as already explained in the Introduction. I refer to them as they break up this\npart in convenient smaller portions, and are easily discernible. After these follow the words]: \"With these your Names, and with the powers you possess, to which there is nowhere anything like (I conjure you) to show me and to search for me, and to bring me X to do all my bidding in the name of X,\" and, again, a list of names, that have no special characteristic in common. Nos. 20-24 are all names commencing with JJ; some of these finish with JH. 24-36 all these names have the word Sabaoth attached to them. To 41-47 HVH is added. From Nos. 51-93 all the names are composite; they appear as names of sons, the name of the father being added to each of these, close upon 160 names, e.g.: Ssgnis, son of Srngia; Ssgn, son of 'Arggis; Atumi, son of Batumi; Ahsuti, son of Kkthus; Agupi, son of Abkmi, etc. Every name from 102 on to the end of this part finishes with -el, after which follow varying syllables and words: some are only JH or JV (Nos. 102-105), or a word commencing with 'A- and finishing with -JH (Nos. 106-111). Nos. 112-121 are followed by AHVH, whilst 122-127=JHVHH, and Nos. 128-134=HVJH. They conclude with the following words: \"Ye sacred angels, princes of the hosts of X, who stand upon the thrones prepared for them before Him to watch over and to minister to the 'Sword,' to fulfil by it all the wants by the name of the Master over all; you Chiefs of all the angels in the world, X, in the name of X the seal of heaven and earth, ministers of X the most high God; through you I see X in the world; you are lording over me in all the place of the Master over all: I pray of you to do everything that I am asking of you, as you have the power to do everything in heaven and upon earth in the name of X, as it is written in the Law, 'I am the Lord, this is My name!'\"\n\nIII.\n\n1.

And four are engraved upon the four crowns of the Ofanim (wheels) that stand against the Holy Creatures, as it is said: \u201cWhen those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood\u201d (Ezek. i, 21); and these they are\u2014X, who is the mightiest over all; X, who rules over all the inhabitants of the heights (?), and in whose hands everything is. And two are engraved upon the crown of the most exalted and high King, and these they are\u2014X, before whom every knee bends and every mouth utters praises; X, besides him there is no God and helper. With these names I conjure thee, and firmly decree upon thee to descend quickly to me, N, son of N, thou and not thy messenger. And when thou comest down do not turn my mind, but reveal unto me all the secret mysteries from above and beneath, and the hidden secrets from above and beneath, and all the secrets of wisdom and the cunning of helpfulness, just as a man speaks to his neighbour. For I have conjured thee with these Names, that are great and mighty and wonderful and awe-inspiring, and proved and arranged in proper order, through which the glorious\nthrone has been established and the beautiful seat of the Most High, which has been wonderfully wrought, long before thou and the heavenly hosts had been created, \"While as yet He had not made the earth nor the fields, and the inhabitants of the earth and the creatures therein\" (Prov. viii, 26).\n\n\"I call thee further by (the power) of the five selected Names, to which only one is superior, and this is their form\u2014X. I conjure thee by these five Names, which correspond to the five names of God, whose letters are written on burning fire, and they circle round the throne of glory, one ascending and the other descending, so that the angels of the Presence should not behold them, and this is their equivalent and form and glory\u2014X. I conjure thee by these, as thou knowest their praise and greatness, which no mouth can utter, and no ear can hear, no, not even one of them. Thou hast been commanded and ordered by the Most High: \"as soon as thou hearest anyone conjuring thee with these names, to do honour to My Name, and to descend quickly and fulfil the wish of the man who makes thee hear them; but if thou tarriest I will push thee into the fiery river Rigayon and place another in thy stead.\" Do it, therefore, for His Name, and come quickly to me, N, son of N, not in a terror, and not in fear, not with fiery coals, not with hailstone, and not with the sleet and treasures of snow, and not with the howling of the storm, and not with the provinces of the whirlwind that usually accompany thee, and do my bidding and fulfil my desire, for everything is in thy hand; by the permission of thy God, the master over all and thy lord, and with His Names I conjure thee to attach thyself quickly to me; come and fulfil my wish, and do not tarry.\n\n\"I further call thee with the greatest of thy Names, the pleasant and beloved one, which is the same as that of thy Master, save one letter, with which He created and formed everything, and which He placed as a seal upon all the work of His hand; and this is its equivalent\u2014X, and the\nother in the language of purity (permutations of the letters Yod, He) is read so\u2014X. I conjure thee with the right hand of sanctity and with His beloved Name, in whose honour everything has been created, and all are terror-struck by His mighty arm, and all the sons of the internal heavenly cohort (servants) tremble and shake of His fear, which is X, and its equivalent by means of JHVH is X. Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever. And all praise and extol thy Name, for they love thee. I conjure thee, and decree upon thee firmly, not to disobey my words, and not to alter my decree and my decision with which I conjured thee, and decreed upon thee, and established in peace. In the Name X, blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever, depart in peace, and do not frighten me in the hour of thy departure; in the name X, Lord, most high and holy, in the name of the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel\u2019s battalions; in the name of the holy living Creatures, and in the name of the Wheels of the Chariot, and in the name of the river of fire, Ih, Zii, Ziin, and all His ministers, and in the name of IH, Ziin, Sabaoth, Z, El Z, Shaddai Z, X revealed Himself on Mount Sinai in the glory of His majesty.\n\n\u201c\u2018With these Names, terrible and mighty, which darken the sun, and obscure the moon, and turn the sea, and break the rocks, and extinguish the light, I conjure you, spirits, and . . and Shiddim, and Satanim, that you depart and disappear from N, son of N.\u2019\n\nAPPENDIX II.\n\nI. Against an enemy.\u2014I call thee, evil spirit, cruel spirit, merciless spirit. I call thee, bad spirit, who sittest in the cemetery and takes away healing from man. Go and place a knot in NN\u2019s head, in his eyes, in his mouth, in his tongue, in his throat, in his windpipe; put poisonous water in his belly. If you do not go and put water in his belly, I will send against you the evil angels Puziel, Guziel,\nPsdiel, Prziel. I call thee and those six knots that you go quickly to NN and put poisonous water in his belly and kill NN whom I mean (or, because I wish it). Amen, Amen. Selah.\n\nII. Against an enemy.\u2014Write upon a new-laid egg on a Nazarene cemetery: \"I conjure you, luminaries of heaven and earth, as the heavens are separated from the earth, so separate and divide NN from his wife NN, and separate them from one another, as life is separated from death, and sea from dry land, and water from fire, and mountain from vale, and night from day, and light from darkness, and the sun from the moon; thus separate NN from NN his wife, and separate them from one another in the name of the twelve hours of the day and the three watches (?) of the night, and the seven days of the week, and the thirty days of the month, and the seven years of Shemittah, and the fifty years of Jubilee, on every day, in the name of the evil angel Tmsmael, and in the name of the angel Iabiel, and in the name of the angel Drsmiel, and in the name of the angel Zahbuk, and in the name of the angel Ataf, and in the name of the angel Zhsmael, and in the name of the angel Zsniel, who preside over pains, sharp pains, inflammation, and dropsy, and separate NN from his wife NN, make them depart from one another, and that they should not comfort one another, swiftly and quickly.\"\nNOTICE TO

The Several Pali and Sinhalese Authors known as Dhammakitti.\n\nDecember 2nd.\n\nSir,\u2014In the course of preparing Catalogues of Sinhalese books and MSS. in the British Museum, I have come across the name of Dhammakitti Thera as the author of several ancient works in the Pali and Sinhalese languages. Judging from their contents and the style in which they are written, it becomes obvious, even to a beginner as I am, that they cannot have been written at one period, and still less by one and the same person. Further research into the literature and the historical records of Ceylon has confirmed this view. It appears that there have been no\nless than five Buddhist friars bearing this name who distinguished themselves as authors, and held at different times high positions in the Buddhist Order.\n\nThe earliest of them was Dhammakitti Thera, a pupil of S\u0101riputta of Polonnaruwa. The latter is well known to Pali scholars as the venerable author of (1) S\u0101rattha-d\u012bpan\u012b, (2) S\u0101ratthama\u00f1j\u016bs\u0101 (a t\u012bk\u0101 on Manorathap\u016brani), (3) Vinayasa\u1e45gha,\u00b9 (4) Abhidhammattha-Sa\u1e45gha-Sanna,\u00b2 and (5) Pa\u00f1jik\u0101la\u1e45k\u0101ra,\u00b9 a commentary on Ratnamati\u2019s Pa\u00f1jik\u0101, which is itself a commentary on the C\u0101ndravy\u0101karana, the valuable Sanskrit grammar of Candragomin.\n\nNo copy of the Pa\u00f1jik\u0101la\u1e45k\u0101ra has as yet been met with in Ceylon.\u00b3 It must, however, have been extant in the fifteenth century, for we find references to it in To\u1e6dagamuve \u015ar\u012b R\u0101hula\u2019s grammatical work \u201cMoggall\u0101yanapa\u00f1jik\u0101-pradipaya.\u201d\u2074 We have thus another work on Candra\u2019s grammar, which must be added to those mentioned by Dr. Bruno Liebich in his learned essay on the subject.\u2075\n\nS\u0101riputta lived at Polonnaruwa in the reign of King Par\u0101krama-b\u0101hu the Great (1164\u201397 A.D.). He had several disciples\u2014Sa\u1e45gharakkhita, Suman\u0101gala, V\u0101gi\u015bvara, Dhammakitti, and others\u2014who were themselves celebrated authors. Sa\u1e45gharakkhita wrote (1) Khuddasikkh\u0101 Abhinava T\u012bk\u0101, (2) Subodh\u0101la\u1e45k\u0101ra, (3) Vuttodaya, (4) Susaddasiddhi, and (5) Sambandha Cint\u0101,\u2076 and took a prominent part in the convocation of monks held under the auspices of King M\u0101gha or K\u0101linga Vijaya-b\u0101hu (1215\u201336) for the suppression of schisms in the Buddhist Church.\u2077\n\nThis Dhammakitti, whom we may call \u201cthe first,\u201d was the composer of the well-known Pali poem, D\u0101\u1e6dh\u0101vamsa, on the Tooth-relic of Buddha. He wrote it at the request of\n\n\u00b9 Colophon to D\u0101\u1e6dh\u0101vamsa (edited and tr. by Sir Mutukum\u0101ra Sv\u0101mi), p. 81. See also P.T.S.

He came to the island from \"Tamba-rata,\" or, according to May\u016brap\u0101da's P\u016bj\u0101valiya, from \"Tamalingamuva,\" at the invitation of the king. The following is the account in the Mah\u0101vamsa, clothed, as is to be expected, in religious language:\n\n\"And it came to pass that of the many and pious priests who dwelt always in the country of Tamba, there was a certain great elder known as Dhammakitti, who had become famous by his great zeal and piety. And when the king heard that a lotus had once sprung up in the path of this elder as he went on his way begging, he was greatly astonished, and sent religious gifts and offerings of perfumes and sandal ointments, and such substances that were touched against the Tooth-relic, and other royal gifts also, to the Tamba country, and caused the great elder to be brought to the island of Lanka. And when the king saw him he was glad and rejoiced greatly, as if he had seen an Arahat, and made great offerings unto him, and ministered carefully, with the four requirements of a monastic life, unto him who was a vessel worthy of offerings and honour.\"\n\nAnd this Buddhist saint may have been the same Dhammakitti who, under the patronage of the king, compiled that portion of the Mah\u0101vamsa which treats of the history from the period of Mah\u0101sena, A.D. 275\u2013301, to his own times.\n\nA third Dhammakitti seems to have flourished during the reign of Bhuvaneka-b\u0101hu I (1277\u201388). He belonged to the fraternity of Buddhist monks whose chief seat was at Pu\u1e6dabbattasela (Pal\u0101batgala), but he resided in a monastery near Ga\u1e45g\u0101\u015br\u012bpura (Gampola).\n\n---\n\n1 D\u0101th\u0101vamsa, Pali Text Society's edition, vv. 4\u201310.\n2 Wijesinha's Mah\u0101vamsa, p. 284, vv. 11\u201316.\n3 Saddhamm\u0101lanka\u1e47\u1e6dha, Brit.

He lived at Gadal\u0101deni Vih\u0101ra during the reigns of Par\u0101krama-b\u0101hu V and Vikrama-b\u0101hu III (1351\u201372), and was the learned author of P\u0101ram\u012bmah\u0101sataka, an important Pali poem on the ten P\u0101ramit\u0101s of Buddha. He was the Sa\u1e45ghar\u0101ja (hierarch) of his time, and held a great convocation of Buddhist monks in 1369 under the auspices of the minister Ni\u015b\u0101nkh\u0101 Alagakk\u014dn\u0101ra,\u00b9 and effected reforms in the Buddhist Church.\n\nThe fifth known Dhammakitti and the last of the series, succeeded his master in the office of Sa\u1e45ghar\u0101ja. He was also called Devarakkhita or Jayab\u0101hu Mah\u0101-thera, and lived in the reigns of Bhuvaneka-b\u0101hu V and Vira-b\u0101hu III (1372\u20131410).\u00b2 He was the celebrated author of about six important works, viz.: Saddhamm\u0101lank\u0101ra, Jinabodh\u0101vali, Sa\u1e45kh\u0113pa, Nik\u0101ya-sa\u1e45graha, Bal\u0101vat\u0101ra,\u00b3 and probably Gadal\u0101deni-sanna and Saddhammasa\u1e45gaha. In conjunction with his colleague Galaturum\u016bla Maitri Mah\u0101sthavira, he, further, held a synod of Buddhist monks, and by suppressing unorthodox doctrines is said to have rendered great service in the purification of the religion.\u2014Yours faithfully,\n\nDon M. de Z. Wickremasinghe.\n\n3. Mahuan\u2019s Account of Bengal.\n\n8, Christ Church Avenue, Brondesbury,\n29th November, 1895.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014It will be remembered that in my paper relating to Mahuan\u2019s account of Bengal, which appeared in the July number of this Journal, the names of the kings of that country sending embassies to China in 1409 and 1415 could not be determined with anything like certainty owing to the discrepancy of dates.\n\n\u00b9 Nik\u0101ya-sa\u1e45graha, p. 28.\n\u00b2 Ibid.\n\u00b3 Saddhamm\u0101lank\u0101ra, Brit. Mus. Or. 2277, fol. lriib.\nI stated that the king sending an embassy to China in 1409 was called in the Chinese annals Gai-ya-sz\u00fb-ting, which name seemed to fairly represent King Ghiyas-ad-din, but who did not appear to have been reigning in Bengal at that time.\n\nMr. Beveridge, with whom I had a conversation and some correspondence on the subject, informs me that Ghiyas-ad-din was living in 814 (1412), and there are coins of his up to 812 (1410).\n\nIn addition to this information kindly given me, Mr. Beveridge sent me an extract from his paper on the \"Rajah K\u00e1ns,\" which he wrote for the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, in vol. lxi, part i, No. 2, 1892, in which he fully enters into the subject concerning the time that Ghiyas-ad-din lived and reigned.\n\nIf we accept the dates given in his paper as correct, the Gai-ya-sz\u00fb-ting of the Chinese annals may with almost certainty be accepted as Ghiyas-ad-din, who was king of Bengal at the time the embassy was sent.\n\nBeing thus tolerably certain as to the name of the king sending the embassy in 1409, I again turned my attention to the embassy of 1415, to see whether the initial character given in the name of the king sending it could be read in any other way. I stated that the Chinese annals called him Kien-fuh-ting, \u5efa\u5f17\u4e01, but I am inclined to think that the name should be read Sai-fuh-ting, \u8d5b\u5f17\u4e01; the initial character Kien, \u5efa, being easily printed in error for Sai, \u8d5b.\n\nThe king of Bengal thus sending the embassy in 1415 would be, in Chinese, Sai-fuh-ting and not Kien-fuh-ting, the name given in my paper. Again quoting Mr. Beveridge, we are informed that a Sai-fud-din, the son of Ghiyas-ad-din, succeeded his father as king of Bengal in 1412. He reigned three years and four months, and consequently would be reigning in 1415, when the embassy started for China. In duly weighing the above facts, I think we are warranted in supposing that the Sai-fuh-ting of the Chinese annals is King Sai-fud-din of Bengal.\nThere is now the question, what city was the capital of Bengal from whence these embassies came? Mahuan gives no name to the capital, but simply its approximate distance from Sonarg\u00e1on. Sonarg\u00e1on in the Ming annals is also the starting-point for the capital, but the directions and distances given are misleading.\n\nIn a Chinese encyclop\u00e6dia, the Yuen-chien-lei-han, \u9047\u9451\u985e\u51fd, there is to be found a short account of Bengal, in which is given the name of the capital, and from which I quote the following:\n\n\"Sona-urh-kiang, Sonarg\u00e1on, is a walled city, where much trade is carried on; beyond which [no direction given] there is the city of Pan-tu-wa, in which the king of the country [Bengal] resides, \u518d\u884c\u81f3\u677f\u7368\u54c7\u914b\u9577\u5c45\u7109. It is a walled city and is very large. The king's palace is very extensive, and the pillars supporting it are of brass, on which are engraved figures of flowers and animals. In the throne-room there is a raised dais, inlaid with every kind of precious stone, on which the king sits crossed-leg with his sword lying across his knees. The king and all his officers are Muhammadans.\"\n\nThe characters can also be read Pan-du-wa, and in the Amoy dialect P\u2018\u00eang-du-wa.\n\nMr. Beveridge, to whom I submitted the above extract, informs me that he thinks Panduah answers to the whole of the description of the Chinese Pan-tu-wa except the distance.\n\nMr. Beames, with whom I have been also in correspondence, states that Panduah was the capital of Bengal at the time the embassies went to China, but, owing to the direction and distance from Sonarg\u00e1on given by the Chinese writers, hesitates somewhat in accepting Pan-tu-wa as representing Panduah.\n\nOn due consideration of the subject, I think it would be as well to dismiss the Chinese accounts of the direction and distance of the capital of Bengal from Sonarg\u00e1on, as faulty and contradictory, and this being done, I think we should be warranted in assuming that the Chinese Pan-tu-wa\nfairly represents the Bengal Panduah, which, according to Hunter's \"Imperial Gazetteer,\" vol. xi, page 39, was at the time the capital of that part of India of which we have been treating, viz. 1409-1415.\n\nMy best thanks are due to Dr. Codrington and Messrs. Beames and Beveridge, for the help they have afforded me in my attempts to identify the names of the kings of Bengal sending embassies to China, and also for kindly aiding me to identify the ancient Bengal capital Panduah with Pan-tu-wa of the Chinese annalists.\u2014Yours truly,\n\nGeo.

N. van der Tuuk.\n\nThe *Nederlandsche Spectator* contains an obituary notice, by Professor Kern, of Dr. H. N. van der Tuuk, in whose death we mourn the loss of the greatest Malayan scholar of this century. Born in the Dutch East Indies, and educated in Holland, he brought out, as the fruit of eight years' residence amongst the Bataks of Sumatra, a Batak dictionary and reader (the latter in four volumes), and a grammar of the Toba dialect. Subsequently he spent some time in London in cataloguing the Malay manuscripts of the East India House and the Royal Asiatic Society; and before his second return to India he brought out two Malay text-books, and several important treatises on the Lampong language and literature. Some twenty years ago he took up his residence at Buleleng, in the island of Bali, for the purpose of elaborating a Kawi-Balinese-Dutch dictionary. He had only just commenced to carry this important work through the Press when death overtook him. He was also the author of a revised edition of Von de Wall's Malay dictionary in three volumes, and contributed many valuable articles to the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, and to the Transactions of the Royal Society of Batavia and of the Asiatic Society of the Hague.\n\nDr. Trailokya Nath Mitra.\n\nDr. Trailokya Nath Mitra was born at Kounagur on the 2nd of May, 1844. His father, Babu Joy Gopal Mitra, was a clerk in a merchant's office. His was a large family, and it was not without difficulty that he managed to make both ends meet. Young Trailokya Nath grew into a vigorous, diligent, and self-reliant boy. He was first sent to Serampur to receive his rudimentary education. Subsequently he went to Utterparah, and was admitted into the local school on the 11th May, 1855. In April,\n1859, when he was practically in the Second Class, he passed the Entrance Examination of the Calcutta University. In 1860 he went up for and successfully passed the Senior Scholarship Examination, heading the list of the successful candidates. In the next year, 1861, he passed the First Examination in Arts, and stood second in order of merit. In 1863 he passed the Examination for the Degree of Bachelor of Arts, and secured the first place. In 1864 he obtained the Degree of Master of Arts, and again headed the list of the successful candidates. In 1865 he passed the Examination for the Degree of Bachelor of Law in the First Division, standing second in order of merit. In 1867 he received Honours in Law, and in 1877 the University of Calcutta conferred on him the Degree of Doctor in Law, the highest honour it can bestow.\n\nA career so brilliant could not pass without recognition. In 1864, just after he had obtained the M.A. Degree, Dr. Trailokya Nath was appointed Lecturer in Mathematics at the Presidency College. This he held till 1865, when he was appointed Law Lecturer and officiating Professor of Philosophy in the Hughli College. The Chair of Philosophy fell vacant when Mr. (now Sir Alfred) Croft went on leave, and it was no mean compliment paid to the varied learning and brilliant intellect of the young man that he was chosen to fill it. He held both these offices for about a year, when he resigned his appointment as Professor of Philosophy and joined the Bar, retaining his appointment as Law Lecturer. It is said that Mr. Atkinson, who was then Director of Public Instruction, offered him an appointment in the higher grades of the Bengal Educational Service, but Dr. Trailokya Nath chose to follow the profession of Law. And no one can doubt that his subsequent career amply justified his choice.\n\nIt was in 1867 that Dr. Trailokya Nath joined the Hughli Bar; within a year he became a prominent member, and, step by step, he rose to the very top of the ladder. He practised at Hughli for about eight years with great distinction and uniform success. We are\ninformed that it was Mr. Justice Markby who advised Dr. Trailokya Nath to try his chance in the High Court of Calcutta. Justice Markby was then at Hughli on a tour of inspection, when the forensic talents and eloquence of young Trailokya Nath made so favourable an impression upon him that he encouraged him to go and practise in the High Court. So Dr. Trailokya Nath secured a Law Lecturership in the Presidency College, and joined the High Court in 1875. His achievements in this field need not be dilated upon, but this much may be said, that his position was very high indeed, and that he was well within reach of the highest prizes which the profession can offer.\n\nDr. Trailokya Nath was made a Fellow of the Calcutta University in 1879, along with his friends Dr. Guru Das Banerjee and Dr. Rash Bihari Ghosh. He was appointed Tagore Law Lecturer in 1879, and his work on the Law relating to the Hindu Widows is a standard work on the subject. He was Chairman of the Serampur Municipality for about ten years, and greatly distinguished himself in the Municipal Board, especially in his controversy with Dr. Lidderdale about the sanitation of Serampur, in connection with which he wrote a minute which won for him the admiration of all classes, and elicited the encomium even of the *Times* newspaper. He was elected a member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland in November, 1893. Lately, on the resignation of Dr. Rash Bihari Ghosh, the Faculty of Law of the University of Calcutta elected him as their President, and he was also elected a member of the Syndicate. He was a candidate for election to the Legislative Council of Bengal, and had a very good chance of being returned; but on the 18th of April, 1895, Dr. Trailokya Nath Mitra died of fever at Bhowanipur. The universal expressions of regret which followed the announcement of his death indicate the high esteem in which he was held by all who knew him.\n\n*Jogendra Nath Sen, M.A., B.L.*\n(Vakil of the Calcutta High Court).\nIV. Notes and News.\n\nThe Buddhist J\u0101takas.\u2014Professor Fausb\u00f6ll is far advanced with vol. vi of his edition, 300 pages having been struck off. Meanwhile the Cambridge Translation is also progressing, the second volume being already in type.\n\nArabic Grammar.\u2014We hear that Professor De Goeje (Hon. M.R.A.S.) is well advanced with his new edition of Wright\u2019s Arabic Grammar, and the first volume will probably appear early this year.\n\nInscriptions in Sw\u0101t.\u2014A box full of squeezes of inscriptions discovered in Sw\u0101t during the recent expedition has been forwarded to Hofrath Dr. B\u00fchler in Vienna. They are all in characters unknown in the rest of India, but the technical execution of the engraving is the same as that of certain Sanskrit inscriptions from the same district which belong to the fifth and sixth centuries A.D.\n\nPalestine Exploration Fund.\u2014At the request of the Honorary Secretary, the Library has been supplied with a copy of the Report by the accomplished Secretary, Sir W. Besant, of \u201cThirty Years Work of this Society\u201d since its establishment. The amount of work done, or in course of being done, is wonderful. The Society has been fortunate in securing the services of a succession of most distinguished co-operators, Sir Charles Wilson, Colonel Conder, Professor Petrie, Mr. Bliss, and others: the subject is really an Asiatic one, and deserves allusion in our pages. The discovery of the so-called Hittite Inscriptions, and the Revelations of the Library of Cuneiform Tablets at Tel el-Amarna in Egypt, have aroused an interest in the subject, and it is important that the work of excavation in and around Jerusalem should be vigorously prosecuted.\n\nPurchase of the Morris MSS.\u2014The Society has not hitherto been able to purchase any MSS., not even single ones. This quarter we are glad to be able to announce\nthe purchase of a valuable collection of P\u0101li, Sinhalese, and Burmese MSS. from the executors of the late Rev. Dr. Richard Morris, the well-known P\u0101li scholar. It is a matter of great importance, in the interests of historical enquiry, that MSS. should be in the hands of such bodies as our Society, which is always ready, under proper precautions, to lend its MS. treasures to any scholar seriously engaged in original work. The following is a detailed list of the MSS. acquired by this purchase:\n\nI. P\u0101li.\n\n1. M\u016bla pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101sa of the Majjhima. 280 leaves. Sinhalese letters.\n2.

Suttanta Bhajaniya.\nNotes on Indian Literature.\n\nIn the course of cataloguing the Sanskrit MSS. of the British Museum, I have come across several points of literary interest. It may, I think, serve several useful purposes if I briefly note two of the chief of them here.\n\n1. The Sanskrit Poem Suryasataka.\n\nAt p. 555 of last year's (1894) issue of this Journal Prof. Rhys Davids called attention to this poem, under the impression that a MS. of the work, with a Sinhalese commentary, in his possession was unique in Europe. But there is a copy of both text and commentary in the British Museum (Or. 4147).\n\nIt may be seen from my Catalogue of Sanskrit Books in the British Museum that a printed edition of both text and commentary or paraphrase appeared at Colombo in 1883. Had Prof. Rhys Davids had an opportunity of reading the Sinhalese preface to that edition by the late D[on] A. de Silva [Ba\u1e6duvantud\u0101v\u0113], he would have discovered no disposition on the part of that eminent Sinhalese scholar to claim May\u016bra as a countryman; and, indeed, the references given by Aufrecht s.v. May\u016bra in his Catalogus (including quotations from him by authors who lived long before the thirteenth century) entirely preclude the proposed identification with the Sinhalese poet May\u016brap\u0101da.\n\nA few words as to the Sinhalese commentator. Prof. Rh. Davids appears to take 'Wilgam-m\u016bla' as a name; Pandit Ba\u1e6duvantud\u0101v\u0113, however, in his preface describes the commentary as composed \"by a certain chief elder of the\n\n---\n\n1 Those who may look up the subject should not fail to read Mr. FitzEdward Hall's delightful footnote on p. 8 of his Introduction to the Vassavadatta (ed. Bibl. Ind., 1859).\n2 [It should have been mentioned that in the letter the possibility of two May\u016bras was clearly referred to.\u2014Rh. D.]\n3 [Not at all. Just as Galaturu-m\u016bla is used at the end of this note as a name, so Wilgam-m\u016bla, which is an epithet of a distinguished member of the Wilgam-m\u016bla fraternity, may be rightly used as a designation without supposing it to be a family name.\u2014Rh. D.]\nVilgam-m\u016bla sect\u201d (Vilgam-m\u016bla nik\u0101yehi mahatera kenekun visin) about \u015aaka 1200, i.e. at the end of the thirteenth century A.D. The commentary, nevertheless, states that the laic name, at all events, of its author was Par\u0101kramab\u0101hu, and that he was (as Prof. Rhys Davids points out) the pupil of Galaturu-m\u016bla Mah\u0101sv\u0101mi.\n\nI find at p. 30 of the printed edition of the Nik\u0101yas\u0101ngraha that a Galaturu-m\u016bla (probably the same person) was a contemporary of the author of that work, Devarakshita Dharmak\u012brti, and was living in A.D. 1396.\n\n2. Note on Al-B\u0113r\u016bn\u012b\u2019s Indica.\n\nIn the Indica of Al-B\u0113r\u016bn\u012b (cap. lxxiv., sub fin. = p. 286 Sachau\u2019s text, or ii., 174 of his translation) occurs a citation from a Sanskrit work called Vish\u1e47u-dharma. In the course of a very elaborate review of Dr. Sachau\u2019s translation (Ind. Antiq., Nov. 1890 = vol. xix., p. 403), Dr. B\u00fchler compares the reading of a Sanskrit MS. of the Vish\u1e47u-dharma preserved at Berlin with the Arabic as rendered by Dr. Sachau. This reading is var\u1e0da, rendered by Dr. B\u00fchler \u2018myrobalans,\u2019 with the addition of a note stating that \u201cthis may possibly be the same as B\u0113r\u016bn\u012b\u2019s galangale.\u201d There can, however, be no doubt that the correct reading is that which is preserved in a Nepalese copy (saec. xv.) of the Vish\u1e47u-dharma (British Museum, Or. 2207), namely, ra\u1e0da. This agrees with the Arabic text \u0648\u0627\u062c, wajj, and I may add that two independent authorities agree in interpreting\n\n---\n\n1 Sometimes called sam\u0101gama \u2018confraternity.\u2019 See M. Dharmaratna\u2019s preface to his edition of the Abhidhammattha-sa\u1e45gha, p. 1 ad fin., where the Uttara-m\u016bla and Vilgam-m\u016bla are given as the leading sam\u0101gamas in the twelfth century A.D.\n\n2 Edited at Colombo, 1890, by my friend Don M. de Silva Wickremasinghe (Vikramasingha), whose kind assistance in the present note I have to acknowledge. It would be a most useful work if some of our friends in Ceylon (e.g. the Asiatic Society there) would undertake a translation, or at least an abstract in English, with an index showing names and chronology.\n\n3 These are Udayachandra Datta\u2019s \u201cHindu Materia Medica\u201d cited by B\u00f6htlingk, and the Arabic writer Ibn al-Baitar, who may be consulted in \u201cNotices et extraits\u201d (Bibl. Nationale, Paris, tom. xxvi., p. 403), a reference given to me by my colleague, Mr. A. G. Ellis.\nthese words by the herb called *Acorus calamus* by Linn\u00e6us. This appears to grow both in Europe and Asia, and to be sometimes known here as the 'sweet-flag.' Al-B\u0113r\u016bn\u012b no doubt belongs to the very first rank of Oriental writers, and it seemed worth while to save his credit, even in a small detail. I reserve some minor particulars as to the second MS. cited.\n\nCecil Bendall.\n\n**Asiatic Philology.**\n\nI. Mr. Lewis Rice, Director of Archaeological Researches in Mysore, has published a volume of *Epigraphia Carnataca*, or inscriptions in the kingdom of Mysore. The date of the eighth century A.D. is postulated as that of the earliest, and there is a continuous series down to the present time. The inscriptions are exhibited both in the original written character of the Karnata or Canarese, and in the Roman, with an English translation. There are other architectural plates: this volume is only the forerunner of many to follow: historical results of importance may be anticipated. We hope to have a full review in a subsequent number.\n\nII. Maspero's Chald\u00e6a. In his important volume on the \"Dawn of Civilization\" Prof. Maspero treats at great length upon Egypt, his peculiar Province, but his three chapters on Chald\u00e6a are of extreme importance: allusion to them was omitted in the late Review of this book in our Journal, which treated exclusively on Egypt, but the Summary of the history of Chald\u00e6a should not be lost sight of.\n\nIII. The Dutch Bible Society have published a translation of the Gospel of Luke in the language spoken in the Island of Rotti, in the Malay Archipelago: it belongs to the Malayan Family of Languages, and is an addition to our knowledge contributed by a Missionary.\n\nIV. Mr. E. B. Michell, legal adviser to the Siamese Government, has printed and published at Bangkok, in 1892, a Siamese-English Dictionary.\nAfrican Philology.\n\nA Nyanja-English Vocabulary has been published by the S.P.C.K. for the Mission at Likoma, on Lake Nyasa: it is the Vernacular of the inhabitants of the Island.\n\nSeven years ago Mr. Holman Bentley, of the Baptist Mission on the Kongo, published a Dictionary and Grammar of first-rate excellence of the great language spoken in that Region, and known by the name of the Great River. It was an admirable book, and marked an epoch in our knowledge of West African languages South of the Equator. A special interest was attached to it, as the wife of the Missionary, a most competent scholar, had largely contributed to the work. Other books have followed, and translations of the Bible, and a bi-monthly Magazine in the Vernacular, have been started: it has taken about ten years to make an intellectual stride in West Africa, which it took one thousand years in Europe. The necessity of an appendix both to the Dictionary and the Grammar of this exceedingly luxuriant language was soon felt. New ideas had to be represented by newly developed words without foreign loan words; knotty points of grammatical construction had to be solved: the tongues of men, women, and children had been let loose in the School, the Mission Hall, and the Village; and it is the art of a true linguist to catch words alive, as they issue from the lips of unconscious barbarians. Mr. Bentley has now published in London an appendix of 4,000 words in addition to the previous 10,000: the Roman alphabet is adapted to suit new sounds. A young native, named Niemvo, materially contributed to the work of compilation and translation, and exhibited great aptitude and intelligence. The great Bantu race are born orators, and have in them the stuff, which Education will develop into Culture and Civilization.\n\nHerr A. Seidel has published at Vienna, Pest, and Leipzig (Hartleben's Verlag) practical Grammars of three South African languages.\n(1) The Nama, a Hottentot language of Nam\u00e1qualand, South Africa.\n(2) Herer\u00f3, a Bantu language, South-west Africa.\n(3) Ndonga, a Bantu language, South-west Africa.\n\nThey are in the German language, accompanied by reading Selections and Vocabularies.\n\nThe same accomplished and indefatigable scholar has issued two additional parts of his useful Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Africanische und Oceanische Sprachen at Berlin in the German language.\n\nPart III contains:\n\n(1) A Vocabulary of the Tikuu (a new language) and the Pok\u00f3mo, both Bantu, in E. Equatorial Africa. By F. Wurtz (German).\n(2) A Grammatical Note of the Chagga language, Bantu, in E. Equatorial Africa. By A. Seidel (German).\n(3) A Beast Story of the Bondei tribe, Bantu, in E. Equatorial Africa. By A. Seidel (German).\n(4) Tales in the language of Ki-lim\u00e1ni, in Portuguese East Africa. By P\u00e8re Torrend, S.J. (French).\n(5) The place of the Temne language, in the Bantu Family. By Dr. G. A. Krause (German). This language is spoken by a tribe on the West Coast of Africa, North of the Equator, within the Negro Region, and up to this time considered to belong to the Negro Language Group. In my \"Modern Languages of Africa,\" 1883, I grouped it as Negro on the best information then available: it is supplied with considerable literature by a most competent scholar, Schlenker. Dr. Krause has been led, by a searching inquiry into certain features of this language, to start the theory that it belongs to the Bantu languages, South of the Equator: the question is a most interesting one, and must be left to time to decide.\n(6) Preliminary observations to a comparative Vocabulary of the Bantu Family of Languages. By Carl Meinhof (German).\n\nPart IV contains:\n\n(1) Continuation of the Vocabulary of Tikuu and Pok\u00f3mo in Part III (German).\n(2) On the mode of forming adverbs in Mbundu or Bunda, a Bantu language on the West Coast of Africa, South of the Equator. By Heli Chatelain (German).\n(3) Remarks on the Bali, a Bantu language, in the Kamer\u00fan Region, West Africa, North of the Equator. By E. Zintgraff (German).\n(4) Songs in the Pok\u00f3mo, a Bantu language, E. Equatorial Africa. By F. Wurtz (German).\n(5) An obituary notice of B\u00fcttner, an unwearied contributor to the study of African languages. By Carl Meinhof (German).\n(6) The Fada language on the River Geba, in Portuguese West Africa, a Bantu language. By Dr. G. A. Krause (German).\n\nOceanic Philology.\n\nZeitschrift f\u00fcr Africanische und Oceanische Sprachen, Part iii, No. 6.\n\nTexts of the languages of the Bismarck Archipelago, Oceania, with translations by Sidney Ray (English). This is a most important contribution to our knowledge, in an entirely new field, by an industrious and promising scholar.\n\nTranslation of the Bible into New Languages of Asia, Africa, and Oceania in 1894.\n\nA. Asia.\n\nI. In the Dehra D\u00fan, North-west Provinces of British India, the language of Gurw\u00e1li or Tiri is spoken by a rural population, and a Gospel has been translated into it and published by the British and Foreign Bible Society.\nII. In the same locality there is a language, called Jauns\u00e1ri, which has also been honoured by becoming the vehicle of communicating the Gospel to an Indian tribe.\n\nIn both these cases there has been a distinct addition to our linguistic knowledge. Whether these two languages will retain their position in collision with the lordly Hindi remains to be seen.\n\nB. Africa.\n\nA tribe exists on both banks of the great River Kongo in Equatorial Africa, not far from the confluence of the River Kasai: their name is Bangi; they have a distinct language, and a Gospel has been translated into it.\n\nC. Oceania.\n\nI. The Dobu are a tribe in British New Guinea, and their language has been studied, and the translation of a Gospel made.\n\nII. The same may be said of the Panai\u00e9ti, also in New Guinea.\n\nThese facts may seem small and unimportant, but they indicate that annually fresh languages are being discovered: the translations are, at any rate, genuine, and furnish material for skilled Grammarians to find out new phenomena of linguistic variety in word-store and structure.\n\nR. N. C.\n\nV. Notices of Books.\n\nLes M\u00e9moires Historiques de Semats'ien, traduits et annot\u00e9s par E. Chavannes. Paris: Leroux.\n\nWe cannot but admire the energy and ability with which this stupendous work has been accomplished, and it is wonderful that we have not long ago had some sinologist eager to translate the book of one who has been called the Herodotus of China, and whose Records really form the\nmain source of our knowledge of the early history of that country. These Records, dating from primeval and mythical times, are the model on which subsequent dynastic histories have been compiled. M. Chavannes prefaces his labour with a long introduction in five chapters. In the first of these we have short biographies of the two Ss\u016dmas, father and son, and an attempt is made to determine the respective shares taken by each in the writing of the Records, the translator basing his judgment on the supposed difference of their religious opinions. He says that Ss\u016dma Ch'ien was undoubtedly a Confucianist, as he gives the sage a place of honour in a part of his work reserved for the biographies of great men, and refers to the enthusiastic manner in which the historian recounts a visit he paid to the temple of Confucius; while he remarks that any traces of Taoism found in the Records must be assigned to the influence of Ss\u016dma Tan alone. He admits, however, that in this opinion he is opposed to the views of San Piao, father of the author of the History of the Former Han Dynasty, who, living about 120 years after Ss\u016dma Ch'ien, reproaches him for 'specially revering Huangti and Laotz\u016d and speaking lightly of the five canonical books.' The phrase here referred to is doubtless Huang-lao, literally 'Yellow ancient,' which occurs so often in the Historical Records. If, as I believe, this expression simply refers not to Taoism but Buddhism, it cannot of course be admitted, as M. Chavannes says in the second chapter of his introduction, that there is no passage in the Historical Records which alludes to the latter religion. The author is speaking of the capture by the Chinese general Ho Ch\u00fc-ping, in the year 121 B.C., of a 'golden man' from a tribe of Hsiung-nu near the present Liangchow, in the Kansu province. The Chinese commentators on this passage think that this must have been a Buddhist image, but M. Chavannes ridicules the idea of Buddhism having penetrated into China so early as the end of the second century B.C., and believes that the image must have been that of one of the ancestors of the King of Hsiuchu. Now on referring to the biography of Ho\nCh\u00fc-ping, as recounted in the History of the Former Hans, we find the image referred to as the 'Hsiuchu's Heaven-worshipping golden man,' and it is more than likely it was carried into the battle as a sort of talisman. Some nine years ago I pointed out in the pages of the China Review that Buddhism seems to have found its way into China as early as 221 B.C., when the 'First Emperor' cast bronze images after seeing similar figures at Lintao in South-west Kansu. The late Dr. Lacouperie refers to a story in the T'ai-ping-y\u00fc-lan (\"Origin of Chinese Civilization,\" p. 2086) to the effect that this emperor conversed with some persons, professing Hindu views on the beginnings and transformations of the universe, who had come to Lintao by river from North-west Szuch'uan, where recluses had for years been established in caves, and thinks that there is a connection between the two stories. In B.C. 219 Buddhist priests were certainly seen by the same emperor at Puhai, near Laichoufu; and considering how actively the Buddhists spread their tenets in all directions, it cannot be a matter of surprise that the faith was fairly well known in China 100 years later. The sources of the Records, the method of compilation, and the interpolations and criticisms are gone into fully in later chapters of the Introduction. When half through the volume we reach the text of the translation, which it must be admitted is very carefully worked out. On p. 133 M. Chavannes observes in a note that the pond of Tuyeh, although referred to in the time of the Hsia dynasty, could not have been known to the Chinese until the year 115 B.C., so he forthwith marks the passage as an interpolation by some one in the reign of the Emperor Wu, then living. There are plenty of other anachronisms, and we may conclude that the only solution of the difficulties is this\u2014that the whole history was forged after the year 115 B.C. M. Chavannes notices that the historian does not mention the famous eclipse of the sun said to have occurred in 776 B.C., which is thought by some to be the first authentic date in Chinese history.\n\nHerbert J. Allen.\nPriority of the Ved\u0101nta S\u016btra over the Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101. By Prof. T. R. Amalnerkar. Bombay, 1895.\n\nThe author takes one by one the reasons adduced by the late Mr. Justice Telang for considering the G\u012bt\u0101 the older of these two works, and maintains that not only are they not convincing, but, in fact, are only reconcileable with the contrary hypothesis. A question of this kind cannot be properly discussed on the basis of one or two isolated passages without due regard being paid to the general tone of the whole of the works in question, and the Professor very properly points out that the principal questions raised in the Brahma S\u016btra have ceased to interest the author of the G\u012bt\u0101, who is concerned, on the contrary, with quite other matters belonging to a later stratum of thought. The whole argument is well thought out, and time will probably show that the author of this interesting brochure is in the right.\n\nA Practical Hindustani Grammar. In Two Volumes. Compiled by Lieut.-Col. A. O. Green. Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1895.\n\nBy the courtesy of the manager of the Clarendon Press a copy of this new grammar, prepared on a new system, has been forwarded to the Library of the Royal Asiatic Society, and it is with great pleasure that notice is now taken of it in our periodical Reports. The language is well known to all Anglo-Indians, as it is the lingua franca of the whole of India, and the special vernacular of the Northern Provinces: it is a beautiful and highly refined form of speech, having incorporated with the Hindi, which is its linguistic base, vast loans of words, sentences, and inflections from the Persian and Arabic: its other name is \"Urdu,\" or the Camp-language of the Mahometan invaders of India from the Regions West of the Indus.\n\nCol. Green was interpreter to the Bengal Sappers and Miners at Rurki, and, as far back as the year 1875, formed a desire to write a grammar of this language, which was\nhis ordinary official vernacular, based upon the lines of such works as Otto's German, French, and Latin Grammars. For the convenience of the learner the book is divided into two parts. Part I contains a concise Grammar, the rules being illustrated by copious exercises, to which are appended a well-known vernacular Romance to be used as a Reader, and a selection of lithographed Manuscripts on various subjects. These are printed in the well-known Semitic Arabic written character, with additional symbols to represent the peculiar sounds of an Aryan language. In an appendix the author adds a few remarks on the N\u0101gari or Indian square written character, which is also used to record the literature of this language.\n\nPart II contains a key to the exercises and stories in Part I: these translations are not only printed in the Arabic character in the regular form adopted by the Press, but lithographed in a written series of gradually increasing difficulty to accustom the beginner to the handwriting of native letter-writers. A free translation into English is also given of the Romance above alluded to in Part I, and the other Hindi selections, and the handwriting is both transliterated and translated.\n\nThe type and style of this work reflect the greatest credit upon the Clarendon Press: it is a pleasure to a proficient in the Hindustani to read it. It is impossible to predict whether this elaborate handbook of the Language will supersede its predecessors: experience alone can decide this point: under any circumstances this is a most praiseworthy and creditable performance of one who knows the language, which he treats scientifically and thoroughly.\n\nR. N. C.\n\nThe Budh Gay\u0101 Temple Case.\n\nMessrs. Newman and Co., of the Caxton Press, Calcutta, have published a complete report of this now celebrated case in a substantial volume of close upon 300 printed\npages of foolscap size. The report includes the proceedings and judgments in all the courts, with all the correspondence and legal documents referred to in the course of the action. As will be in the memory of our readers, the case was not a civil one to claim the possession of this ancient Buddhist building for the Buddhists, but a criminal one against the Hindu Mahant who has taken possession of the building for the purpose of violently interrupting Buddhist worship. The action was brought under a clause of the Indian Act directed against the forcible interruption of any established religious service, and in the result it was held that the particular occasion in question did not come under the terms of the Act.\n\nDie Abessinier in Arabien und Afrika auf Grund neuentdeckter Inschriften, von Dr. Eduard Glaser. 8vo. pp. 210. Franz: M\u00fcnchen, 1895.\n\nThis book forms a very welcome supplement to Dr. Glaser's previous researches on the early history of Arabia. It is full of startling discoveries and ingenious theories, throwing light on ancient cultures hitherto shrouded in mist. Dr. Glaser's aim is to demonstrate that the original home of the \u00c6thiopians, or Habasat, is not Africa, but Asia, and especially that part of Arabia which is now called Ma\u1e25ra. Apart from the material gathered from classical authors, as Herodotus, Eratosthenes, the Author of the \"Periplus,\" and others, the demonstration is mainly built on the incense-producing character of this territory. The derivation of the name of the \u00c6thiopians from a Sabean plural, aty\u016bb\u00b9 (pronounced aty\u014db P), is uncommonly\n\n\u00b9 This form is not to be confounded with the \u00c6thiopic plur. fract. aqt\u0101l, which, according to Dillmann (Gramm. d. \u00c6th. Spr., p. 241), is a development from Arab. \u0646\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0644\u064f, but in Sabean it seems to correspond with Arab. \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064c. cp. \u0623\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064f \u0623\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064c, ZDMG. xlvi, 537. Perhaps the \u00c6thiopic aqt\u0101l is also nothing but a differentiation from aqt\u0101l.\nconvincing. As to \u1e24aba\u0161at, Glaser very properly thinks of Arab. \u062d\u0628\u0634 \u2018to gather.\u2019 Now the existence of a kingdom of the \u1e24aba\u0161at, Glaser argues, cannot be disputed, as it is mentioned in several Sab\u00e6an inscriptions, in particular in the \u201cTreaty Inscription\u201d (Glaser, 1076), which cannot have been composed later than 100\u201350 B.C., but probably earlier. Axum mentioned in the \u201cPeriplus\u201d was then too insignificant to figure as an independent power in that treaty, and therefore the country of the \u1e24aba\u0161at is not to be sought for in Africa, but in South Arabia, east of Hadhram\u014dth. To make this evidence all the more striking, Glaser identifies \u1e24aba\u0161at not only with the \u1e24bsti of the old Egyptians (for Pwent) but also with Abasa of Pausanias and Uranius\u2014who likewise place it next to \u1e24adhram\u014dth\u2014and the Abissa of Ptolemy. This Arabic kingdom of \u1e24aba\u0161at must have ceased to exist at the time of the author of the \u201cPeriplus\u201d (i.e. in the second half of the first century of the present era), and was probably absorbed by \u1e24adhram\u014dth. Now in the Greek text of the bilingual Axum inscription of King Aizanas \u1f08\u1f30\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c0\u03af\u03b1 is mentioned as one of his dominions, which in the parallel \u1f08\u1f30\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2 text (written in Sab\u00e6an characters) is rendered by \u1e24aba\u0161at. It is greatly to Dr. Glaser\u2019s credit that in one of his previous writings (\u201cSkizzen der Geschichte Arabiens,\u201d p. 36) he already suggested that identity before the \u1f08\u1f30\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2 text\u2014of which the first squeeze was brought to Europe only a short time ago\u2014was known. From all these items Dr. Glaser concludes that the \u1e24aba\u0161at, beginning with those designated in the above-mentioned \u1e24bsti, was the general name employed for the incense-producing countries as early as the second pre-Christian millenium. About this period large immigrations took place from Arabia into Abessinia. The possible objection that it may have been the reverse, Glaser justly meets with the counter evidence that there is no proof in favour of it, whilst everything advocates the movement towards Africa. The question is, of course, in close connection with that other and more complicated one respecting the wanderings of\nthe Semitic tribes. The great plausibility of Glaser's arguments has undoubtedly brought the solution of this question somewhat nearer. His book, although anything but bulky, is full of other interesting details, among which are explanations of inscriptions from which he draws his conclusions, and of the Greek names of places mentioned in the Adulis inscription. In these matters, however, the final word still remains to be spoken. That Glaser also took the opportunity of touching upon the famous Minaean question is not surprising, and his remarks certainly tend to strengthen his theory. The diction is attractive, though sometimes rather polemical. An excellent index is appended.\n\nH. HIRSCHFELD.\n\nTHE RULING RACES OF PREHISTORIC TIMES IN INDIA, SOUTH-WESTERN ASIA, AND SOUTHERN EUROPE. By J. F. HEWITT, late Commissioner at Chota Nagpore. Vol. I, 1894. Vol. II, 1895. Westminster: Archibald Constable and Company.\n\nThe first of these two remarkable volumes is composed of a preface and six essays, and the second volume is made up of a preface and three essays. Each volume is furnished with an excellent and very useful index.\n\nThe object of the essays in the first volume is, in the author's words, \"to help those who, like myself, are trying to trace the paths worn by the ruling races of the world through the tangled jungles of past times, and thus to learn the real history of the childhood of humanity during the ages when national life began its troubled journey towards its ultimate and, as yet, unseen goal. They call especial attention to the chronological data supplied by social laws and customs, mythic history and ritual; and prove that these, when studied, provide guiding marks from which we can deduce, even in ages which have been hitherto called prehistoric, the order in which leading epochs of civilization succeeded one another.\"\nThe first is somewhat of an introductory character, and tells how the author was led to begin the inquiries which have resulted in these volumes. In it we find a good deal about St. George showing his development from a rain-god, and also about the Cross.\n\nEssay ii treats of \"The primitive village, its origin, growth into the province, the city, and the State, and its methods of record.\"\n\nThe third essay is devoted to \"The early history of India, South-western Asia, Egypt, and Southern Europe, as taught by that of the worship of the Hindu Soma, the Zend Haoma, the Assyrian Istar, and the Egyptian Isis.\" This is a long and learned, though rather confused, disquisition. In it the author claims to \"have traced the history of the worship of the goddess Istar and of the god Soma, and have shown that both derived their origin from the worship of the two earth-mothers, the mother-grove of the Indian village communities and the mother-mountain of the Northern races, and of the thunder- and storm-god as a father-god, the husband of the land.\" He also shows that \"the history of the evolution of religion, culminating in Soma worship, discloses its absorption into a form of ascetic doctrine, in which the desire for personal holiness characterizing Semitic belief in the fatherhood of the God of Righteousness predominated.\"\n\nThe fourth essay treats of \"Astronomical myths, showing, on the evidence of early Akkadian astronomy, how the Hittites, Kushites, and Kushite-Semites measured the year.\"\n\nEssay v is entitled \"The history of the rule of the Kushite-Semite races as told in the early forms of the Soma festival and the worship of the Sun-god R\u0101.\"\n\nThe sixth essay, which is a very interesting and ingenious one, is headed, \"The first coming of the fire-worshipping Heracleidae to Greece, their conquest of the Dorians and Semites, and their victorious return as worshippers of the Sun-god.\"\n\nIn the second volume we have Essay vii, which treats of \"The astronomy of the Veda, and its historical lessons.\"\nThe author shows how the \"Indian conception of history as the records of events in the cycle year of destiny\" is repeated in Buddhist history and theology.\n\nEssays viii and ix deal respectively with history as told in the mythology of the Northern races and with the \"History of the worship of Ja or Yah, the all-wise Fish-sun-god, as told in the mythology of the American Indians,\" etc.\n\nFrom this short summary of the contents of this treatise it may be seen that the author has taken a wide and comprehensive view of the origins or foundations of historical civilization. In the mythologies handed down from primitive tribes he sees history, and he has endeavoured to ascertain and show what were the facts embodied in the mythologies. The two volumes contain a vast amount of curious learning and ingenious conjecture. But facts, deductions, and conjectures seem to be all inextricably confused at times, and occasionally whole paragraphs are bewildering from this mixing up of things which should have been kept apart. The author seems to go too far, with regard to the present state of knowledge, in the identifications which he makes in the matter of objects of worship in widely separated lands, and in the derivation of religious and cosmic theories. The treatise is the work of a great reader, a man with wide sympathies and active imagination, and many of the analogies pointed out by him are suggestive and curious. But the method of argument takes so much for granted that it is very difficult for the specialist in any one of the many fields he touches to follow it, and of course the book is not meant for anyone not a specialist.\n\nT. W.\n\nThe Mogul Emperors of Hindustan, 1398\u20131707. By Edward S. Holden, LL.D. 8vo. London, 1895.\n\nDr. Holden has succeeded in writing a very pleasant book, having used his materials with great skill and effect. The first paragraph of the introductory note was, it must\nbe confessed, a little disconcerting: for, what could we look for from a man who, having accidentally acquired a few miniatures of Mogul emperors, casts about for books to tell him something of their history, and lays the result before the public within the twelvemonth (pp. v and xiii)? After that, to find the book so good was an agreeable surprise. It would, at the same time, be affectation to pretend, in this Journal, that Dr. Holden's pages contain any information not known before to every student of the period. Still, his production is an excellent effort at what the French call vulgarisation; and it is the more remarkable for the fact, rare in my experience of such works, that there is hardly a statement to which a specialist could take serious exception.\n\nWhether a Shahjah\u0101n-n\u0101mah (p. ix) could include portraits \"by contemporary artists\" of B\u0101bar, Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and Akbar, is a little doubtful, unless interpreted as meaning \"copies\" of such work. I fully agree with Dr. Holden (p. xi) that we may have confidence in the authenticity of Indian portraits. They were not purely fictitious, like those of the early kings of Scotland at Holyrood. They are true to life, so far as the artist's skill could carry him, and the originals have been most faithfully copied ever since. I rest this opinion upon the researches in India of Mr. A. Constable, who put himself in direct communication with still-living painters, to whom these originals have been transmitted from generation to generation. Mr. A. Constable is one of the three or four Europeans who have any intimate acquaintance with this branch of Indian art. It is one which, from its great interest, would well reward anyone who went into it thoroughly.\n\nOn p. 98 Dr. Holden asserts by implication that the cruel removal of all heirs to the crown, so common throughout the Mogul period, sprang from the Hindu, and not from the Turk\u012b blood of the reigning house. Here, I think, he might reverse the position. If he will read again B\u0101bar's Memoirs or the book of B\u0101bar's cousin, Mirz\u0101 Haidar, the T\u0101rikh-i-Rash\u012bd\u012b, I think he will confess\nthat to Central Asia, with its confused, never-ending struggles for lordship over its petty states, and not to India, were due the frequently repeated and finally disastrous contests among competitors for the throne. Hindus have long been, and are to this day, strong, even bigoted, upholders of hereditary right; and in the succession to their states, large and small, they observe the rule of primogeniture, tempered by the grant of appanages or fiefs to the younger sons.\n\nBeing for the nonce a critic, \"I am nothing if not critical,\" and would therefore suggest (p. 104) that Sind is not \"the province just south of K\u0101bul.\" South of K\u0101bul we may call it, roughly speaking, but just south it is not, there being the intervening province of Qandah\u0101r. Again, \"the successive raids, sieges, captures, flights\"\u2014did they cease four centuries ago, when the Moguls were permanently established in India (p. 111)? Did they not rather continue as before, until the subversion of the dynasty early in this century? William Erskine's work, quoted on p. 125, is not a Life, but \"A History of India under the two first Sovereigns of the House of Taimur\u2014Baber and Humayun\": see therein the passage quoted, ii, 530. Of '\u0100lamg\u012br a much more characteristic portrait than that opposite p. 309 might have been given: I refer to one in British Museum, Add. MSS., No. 18,802 (Rieu, 783), which shows that emperor as a decrepit, bowed old man, just as Gemelli Careri saw him, clad all in white.\n\nDr. Holden remarks (p. 165) that the Turk\u012b language was known at the Indian Court as late as Jah\u0101ng\u012br (1605\u201327); but I think the period of such use might be extended safely to 1719, and possibly for forty years later. The harems were guarded by Qalm\u0101q women, supplies of them being one of the most valued parts of the presents sent down from time to time by the various rulers of the Central Asian Khanates. These women were, no doubt, the source from which the knowledge of the language was maintained. There is direct evidence that in 1719, on an important occasion, one of the nobles, a native of Samarqand,\ncommunicated with the emperor, Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h, in Turki, a language not understood by the Hindustani nobles.\n\nI would remind Dr. Holden that the Mogul Empire did not end with 1707; there were at least nine emperors after that date, of whom authentic portraits could easily be produced. Of one, Sh\u0101h \u0100lam II, there is a personal description and character by an easily accessible European writer, Alexander Dow\u2014\"History of Hindostan,\" ii, 497, edition of 1803\u2014who gives also (at the end of vol. iii) portraits of five of these later sovereigns. We may now hope that Dr. Holden, having once nibbled at the subject, will be tempted to devote further time and research to it, and provide us hereafter with a much-needed monograph on the history of figure-painting in Persia and India, its origin, the names, dates, and abodes of the chief artists, and a critical list of their productions, so far as known to us. As Dr. Holden points out (p. 68), pictures are prohibited by Mu\u1e25ammad, and to trace out the origin of this discrepancy between precept and practice would be one of the not least piquant parts of a fascinating subject.\n\nBefore concluding I must say a word or two in praise of Sir W. W. Hunter's chapter, \"The Ruin of Aurangzeb.\" I admired it when I read it long ago in some magazine; it is full of felicitous phrases, and I have never forgotten the true though epigrammatic contrast (p. 319) between \"the ruddy men in boots\" from Central Asia and their degenerate descendants, the \"pale men in petticoats.\" It is probable that I hold different views from those of Sir William Hunter as to the amount of underground, or preparatory, work required before writing anything satisfactory in the way of Indian (Mahomedan) history; but setting that on one side, no more admirable use of the readily available materials could be wished than we find in this short essay, where, as so seldom happens, the known facts are stated with complete accuracy, even if it be only in outline.\n\nAs Dr. Holden has found in America a liberal publisher,\nwho has brought out his book in such tasteful and becoming form, we trust that he will be encouraged to go into the subject more deeply, and treat in greater detail the question of Indian portraiture.\n\nWILLIAM IRVINE.\n\nThe D\u012bn\u0101-\u012b M\u0101\u012bn\u016b-\u012b Khrat, or the Religious Decisions of the Spirit of Wisdom. The Pahlavi text, edited by Darab Dastur Peshotan Sanjana, B.A. Bombay, 1895.\n\nThis first complete edition of the Pahlavi Min\u016b-khirad, as it is called in Persian, has been prepared chiefly for the use of Pahlavi students at the Bombay University, where Avesta and Pahlavi have recently been added to the list of classical languages prescribed for the B.A. and M.A. examinations.\n\nWhen the complete transliterated P\u0101zand-Sanskrit text was published, with an English translation and glossary, in 1871, from the best existing copies of the versions prepared by Neryosang about the end of the twelfth century, there was no copy of the original Pahlavi text accessible. The few Pahlavi MSS. of the Min\u016b-khirad then existing in India were evidently only reproductions from Neryosang's P\u0101zand version. But Westergaard, in 1843, had brought a manuscript of miscellaneous texts from Persia, one of which was an incomplete copy of the Pahlavi Min\u016b-khirad written in 1569; and a facsimile of this text was published by Andreas in 1882. This Pahlavi version had been copied from an original which had already lost its first folio, and ten other folios of the copy had also disappeared. Its colophon states that it was derived, through two intermediate copies, from a manuscript in India. As this Pahlavi text, though agreeing very closely with Neryosang's P\u0101zand, supplies several small corrections of his manifest errors, and one or two short passages which he omits, there can be little doubt that it is derived from the\nsame original as his P\u0101zand version. The contents of the ten missing folios have been recovered from a Bombay copy of another Iranian MS. which belongs to Ervad Tehmuras, while the text of the first lost folio has been transcribed from the P\u0101zand version.\n\nThe Min\u016b-khirad professes to be a selection from the wisdom of the Mazda-worshipping religion, prepared by a wise enquirer who had wandered from place to place in search of wisdom and truth. In response to his prayers, the Spirit of Wisdom presented itself and offered to be his guide and preceptor. The sage then propounds a series of 62 questions, or groups of questions, on religious and mythological subjects, which the Spirit of Wisdom duly answers. But, as the series terminates abruptly and without any peroration, it is doubtful if the work be complete.\n\nAs to the age of this treatise, we have seen that both the Iranian and Indian copies can, as yet, be traced back only to some Indian MS. of the twelfth century. But the work itself is decidedly Iranian in character, though the internal evidences of age are slight and admit of much difference of opinion. The allusion, in i, 18, to an evil religion which does harm to that of the Yazads, and the praise of wine, when drunk in moderation, in xvi, 25-29, 36-48, might be considered as referring to Muhammadan practices and prohibitions; but the descriptions of good and bad government, in xv, 16-39, do not specially allude to any foreign domination. Perhaps the period A.D. 550-625 is that most clearly indicated by the contents of the treatise, but the indications are scanty and readily misunderstood. The conflicts of the Arumans and Turanians with the Iranians, alluded to in xxi, 23-26, have been much too frequent to afford a safe clue to any definite period for their occurrence.\n\nThe Pahlavi text has been carefully edited, and the book is dedicated to the memory of the editor's learned great-grandfather, Dasturan-Dastur Edalji Darabji Sanjana, Parsi High Priest of Bombay from 1830 to 1847, whose portrait and pedigree are given, as well as a metrical account of his\nlife in Gujar\u0101ti, which is an abridged second edition of the Cher\u0101ge D\u0101nesh, or Lamp of Learning, originally published in 1854.\n\nE.

PARIS, 1895.\n\nThis pamphlet is reprinted from the \"Centenaire de l'\u00c9cole des langues orientales vivantes.\" The Fragments are a supplement to M. Cordier's \"Notes pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire des \u00e9tudes chinoises en Europe, jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de Fourmont l'a\u00een\u00e9,\" published in the Nouveaux M\u00e9langes Orientaux in 1886. Together with these Notes, moreover, the Fragments are part of the \"Histoire des \u00e9tudes chinoises en Europe,\" on which the author has been engaged for several years.\n\nAmong the writers on Chinese matters in the eighteenth century were Fourmont and the missionaries Premare and Gaubil. The mention of the missionaries leads M. Cordier to take a short survey of the early history of the French missionaries at Peking. One of these, P. Noel (born 1651, died 1729), translated into Latin the Four Books, the Small Learning, and the canonical treatise on Filial Piety. P. Noel was also the author of works on the mathematical and physical theories of the Chinese, and of an important treatise on the Chinese knowledge of God, the ceremonies observed to the dead, and the ethics of the Chinese.\n\nOf the amateur sinologists of Europe in the first half of the eighteenth century we have Masson and Vandermonde, the former an eccentric theologian who affiliated Chinese to Hebrew. Then we come to Fourmont, the one positively mean and wicked man among past sinologists. M. Cordier tells the story of Fourmont's meanness towards Premare, the missionary well known by his Notitia Linguae Sinicae. We have notices also of the works of Daniel Webb and John Webb in England. The latter, in 1639, published\nhis Essay in which he endeavours to show that Chinese is the primitive language of man. The former, in 1787, published a short treatise in which he gives reasons for thinking that the Greek language was borrowed from the Chinese.\n\nIn China P. Parennin laboured at two dictionaries of the language which still slumber in MS. M. Cordier gives also bibliographical notices of the Chinese dictionaries of P. d\u2019Incarville and P. de la Charme, and of the works of P. de Ventavon.\n\nThe great De Guignes, father and son, and the distinguished missionaries Gaubil, Amiot, and Cibot, are reserved for a future opportunity, and the pamphlet closes with a short notice of Deshauterayes. This last, who died in 1795, wrote against De Guignes\u2019 theory of the Egyptian origin of the Chinese, and he also translated the \u201cSpring and Autumn\u201d of Confucius.\n\nThe present pamphlet, like the other bibliographical works of M. Cordier, gives dates and authorities in a careful, precise manner. The information contained in it may be of an antiquarian rather than a practical value, but it will always be interesting to the student of the Jesuit missionaries in China and to the workers on the Chinese language and literature. The career of the villain of the Fragments is exceedingly instructive, and shows how a bad man may have good teachers and good disciples.\n\nT. W.\n\nDie Chinesische Sprache zu Nanking. Von Dr. Fr.

The author has lived in China at Peking and Nanking, and he has been told by the Chinese Secretary of the Belgian Legation at Peking that he speaks Chinese like a Chinaman.\nThe Secretary has probably made a similar statement to every foreigner who has tried to speak Chinese to him!\n\nDr. K\u00fchnert in this pamphlet uses a transcription of his own for the Chinese sounds, and it is one which cannot be recommended. It is not good in itself, and the use of it would make the comparison of sounds impossible.\n\nThe author gives a number of terms and phrases to illustrate Chinese as spoken at Nanking. But many of these seem to be the ordinary Mandarin used by those who talk that language in any part of China. At p. 37 we find an expression which we are told means, \"Whence come you, sir, and whither go you?\" This is shortened down, the author says, to Hsien-sheng-ch\u00fc-lai-a (\u5148\u751f\u53bb\u4f86\u53e3\u963f), which he says means, \"Sir, whither whence?\" But as I have heard this question asked, it was used in the sense of, \"Sir, from going whither are you come?\"\u2014that is, Where have you been to, sir? But should not the word na-li be inserted?\n\nDr. K\u00fchnert has some remarks on the tones of the words and the rhythm of the sentences in Chinese. These remarks, however, are of little use to the student of the language, for, as the learned author would admit, the proper and practical use of tones and rhythm can be learned only by hearing the natives and imitating them.\n\nThe two Tables give a syllabary of the sounds of Nanking Chinese expressed in the author's peculiar manner. There is a third Table at p. 18, which gives all the syllables in the author's transcription with the characters and Mr. Mateer's transcription.\n\nT. W.\n\nDie Philosophie des Kong-Dsy (Confucius) auf Grund des Urtextes. Ein Beitrag zur Revision der bisherigen Auffassungen. Von Dr. Fr. K\u00fchnert, Privatdocent an der Universit\u00e4t in Wien. Wien, 1895.\n\nThis pamphlet\u2014like the one noticed above, by the same author\u2014is an extract from the Proceedings of the Imperial\nAcademy of Sciences of Vienna. The author thinks that a revision of our translations of the Confucian classics is justified and required. These venerable old books should be interpreted according to reason and the authorized use and construction of Chinese words and phrases. In his present contribution to the work of revision Dr. K\u00fchnert confines himself to the Ta Hsio or Great Learning.\n\nThe transcription of Chinese characters which the author uses is his own, and it cannot be recommended. Thus, we have \"Kong-dey\" for K'ung-tz\u00fc, although the Nanking pronunciation of the character for the first syllable is given by Dr. K\u00fchnert as K'eng and by Mr. Mateer as K'ong. The title of the Chinese work he gives as \"d\u00e0-hjo\" or \"d\u00e0i-hjo,\" which he translates by Philosophy. This translation is not sanctioned by the words of any Chinese commentator, and it is at variance with the received meaning of the words. Nor can the author's distinction between d\u00e0-hjo, great or high learning, and d\u00e0i-hjo, highest learning, find any authority.\n\nThe Great Learning has a threefold scope according to the text. Of its three objects the first is said to be ming-ming t\u00e9 (\u660e \u660e \u5fb7), that is, to bring into clear evidence the clear moral constitution; or, according to another interpretation, to restore this constitution to its original clear brightness. But Dr. K\u00fchnert takes the second ming here to be used as in such terms as ming-t'ien, to-morrow; ming-nien, next year; that is, as meaning future, not present, coming. Then he makes ming-t\u00e9 denote merely a capacity or capability for virtue. But this is neither Confucian nor in accordance with the general use of the terms. The word t\u00e9 denotes the perfect moral constitution with which man is endowed at his birth, and also the innate or inherent qualities or virtues of animate and inanimate objects generally. It has also several secondary meanings, such as are given in the dictionaries.\n\nDr. K\u00fchnert proceeds to give his interpretation of the text, with criticisms on Dr. Legge's translation and commentary. At p. 18 we find another instance of incorrect\nrendering. The Chinese sentence begins Fan-yen-t\u00e9-cho (\u51e1\u8a00\u5fb7\u8005), and this is rendered, \"Alle sagen t\u00e9 ist\"; but the meaning is, wherever the word t\u00e9 is used. Then, on the same page we have a very interesting passage from that clearest of writers, Chu Hsi (\"Tsohu-hi\"), mistranslated in a hopeless manner. At p. 26 we have some remarks about the terms ta-jen (\u5927 \u5165) and hsiao-tsz\u00fc (\u5c0f \u5b50), which show an imperfect acquaintance with the Chinese language and are misleading. The author gives to ta-jen and hsiao-tsz\u00fc the meanings of men of superior and men of inferior mental endowments respectively. But this is undoubtedly wrong.\n\nA sentence is quoted from the beginning of Chu Hsi's Preface, and Dr. K\u00fchnert translates it\u2014\"Das Werk 'Philosophie' ist die Philosophie der Alten, wodurch sie die Gesetze der Menschen lehrten.\" But the words mean: \"The book Great Learning is the great learning of the ancients, the means by which men were educated\" (\u5927\u5b78\u4e4b\u66f8\u53e4\u4e4b\u5927\u5b78\u6240\u4ee5\u654e\u4eba\u4e4b\u6cd5\u4e5f). The context shows that men is the emphatic word here, and if Dr. K\u00fchnert had read the next page he would have seen that Chu Hsi understood and taught that the Great Learning was for adults of all sorts and conditions.\n\nAt p. 32 there is a wrong translation which makes nonsense, but is apparently due to a misprint in the original text. Dr. K\u00fchnert prints \u5fd8\u52d5 and interprets the clause as meaning that the spirit does not move about forgotten, but the correct text is \u5984\u52d5, to move recklessly or at random.\n\nIt cannot be maintained that Dr. K\u00fchnert's study on the Great Learning is an improvement on existing interpretations. The Chinese text and the Commentaries, both the earlier and the later, would repay a thoughtful reading. But the book itself must be taken, as the Sung scholars taught, as a part of the Confucian curriculum of education. It cannot be read and understood by itself, and when Dr. K\u00fchnert has made some progress in the study of Confucian literature he may, perhaps, be able to give a satisfactory interpretation of the Great Learning.\n\nT. W.\nMat\u00e9riaux pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire de la d\u00e9esse Buddhique T\u0101r\u0101. Par Godefroy de Blonay, Bibl. de l'\u00e9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes. Paris, 1895.\n\nNotwithstanding the modesty of its title and its subject, which is apparently a very special one, the volume which M. de Blonay has just published is a worthy addition to the series of memoirs devoted to the study of India in the library of the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes. It is the first among all the volumes of that collection which treats of Buddhist history and religion, and to many persons it will come as a revelation. The only Buddhism known to the reading public is the Pali Buddhism, so excellently described by Rhys Davids and Oldenberg, the religion of the \"sons of \u00c7\u0101kya,\" with its impassive founder, its treatises upon monastic discipline, its collection of doctrines, its monks, given to meditation in place of prayer, who gave equal thought to self-training and to charity, and contemned that more or less mystical magic which takes such hold of the passionate, fiery temperament of the Hindu. The Buddhist civilizations are so numerous, the seeds sown upon fertile soil by the greatest of ancient spiritualists have produced such a luxuriant vegetation, that Buddhism, everywhere differing from itself, presents a unique spectacle in the variety of its forms amid the unity of its essential conceptions and of its sacred terminology.\n\nThese ramifications are little known and barely understood. The worshippers of the mysterious signs of Barhut, the worshippers of the statues of Gandh\u0101ra, the readers of the Lalita, the contemplatives of the Praj\u00f1\u0101, the Tantrikas of the different sects, the ascetics, who called themselves Bhikshus, those who aspired to the name of Bodhisattvas, the faithful devotees of Amit\u0101bha, and all those who aspired to the Buddhist heavens are members of the vast spiritual family, of which Buddha is the eponymous ancestor, whatever be the varied aspects in which he is regarded.\n\nRound Buddha, in the pantheon of new churches,\ncrowd a multitude of other divinities, and their splendour threatened to eclipse that of the Master. Popular imagination continued its work, hand in hand with the enlightened piety of learned devotees. In place of the self-controlled sage, the type of perfect humanity, there was substituted a protecting goddess, kind as a mother. The living Bodhisattva took the place of the extinct Buddha. And as the idea of the divinity changed, the rules of life and the conditions for gaining salvation became modified.\n\nThe faithful is now he who loves, and who prays to, any Buddhist divinity whatever, the *ishtadevata* of his family, his country, or his monastery.\u00b9 It is neither by Bkikshuta, nor by J\u00f1\u0101na, that salvation may be gained; but by Bhakti, the fervent devotion, the slavery (d\u0101satva), both material and moral, of man with regard to the deity. But it is not in every environment that religion preserves this character of intelligent piety, which gives to certain Buddhist pages so striking a resemblance to numerous passages of the literature of the Bh\u0101gavatas. In India the old superstitions reappear along with the newer religions; sacrifice and prayer are both magic and sacramental operations: the doctrines which teach Bhakti are in direct opposition to those called Tantric, in which the female divinities play so important a part.\n\nFrom among all the divine personalities belonging to Nepalese and Tibetan Buddhism, M. de Blonay has signalled out one of the most characteristic\u2014T\u0101r\u0101, a Brahmanic goddess, of naturalistic origin (for her name signifies a star), she who became the mystical spouse of the \"meditative\" Buddhas, the mother of the Bodhisattvas, the Saviour, *par excellence* (*y\u0101 t\u0101rayati*). With a zeal worthy of a devoted follower of the kind goddess, he describes the Buddhist, Indian, and Tibetan T\u0101r\u0101; he recounts or suggests the popularity of his heroine and the evolution of the worship paid to her. In so doing he gathers together valuable information upon the internal\n\n\u00b9 Compare the parallel evolution of orthodox Brahmanism: the Karmak\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, the Upanishads, the Ved\u0101ntas\u016btras, the Bhaktis\u016btras.\nhistory of Buddhism, and notably upon the character of its monasteries during the seventh and eighth centuries.\n\nFor compiling a history of T\u0101r\u0101, we have at our disposal documents of various kinds. I. Inscriptions and monuments, which supply a solid basis for chronological research. Three inscriptions, of which the second betrays a certain amount of literary influence; the first, belonging to Java, dated approximately 779 A.D., establishes the popularity of T\u0101r\u0101 amongst the Mah\u0101y\u0101nist communities who achieved the conquest of the Archipelago; the two others, dated 1095 and 1219 A.D., give proof of the survival in India of the Buddhist religion and ideas, which has been hitherto contested. Hiouen-Tsang bears witness to the existence of statues of T\u0101r\u0101 in Magadha and in the kingdom of Vaicali; the name transcribed by the Chinese traveller (T\u0101r\u0101bodhisattva) is worthy of attention\u2014Tao-Suen (650 A.D.) indicates a st\u016bpa of T\u0101r\u0101 in the kingdom of Tsau-K\u016bta, in the midst of Central Asia. Resemblances to T\u0101r\u0101 will very probably be found among the sculptures of Gandh\u0101ra. II. T\u0101ran\u0101tha, the Tibetan historian of Buddhism, who was so devoted to the goddess that he adopted her name, relates the oftentimes marvellous biography of the Masters of Buddhism. Nearly all of them, according to him, were inspired by T\u0101r\u0101. M. de Blonay has gathered together the scattered matter relating to the goddess, and has thus compiled an interesting monograph, notwithstanding the limited extent of his essay and the small space reserved to historical discussion. Thus, according to T\u0101ran\u0101tha's account, \u00c7\u0101ntideva must have been a mystical Thaumaturgus, a pupil of T\u0101r\u0101 and of Mo\u00f1ju\u00e7r\u012b. According to the Russian orientalist, T\u0101ran\u0101tha wrote the life of \u0100c\u0101ry\u0101s in a tendenz\u00f6s style, and the actual example proves this to be the case, for nothing in the Bodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra, a work of \u00c7\u0101ntideva, leads us to believe that the author was a T\u0101ntrika, a worker of miracles, an adorer of T\u0101r\u0101 or of her sister divinities. I do not doubt that M. de Blonay rejects these ideas of a rather exaggerated criticism.\nWithout wishing to discuss so wide a problem in these pages, may I be allowed to remark how very little we know of the relation between the various sects and doctrines? When T\u0101ran\u0101tha relates the history of Asvabh\u0101va, the author of the hymns to T\u0101r\u0101, the fact appears to be incredible, for Asvabh\u0101va was a M\u0101dhyamika and his name itself points out the uncompromising character of his school. But do we not find the pantheistic poet of the G\u012bta profess his faith in Krishna? The Buddhists of the South and the Santr\u0101ntikas give as good a reason for the justification of the worship which they paid to the defunct Buddha\u2014\"As the pole erected by snake-charmers still continues to cure venomous bites even after the death of the charmer.\"\u00b9 The school which professes to deny the existence of the \u015br\u0101 \u1e47a bh\u0101va, admits that we may pray to and adore divinities. The idea of the void is made to agree with that of adoration and with that of charity. The practice of Tantric ceremonies is not repugnant to believers in the most abstract spiritual theories.\n\nI think some credit must be given, provisionally at least, to tradition. The cult of the Bodhisattvas and of the T\u0101r\u0101s is certainly a very ancient one. The schools of the Yoga possessed a long history of their own before Asanga. If the details of the biographies of T\u0101ran\u0101tha appear to be in many cases doubtful, as were also many of the legends of the Middle Ages, we believe that the type of the great Master of Buddhism in the seventh and eighth centuries is faithfully described by the Tibetan author in the fourteenth. The latter had ancient documents at his disposal, the greater number of which are lost for ever, unless they be hidden in some Tibetan library. M. de Blonay has had the good fortune to discover a Sanskrit text which serves as a specimen of the sources from which T\u0101ran\u0101tha drew his information. This is the commentary on the Srag-dhar\u0101stotra, full of details about Sarvaj\u00f1\u0101mitra, author of a hymn to T\u0101r\u0101. The comparison between this commentary\n\n\u00b9 B.C.A. ix, 37.\nand the history of Buddhism shows the antiquity of the traditions from which T\u0101ran\u0101tha gathered and compiled his information.\n\nIII. Literary documents. From the vast mass of Sanskrit literature consecrated to the memory of T\u0101r\u0101, M. de Blonay has chosen three texts, typical of the two principal styles of its sacred literature.\n\nThe first of these is a hymn to the \"Wearer of the Crown.\" The author, Sarvaj\u00f1amitra, may be placed, with certainty, at the end of the seventh or at the beginning of the eighth century. He was \"a distinguished writer, who moves easily amidst the difficulties of a complicated metre, and who employed a learned style in the service of an ardent faith and an exalted devotion.\" His work \"surpasses in literary merit the Buddhist hymns which have been published so far.\"\n\nSide by side with the commonplaces of classical poetry, this little poem is full of delicate and sometimes touching sentiments. It would be placed in the front rank of any anthology of Indian prayers.\n\nThe two other documents which M. de Blonay presents us with offer a complete contrast to the K\u0101vy\u0101 of Sarvaj\u00f1amitra. \"The praise of the hundred and eight names of T\u0101r\u0101\" and the eulogy in twenty-one verses are a string of Tantric fragments, \"a litany of colourless epithets\" easily transferred \"from one divinity to another,\" in which \"language, metre, and reason are abused\" with equal indifference. We have no longer to do with the personal composition of an artist, but with extracts from a ritual of which the essential object is to cast a spell upon a divinity by the material possession of a mudr\u0101. The India Office Library possesses a number of books consecrated to the Tantric T\u0101r\u0101, in which these ceremonies are described. M. de Blonay has reserved the analysis of these works for a future volume. He has contented himself with indicating the culminating point in Buddhism of female divinity. T\u0101r\u0101 is but an instrument of cult, the docile slave of him who is familiar with the mantras. Her personality, so pre-\ncisely defined in the Sragdhar\u0101stotra, becomes completely effaced, or is revived under different aspects according to the fancy of theorists of the Yoga. She, with her four sisters, represents the elements, and plays a part in the operation called the Vagrak\u0101yasa\u1e0dhana.\n\nTo conclude, this book, which touches upon so many problems at present insoluble, is a skilfully compiled and broadly conceived chapter in the history of later Indian Buddhism. T\u0101r\u0101, by her Brahmanic origin, her literary and religious developments, and the popularity of her worship, is worthy of our attention. She has found in M. de Blonay a learned and scrupulous historian.\n\nL. G. V. Poussin.\n\nGhent, December, 1895.\n\nVI.

Denison Ross, Ph.D., M.R.A.S.\n\nThe most exhaustive, if not the best known, source for the history of Sh\u0101h Isma'il the Safav\u012b, is undoubtedly the Habib-us-Siyar of Khw\u0101ndam\u012br. Though this large and important work has been lithographed, both in T\u012bhr\u0101n and in Bombay, it is but too little known in Europe, where it has generally been regarded as a mere epitome of the Rauzat-us-\u1e62af\u0101; whereas, besides being an original source for much valuable biographical and geographical matter, it contains detailed accounts of many little-known dynasties. Khw\u0101ndam\u012br's work is thus in many respects more interesting than the ponderous universal history of his grandfather.\u00b9 Now, there is a work, of which the British Museum possesses one copy,\u00b2 and the Cambridge University Library a second,\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 Dr. Rieu (see \"Catalogue of the Persian MSS. in the British Museum,\" vol. i, p. 87) was the first to point out that Mirkhw\u0101nd was the grandfather of Khw\u0101ndam\u012br, and not his father, as hitherto generally supposed.\n\u00b2 B.M.

The work ends with a short account of the accession of Isma\u02bf\u012bl's son Tahm\u0101sp, and with prayers for the prosperity and long life of the young prince. This would lead one to fix the completion of the history soon after the accession of Tahm\u0101sp M\u012brz\u0101 in A.H. 930. On the other hand, on fol. 277a of MS. L, we are told, in a momentary digression from the main narrative, that Mohammad Zam\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 was drowned in the Ganges in the year 947, on the occasion of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's retreat from Bengal.\\(^2\\) It does not seem evident that our history was completed after this date; and therefore this incident was probably added by some copyist. There is in the British Museum a MS.\\(^3\\) containing the lives of Sh\u0101hs Isma\u02bf\u012bl and Tahm\u0101sp. It is the work of Mahm\u016bd, son of Khw\u0101ndam\u012br, and was commenced in A.H. 955 (fol. 5b). Now I have attempted to show below that Mahm\u016bd made use of our history, which was therefore in existence in A.H. 955. Mahm\u016bd mentions that he had used many histories in the compilation of his work, but of them all he only mentions by name that of his father. In the opening pages of Mahm\u016bd's history there is much close correspondence with the beginning of the work we are discussing.\n\nMS.

I believe there is no other copy of this work to be found in the libraries of Europe.\n\n\\(^4\\) A = History of Isma\u02bf\u012bl. B = Mahm\u016bd's History.\nfolio in each, where the two MSS. only differ in this, that B is more ornate in style and contains two additional sentences in Arabic. Hereupon in B follows a life of \u1e62afi-ud-D\u012bn Ish\u0101\u1e33, while A, no longer corresponding, gives some facts concerning Fir\u016bz Sh\u0101h, of whom B says nothing. In A, fol. 8b, and B, fol. 10b, we have a description, similar in diction, of \u1e62afi-ud-D\u012bn\u2019s dream. B, fol. 19a to fol. 23b, contains a biography of Shaikh \u1e62adr-ud-D\u012bn, to whom A devotes only half a page (fol. 11b). I have given these details [and I give no more, for I think them sufficient testimony] in order to show how little probability there is of our history (A) being also the work of Ma\u1e25m\u016bd, son of Khw\u0101ndam\u012br, as was suggested by Dr. Rieu after a very cursory inspection of the two MSS.\n\nA comparison of our history (A) with the \u1e24ab\u012bb-us-Siyar will show that there is a very close correspondence in them; nearly always in arrangement and not unfrequently in actual wording, which is especially remarkable in the opening sentences of chapters. The headings of chapters, though generally agreeing in matter, never correspond verbally. The verses which abound throughout our history are usually the same as those occurring in the corresponding passage in the \u1e24ab\u012bb-us-Siyar, but in many cases the quotations are not so long. This all points very clearly to a case of plagiarism.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many biographical and geographical details in our history which are not to be found in the work of Khw\u0101ndam\u012br, and which, therefore, go to prove that our author did not, at any rate, use the \u1e24ab\u012bb-us-Siyar as his only model or authority. Khw\u0101ndam\u012br completed his history in 930\u2014one month before Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bf\u012bl\u2019s death; up till this time, at any rate, he seems to have lived in Khor\u0101s\u0101n, and we have no mention of his having visited other parts of Northern Persia. He, therefore, did not probably obtain his information about Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bf\u012bl on the spot, but got his facts either from some of Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bf\u012bl\u2019s courtiers who came to Khor\u0101s\u0101n, or from some contemporary history\nunknown to us. He quotes no authorities in his account of the Safavids except in the case of the history of Shaikh Safi-ud-Din; these details he naturally and avowedly derives from the large biography of that saint called Safwat-us-Safa.\u00b9 [Khw\u0101ndam\u012br notices incidentally that Maul\u0101n\u0101 Ab\u016b Bakr T\u012bhr\u0101n\u012b, a contemporary of \u1e24asan Beg, wrote a history of that prince, but he, Khw\u0101ndam\u012br, being unable to obtain a copy, gives no account of his reign.]\n\nThus weighing these considerations we may suppose that our history was written by a man closely connected with the Safavids, and who, though taking the \u1e24ab\u012bb-us-Siyar as a general model, had personal acquaintance with the country of which he wrote, first-hand information and perhaps other histories to rely on for his details. With regard to the date of composition we would place it either at the beginning of Tahm\u0101sp\u2019s reign\u00b2 or about the middle (A.H. 950) according to the genuineness of the note on Mohammad Mirz\u0101 Zam\u0101n, mentioned above.\n\nThe portion of our history, which offers the most original matter, is that which deals with the early youth of Sh\u0101h Isma\u2018\u012bl. Much of this is no doubt legendary and fictitious, but it is probably based mainly on historical fact and is at any rate interesting as showing us the stories current at the time regarding this brave and no less bigoted king. I had originally intended to publish a consecutive extract of the text [ff. 20b\u201360a of the British Museum MS.]\u00b3 with a translation, references to the \u1e24ab\u012bb-us-Siyar and general notes. But on consideration I have decided to give the text and translation only of those passages that offer details quite foreign to the \u1e24ab\u012bb-us-Siyar, and which may serve as addenda to Khw\u0101ndam\u012br\u2019s important account\u2014of\n\n\u00b9 See British Museum, Add. 11,745.\n\u00b2 This is certainly the more probable conjecture. The life of Sh\u0101h Isma\u2018\u012bl, though most eventful, was a comparatively short one, and our author might have been a grown man at the time of Isma\u2018\u012bl\u2019s birth (A.H. 892) and still have lived to write his history after the king\u2019s death (A.H. 930).\n\u00b3 In my notes L refers to the British Museum copy of our history and C to the Cambridge MS. In the text I have used the following signs: { } = peculiar to C; [ ] = peculiar to L.\nwhich I would remark, in passing, a new critical edition would well repay the labour any one might bestow on it.\n\nAfter mentioning that Isma'il Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n\\(^1\\) was the fruit of the union of Sult\u0101n Haidar with \u1e24alima Begum, known as \u2018Alam Sh\u0101h Begum, daughter of Amir \u1e24asan Beg, the Turkoman, our author recounts a tradition concerning the origin of the name Kizil b\u0101sh. This is not given in the \u1e24ab\u012bb-us-Siyar, which merely tells us that Haidar fashioned a cap with twelve points out of crimson cloth, which was adopted by all his followers.\n\n[MS.

It is curious that our author should have appropriated for Isma'il the title of S\u0101hih Kir\u0101n, which is in Persian Histories almost the exclusive \"property,\" as it were, of the great Tim\u016br. It is interesting to remark how Purchas says that Uz\u016bn \u1e24asan moved with the fame of Haidar gave him in marriage his daughter Martha, begot of a Christain lady Despina, daughter of Calo Johannes, Emperor of Trebizond \"both of them by that alliance strengthening themselves against the Turke,\" and this Martha was the mother of Isma'il, \"whom she trayned up in the principles of Christain Religion.\" See Purchas \"Pilgrim,\" 4th ed., pp. 382, 383.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u0647\u06cc\u0626\u062a.\nOne night the Prince of the throne of Guidance and Sanctity, that is to say the Commander of the Faithful ('Al\u012b), upon whom be the prayers of God, appeared in a vision to Sult\u0101n Haidar, and said to him: \"Oh my son, the time is now at hand when my child from among your descendants shall arise and sweep Infidelity from off the\nface of the Earth. It now behoves you to fashion a cap for the \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs and your disciples, and you must make it of scarlet cloth.\u201d So saying His Sanctity cut out with a pair of scissors which he had in his hand a pattern of a cap with twelve points [tarak]. On awaking Sultan Haidar remembered the form, and having cut out a cap to that pattern, ordained that all the \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs should make for themselves caps like it and wear them. They gave it the name of T\u0101j-i-Haidari or Haidar\u2019s Cap; and as in the Turkish language K\u0131z\u0131l means scarlet, this holy body became known as the K\u0131z\u0131lb\u0101sh or \u201cRed-heads.\u201d When Hasan P\u0101dish\u0101h heard of these doings he sent a messenger to Sultan Haidar saying: \u201cOh my son, send me one of the caps which thou hast made that I may see it.\u201d Thereupon Sultan Haidar sent him a cap, and when Hasan P\u0101dish\u0101h saw it he was pleased with it, and taking it up kissed it and placed it on his own head, after which he bade each of his children do likewise. But his son Ya\u02bfk\u016bb did not place it on his head, and in spite of all his father\u2019s entreaties refused to do so. In this manner did he bind round his soul the girdle of hostility towards Sultan Haidar.\n\nWhen Hasan P\u0101dish\u0101h bade farewell to his regal throne he was succeeded by his son Sultan Khal\u012bl, who was in turn succeeded by Sultan Ya\u02bfk\u016bb. On account of the hatred he had formerly cherished in his heart for Sultan Haidar he warned his subjects saying: \u201cWoe unto that man who places on his head the cap of Sultan Haidar.\u201d He thus became an enemy to the children of Shaikh \u1e62afi; and he moreover issued a decree that the disciples of Shaikh \u1e62afi should no longer wear their caps. In thus changing his former righteous actions for evil and impious deeds, and in opposing this holy race, Sultan Ya\u02bfk\u016bb brought about the ruin of the dynasty of the White Sheep, as, God willing, will be clearly shown in the following chapters.\n\nThe tradition is of course a gross fabrication, and, as Prof. N\u00f6ldeke suggested to me, was an attempt to attribute an honourable origin to the somewhat disrespectful name of K\u0131z\u0131lb\u0101sh.\nAfter this digression in our history there is a close correspondence of narrative in the two works, containing an account of Sult\u0101n \u1e24aidar\u2019s invasion of Shirw\u0101n, his death, and the subsequent imprisonment of his sons in I\u1e63\u1e6dakhr by Sult\u0101n Ya\u02bfk\u016bb. The story of the release of the Princes and of the engagement in which Rustem Mirz\u0101 defeated the Shirw\u0101nis is given much more fully in our history. Space does not admit of my giving the text of this extract, I therefore confine myself to giving a translation of the same, placing within square brackets those details which are also found in the \u1e24ab\u012bb-us-Siyar, and mentioning in a note any details given in this latter work not to be met with in our own.\n\nB\u0101\u02beisunkar Mirz\u0101 having been deserted by his own men in an encounter with Rustem Mirz\u0101, fled to his uncle, Shirw\u0101nsh\u0101h, while Rustem Mirz\u0101, making a triumphant entry into Tabriz, set himself upon its throne. Here follows a chapter entitled: Liberation of the Princes from the Castle of I\u1e63\u1e6dakhr-i-F\u0101rs, and the end of the Turkom\u0101n Sult\u0101ns.\u00b9\n\n[When Sult\u0101n Farrukh Shirw\u0101nsh\u0101h was informed of the misfortunes of B\u0101\u02beisunkar Mirz\u0101, who was both his sister\u2019s son and his son-in-law, he resolved to help him to re-establish his power. Rustem Mirz\u0101, for his part, being alarmed at the support offered to B\u0101\u02beisunkar Mirz\u0101 by the Shirw\u0101nis and Shirw\u0101nsh\u0101h, held council with the B\u0101yandari\u00b2 chiefs and nobles as to how he might best resist him. All were of opinion that he should set about the release of Sult\u0101n \u2018Ali and the Princes] and become a disciple of their holy race: for under the blessed auspices of that saintly person the repulsion of the allies would become an easy matter. \u201cMoreover\u201d (they added) \u201cthe adherents and disciples of the \u0160afav\u012b \u0160\u016bfis are numerous in all parts of the world, and when they hear of the release (of the Princes) they will soon assemble in great numbers.\n\n\u00b9 L, fol. 25b.\n\u00b2 B\u0101yandari is a name often applied to the dynasty of Uz\u016bn Hasan\u2014the white sheep\u2014after the name of a person to whom they trace back their descent.\nSult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b, being a brave youth, must be sent to fight B\u0101isunkar M\u012brz\u0101, whom, with the support of his own \u0160\u016bf\u012bs and the Turkom\u0101ns, he will overcome. Having thus got rid of this rival, it will be an easy matter to dispose of Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b. [Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h agreeing with this plan, sent an envoy to fetch the children of Sult\u0101n Haidar from the castle of Istakhr-i-F\u0101rs.]\n\nSult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b P\u0101dish\u0101h entered Tabr\u012bz with all pomp and dignity, and was received with affectionate embraces by Rustem M\u012brz\u0101, who paid him great respect and said: \u201cOh! my life, what they have done to you is now past, and by God\u2019s help I will make amends for it. You are as a brother to me, and at my death\u00b9 you shall become king of \u012ar\u0101n.\u201d He then ordered to be given to Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b M\u012brz\u0101 kingly appurtenances, such as a crown with a crest (j\u012bka), an embroidered girdle, a sword and a belt-dagger, together with Arab steeds with golden saddles and other articles of luxury. He then said to him: \u201cI have conferred on you the title of king (p\u0101dish\u0101h), you shall no longer be called \u2018M\u012brz\u0101.\u2019\u201d [Now, when the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs and followers of that family, who had crept into the nooks of obscurity and disappointment, heard of these doings, they turned their faces towards the blessed threshold of their sovereign lord; and the band of devotees daily increased in numbers and in strength.]\n\nIn the meantime news reached Am\u012brz\u0101da Rustem\u2019s ears of the arrival in Azarb\u0101\u012bj\u0101n of B\u0101isunkar M\u012brz\u0101 with the troops of Shirw\u0101n. He therefore entreated Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b P\u0101dish\u0101h to undertake, with his own \u0160\u016bf\u012bs and in conjunction with Abiya\u00b2 Sult\u0101n and the Turkoman army, to repulse B\u0101isunkar M\u012brz\u0101 and the men of Shirw\u0101n, in order that his (Rustem\u2019s) mind might be set at ease with regard to them. [Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b P\u0101dish\u0101h acceding to this request set out along with Abiya Sult\u0101n, full of confidence,\n\n\u00b9 L, fol. 26a.\n\u00b2 The reading of this name is doubtful. The Bombay edition of the Hab\u012bb-us-Siyar writes \u02bfAb\u012bya; the London MS. of same \u02bfAb\u012bya; while in both MSS. of our history it is written \u02bfAb\u012bya.]\nto oppose B\u0101isunkar M\u012brz\u0101 and the army of Shirw\u0101n. They advanced as far as the ford of the river Kur, where they pitched their tents; while on the opposite bank of the river Kur B\u0101isunkar M\u012brz\u0101 lay encamped with a large army. Both armies protected their flanks from any attack by means of palisades] and victory did not seem to promise for either side;\u00b9 so that the two forces grew weary of their protracted inaction, and without any encounter or conflict having taken place [B\u0101isunkar M\u012brz\u0101 returned to Shirw\u0101n and Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b P\u0101dish\u0101h and Abiya Sult\u0101n to Tabriz. While this was passing K\u016bsa H\u0101j\u012b B\u0101yandari, governor of Isfah\u0101n, having declared open revolt against Am\u012brz\u0101da Rustem, read the Khutba in the name of B\u0101isunkar M\u012brz\u0101,] and set about collecting an army and making ready for an expedition.\u00b2 It was for this reason that B\u0101isunkar M\u012brz\u0101 a second time led a large army into Azarb\u0101ij\u0101n. [Am\u012brz\u0101da Rustem seeing himself become on two sides a target to hostile arrows, again called upon Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b P\u0101dish\u0101h to avert from him these two overwhelming dangers.] Whereupon Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b P\u0101dish\u0101h, in compliance with the Am\u012brz\u0101da\u2019s request, again set out with Abiya Sult\u0101n, a body of his own followers, and the Turkom\u0101n army to meet the insurgents. [He told off Kar\u0101 Piri Kaj\u0101r\u00b3 with a large body of S\u016bf\u012bs to engage K\u016bsa H\u0101j\u012b B\u0101yandari] while he himself set out to oppose B\u0101isunkar M\u012brz\u0101, whom he encountered in the vicinity of Ahar Shak\u012bn.\u2074 The opposing forces then began to make ready for battle: (Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b) placed the right of his army under the command of \u1e24usain Beg Sh\u0101ml\u016b Lala and Rustem Beg Karam\u0101nl\u016b, and over the left he appointed Dede Beg T\u0101l\u012bsh\u2014known as Abd\u0101l\n\n\u00b9 The Hab\u012bb-us-Siyar differs in this place, saying: \u201cThere was an occasional interchange of arrows, and every day small conflicts took place, but on none of those days did victory declare itself for either side, and one could not distinguish which were the victors and which the conquered.\u201d\n\u00b2 L, fol. 26b.\n\u00b3 L and C read K\u0101j\u0101r, but the Hab\u012bb-us-Siyar says Taw\u0101j\u012b, whose name also appears at the end of this chapter.\n\u2074 Thus in L: C reads Ahar Mashk\u012bn. It is noticeable that the Hab\u012bb-us-Siyar gives no details concerning this battle, of which our author is able to give us so exact an account. On the margin of the Bombay edition we find the date given as 897.\n'Ali Beg\u2014and Kh\u0101dim Beg Khal\u012bfa, while the skirmishing party, composed of the rest of the Turkom\u0101ns, was led by Abiya Sult\u0101n. The Prince himself took up his stand with a body of devotees under the shadow of the victorious standard.\n\nOn the other side, B\u0101\u012bsunkar M\u012brz\u0101 gave his right wing to Shaikh Sh\u0101h, son of Sult\u0101n Farrukh Shirw\u0101nsh\u0101h, and his left to Malik Sal\u012bm, one of the renowned maliks of Shirw\u0101n, while he took up his own position in the centre of his army facing the Prince's standard. These tactics being completed, valorous youths entered the field and began to encourage and incite the soldiers to battle. When the troops had thus been worked up into a state of fervour, the skirmishers from both sides advanced and fell upon each other. So numerous were the flying arrows and so thick the clouds of dust that the air became dark as the heart of a Sunni.\\(^1\\) Abiya Sult\u0101n next charged down upon the Shirw\u0101nis and put them to flight; seeing which B\u0101\u012bsunkar M\u012brz\u0101 sent Malik Sel\u012bm to their aid and brought the Shirw\u0101ni right and left wings into the field. (In the encounter that ensued) Abiya Sult\u0101n received a spear-wound, and so severe was the onslaught of the enemy that he was unable to withstand them, and turned in flight. The Prince perceiving the helpless condition of Abiya Sult\u0101n and the disorder among the Turkom\u0101ns, gave a signal to the \u0160\u016bf\u012b right and left wings to advance to their aid. In obedience to this order Husain Beg Lala and Abd\u0101l 'Ali Beg Dede charged forward, quick as lightning, from either side, and in one brave onslaught threw confusion among the Shirw\u0101ni troops. B\u0101\u012bsunkar M\u012brz\u0101, alarmed by the daring attacks of the gh\u0101zis, now sent into the fray his foot-archers and mounted-lancers, who had been posted in his centre. (The former discharged a volley of arrows upon the gh\u0101zis, and so dense was the shower of deadly points that those brave men were panic-stricken. Maddened at this repulse the Prince himself now entered the fray, and\n\n\\(^1\\) L, fol. 27a.\nwith thrusts from his terrible spear swept his enemies from the field.) B\u0101\u012bsunk\u0101r M\u012brz\u0101, dislodged by a spear from his saddle, fell dead to the ground, and one of the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs with a sharp dagger severed his arrogant head from the body, and threw it in the path of the Prince\u2019s steed.\n\nThus by the blessing of the courage of that holy Prince were the Shirw\u0101n\u012bs overcome; and in that battle B\u0101\u012bsunk\u0101r M\u012brz\u0101 was slain.\n\n[Meanwhile Kar\u0101 Piri Taw\u0101j\u012b, having encountered K\u016bsa H\u0101ji near Dar Guzin, under the blessed auspices of \u201cHis Sanctity\u201d had overcome his enemy and slain K\u016bsa H\u0101ji.]\u00b9 Both these pieces of good news reached Tabriz on the same night, and Am\u012brz\u0101da Rustem was delighted and overjoyed at the victories.\n\nDeath of Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b P\u0101dish\u0101h.\u00b2\n\nThe victorious Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b P\u0101dish\u0101h now returned to Tabriz. Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h sent out a party to receive him, and himself, having ridden three forasangs out of the town to meet him with all honour, rode into Tabriz at his side. [Soon after this he with great state set the Prince and his brothers on the road to Ardabil, in which blessed town the Prince mounted the throne of his ancestors, and became a religious guide to the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs and devotees.]\u00b3 His entry was a most propitious event for that city, which now became a rival to the garden of Iram. The pious began to assemble in Ardabil that they might benefit by attending upon that Upholder of the Faith, and the number of the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs there collected together soon became very great. When Rustem M\u012brz\u0101 learned that high and low were thus flocking round Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b P\u0101dish\u0101h, jealousy enflamed his heart, and he was filled with anxiety lest the Prince might turn against\n\n\u00b9 L, fol. 276.\n\u00b2 In this place the \u1e24ab\u012bb-us-Siyar has a chapter entitled \u201cDeath of Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b P\u0101dish\u0101h, and the honour done to L\u0101hij\u0101n by the blessing of His Sanctity\u2019s journey thither,\u201d and resolves into one chapter what our author extends to three.\n\u00b3 \u0647\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0634\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc = well-wishers, supporters (of the \u0160afav\u012bs).\nhim; so he sent an envoy to bring back the Prince and his brothers to Tabriz.]\n\nThough he still treated him with outward regard, he commissioned spies to see that the Prince had no communication with the Sufis. Nevertheless, his faithful disciples contrived secretly to send him gifts of ready money and various stores, thus putting to the test the coin of their devotion.\\(^1\\) When Rustem Mirza heard of this he was filled with anxiety in regard to the sons of Sultan Haidar. [That winter\\(^2\\) he quartered in Khui.] Just as Rustem Mirza was leaving this place to move into summer quarters, some malicious men reported to him calumniating stories (of the Prince), and advised him to make an end of that Prince. He, therefore, arranged with his generals that on the morrow they should hold a big meeting and then and there [put to death the princes, together with all the nobles (busurgan), Sufis, and disciples of Shaikh Safi (in Ardabil), and likewise those in Tabriz]. But a certain Turkoman, who loved the children of Shaikh Safi, betook himself to the dwelling of Sultan Ali Padishah and informed the princes of Rustem Padishah's design. On hearing this alarming news, Sultan Ali Padishah in that same night warned his nobles thereof, saying: \"To-morrow they intend to kill me and you; what is to be done?\" Husain Beg Lala, Dede Beg Talish, Kara Piri Beg Kajur, and Ilyas Beg said: \"May we be thy sacrifice! Arise and let us go to Ardabil, for there and in that neighbourhood you have many disciples. If Rustem Padishah should wish to pursue us, we will give him fight. If, however, he neglects to follow us, we shall remain unharmed.\"\\(^3\\) The Prince replied \"Very well.\"\n\nThat same night they rode away in the direction of Ardabil. At dawn next day they brought Rustem Padishah news that Sultan Ali Padishah had fled, and was\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) L, fol. 28a.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Habib-us-Siyar gives the date 898.\n\n\\(^3\\) I have thus rendered a short sentence which I found difficult to translate\u2014\n\n\u0627\u0643\u0631\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0643\u064a \u0645\u0627 \u0646\u064a\u0632\u0628\u0635\u0627\u0644 \u062e\u064a\u0631 \u063a\u0648\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0628\u0648\u062f\non his way to Ardabil. (Rustem) was much perturbed, and ordered his adoptive-son, \u1e24usain Beg \u2018Al\u012bkh\u0101n\u012b, and Abiya Sult\u0101n, the Turkom\u0101n, to mount their horses and overtake the fugitives as quickly as possible. For, he said, should Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b once enter Ardabil (which God forbid!) the deaths of 10,000 Turkom\u0101ns would be of no avail. Thereupon Abiya Sult\u0101n set out, at the head of 5000 Turkom\u0101ns, in hot pursuit.\n\nWhen the Princes reached a village in the vicinity of Ardabil called Shamm\u0101s\u012b, Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b P\u0101dish\u0101h comprehended by the power of his sanctity that he would shortly taste the wine of martyrdom. He therefore called for his brother Isma\u2018il M\u012brz\u0101, and said to him: \u201cOh! my brother, it is pre-ordained that I shall this day be killed. The disciples will take my body and place it in the mausoleum of my ancestors, by my father\u2019s side. I desire you to avenge me and your father and your ancestors upon the children of \u1e24asan P\u0101dish\u0101h. For the die of heaven\u2019s choice has been cast in your name, and before long you will come out of G\u012bl\u0101n like a burning sun, and with your sword sweep infidelity from the face of the earth.\u201d So saying he took Sult\u0101n \u1e24aidar\u2019s cap from his own head, and placed it on his brother\u2019s, and then bound his own girdle round his brother\u2019s girdle. After this he spoke into his ear those maxims which he had received as an inheritance from his noble ancestors. He next chose out seven men, among them \u1e24asain Beg Lala, Kar\u0101p\u012br\u012b Beg, Abd\u0101l Beg, and Dede Beg T\u0101l\u012bsh, and ordered them to proceed to Ardabil with Isma\u2018il M\u012brz\u0101 and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm M\u012brz\u0101.\n\nMeanwhile the approach of Abiya Sult\u0101n and \u1e24usain Beg \u2018Al\u012bkh\u0101n\u012b with the enemies\u2019 troops was reported. Abiya Sult\u0101n leaving a body of men in ambush, himself advanced into the battle-field. Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b P\u0101dish\u0101h, having finished his commendations to his brother, hastened out to meet the enemy, and as soon as he perceived that rabble he bore\n\n1 \u1e24usain Beg \u2018Al\u012bkh\u0101n\u012b.\n2 L, fol. 286.\n3 Lit. \u201cnotified.\u201d\ndown upon them with his \u0160\u016bf\u012bs, and in one daring charge completely broke their ranks. In that battle \"His Sanctity\" complained that the men of the day had forgotten the mode of fighting of Rustem and Isfandy\u0101r.\n\nWhen Abiya Sult\u0101n saw the valorous onset of the Prince and the discomfiture of his own men, being overcome by fear of the fiery lance of that undaunted rider and the cleaving swords of the brave \u0160\u016bf\u012bs, he turned and fled with \u1e24usain Beg \u2018Al\u012bkh\u0101n\u012b, hotly pursued by the Prince. Meanwhile the ghas\u0101t entered the Turkom\u0101n camp and began to pillage. On this account the Prince was not accompanied by more than 300 men; yet he persisted in giving chase to that rabble, and slew many of them with sword and spear, till they reached a river which crossed their road; into this the Prince fell with his horse, and failing to extricate himself was drowned. Disheartened at this fatality the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs dispersed in flight, while those who were engaged in pillaging were put to death.\n\nAfter the battle \u2018Alam Sh\u0101h Begum ordered the body of that cypress from the garden of the Im\u0101mate to be conveyed to Ardabil, to be there interred beside the tomb of his noble ancestor (may God have mercy on him and his fathers!). This event occurred in the year 900.\n\nAt this place begins an account of the adventures of \"the Princes\" in Gil\u0101n and the subsequent experiences of Isma\u2018\u012bl in L\u0101hij\u0101n. As the \u1e24abib-us-Siyar affords us\n\n---\n\n1 Isma\u2018\u012bl is also frequently spoken of throughout the work as \"\u0101n hazzat\" (or His Sanctity), but as this title seems strange to European ears thus applied, I have preferred generally to render this (and any other epithet applied to him) by his name only.\n\n2 L, fol. 29a. The foregoing sentence is a little obscure. It is at any rate unimportant.\n\n3 It is hard to render this expression in English. It means more than warriors and less than \"fighters for the faith.\" A ghas\u0101t originally meant merely a freebooting-raid. It next became applied to the \"holy war\" for the propagation of the faith, and after that to any war carried on by believers, for whatsoever object.\n\n4 The expression used is \u062c\u0645\u0639 \u06a9\u0631\u0628\u0644\u0627 \u06a9\u0645\u0628 \u06a9\u0645\u0628 might mean booty, but I can find no trace of \u06a9\u0645\u0628 being employed in this sense.\n\n5 See preceding note.\n\n6 The \u1e24abib-us-Siyar gives the date as 898.\nscarcely any details on these subjects I have chosen to give\nthe full text and translation of the following chapters of\nour history which deal with these adventures. The few\nfacts that do occur also in the \u1e24abib-us-Siyar I have again\nplaced within square brackets.\n\n(From the minuteness of our author's details, both in\nregard to Isma'il's adventures and in regard to accounts\nof small engagements, one might feel justified in supposing\nthat he was in the same districts at the time, and even\ntook part in some of the scenes of which he speaks.)\n\nL,

Beg, together with the remainder of the Sufis and Abd\u0101l \u2018Ali Beg Lala, had set out in the escort of the princely brothers, that is to say Isma\u2019il Mirz\u0101 and Sultan Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Mirz\u0101, towards the holy town of Ardabil. On reaching this town news overtook them of the death of the Prince. \u2018Alam Sh\u0101h Begum was overwhelmed with grief at hearing of her son\u2019s death, and her mind was filled with anxiety lest Isma\u2019il and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm might fall into the tyrant\u2019s hands. She therefore sent them both to the mausoleum of their noble ancestor, that they might, in that holy spot, under God\u2019s care, remain in hiding. As soon as they had departed she performed the funeral rites of her dear son.\n\nOn the next day Abiya Sult\u0101n and the merciless Turkomans entered the town in search of the Princes. They used the inhabitants with violence, and busied themselves with plunder and rapine, and in searching for the Princes. Isma\u2019il, becoming fearful of these hostile men, came out of the mausoleum and hid himself in the house of K\u0101z\u012b Ahmad K\u0101kul\u012b, which was hard by. K\u0101z\u012b Ahmad, being devoted to the family [of Shaikh Safi], was delighted at the arrival of Isma\u2019il, did him all honour, and kept\nhim three days in hiding in his house. When he, however, heard of the careful search which the Turkom\u0101ns were making, and of Abiya Sult\u0101n's efforts to discover Isma'il, he was fearful lest some of the envious or malicious \u0160\u016bf\u012bs might report to Abiya Sult\u0101n that the Prince was in his house; he therefore took Isma'il to the house of a woman named Kh\u0101nj\u0101n, and entrusted him to her keeping. There Isma'il remained one month, hidden like the spring of the water of life, from all eyes, except those of P\u0101sh\u0101 Kh\u0101t\u016bn, one of Sult\u0101n Junaid's daughters, and aunt to Isma'il by her marriage with Mohammadi Beg Turkom\u0101n. No one else knew of the Prince's whereabouts. When a month had elapsed P\u0101sh\u0101 Kh\u0101t\u016bn, fearing the tyrants, deemed it advisable to take Isma'il away from the house of Kh\u0101nj\u0101n and place him in the keeping of another woman named Uba-i-Jarr\u0101\u1e25a, of the tribe of Z\u016blkadr. After consulting with Uba, this latter conveyed Isma'il to her house in the quarter of the Greeks, and hid him there. Meanwhile the Turkom\u0101ns, in obeyance to the orders of Abiya Sult\u0101n, became each day more scrutinious in their spying and searching, passing from quarter to quarter, and from house to house. Rustem M\u012brz\u0101 insisted more strongly than ever upon the discovery of the Princes, ordering that, having seized the \"Perfect Guide\" by whatsoever means they could, they should put him to death with the sword, together with all his race, both male and female. That tyrant, moreover, in the vileness of his natural clay, desired that '\u0100lam Sh\u0101h Begum, mother of Isma'il, should be tortured, and that having taken the Prince from her, he might carry out his secret intention (namely, of killing the Prince). But she knew absolutely nothing about him, and so deep\n\n1 He is here called the \"Perfect Guide\": a very usual epithet for a spiritual head, or adviser, among the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs.\n\n2 \u062c\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0651\u0627\u062d\u064e\u0629\u064c = the feminine form of jarr\u0101\u1e25 'a surgeon' (which latter word is derived from the former through the intermediate form chirurgien). We might call this woman Uba the Lady-Surgeon (better in French and German, chirurgienne and Wund\u00e4rztin). But, as the English expression is awkward, I have preferred to keep the original Arabic word in my translation.\nwas she sunk in the ocean of grief at separation from her dear son that all that pain and torture had no effect upon her. Abiya Sult\u0101n, therefore, abandoned this evil plan, and ordered that good-for-nothing band of Turkom\u0101ns impudently to enter the houses of all the \"congregation of Ardabil,\" if haply they might capture Isma'il in the house of one of his supporters. When Uba-i-Jarr\u0101\u1e25a heard of this design of Abiya Sult\u0101n, fearing the violence of the Turkom\u0101ns, she brought Isma'il into the Great Mosque of Ardabil, where she watched over him in the vault which is the burial place of All\u0101h Virmish \u0100k\u0101. While he was there, she took advantage of a suitable occasion to give \u2018Alam Sh\u0101h Begum news of her son. The Begum, overjoyed at hearing of her son's safety, laid her thanks before the throne of God, and prayed for his safe keeping. After a few days Uba, becoming unquiet for the Prince's safety in that place, resolved to take him elsewhere. At this juncture a \u0160\u016bfi gh\u0101si, who had fled wounded from the battle between Sult\u0101n \u2018Ali and Abiya Sult\u0101n, and had hidden himself in the Great Mosque of Ardabil, while his wounds were healing, came to Uba-i-Jarr\u0101\u1e25a, who told him about Isma'il, and showed him to him. The \u0160\u016bfi, having kissed the ground at the Prince's feet, told him of the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs who were in hiding in the mountain of Baghrau, in the vicinity of Ardabil, and who were longing for the opportunity of serving Isma'il. He then, at the advice of Uba-i-Jarr\u0101\u1e25a, left the mosque, and went and gave news of Isma'il to Rustem Beg Kar\u0101m\u0101nl\u016b, who had also fled from the same battle-field and was hiding in that mountain, together with eighty other \u0160\u016bf\u012bs, who had escaped from that encounter, and were collected together in that mountain. At midnight Rustem Beg betook himself to the Great Mosque of Ardabil, and having found Isma'il, carried him off to the mountain of Baghran, where he placed him in the village of Karg\u0101n, in the house of Farrukh Z\u0101d Kurk\u0101n\u012b, the Preacher, who did him fitting service.\n\nMans\u016br Beg Kipch\u0101khi, \u1e24usain Beg Lala K\u0131rk Sayyid\u012b \u2018Ali, Julb\u0101n Beg, Kh\u0101dim Beg Khal\u012bfa, Dede Beg, K\u00fck\n\u2018Ali Beg, and the rest of the \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs now held council as to where Isma\u2018\u012bl had best stay and how he was best to be watched over. They all decided for taking Isma\u2018\u012bl to Rasht, after remaining a few days where they were for making the necessary arrangements. Now, friendly relations such as the continual exchange of messages and of gifts, had long existed between Mohammadi Beg, husband of P\u0101sh\u0101 Kh\u0101t\u016bn, Isma\u2018\u012bl\u2019s aunt, his brother Ahmad\u012b Beg, and Am\u012bra Ish\u0101k of Rasht. Being of accord with the above plan, Rustem Beg, Ahmad\u012b Beg, and Mohammadi Beg, with an escort of eighty \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs, conveyed the \u201cPerfect Guide\u201d into the district of T\u016bl-u-N\u0101v to the house of Am\u012bra Muzaffar, governor of T\u016bl-u-N\u0101v. This man received Isma\u2018\u012bl with all hospitality, and omitted nothing in the matter of devoted attention and service.\n\nWhen news reached Abiya Sult\u0101n, in Ardabil, that Isma\u2018\u012bl was in the house of Am\u012bra Muzaffar, he despatched a messenger to Am\u012bra Muzaffar saying: \u201cSult\u0101n Haidar\u2019s son has sought shelter in your house, the conditions of obedience and subservience demand that you send him and his companions with presents and gifts to Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h, so that you may profit by the indulgence and kindness of your king. But if you act contrary to this and disobey you will be subject to the wrath and severity of your king.\u201d He also sent a message of like purport to Jak\u012br Beg Parnak, governor of Khalkh\u0101l and T\u016bl. Am\u012bra Muzaffar, in his devotion to that holy race, would not agree to Isma\u2018\u012bl remaining any longer in T\u016bl-u-N\u0101v, nor was his mind quite at rest with regard to Jak\u012br Beg. He therefore persuaded Isma\u2018\u012bl to go to Kaskar, and at his bidding the \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs, together with Am\u012bra An\u016bsh, a servant of Am\u012br Siy\u0101vush, escorted Isma\u2018\u012bl towards that place. Mohammadi Beg and Ahmad\u012b Beg wrote letters of recommendation for Isma\u2018\u012bl to Am\u012bra Ish\u0101k of Rasht, and sent them to Rasht, while they themselves returned to Ardabil. On learning the approach of Isma\u2018\u012bl, Am\u012bra Siy\u0101vush, governor of Kaskar, came out to receive him in honour, and made him alight in his own house, where he entertained him for three days,\nand on the fourth set out with him on his way to Rasht. He escorted him as far as the outskirts of Rasht, but when Isma'il entered the town he bade Isma'il farewell and returned (to Kaskar). The \"Perfect Guide\" and the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs alighted at a mosque in Rasht called the \"White Mosque,\" and its architecture and style pleased Isma'il so well that he would not go on to the house of Amira Ishak or anywhere else. Even the entreaties of Amira Ishak himself were of no avail. Close to that mosque a goldsmith named Amira Najm had his shop. Being so near at hand he spent much of his time in attendance on Isma'il, and thereby daily increased his \"grade.\" However, reports are at variance\\(^1\\) with regard to the length of Isma'il's stay in Rasht. Some state it to have been seven days, others twenty, and others again say a month.\n\nK\u0101rgiy\u0101\\(^2\\) Mirz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b, governor of L\u0101hij\u0101n, formed an exception to the other rulers in Gil\u0101n in his devotion to the cause (of the descendants of Shaikh \u0160\u016bf\u012b), and when he heard that Isma'il, being compelled by circumstances to quit Ardabil, had gone to Rasht, he, knowing that Amira Ishak was not in a position to protect Isma'il and his \u0160\u016bf\u012b companions, invited Isma'il to come to L\u0101hij\u0101n. On receipt of this friendly invitation from the devoted K\u0101rgiy\u0101 Mirz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b, Isma'il decided to go and stay in L\u0101hij\u0101n. He therefore set out without delay. K\u0101rgiy\u0101 Mirz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b, elated at the joyful news of Isma'il's arrival, rendered him every possible service, and having prepared everything to meet their wants, set apart for him and his companions a dwelling opposite the College of Kai \u0100frid\u016bn. A short while after this, Sult\u0101n Abiya, having received news of Isma'il's departure for L\u0101hij\u0101n, set out for Tabriz, and seized on the person of the woman named Uba-i-Jarr\u0101ha, and taking her (back with him) extorted from her the whole story in detail of Isma'il's journey, his stay in Ardabil, the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This is worthy of note as an instance of our author's care for accuracy.\n\n\\(^2\\) K\u0101rgiy\u0101, or \u0120iy\u0101\u2014emperor. It is said to be a Gil\u0101ni word. We may here note that Mirz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b is always given this title in our history, while the \u1e24abib-us-Siyar never applies it to him.\ndeparture of the princes for Gil\u0101n, and the help afforded by each of the \"supporters.\" This he reported to Rustem M\u012brz\u0101, who bursting into a fit of rage had that poor pious woman strangled in the market-place of Tabriz. He also poured out his wrath upon Mohammadi Beg, and had the other accomplices arrested, but finally, at the request of Kar\u0101 Dede, pardoned them on the payment of a fine of thirty thousand tanga.\n\n**Isma'il's Stay in L\u0101hij\u0101n.**\n\n[Isma'il, having reached L\u0101hij\u0101n, took up his residence there, while K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b did all in his power to testify to his devotion and willing service.] He appointed Maul\u0101n\u0101 Shams-ud-D\u012bn L\u0101hij\u012b, one of the learned men of that country, to instruct Isma'il in the reading and recitation of the \u1e32ur\u0101n. Isma'il took delight in the Maul\u0101n\u0101's instruction, and with him studied the \u1e32ur\u0101n and learnt to read Persian and Arabic books. During this period disciples and single-minded \u0160\u016bf\u012bs flocked in from all sides, especially from the districts of R\u016bm, Kar\u0101ja D\u0101gh, and Ahar, bringing gifts and offerings for the \"Perfect Guide\"; but immediately returned, as it was not wise for them to remain there. Am\u012br Najm, the goldsmith, who had waited on Isma'il in Rasht, together with Giy\u0101 Sult\u0101n Husain and Giy\u0101 Amir H\u0101shim, brothers of K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b, had frequent intercourse with Isma'il, and, from the converse and society of these men, Isma'il's mind became fully developed.\n\n[After a while,\u00b9 Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm M\u012brz\u0101 and Sulaim\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 formed a desire to return to Ardabil, and so having doffed the twelve-pointed cap of \u1e24aidar, which is the distinctive mark of the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs of this branch, and having donned the Parn\u0101k\u012b head-dress (\u1e6d\u0101kiya), as worn by the \"White-Sheep\" Turkom\u0101ns, they set out for the old residence of their great ancestor.] After the departure of Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm M\u012brz\u0101, Isma'il fell ill, and was obliged\n\n\u00b9 The \u1e24abib-us-Siyar says: \"after some months.\"\nto keep to his bed for a whole year. Maul\u0101n\u0101 Ni\u2018mat Ullah tried many remedies in vain, till at length the Absolute Physician sent down miraculous healing, and Isma\u2018il began to recover. Having regained his appetite, he begged his aunt, P\u0101sh\u0101 Kh\u0101tim, to send him some dainties [n\u0101n-r\u012bsa]. She thereupon sent him offerings with dainties from Ardabil, and made enquiries after his health. When her messengers reached Rasht, Isma\u2018il heard of their approach and sent out K\u014dk \u2018Al\u012b to receive them. The messengers, accompanied by M\u012br Najm, the goldsmith, M\u012br \u1e24asan, son of M\u012br M\u016bs\u0101, Am\u012br Jah\u0101ng\u012br, the wak\u012bl of Amira Ish\u0101\u1e33 Rasht\u012b, were conducted into the presence of Isma\u2018il by K\u014dk \u2018Al\u012b. Having kissed the Prince\u2019s feet, and having delivered over the presents and letters from his mother, brothers, foster-brothers, and aunt, they expressed their gratitude to heaven for that they found Isma\u2018il restored to health. The Prince then entertained them hospitably. He likewise set apart some of the presents to be given to K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b and his brothers. After three days the messengers were allowed to take their leave, and they set out for Ardabil laden with suitable gifts, such as stuffs and merchandise, fattened birds, fish, rice, oranges, and other products of Gil\u0101n. When they reached a village of Ardabil called Kuraim, P\u0101sh\u0101 Kh\u0101t\u016bn and Mohammadi Beg, who had heard of their arrival, came thither from Ardabil, and having taken over from them the gifts they bore, set out for the capital, Tabriz, hoping that they might by this means obtain the restitution of their effects which had been confiscated\u00b9 from them by Rustem M\u012brz\u0101. They again sought the mediation of Kar\u0101 Dede, who, by means of presents, obtained an audience with Rustem M\u012brz\u0101, who, accepting these presents, delivered over their effects, and wrote an order that from thenceforward no one should molest them. Having presented Mohammadi Beg with a robe of honour, he allowed them to return.\n\n\u00b9 The expression used is \u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0633\u06a9\u0646. I have been unable to find the word s\u016bng in any dictionary. From the context it would appear to mean \u201cconfiscation,\u201d or something akin to it.\nRustem Mirz\u0101 sends an Envoy to K\u0101rgiy\u0101 Mirz\u0101 in L\u0101hij\u0101n to Demand the Person of Isma\u2018\u012bl.\n\nIt was mentioned above that, after the Isma\u2018\u012bl\u2019s departure for Gil\u0101n, Abiya Sul\u1e6d\u0101n, the Turkom\u0101n, and \u1e24usain Beg \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n\u012b went to Tabr\u012bz. They there reported to Rustem Mirz\u0101 the events that have been herein related. Thereupon Rustem Mirz\u0101 sent to ask K\u0101rgiy\u0101 Mirz\u0101 \u2018Ali to deliver up the Princes. On receiving this message K\u0101rgiy\u0101 Mirz\u0101 \u2018Ali sent Isma\u2018\u012bl to a village near L\u0101hij\u0101n called Lashta, where he remained in hiding, and sent Rustem Mirz\u0101\u2019s envoy back to Tabr\u012bz with flattering apologies. He then brought Isma\u2018\u012bl back to his own house, where the Prince spent his time in reading the Kur\u0101n, and in learning to read and write. On his return, the Turkoman laid before Rustem Mirz\u0101 the cunning excuses of K\u0101rgiy\u0101 Mirz\u0101 \u2018Ali.\n\nRustem Mirz\u0101 convened repeated assemblies to discuss the best means of capturing Isma\u2018\u012bl, until they finally decided that a party of Turkom\u0101ns should be sent out as spies disguised as \u0160af\u0101vi \u0160\u016bf\u012bs, and report any news they might hear of the Prince\u2019s whereabouts, and thereby facilitate the capture of Isma\u2018\u012bl. Rustem Mirz\u0101 and \u1e24usain Beg \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n\u012b therefore selected a few spies and sent them into the surrounding districts. These spies entered \u012ar\u0101n, and brought their spying into L\u0101hij\u0101n; of every Gil\u0101n\u012b1 they met with they asked news of Isma\u2018\u012bl, and pretended to be disciples of the children of Shaikh \u0160afi, till at length one day a Gil\u0101n\u012b said to one of them: \u201cIf you speak true and really belong to the \u0160af\u0101vi \u0160\u016bf\u012bs, go and present yourself before K\u0101rgiy\u0101 Mirz\u0101 \u2018Ali, King of L\u0101hij\u0101n, and tell him of your devotion to the Prince. Haply he will allow you to be honoured with a sight of the Prince. This ingenuous simpleton having thus, in his stupidity, given him a clue, the Turkoman stayed no longer in Gil\u0101n, but went straight to Ardab\u012bl and told \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n\u012b\n\n---\n\n1 Gil\u0101k\u012b is the word used in the text; a curious nisba-formation from Gil\u0101n. It is probably dialectic. Gil\u0101n\u012b is the more usual form.\nSult\u0101n what he had heard; this latter immediately sent on the spy to Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h with an escort. When Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h learnt that Isma\u2018il was staying in L\u0101hij\u0101n he consulted his chiefs, saying: \u201cWhat must I do to capture my enemies, and assure myself that Isma\u2018il will not make a revolt?\u201d Everyone had a suggestion to make, and Abiya Sult\u0101n said: \u201cOh! Prince, the thought has suggested itself to me that since the King of L\u0101hij\u0101n is your friend and ally, he would, at the mere hearing of your wishes, send to you the Princes and those \u0160\u016bf\u012bs who are in his company, or else, being directed by him where to find the Prince, you can send someone to fetch him. But if he make boast of his discipleship and keep them both in hiding, I should suggest another plan, namely, that you write him a letter, saying: \u2018Being misled and deceived by certain malicious men I put an end to that brave youth, who was a general in my army. At this present I know of no one whom I could confidently raise to power, and with whose help I shall fear opposition from no one. Since matters have turned out thus with Sult\u0101n \u2018Ali, I wish you to send me his two brothers, whom I regard as my own children in rank, that I may educate them as were I their father and be their guardian and protector. Moreover, compensation shall be made them for the blood of their father and brother. Now I have heard that you have shown honour to these two princes, and treated them with the utmost kindness and indulgence. You have done well in this, for they come of an honourable race, and whatsoever you have done for their attendants shall hereafter meet with its due reward. We, too, are desirous of performing the duties of hospitality to them.\u2019\u201d\n\nRustem P\u0101dish\u0101h sends a Letter to K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b in G\u012bl\u0101n requesting him to give up the Princes.\n\nNow when Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h\u2019s letter reached G\u012bl\u0101n, K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b, although he showed outward satis-\nfaction, was in reality much alarmed, and said to the K\u00fcrchi,\\(^1\\) who had brought the letter: \"I know nothing of the princes; they may be in Gil\u0101n, and I will make enquiries. While you remain here a few days to recover from the fatigues of the journey, I will set on foot a diligent search; have no anxieties.\" He then entrusted the messenger to the care of one of his attendants, who should hospitably entertain him, while he himself hastened to Isma'il, and, having called together the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs and \"supporters,\" read them the letter. Husain Beg Lala, Kh\u0101dim Beg Khal\u012bfa, and Dede Beg, said: \"Oh! master, what do you think (in this matter)?\" He replied: \"I was well-pleased that Rustem M\u012brz\u0101 should have written me such a letter as this.\" They rejoined: \"Alas! that thou shouldst be so credulous; Rustem M\u012brz\u0101 wrote this letter out of pure guile; God forbid that you should conform with it. Write in answer: 'I was not aware that those two stars had arisen in the constellation of my kingdom. I swear by the honoured head of the king that I have not with me the sons of Sult\u0101n \u1e24aidar, and I am also able to affirm that they are not even in Gil\u0101n; for had they come to Gil\u0101n it is impossible that they should not have announced their arrival to me. Let the king rest assured that I will not allow the enemies of that prince to come near me. Above all, keep this secret hidden, and do not make this matter public, or you will regret it afterwards.'\" K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101, approving the suggestion of the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs, wrote the answer in this style, and sent the K\u00fcrchi back again with it.\n\nWhen the answer reached Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h he said: \"K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Ali certainly speaks truth, and has no news of the princes: what (the others) said was all lies.\" But a second time his agents\\(^2\\) brought Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h news that the sons of Sult\u0101n \u1e24aidar were in Gil\u0101n, and\n\n\\(^1\\) The K\u00fcrchi were the descendants of the two thousand prisoners who were released by Tim\u016br at the request of \u0160af\u012b-ud-D\u012bn, and among whom some lands round Ardabil were afterwards distributed. Hence were they such faithful supporters of the \u0160\u0101f\u012bv\u012b dynasty. Cf. Chardin-Langl\u00e8s, x, 188.\n\n\\(^2\\) Lit. \"refractory persons\"\u2014mu\u02bf\u0101nid\u0101n.\nthat K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b was certainly aware of the fact. He therefore wrote another letter containing many threats: \"Why have you played me false, and given shelter to my enemies? If you will send the princes there will be friendship between you and me, but if you refuse, I will send a countless army to come and utterly destroy Gil\u0101n and L\u0101hij\u0101n, and make a general massacre of their inhabitants. Verily, verily, as soon as you have received this letter you must put the princes to death; or, if you do not wish to be a party to taking their blood, you must send them to me, for I shall be watching for them.\"\u00b9 K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b was very much alarmed at the receipt of this letter, and debated with his people what had best be done, since Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h had sworn to make a general massacre in Gil\u0101n if he did not send the princes. They said: \"The safest plan is that we give the princes over to them to carry away\u2014they know they are related to one another.\"\u00b2 But K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b replied: \"The more I consider the matter the more convinced I feel that Rustem M\u012brza would speedily put them to death; and how can I help and encourage him in shedding the blood of these noble youths?\" Thus pondering over the matter he retired to his haram, wondering all the while how he could possibly deliver the princes over to the envoys of Rustem. In his sleep he dreamed that the Commander of the Faithful \u2018Al\u012b appeared to him and said: \"Oh! K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b, why dost thou hesitate? Take care that thou dost not make so small a sacrifice for my son, that on the morrow of the Resurrection thou stand ashamed before me!\" At this vision his whole frame shook, and the shaking awoke him from his sleep. He then arose and went to Isma\u2018\u012bl, in order to kiss his hands and feet, if haply \u2018Al\u012b might overlook his shortcomings. Now he had given Ishma\u2018\u012bl a dwelling at the back of his haram, and at the side of it he had set apart a place for the \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs, while he had appointed some maidens to wait on Isma\u2018\u012bl. When he came\n\n\u00b9 lit. \"the eye of expectancy is on the road.\"\n\u00b2 Sense not very clear.\nround to the back he saw that the prince was talking with some person, and, leaning forward, he heard the prince say: \"May I be thy ransom? Oh! prince. One of the maidens said to me that a letter was supposed to have come from Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h, in which he made very urgent demands for me. And K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b will to-morrow deliver me into the hands of Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h's envoys.\" Having said this, he paused, and then continued: \"May I be thy ransom! The hour of my 'coming' is at hand.\" When K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 heard these words he cried out and said: \"Oh! son, open the door\"; whereupon the prince, who was asleep, awoke, and called out, \"Who art thou?\" He replied: \"I am such and such a prince.\" (Isma\u2018il) then said: \"How strange a thing this is. Didst thou feel a headache in the middle of the night? Where hast thou been? Art thou come to seize me, and deliver me over to the servants of Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h?\" The other replied: \"May I be thy ransom? May the day never come on which I should do such a thing! But tell me with whom you were just now speaking, for though I looked carefully I could perceive no one in this house.\" The prince replied: \"I was conversing with \u2018Al\u012b.\" He then related what he had heard. K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b said: \"May I be thy ransom! His Holiness has just been with me, and, in the world of visions, recommended you to me. I am now come to kiss your feet, that you may forgive me.\" The prince then forgave him, and on the morrow K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b returned to his own palace. On that same day, seated (in his audience-room), he sent for the envoy of Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h, and said to him: \"Go now, present my salutations to Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h, and say to him: 'Falsehoods have reached your ears; for what wrong have I experienced\n\n1. The word *khur\u016bj*, which means literally \"a coming out,\" is used throughout the beginning of this work to express the first appearance of Isma\u2018il to play his part in history. I can think of no better rendering into English than the word \"coming,\" applied in like manner to King Arthur of the Round Table. The word \"advent\" might also suit were it not for the almost exclusively religious signification this word has acquired.\nfrom the dynasty of \u1e24asan P\u0101dish\u0101h that I should give a shelter to their enemies and protect them? If in the course of one hundred years it should transpire that I had any news of the sons of Sult\u0101n Haidar, then am I guilty, and have committed a sin.\u201d Thereupon, having given the envoy a sum of money, he sent him away. This latter, on his return, laid before Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h what he had heard, namely, that K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 had taken an oath that he knew nothing of the sons of Sult\u0101n Haidar, and on account of the good treatment he had received in L\u0101hij\u0101n he deterred Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h from his design. But yet another of K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b\u2019s subjects came and personally represented to Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h that the sons of Sult\u0101n Haidar were with K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b, who knew all about them. At this Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h\u2019s anger was inflamed, and he despatched 300 Turkom\u0101n kurchis, saying: \u201cGo, and take Isma\u02bfil M\u012brz\u0101 and Ibr\u0101him M\u012brz\u0101 from K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b, and bring them back here. If he ill-advisedly refuse to give them up, remain there, and inform me of the fact.\u201d \u1e32\u0101sim Beg Turkom\u0101n, one of the \u201cBlack Sheep,\u201d was sent in command of this party. On his reaching L\u0101hij\u0101n, he entered the palace of K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101, and handed him Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h\u2019s letter, which ran as follows: \u201cWhy do you thus provoke me? Hand over Sult\u0101n Haidar\u2019s sons to \u1e32\u0101sim Kh\u0101n. For if you refuse I will come myself and make a general massacre in Gil\u0101n.\u201d The perusal of this letter filled K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 with anxiety, and he said: \u201cPerhaps they are in Gil\u0101n; I will make a search.\u201d He then invited \u1e32\u0101sim Beg to alight, but he was the while very anxious, and, withdrawing, went and reported the matter to the prince.\n\nNow when \u1e24usain Beg Lala, Khalif ul-Khulaf\u0101, and Abd\u0101l Beg Dede heard that Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h had sent to seize the Princes, they said: \u201cThe matter rests in the hands of God.\u201d That night \u2018Al\u012b again appeared to K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b in his sleep, and said to him: \u201cAfter a few days interval you must summon \u1e32\u0101sim Beg to your palace, and say to him that you have sent men round from house\nto house, and from door to door, but the sons of Sult\u0101n Haidar are not in this kingdom, and then say: \u2018If you do not believe me, I will take an oath that they are not in the land of Gil\u0101n.\u2019 Now before taking your oath you must attach a rope to a tree, and to the rope you must fasten a basket, which must thus hang from the tree. In this basket you must place the Prince, and then in the presence of the envoys of Rustem P\u0101dish\u0101h, swear with your hand on the K\u016br\u0101n that Isma\u2018il is not in the land of Gil\u0101n. In this way your oath will not be false.\u201d A few days later, in accordance with the directions of the Commander of the Faithful, K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b entered his palace and summoned K\u0101sim Beg. He then having exactly carried out the instructions of the Prophet \u2018Al\u012b, sent the envoys back to Rustem M\u012brz\u0101. This latter now understood by the sending of messengers and Turkom\u0101n chiefs to L\u0101hij\u0101n, K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b was in no way to be deterred from his unselfish devotion, or made to confess the presence of the Princes and \u0160\u016bf\u012bs in his state; he, therefore, determined to send a powerful army into that land, which might with force and violence seize the Princes.\n\nIt was while he was engaged in such evil meditations that God filled the cousins\u00b9 with a desire to exterminate one another, and so degenerate had the Turkom\u0101n Sult\u0101ns become that they fell upon one another, verifying the words: \u201cBy God, tyrants have to do with tyrants\u201d; and were unable to occupy themselves with anything beyond their own mutual contentions. For this reason the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs and disciples were able to enjoy free intercourse with Isma\u2018il, some returning immediately after their interview with him, others remaining in Gil\u0101n. Thus, with the approval of K\u0101rgiy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b, they firmly established Isma\u2018il, in the manner of his great fathers and ancestors, upon the throne of Religious Guidance. In spite of his tender years, for he was at that time but seven years of age, he was a model of intelligence, perspicacity, and sound\n\n\u00b9 Namely, Rustem Beg and \u0100\u1e25mad Beg.\njudgment, and his devoted followers, out of the abundance of their faith, called him \"The Perfect Guide\" and \"P\u0101dish\u0101h.\" In that beautiful town\u00b9 he grew up and developed. Sometimes he would participate in the pleasures of the chase, or visit the pleasant spots of that country; and he always showed signs of possessing a conqueror's genius. Thus pleasantly did he pass his time, until the hour arrived for him to come out of that country and appear (before the world). After we have spoken of the downfall of the Turkom\u0101ns and the extinction of the White Sheep, we will, God permitting, give an account of the \"Coming\" of Isma'il.\n\nHere follows the promised account of the \"Downfall of the Turkom\u0101ns,\" of which, corresponding as it does to a large extent with the same episode in the \u1e24ab\u012bb-us-Siyar, I give a translation only; at the same time showing throughout to what extent the two histories tally with one another.\n\nRustem P\u0101dish\u0101h is Killed and A\u1e25mad Beg Mounts the Throne of \u012ar\u0101n.\u00b2\n\nIt has been already mentioned that after the death of Sult\u0101n Ya\u1e33\u016bb, son of Hasan P\u0101dish\u0101h, the Turkom\u0101n chiefs split up into two factions, the one supporting B\u0101\u02beisunk\u0101r M\u012brz\u0101 and the other Mas\u012b\u1e25 M\u012brz\u0101, who was in Sult\u0101nl\u016b\u00b3 in K\u0101r\u0101b\u0101gh. The party of B\u0101\u02beisunk\u0101r M\u012brz\u0101 gaining the upper hand put Mas\u012b\u1e25 M\u012brz\u0101 to death.

In this year \u1e24asan \u2018Al\u012b Tarkh\u0101n\u012b, being enraged at the evil deeds of Rustem M\u012brz\u0101, went to R\u016bm and begged the Emperor to give him over A\u1e25mad Beg, declaring that there was no one in Ir\u0101n who would not welcome him as king. \u201cIf you will send an army with him, he will, in all probability, bring under his sway the kingdom that is his by right of inheritance.\u201d In answer to the appeal of \u1e24asan \u2018Al\u012b Tarkh\u0101n\u012b the Emperor sent A\u1e25mad Beg into Di\u0101r Bakr and [Azarb\u0101\u012bj\u0101n with a regiment of R\u016bmis.] As soon as the rumour of their advance was spread about in the country of Azarb\u0101\u012bj\u0101n, the Turkom\u0101n chiefs, turning traitors, went over to the side of A\u1e25mad Beg. \u1e24usain Beg \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n\u012b, having put to death in Sult\u0101niyya, \u2018Abdulkar\u012bm Beg Lala, one of Rustem M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s chiefs, read the khutba in the name of A\u1e25mad Beg. Rustem M\u012brz\u0101 hearing of these things was dumbfounded, and set out from Tabr\u012bz with his chiefs and a large army to repel A\u1e25mad Beg. [The two forces met and fought a pitched battle on the banks of the river Aras. In the heat of the fight Abiya Sult\u0101n Turkom\u0101n, with a riotous band of deserters, broke the line of the army and went over to the side of A\u1e25mad Beg. Rustem M\u012brz\u0101 was thus caught in the claws of fate, and being taken prisoner was hamstrung at the order of A\u1e25mad Beg, who thus rid of his rival, entered Tabr\u012bz and established himself upon the throne.] [He showed special favour to \u1e24usain Beg \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n\u012b, and distinguished him with increase of dignity and rank. \u1e24usain Beg, on account of\n\n1 Probably a variation of Tarkh\u0101n\u012b.

Kw\u0101ndam\u012br here begins a fresh chapter entitled \u201cThe Accession of A\u1e25mad P\u0101d\u012bsh\u0101h to the throne of Azarb\u0101\u012bj\u0101n, and his death at the hands of Abiya Sult\u0101n.\u201d\nthe enmity he had long cherished for Muzaffar Beg Parn\u0101k, having drawn him into a quarrel, killed him with his sword. When K\u0101sim Beg Parn\u0101k, Muzaffar\u2019s brother, heard of this in Sh\u012br\u0101z, where he was governor, he only waited his opportunity to avenge his brother\u2019s blood. At length Ahm\u0101d Beg appointed Abiya Sult\u0101n governor of Kirm\u0101n, from which place Abiya Sult\u0101n sent a message to K\u0101sim Beg inciting him to revenge his brother\u2019s blood; and a compact was confirmed between the two Am\u012brs that they should together raise the flag of revolt from that quarter. For this reason Abiya Sult\u0101n set out for the tomb of the mother of Sulaim\u0101n,\u00b9 where he was met by K\u0101sim Beg. Here they put to death all the servants of Ahm\u0101d Beg, who were with K\u0101sim Beg, and read the khus\u016bba in Abiya Sult\u0101n\u2019s name. They then decided to send for Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d, son of Sult\u0101n Ya\u02bfk\u016bb, son of \u1e24asan P\u0101dish\u0101h, who was with his uncle Sult\u0101n Farrukh Yas\u0101r, in Shirw\u0101n, and set him up as king; while the two Am\u012brs should be his prime ministers (wakil). They therefore sent an \u2018a\u1e25d-n\u0101ma to Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d, in Shirw\u0101n.\u00b2 After this they began to violate the property of the inhabitants of that country and to extort large sums of money from the men. Then those two ill-starred ones together led a large force against Isfah\u0101n. And when Ahm\u0101d Beg, in Tabriz, heard of these doings he set out by forced marches with a powerful army to Isfahan to oppose them, and overtook them in Alang Kaniz and Khw\u0101ja Hasan M\u0101zi.\u00b3 A party of the Turkom\u0101ns, deserting Abiya Sult\u0101n, went over to the side of Ahm\u0101d Beg, and Abiya Sult\u0101n, perceiving this, lost confidence and fled. Ahm\u0101d Beg\u2019s men seeing the helplessness of the enemy left Ahm\u0101d Beg and gave them chase, plundering as they went the baggage of Abiya.\n\n\u00b9 Mashad-i-m\u0101dari-Sulaim\u0101n; this is no doubt a corruption of masjid-i-m\u0101dari-Sulaim\u0101n, a name which the Persians still give to the tomb of Cyrus in the plain of Pasargad\u0113. Cf. Browne, \u201cA Year among the Persians,\u201d and Ouseley, ii. 44 et seq.\n\u00b2 L., fol. 39a.\n\u00b3 There seems to be some confusion here in the narrative. The \u1e24ab\u012bb-us-Siyar mentions only one encounter, namely in Kaniz Alang-i-Isfah\u0101n.\nSult\u0101n and K\u0101sim Beg. Abiya Sult\u0101n, recognizing his opportunity, charged down on A\u1e25mad Beg\u00b9 and threw him from the saddle of glory on to the ground of humiliation, and cutting off his head stuck it on the end of his spear and sounded the horn of triumph. When the soldiers of A\u1e25mad Beg saw what had happened they turned in flight [while Abiya Sult\u0101n, crowned with victory, turned towards the town of Kum, where he read the khatba and had coins struck in the name of Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d.\u00b2 He then sent a swift messenger to Sh\u012brw\u0101n to fetch Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d, while he himself mounted the throne of Kum, and was waited on by the chiefs as a Sult\u0101n; and he busied himself daily with the settlement of important business pending the arrival of Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d.]\n\nAbiya Sult\u0101n is killed and is succeeded by Mohammadi P\u0101dish\u0101h, who is in turn killed and succeeded by Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d in \u2018Ir\u0101k, and by Amir Alwand in Azarb\u0101ij\u0101n.\u00b3\n\nA\u1e25mad Beg, on account of his small stature and short legs and arms, had received from the Emperor B\u0101yazid the nick-name of Kad\u016bcha\u2074 A\u1e25mad.

Mur\u0101d Beg B\u0101yandari and Ashraf Beg, having amassed an army, set out under the command of Mohammadi P\u0101dish\u0101h towards Sh\u012br\u0101z, whose Governor, K\u0101sim Beg Parn\u0101k, came out with an army to offer him fight. After [the first] encounter K\u0101sim Beg turned in flight, and with great difficulty managed to throw himself into \u0160\u0101in Kal'a. Meanwhile [Mohammadi P\u0101dish\u0101h] having become master of the province of F\u0101rs, appointed Mans\u016br Beg Afsh\u0101r governor of Sh\u012br\u0101z, [and set out himself against \u2018Ir\u0101\u1e33, which, having conquered, he pitched his camp in Rai.]\u00b9\n\n[But Abiya Sult\u0101n, Turkom\u0101n, who had fixed his winter-quarters in the town of Kum at the beginning of the spring, set out for Tabr\u012bz].

This latter, on hearing this news, pushed forward to meet him, and an engagement took place in which he defeated Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d and made him prisoner, confining him in the castle of Rubandar. Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d's mother, the daughter of Sult\u0101n Khal\u012bl Sh\u012brw\u0101nsh\u0101h, he made his own wife.

The account which Khw\u0101ndam\u012br gives of the downfall of the Black and the White Sheep dynasties is not a very full or consecutive one, but our author tells us even less about them.

Mohammadi was assisted by special divine favour, while Sult\u0101n Abiya was thrown upon the ground of destruction. Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d, accompanied by Guzel A\u1e25mad, fled towards Sh\u012br\u0101z, while Mohammadi made a triumphant entry into Tabriz, where he mounted the throne.\n\nBeginning of Alwand\u2019s Reign, and End of Mohammadi M\u012brz\u0101.\n\nWhen Am\u012brz\u0101da Alwand came to Di\u0101r Bakr, after the battle of Kan\u012bz Alang, K\u0101sim Beg conferred on him the title of king.

Now K\u0101sim Beg Parn\u0101k, who before that battle in which Abiya Sult\u0101n was killed, had\n\nexercised absolute direction in state affairs, so that not merely did the rest of the nobles have no voice in the government, but even the king was powerless. So arrogant and assuming was he that Alwand Mirz\u0101 became disgusted with him, and one night, together with many of the nobles, who shared his feelings, he got away from K\u0101sim Beg and went to Azarb\u0101ij\u0101n. When Mohammadi heard of his brother's advance at the head of a brave army, thinking he could not oppose him, he hastened to Sult\u0101niyya.\n\nAlwand Mirz\u0101 entering Azarb\u0101ij\u0101n without (even the hindrance of) the exchange of messages, raised the banner of sovereignty, appointing Khw\u0101ja S\u0101bik-ud-D\u012bn his vizier and Lu\u1e6df Beg his wakil.\nstarted out with a squadron of horse for Shir\u0101z, and in an encounter in Sh\u016blist\u0101n\u00b9 in F\u0101rs, was defeated and taken prisoner by the governor of that district. But as they passed near I\u0161takhr, he contrived to escape, and shut himself up in that fortress. When he heard of the approach of Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d and G\u00fczel A\u1e25mad, he came out of the fortress and joined them, giving them many goods and effects which he had taken from the inhabitants of Shir\u0101z.\u00b2 They all now proceeded together to Shir\u0101z, and Man\u1e63\u016br Beg Afsh\u0101r, deeming resistance useless, fled.\u00b3\n\nSult\u0101n Mur\u0101d, having entered Shir\u0101z, busied himself with preparations for a military expedition. Having established perfect order in Shir\u0101z, he appointed K\u0101sim Beg Parn\u0101k to the governorship, and then set out with a powerful force for Isfah\u0101n. When Mohammadi P\u0101dish\u0101h, in Sult\u0101niyya, heard of this, he marched out with the chiefs of the \u1e2ar\u0101\u1e33 frontier towards Isfah\u0101n, where he heard that Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d was advancing from F\u0101rs.

On the same day that Abd\u0101l Beg entered Mur\u0101d\u2019s service he migrated from S\u0101wa to Azarb\u0101ij\u0101n.\n\n\\(^3\\) L, 416.\n\n\\(^4\\) The Habib-us-Siyar says S\u0101in Kal\u0101 instead of Abhar.\n\n\\(^5\\) Detail omitted by Khw\u0101ndam\u012br.\n\n\\(^6\\) Khw\u0101ndam\u012br omits Mugh\u0101n from the list.\nAlwand, while Sultan Mur\u0101d was to govern the states of \u2018Ir\u0101k, F\u0101rs, and Kirm\u0101n. After the ratification of this treaty, Amir Alwand returned to Tabriz and Sultan Mur\u0101d to Kazwin.] Many of the Afsh\u0101r and Turkom\u0101n chiefs, who had revolted, now came to Sultan Mur\u0101d and begged his forgiveness. Some he punished\u00b9 and others he re-appointed governors or amirs.\u00b2\n\nThe chapters now succeeding, apart from telling us much about Isma\u2018il that we cannot learn from the \u1e24ab\u012bb-us-Siyar, have a special interest of their own, for Dede Mohammad\u2019s story, whatever may be its historical value, is of sufficient curiosity to merit reproduction.

rebellions of the Turkom\u0101n chiefs, he desired to leave Lahij\u0101n and go to Ardabil, that, with the spiritual aid of his saintly ancestors, he might clear the flower-garden of religion of the chaff and rubbish of insubordination. When he expressed this desire to some of his disciples and \u0160\u016bf\u012bs, they knowing that his \"coming\" was near at hand, bound the girdle of obedience and self-\nsacrifice round their souls and became expectant. Isma'il then sent one of his disciples to K\u0101rgiy\u0101 Mirz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b to announce to him his intentions, and to obtain leave for him to depart. But K\u0101rgiy\u0101 Mirz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b, considering the tender years of Isma'il (who was then only twelve years of age), and his lack of allies, and the numbers and strength of his enemies, would not allow him to leave the country, but said: \u201cIt is not yet time for his \u2018coming.\u2019 It is wisest for him to wait a little longer.\u201d The \u1e62\u016bf\u012b returning, delivered K\u0101rgiy\u0101 Mirz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b's message, in compliance with which Isma'il remained where he was. A few days later he went and visited K\u0101rgiy\u0101 Mirz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b in person, and explained to him\u00b9 his project of leaving L\u0101hij\u0101n for Ardabil. Mirz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b again begged him to abandon his plan, but this time Isma'il refused (to listen to him), and so Mirz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b was obliged to turn his attention to some of the necessary preparations.]\u00b2 On the following day Isma'il rode out hunting with some of his disciples. Not far from Lashta Nash\u0101 they arrived at the edge of a dense forest. Isma'il, having crossed a river which flowed by there, said to his companions: \u201cNo one of you is to follow me across this river, but you are to await my return on the other side.\u201d Isma'il then entered the forest, and no one knew what had become of him until he came out again. How Isma'il was girt with a belt; how he came out of the forest bearing a sword suspended from a sword-belt;\u00b3 and the other \u201csigns\u201d which the \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs witnessed, will appear from the account of Dede Mohammad R\u00fcml\u00fc, which is given below. This man was a \u1e62\u016bf\u012b and a darwish, gifted with second sight,\u2074 an Ar\u016bm \u0130li,\u2075 and in the year 907 had the honour of kissing the \u201cPerfect Guide\u2019s\u201d feet in the market-place called \u015eahib-\u0101b\u0101d in Tabr\u012bz. He also describes\n\n\u00b9 lit. \u201csaid to him with the tongue of divine inspiration.\u201d\n\u00b2 The \u1e24ab\u012bb-us-Siyar here mentions that Mirz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b escorted Isma'il on the first stages of his journey to Ardabil, and then turned back.

He had once waited on Sult\u0101n Junaid, and twice on Sult\u0101n Haidar, who had sent him with forty \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs to a *chilla-kh\u0101na*,\\(^3\\) where each had a jug of water and a loaf of bread as their sustenance during the period of fasting [*chilla*]. When this period was over they came out of the *chilla-kh\u0101na*. All of them had consumed their provisions, excepting only \u1e24asan Khal\u012bfa, who brought his untouched to \u201cHis Holiness,\u201d\\(^4\\) who then sent him back to Tike \u0130li, having first given him a promise with regard to the appearance and coming of Isma'il. When he returned to the aforesaid \u0130li he performed many miracles and uttered prophecies, repeatedly announcing to pious \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs the coming of Isma'il. On leaving this world he bequeathed his \u201cthrone\u201d\\(^5\\) to his son B\u0101b\u0101 Sh\u0101h Kuli, who was also a revealer of mysteries and a worker of wonders, and gave him an *abla\u1e33*\\(^6\\) saying: \u201cIn the year 907 our Guide will mount the throne of \u012ar\u0101n in Tabr\u012bz. This is a present entrusted to me [*im\u0101nat*]\u201d\n\n---\n\n1 The Twelfth Im\u0101m.\n2 The K\u0131z\u0131lb\u0101\u015f were composed of seven principal tribes, namely, 1. U\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101jl\u0101, 2. Sh\u0101ml\u016b, 3. Tikeli (often falsely given as *Nikallu*), 4. Bah\u0101rl\u016b, 5. Zu\u2019lkadr, 6. Kaj\u0101r, 7. Afsh\u0101r.\n3 *Chilla* is a religious fast of forty days duration; the *chilla-kh\u0101na* is a place of seclusion to which the pious retire during the fast. For some interesting remarks on the subject, see Olearius, Adam. *Persianische Reise = Beschreibung*, 1656, p. 464.\n4 Sult\u0101n Haidar. See note above.\n5 Saints are spoken of as succeeding each other to the throne (of spiritual guidance). They many of them even bear the titles of Sult\u0101n and P\u0101d\u012bsh\u0101h. Thus Isma'il, before he came to temporal power, is spoken of as a \u201cprince,\u201d as are also his brothers.\n6 *Abla\u1e33* must mean a precious stone of some sort, probably of changing colours. (I cannot find it in any dictionary applied to stones or jewels.)\nfor that prince\u2014give it him with my salutations.\u201d So B\u0101b\u0101 Sh\u0101h Kuli awaited the appointed time. In the year 905 Dede Mohammad, who was a disciple of Khalifa, desiring to make the pilgrimage to Mekka, asked the permission of B\u0101b\u0101 Sh\u0101h Kuli, who said to him: \u201cYou have permission, go; but when you have completed your pilgrimage to Mekka you will visit the Holy Shrines\u00b9 (in Babylonia) and thence go to Tabriz. On the first day of your arrival there the time will have come for one of the sons of purity and goodness, and he will have become p\u0101dish\u0101h, having caused coins to be struck and the kh\u016b\u1e6dba read in his name; you will find him playing polo in the square [maid\u0101n] of Tabr\u012bz. You will go to him and greet him from me and give him this abl\u0101k to fasten on his crown.\u201d Dede Mohammad, having accepted the im\u0101nat, set out for Mekka. When he had performed the circuit of Mekka and visited Medina, he turned towards Baghd\u0101d. Between Medina the sanctified\u00b2 and Baghd\u0101d he got separated from the caravan and was overcome by sleep. On awaking he could find no trace of the caravan, and for three days he wandered through that desert, supported only by his spiritual power,\u00b3 until at length he fell exhausted to the ground, and his tongue hung out of his mouth: from sheer thirst he longed for death. When the mid-day sun shone straight down upon him he perceived an Arab youth riding towards him, who coming up to him said: \u201cOh! darwish, arise, for thou art not far from cultivated land.\u201d The darwish indicated by signs that he was too feeble to walk. The youth then took his hand, and no sooner was his hand in that of the youth than he felt all his strength return. So he arose and was led by the youth towards a hill; when they reached the summit of the hill he looked around and saw that as far\n\n\u00b9 \u2018Atab\u0101t, lit. the threeholds.\n\u00b2 I have thus translated the epithet b\u0101 taskinat, which means \u201cunder divine influence.\u201d\n\u00b3 Darv\u012bshi, that is, the degree of continence and endurance he had attained to by leading the strict life of a darwish.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nas the eye could reach the plains were covered with verdure and roses and tulips, and that gold-embroidered tents and silk canopies had been spread out. Turning to his companion he said: \"Oh! Arab youth, no one ever saw such a place as this in the deserts of Mekka and the Najaf-i-Ashraf.\" What place is this? and who is the lord of these tents and palaces?\" The young Arab replied, \"You will know afterward?\" He then walked by the young man's side, until they came to a palace, whose cupola out-rivalled the sun and moon. They then entered, and a delightful apartment met his view, the like of which he had never seen. Golden thrones were arranged side by side, and on one of the thrones a person was seated whose face was covered with a veil. Dede Mohammad, placing his hand on his breast, made a salutation, whereupon an answer to his salutation came from the veiled one, who having bidden him be seated, ordered food to be brought for him. The like of this food he had never seen in his life before. They also brought some cold water, which Dede Mohammad drank, nor had he ever tasted such refreshing water. As soon as he had finished his repast, he saw that a party of men had entered, bringing a boy of about fourteen years of age, with red (surkh) hair, a white face, and dark-grey eyes; on his head was a scarlet cap. Being entered he made a salutation and stood still; the veiled youth then said to him: \"Oh! Isma'il, the hour of your 'coming' has now arrived.\" The other replied: \"It is for your Holiness to command.\" The prince then said: \"Come forward.\" He came forward, and His Holiness taking his belt three times lifted it up and placed it on the ground again. He then, with his own blessed hands, fastened on the girdle, and taking (Isma'il's) cap from his head, raised it and then replaced it. He wore a Kurdish belt-dagger; this His Holiness took from him and threw\n\n1 Najaf is the tract of country in which Karbal\u0101 is situate.\n2 Mish-chashm, lit. sheep-eyed.\n3 This passage is rather obscure. I am not sure whether him (Isma'il) or it (the belt) is intended.\nto the darwish, saying: \"Keep this, for it will stand you in stead.\" His Holiness then told his servants to bring his own sword, which, when brought, he fastened with his own hands to the girdle of the child. Then he said \"You may now depart.\" Having recited the Fat\u012b\u1e25a he entrusted the child to the two or three persons who had brought him in. When they had taken the child away, he made a sign to the young Arab to lead the darwish back to his caravan; and having brought him to it, said: \"This is the caravan from which you were separated.\" When Mohammad Dede saw the caravan he said: \"Oh! youth, tell me, for God's sake, who that prince was and who the child?\" He replied: \"Did you not know that the prince whom you saw was no other than the Lord of the Age?\"\u00b9 When Dede Mohammad heard this name he stood up and said: \"Oh! youth, for the love of God, take me back again that I may once more kiss the feet of His Holiness, and ask a blessing of him, perchance I might be allowed to wait on him.\" But the youth replied: \"It is impossible. You should have made your request at the first. You cannot return. But you can make your request where you will, for His Holiness\u00b2 is everywhere present and will hear your prayers.\" The darwish then sought to return, but he could no longer see the rider, and ascending to the summit of the hill looked around in vain for any signs of those flowers and palaces. He uttered a deep sigh, and saw that his caravan had gone on far ahead. He was therefore obliged to rejoin the caravan. The rest of Dede Mohammad R\u016bml\u016b's story, and how he went to wait on Isma'il, will be related among the events of the year 907.\n\n\u00b9 The twelfth Im\u0101m.\n\u00b2 S\u0101\u1e25ib-ul-amr, the Lord of Command, another epithet for the twelfth Im\u0101m.\nIsma'il Comes Out of the Forest, and Sets on his Road with Seven Sufis.\n\nThe Sufis, who, in obedience to Isma'il's command, were awaiting him on the bank of the river near the forest, at the end of about two hours, seeing no signs of him, began to grow uneasy and anxious for his safety. But since they had been forbidden to cross the river, they could not enter the forest to see if anything had occurred to the \"Guide.\" In the midst of their anxiety they perceived Isma'il emerging from the forest with dignity, with a sword attached to his girdle, but without his belt-dagger. The Sufis, on seeing this, prostrated themselves before Isma'il, and so much overcome were they with awe and dread that not one of them dared examine closely those \"signs.\" Having all gathered round Isma'il, they held council as to which road the \"Perfect Guide\" had better take, and they finally decided that he should go to Ardabil by way of T\u0101rm. At this juncture K\u0101rgiyy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b arrived, bringing necessaries for the journey, and again he tried to persuade Isma'il to remain with him, but to no effect. He was therefore obliged to accommodate himself to his wishes, and Isma'il, placing the foot of success in the stirrup of good fortune, set out from L\u0101hij\u0101n towards Arjw\u0101n, while K\u0101rgiyy\u0101 M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b and a party of Sufis accompanied him for a distance of two farsangs. He then left the Prince to proceed on his way under the protection of the King of Bounties, while he himself returned to the castle of L\u0101hij\u0101n. Isma'il now turned in the direction of Dailam, accompanied by seven Sufis, namely: \u1e24usain Beg L\u0113la, Abd\u0101l \u2018Al\u012b Beg Dede, Kh\u0101dim Beg Khalifa, Rustem Beg Kar\u0101 M\u0101nl\u016b, Bair\u0101m Beg Kar\u0101 M\u0101ul\u016b, Ily\u0101s Beg Aigh\u016bth Ughli, and Kar\u0101 Piri Beg Kaj\u0101r. They stayed in Dailam, and thence proceeded to T\u0101rm, being joined at every stage on their road by Sufis from Sh\u0101m and R\u016bm, so that when Isma'il alighted in T\u0101rm he had\nan army of about 1500 devoted \u0160\u016bf\u012bs. But since he did not place any trust in Am\u012bra Hass\u0101m-ud-D\u012bn, for it was always said of this person that he was evilly disposed towards that blessed family, Isma\u02bf\u012bl left T\u0101rm to go to Khalkh\u0101l. (The first) halt was made in the village of Barandak, whence they hastened next morning to some cultivated ground belonging to the Sh\u0101ml\u016b, and known as Sh\u0101m K\u0131z\u0131l \u00dcz\u00fcn. Now this place was noted for the sweet quality of its water-melons [kharb\u016bza], and Isma\u02bf\u012bl being especially fond of this fruit, they remained there several days, and were entertained by Shaikh K\u0101sim in the most hospitable way possible. And not being satisfied with his own hospitality, he further ordered forty roast sheep to be brought for their consumption. A few days later Isma\u02bf\u012bl moved on to the village of Nas\u0101z in Khalkh\u0101l, thence to the village of K\u00fcyi in Khalkh\u0101l, where he stayed with Malik Muzaffar T\u00fck\u0101j\u012b Sult\u0101n, son of the blessed martyr, Sult\u0101n \u2018Ali P\u0101dish\u0101h, known as Khalfa. After a short stay he set out for the village of Hafz\u0101b\u0101d in Ardab\u012bl, thence to the village of Al\u0101r\u016bk, and thence he came to Ardab\u012bl, where, having visited the tombs of his ancestors and the saints, and having prayed God to help him to overcome the enemies of the Faith, he entered his own dwelling. At this time he received a message from Sult\u0101n \u2018Ali Beg Kh\u0101kirl\u00fc, Turkom\u0101n, who was governing Ardab\u012bl and Magh\u0101nat for Am\u012br Alwand, saying that it was not safe for Isma\u02bf\u012bl to remain in Ardab\u012bl. \u201cYou must either go to some other country or else be prepared to fight.\u201d And since at that time his following was small and his enemies many, Isma\u02bf\u012bl did not deem it wise to engage in a battle, and he therefore moved from Ardab\u012bl to the village of Mirm\u012b.\n\nIsma\u02bf\u012bl makes Arjw\u0101n his Winter-Quarters.\n\nMohammadi Beg, husband of P\u0101sh\u0101 Kh\u0101t\u016bn, who had enjoyed the privilege of kissing the prince\u2019s feet, now represented to him that it would be wisest for him to take\nup his winter-quarters in \u1e6caw\u0101l\u012bsh,\\(^1\\) and make that his centre for collecting together his helpers and allies; this advice Isma\u02bfil followed, and since Mohammadi Beg had long-standing ties with M\u012brz\u0101 Mohammad Sult\u0101n, Isma\u02bfil sent him to this latter. When Mohammadi Beg arrived in Ast\u0101r\u0101, he went to M\u012brz\u0101 Mohammad Sult\u0101n, and with words of counsel brought him back to the path of discipleship and devotion. M\u012brz\u0101 Mohammad Sult\u0101n, on learning the approach of Isma\u02bfil into his dominions, without delay, hastened out to receive him in State, along with Mohammadi Beg and the nobles of \u1e6caw\u0101l\u012bsh. Having kissed the feet of the \u201cPerfect Guide,\u201d he represented to him: \u201cThis country belongs to your servants.\\(^2\\) I hear the Prince meditates passing the winter in this country. This slave would be highly gratified if he might be allowed to wait on the Prince for a few days.\u201d Accepting his invitation, Isma\u02bfil alighted in Arjw\u0101n, one of the villages of Ast\u0101r\u0101, while (M\u012brz\u0101 Mohammad Sult\u0101n) exerted himself to the utmost to give him pleasure and satisfaction. Isma\u02bfil spent most of his time fishing, of which sport he was very fond. M\u012brz\u0101 Mohammad Sult\u0101n, having appointed his own mother, together with a few maidens, to wait on the Prince, himself returned to his own residence; being, however, at all times anxious to attend to the Prince\u2019s wants.\n\nWhen Sult\u0101n \u2018Ali Beg Ch\u0101kirl\u016b heard of Isma\u02bfil\u2019s migration to \u1e6caw\u0101l\u012bsh, he sent the information to Am\u012br Alwand M\u012brz\u0101 in Tabr\u012bz; at the receipt of which news Alwand M\u012brz\u0101 was dumbfounded, and sent back the following message: \u201cSince there is a long-standing alliance between you and M\u012brz\u0101 Mohammad, do all in your power to set him against Isma\u02bfil.\u201d Then that wretched man, after much reflection, sent a messenger to the mother of M\u012brz\u0101 Mohammad Sult\u0101n, to deceive her with fine promises, and induce her to plot against Isma\u02bfil. And that foolish woman, having swallowed the vain promises of Alwand\n\n\\(^1\\) T\u0101l\u012bsh or \u1e6caw\u0101l\u012bsh; the plural form signifies the district.\n\\(^2\\) Sense of text a little obscure.\nMirz\u0101, suggested to Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b Beg Ch\u0101gir\u016b that since Isma\u2018il went out fishing every day, they might (one day) push him into the water; and so, together, with Amir Hamza of T\u0101l\u012bsh, chief judiciary of Mirz\u0101 Mohammad of T\u0101l\u012bsh, they were on the watch for an opportunity of doing so. But Mirz\u0101 Mohammad Sult\u0101n, getting wind of the plot of these two impious persons, checked and reprimanded his mother, and treated Amir Hamza of T\u0101l\u012bsh with severity and contempt: he continued also to try and trace the origin of the plot. Amir Agh\u0101i Gil\u0101n\u012b, hearing of these matters, went to Lala Beg and Kh\u0101dim Beg and told them of the treachery of these two worthless persons, and of the efforts of Mirz\u0101 Mohammad to discover the secret. Lala Beg and Kh\u0101dim Beg, being much alarmed, went and laid the matter before the \u201cPerfect Guide.\u201d When Mirz\u0101 Mohammad heard that Isma\u2018il had been thus informed, he was confounded, and hastened to his dwelling, and took an oath before him saying: \u201cI knew absolutely nothing of this plot, and when I was informed of it I checked and reprimanded my mother.\u201d Since his oath was allied to the truth, it was believed by Isma\u2018il and the \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs. (Verse) of every word that is allied to good faith and good sense, the truth is apparent to all.\n\nNow some have related this story in the following fashion.\u00b9 Mohammadi Beg, Ahmadi Beg\u2019s brother, was at that date living with Mirz\u0101 Mohammad Sult\u0101n. Amir Alwand Mirz\u0101 sent a messenger to Mirz\u0101 Mohammad and Mohammadi Beg saying that he would give them the government [iy\u0101lat] of Ardabil and Khalkh\u0101l, on the condition that they would seize and send Isma\u2018il to him. Mirz\u0101 Mohammad began to meditate which of these two prizes he would relinquish. But Mohammadi Beg, concerned at the other\u2019s reflections, said to him: \u201cIt is impossible that you should, by means of the deceitful promises of Alwand Mirz\u0101, renounce the happiness of this world and the next! You must not, upon the entreaty of the lord of envy and malice, strew upon\n\n\u00b9 Notice again our author\u2019s accuracy and care in obtaining information.\nyour own head the earth of perdition and ignominy! For thereby the people of T\u0101l\u012bsh would enjoy an evil reputation till the end of the world. Only what is decreed by destiny will come to pass. And when would T\u0101l\u012bsh allow you to commit such a heinous offence for the sake of government in this base world. (verses) How can a man who plans evil deeds ever again recognize goodness? How can he that plants the branch of harmfulness cull the fruit of advantage?\" M\u012brz\u0101 Mohamm\u0101d, at the wise words of Mohamm\u0101d\u012b Beg, fell to thinking of his own end, and entirely discarded his intention from his thoughts.\n\nIn the meanwhile Sult\u0101n Farrukh Yas\u0101r, the Shirw\u0101nsh\u0101h, sent a message to M\u012brz\u0101 Mohamm\u0101d, saying: \"I will pay you 1000 tum\u0101ns ready money if you will send Isma\u02bf\u012bl bound to me.\" As it was several days since M\u012brz\u0101 Mohamm\u0101d had waited on Isma\u02bf\u012bl, he now, accompanied by a large number of T\u0101l\u012bsh men, brought Shirw\u0101nsh\u0101h's letter to him. But before he arrived, the \"Perfect Guide\" had been informed that Shirw\u0101nsh\u0101h had written a letter, and that M\u012brz\u0101 Mohamm\u0101d was coming to find him with a number of people. On hearing these facts the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs, among them \u1e24usain Beg Lala, Kh\u0101dim Beg Khal\u012bfa, Bair\u0101m Beg Kar\u0101 M\u0101l\u016bl\u016b, Abd\u0101l \u2018Al\u012b Beg Dede, and Ily\u0101s Beg, grew apprehensive lest some harm might befall the Prince at the hands of M\u012brz\u0101 Mohamm\u0101d, and by way of caution they decided that all his servants should put on chain-shirts under their cloaks and be all armed in readiness for a conflict. Thus, if M\u012brz\u0101 Mohamm\u0101d and his men had hostile intentions, the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs, attacking them from right and left, would put those lords of insubordination to the sword. If, on the other hand, they came to do homage to the \"Perfect Guide,\" there could, at any rate, be no harm in their precautions. So these pious men armed themselves fully, and formed a group around the Prince. At this juncture M\u012brz\u0101 Mohamm\u0101d and his men approached Isma\u02bf\u012bl's camp. The Prince thereupon sent out Kh\u0101dim Beg and Dede Beg to receive him, and to discover warily his real intentions, and report the result of their examination\nto the Prince. When Mirz\u0101 Mo\u1e25ammad perceived these chiefs from afar, he dismounted from his steed, and, having embraced them and expressed to them his absolute devotion to the Prince\u2019s cause, said: \u201cSeeing that it is a long while since I had the felicity of kissing the feet of the \u2018Perfect Guide,\u2019 I am now hastening to his blessed threshold with this intent.\u201d The chiefs then returned and reported to Isma\u02bf\u012bl how matters lay; whereupon this latter sent for Mirz\u0101 Mo\u1e25ammad, who, through the medium of the chiefs, was allowed the honour of kissing the Prince\u2019s feet. After this he showed him Shirw\u0101nsh\u0101h\u2019s letter, and represented to him the evil intentions of that wicked man. Then, in the presence of the chiefs, he placed his hand upon the Kor\u0101n and took an oath, saying: \u201cNo other thoughts than those of service and devotion have entered the mind of this your servant. Nor would I, for the sake of worldly power and riches for the brief span of life, digress from the path of loyalty and self-sacrifice, and thus be deluded by the enemies of this saintly house. Nevertheless I, your single-minded servant, who thus make my representations to the \u2018Perfect Guide,\u2019 well know that the Prince has entertained suspicions of treachery and faithlessness in my regard. In order to dispel these misgivings and doubts, I have rushed headlong to wait on the Prince, and I hope that in the light of my devotion to himself he will refuse to listen to such stories about his servant.\u201d (verse) It is illicit to entertain evil thoughts of well-wishers, give up such bad notions! The Prince then bestowed splendid robes upon Mirz\u0101 Mo\u1e25ammad, and to each of his men he gave a robe of honour. With promises of unstinted bounty and royal favours, he reassured (Mirz\u0101 Mo\u1e25ammad of his satisfaction). That day Mirz\u0101 Mo\u1e25ammad was the Prince\u2019s companion at his meals, and on the next day, having obtained permission to return to his home, he set out for his seat of government. Isma\u02bf\u012bl furthermore allowed those \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs, which he had retained in his army, to return to their homes, to rejoin him on the New Year\u2019s Day.\nIsma'il Moves from his Winter-Quarters and (by the Help of God's Favour) comes to Ardabil.\n\nThe days of winter having reached their limit, again the fanning breezes of spring noised abroad in every quarter the advent of the royal New Year's-Day: while the senses of all men became perfumed with the odorous, amber-scented breath of the variegated flowers. The vegetation of the meadows, which from fear of the army of Cold had withdrawn its head beneath its cloak, now lifted its head above the ground to welcome that victorious day, and decked garden and field with flowers of various hues, as had they been brides. Hill and dale, verdant and bright with their many coloured tulips, became the envy of the garden of Iram.\n\nIsma'il, having celebrated the festival of New Year's Day, meditated moving from that spot to Ardabil. The cold had been most severe, and heavy snows had fallen on the ground such as none remembered ever to have seen. The fragrant odours, the refreshing verdure and the sweet-smelling flowers, fearing the violence of King Cold and the forays of the bitter winds, had remained in hiding under the snow. By the command of Dai and Bahman\u00b9 the surface of the earth had been presented with a grey cap of clouds and an ermine mantle of snow, so that from the quantity of snow the tops of the mountains looked like the level plains. Of all the sweet children which the meadows nursed in the cradle of the earth none remained but the refreshing narcissus, and all of these were like faded roses and withered tulips [verses]\u2014\n\nUnable to withstand the bitter cold,\nThe fire wished for nothing but to die.\nThe snow lay piled above the dismal wold,\nAnd seemed to join together earth and sky.\n\n\u00b9 Names of two winter months. Dai corresponding to our December and Bahman to January.\nSo severe, indeed, was the cold that the birds of the air and the beasts of the field fell powerless to the ground, unable to take wing or flee away. Some of these animals were brought before Isma'il, who was astounded at the sight. Old men, also, came to him and declared that no one remembered having ever seen so severe a winter or so much snow.\n\nIsma'il now ordered his soldiers to build up out of the snow a strong fortress. They therefore built a fortress with turrets, trench \u2014\u2014 (?) and three gates, and when it was completed Isma'il gave instructions to his chiefs that a party of \u0160\u016bf\u012bs should enter the fort and busy themselves with its defence, while another party should be told off to attack it, and thus engage in a fight. Isma'il advancing against another gate with great personal valour took the fort by storm. Now Isma'il by the blessed intuition which he had inherited from his noble ancestors foresaw that certain hypocrites, at the instigation of \u2018Al\u012b Beg J\u0101k\u012br, had come to him disguised as \u0160\u016bf\u012bs and with professions of discipleship, to watch for a suitable opportunity to betray him. That is why he planned this fight, for in it he annihilated all that band of hypocrites. After this action the faith of the \u0160\u016bf\u012bs in Isma'il greatly increased ................\n\nAt the beginning of the spring Isma'il set out from his winter-quarters towards the G\u00f6kcha Dengis. On reaching Langarkan\u0101n\u00b9 he alighted at the house of Sh\u0101h Suw\u0101r Beg, and remained there one night. Next day he moved to the village of M\u0101tib\u0101n, where he was entertained in the house of N\u016bsh\u012brw\u0101n Beg T\u0101l\u012bsh, governor of the Mugh\u0101n\u0101t. Thence he proceeded to Ardabil, where he alighted at the mansion of his noble father, Sult\u0101n Haidar. Here he found his mother, \u2018Alam Sh\u0101h Begum, his brothers and his foster-brothers, who, after all this long period of separation, were longing to see him. But since Isma'il, fearing his cruel enemies, did not deem it wise to remain in Ardabil, he discussed with the leading \u0160\u016bf\u012bs what road he had better\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps another name (an older form) of Lankur\u0101n (?).\ntake. They being all of one mind, suggested that before he left his winter-quarters he should send orders by swift messengers to the S\u016bf\u012bs in R\u016bm and Sh\u0101m, and then betake himself to the frontiers of Arzinj\u0101n by way of G\u00f6kcha Dengis, for there he would be near his \"supporters,\" who, on hearing of his arrival, would the more speedily assemble. Such was the most reasonable plan. Having collected an army he might then, with the help of Divine favour and the assistance of the Im\u0101ms, turn whither he would.\n\nAt this point the two histories begin to coincide very exactly; our author has a chapter on Isma\u2018il\u2019s march from Ardabil to Arzinj\u0101n, and his encounter with Sult\u0101n Husain B\u0101r\u0101n\u012b, which corresponds most closely with Khw\u0101ndam\u012br\u2019s account, commencing at the bottom of page 115 of the Bombay edition of the \u1e24abib-us-Siyar. It is here, where the two histories so to speak unite, that I have chosen to end my article, in which I hope to have shown that our author has at least, for the early history of Sh\u0101h Isma\u2018il, much to tell us that Khw\u0101ndam\u012br was either ignorant of or chose to omit.\n\nP.S.\u2014This article was originally submitted to Professor Th. N\u00f6ldeke at Strassburg as my dissertation for the degree of Ph.D. I have been obliged to reduce its bulk by about one half of the original. All the most important matter has, however, been retained. I here take the opportunity of acknowledging the various corrections and suggestions which Prof. N\u00f6ldeke was kind enough to note upon during his perusal of my work.\nART. VIII.\u2014Mahuan's Account of Cochin, Calicut, and Aden. By Geo. Phillips, M.R.A.S.\n\nIn the July, 1895, number of this Journal I gave a description of the kingdom of Bengala (Bengal) from the pen of a Muhammadan Chinaman named Mahuan, who on account of his knowledge of Arabic was attached as Interpreter to the suite of Ch\u00eang Ho, when he made his voyages to India and other places in the Eastern seas at the beginning of the fifteenth century.\n\nHis accounts of the places he visited are in many particulars not perhaps quite new, but coming as they do midway between the descriptions of the East, given us by medi\u00e6val travellers, and those given us by the early Portuguese voyagers, they form, I think, a link connecting these two periods. To give a lengthy translation of these travels would, I fear, take up too much valuable space; therefore I propose in this paper to give a pr\u00e9cis of the most important details contained in the description of the seaports of Cochin, Calicut, and Aden, to be followed later on by an account of Ormus, the Maldives, and Arabia.\n\n\u67ef\u679d\u570b Ko-chih, COCHIN (A.D. 1409).\n\nCochin, the first port of which we shall treat, is described as a day and a night's sail from Coilum \u5c0f\u845b\u862d, the present Quilon, most probably the Kaulam Malai of the Arabs (vide Yule's Glossary under Malabar), known to the Chinese navigators of the Tang dynasty, A.D. 618\u2013913, as Muhlai \u6c92\u4f86.\nThe king or ruler is of the Solar race,\u00b9 and is a sincere believer in Buddhism,\u00b2 and has the greatest reverence for elephants and oxen; and every morning at daylight prostrates himself before an image of Buddha. The king wears no clothing on the upper part of his person; he has simply a square of silk wound round his loins, kept in place by a coloured waist-band of the same material, and on his head a turban of yellow or white cotton cloth. The dress of the officers and the rich differs but little from that of the king. The houses are built of the wood of the cocoanut-tree, and are thatched with its leaves, which render them perfectly water-tight.\n\nThere are five classes of men in this kingdom. The Nairs\u00b3 rank with the king. In the first class are those\n\n\u00b9 Mahuan's text has Wang-so-li-jen-shih \u738b\u9396\u4fda\u4eba\u6c0f, and the Ming history has Wang-su-li-jen \u738b\u6240\u91cc\u4eba. So-li and Su-li=Suri are, I venture to suggest, intended to represent Surya, or Surya Vansa, or Race of the Sun.\n\n\u00b2 Our traveller makes no distinction between Buddhism and Hinduism. The Chinese text, which I give at the side from Mahuan's text and the Ming history, is clear as to Buddhism being meant.\n\n\u00b3 The characters which I have interpreted as representing the Nairs, the ruling class of Malabar, are written Nan-k'\u00fc\u00ean \u5357\u6606 in Mahuan's text. A Chinese scholar suggested to me that the characters in question might probably be an error in transcription for Nan-li \u5357\u9e97. The Ming history, as quoted in the Hai-kuo-t'u-chih, Keuen 17, when speaking of the castes of Ko-chih (Cochin), also writes Nan-k'\u00fc\u00ean, and states that the ruler of that country belongs to that class. Another work, the Huang-ming-sz\u00fb-i-k'ao \u7687\u660e\u56db\u5937\u8003, when speaking of the ruler of Calicut, calls him a Nan-p'i-jen \u5357\u6bd7\u4eba, but his brother of Cochin is styled of the Nan-k'\u00fc\u00ean class. Here is great confusion, and it is difficult to say which reading is the right one.\n\nDr. F. Hirth has in his paper, \"Das Reich Malabar,\" which appeared in the T'oung-pao in May, 1895, treated of a kingdom called Nan-p'i \u5357\u6bd7\u570b. Dr. Hirth seems to think that this kingdom stands for the country of the\nwho shave their heads, and have a thread or string hanging over their shoulder; these are looked upon as belonging to the noblest families. In the second are the Muhammadans; in the third the Chittis, who are the capitalists; in the fourth the Kolings, who act as commission agents; in the fifth the Mukuas, who are the lowest and poorest of all. The Mukuas live in houses which are forbidden by the Government to be more than three feet high, and they are not allowed to wear long garments; when abroad, if they happen to meet a Nair or a Chitti they at once prostrate themselves on the ground, and dare not rise until they have passed by; these Mukuas get their living by fishing and carrying burdens.\n\nThe merchants of this country carry on their business like pedlars do in China. Here also is another class of men, called Chokis \u6fc1\u9a30 (Yogi), who lead austere lives like the Taoists of China, but who, however, are married. These men from the time they are born do not have their heads shaved or combed, but plait their hair into several tails, which hang over their shoulders; they wear no clothes, but round their waists they fasten a strip of rattan, over which they hang a piece of white calico; they carry a conch-shell, which they blow as they go along the road; they are accompanied by their wives, who simply wear a small bit of cotton cloth round their loins. Alms of rice\n\nNamburi Brahmins of Malabar. There is nothing unlikely in this, but whether their country has any connection with the Nan-k'u\u00ean of Mahuan and the Nan-p'i of the Huang-ming-sz\u00fc-i-k'ao I am not prepared to say.\n\nIt is well known that the rulers of Cochin and Calicut were Nairs, and such being the case I have ventured to assume that Mahuan intended to speak of them when he uses the characters Nan-k'u\u00ean. I would also suggest that by Nan-k'u\u00ean, Mahuan may possibly have intended to represent the title Naik. Vide Yule's Glossary under Naik, p. 470.\n\n1 Most probably the Brahmins. \"The Zenn\u00e4r, or sacred string\" (worn by Brahmins), says Craufurd, is hung round the body from the left shoulder (Marsden's \"Marco Polo,\" p. 666). \u56de\u56de Hui-hui, Muhammadans. \u54f2\u5730 Chih-ti, Chittis; \u8349\u5408 Ko-ling, Kling; \u6c34\u74dc Mu-kua (vide Yule's Glossary).\nand money are given to them by the people whose houses they visit.\n\nIn this country there are two seasons, the wet and the dry. In the first two months of the rainy season there are only passing showers, during which time the people lay in a stock of provisions; in the next two months there is a continual downpour day and night, so that the streets and market-places are like rivers, and no one is able to go out of doors; during the last two months the rain gradually ceases, and then not a drop falls for another six months. The soil is unproductive; pepper, however, grows on the hills and is extensively cultivated; this article is sold at five taels the P'o-ho,\\(^1\\) which is 400 cattis of Chinese weight.\n\nAll trading transactions are carried on by the Chittis, who buy the pepper from the farmers when it is ripe, and sell it to foreign ships when they pass by. They also buy and collect precious stones and other costly wares. A pearl weighing three-and-a-half candareens can be bought for a hundred ounces of silver. Coral is sold by the catti; inferior pieces of coral are cut into beads and polished by skilled workmen; these are also sold by weight. The coinage of the country is a gold piece, called a Fa-nan,\\(^2\\) weighing one candareen; there is also a little silver coin called a Ta-urh,\\(^2\\) which is used for making small purchases in the market. Fifteen Ta-urhs make a Fa-nan. There are no asses or geese in this country, and there is neither wheat nor barley; rice, maize, hemp, and millet abound. Articles of tribute are sent to China by our ships on their return voyage.\n\n\\(^1\\) \u64ad\u8377 P'o-ho. Bahar. A commercial weight which differs greatly in many places. Pepper at Cochin apparently sold, reckoning the tael at 6s. 8d., at \u00a31 13s. 4d. for 534 lbs., or less than a penny a pound.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u6cd5\u5357 Fa-nan. The Fanam is a small piece of gold worth fifteen T\u0101ris. \u82d4\u5152 Ta-urh. The T\u0101ri is a small coin worth a halfpenny. (Extract from Dr. Dillon in Elliott's \"Coins of Southern India,\" p. 57.)\u2014I am indebted to Dr. Codrington for the above note, and also for other valuable help.\nThis seaport, of which Mahuan gives us a most lengthy account, is described as a great emporium of trade frequented by merchants from all quarters. It is three days' sail from Cochin, by which it is bordered on the south; on the north it adjoins Cannanore (\u72fc\u5974\u5152 K\u2019an-nu-urh); it has the sea on the west; and on the east, through the mountains, at a distance of 500 li (167 miles), is the kingdom or city of K\u2019an-pa-mei,\u00b9 a great seat of cotton manufacture, where is made, as also in the surrounding districts, a cloth called Chih-li (\u6307\u9ece\u5e03 Chih-li-pu) cloth. It is made up into pieces, four feet five inches wide and twenty-five feet long; it is sold there for eight or ten gold pieces of their money. They also prepare raw silk for the loom, which they dye various shades of colour and then weave into flowered pattern goods, made up into pieces four to five feet wide and twelve to thirteen feet long. Each length is sold for one hundred gold pieces of their money.\n\nTo return to Calicut, much pepper is grown on the hills. Cocoanuts are extensively cultivated, many farmers owning a thousand trees; those having a plantation of three thousand are looked upon as wealthy proprietors. The king belongs to the Nair class, and, like his brother of Cochin, is a sincere follower of Buddha, and as such does not eat beef; his overseer, being a Muhammadan, does not eat pork. This led, it is said in times past, to a compact being made between the king and his overseer, to the\n\n\u00b9 K\u2019an-pa-mei \u574e\u5df4\u7f8e, read also K\u2019an-pa-i \u574e\u5df4\u5937, and in the Amoy dialect K\u2019am-pa-i, may possibly be a Chinese rendering of Koyampadi, a former name of Coimbatore, a town and district in the Madras Presidency, a great centre of weaving and cotton manufacture.\n\nIbn Batuta informs us that at Sh\u0101ly\u0113t, a town a little to the south of Calicut, they make the stuffs that bear its name (Yule\u2019s Glossary, p. 139). This stuff made at Sh\u0101ly\u0113t must be, I think, the Chih-li cloth of our Chinese traveller, but he says it was made at Kampamei and its district; he may possibly include Sh\u0101ly\u0113t in the term district.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\neffect that if the king would give up eating pork the overseer would give up eating beef. This compact has been most scrupulously observed by the successors of both parties up to the present day. The king at his devotions prostrates himself before an image of Buddha every morning; which being over, his attendants collect all the cow-dung about the place, and smear it over the image of the god. Some of the dung the king orders to be burnt to ashes and put into a small cotton bag, which he continually wears upon his person; and when his morning ablutions are over, he mixes some of the powdered dung with water and smears it over his forehead and limbs; by so doing he considers he is showing Buddha the greatest reverence.\n\nMany of the king's subjects are Muhammadans, and there are twenty or thirty mosques in the kingdom, to which the people resort every seventh day for worship. On this day, during the morning, the people being at the mosques, no business whatever is transacted; and in the after part of the day, the services being over, business is resumed.\n\nWhen a ship arrives from China, the king's overseer with a Chitti go on board and make an invoice of the goods, and a day is settled for valuing the cargo. On the day appointed the silk goods, more especially the Khinkis (Kincoos), are first inspected and valued, which when decided on, all present join hands, whereupon the broker says, \"The price of your goods is now fixed, and cannot in any way be altered.\"\n\nThe price to be paid for pearls and precious stones is arranged by the Weinaki broker,\u00b9 and the value of the\n\n\u00b9 \u54f2\u5730\u672a\u8a25\u51e0 Chitti Weinaki. Chittis are merchants who are called in when anything is to be sold, and who are retained by the king to conduct his trading transactions ashore and afloat. These Chittis are divided into four classes, each dealing in their own particular wares. The Waligi Chitti (doubtless the Chinese Weinaki Chitti) trades in corals, rubies, and bangles made of glass, earth, lead, tin, copper, or any kind of metals. (Valentyn, \"Description of Ceylon,\" vol. v, p. 8.)\nChinese goods taken in exchange for them is that previously fixed by the broker in the way above stated.\n\nThey have no abacus on which to make their calculations, but in its place they use their toes and fingers, and, what is very wonderful, they are never wrong in their reckonings.\n\nThe succession to the throne is settled in a somewhat curious manner. The king is not succeeded by his son, but by his sister's son, because his nephew, being born of his sister's body, is considered nearer to him by blood. If the king has no sister the succession goes to his brother; if he has no brother it goes to a man of ability and worth. Such has been the rule for many generations.\\(^1\\)\n\nTrial by ordeal is much practised in this country, such as thrusting the finger of the accused into boiling oil, and then keeping him in jail for two or three days. If after that time the finger is ulcerated he is pronounced guilty and sentenced to punishment; but if his finger has received no injury he is at once set free, and escorted home by musicians engaged by the overseer. On his arrival home his relatives, neighbours, and friends make him presents, and rejoice and feast together.\n\nThe jack fruit and the plantain abound in this country, which is also well supplied with melons, gourds, and turnips, and every other kind of vegetable. Ducks, herons, and swallows are numbered among the feathered tribe, and there are bats as large as vultures, which hang suspended from the trees.\n\nAs in Cochin, the money in circulation is the Fa-nan and the Ta-urh. Their weights are the P'o-ho and the Fan-la-shih, and there is a measure called a Tang-ko-li.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This is still the order of succession in Travancore.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u756a\u523a\u5931 Fan-la-sek. An error in transcription, most probably for Fan-sek-la. The Arab Farsala, a weight formerly much used in trade in the Indian seas; it seems to have run from 20 to 30 lbs. (Yule's Glossary, p. 273).\n\n\u4eae\u56ca\u9ece Tang-ko-li. This may possibly represent the Curia of Varthema, p. 170. In a note on the same page Curia is said to stand undoubtedly for K\u00f4raja.\nThe king's present to the Emperor is usually a gold-plaited girdle set with all kinds of precious stones and pearls.\n\nIt may not be out of place to note that Mahuan states that the commander of the Chinese fleet which left China in 1408, did on his arrival at Calicut erect a stone with a Chinese inscription on it to commemorate his visit. Are there any traces of it still remaining?\n\n\u963f\u4e39 Ahtan, ADEN (A.D. 1423).\n\nThis kingdom can be reached from Calicut in a month with a favourable wind by shaping a due westerly course.\n\nThe country is rich, and the people prosperous. The king and his subjects are all Muhammadans, who speak Ah-la-pek (Arabic); they are haughty and overbearing in their manners. They have a force of seven or eight thousand military, consisting of infantry and cavalry, which causes them to be greatly feared and respected by their neighbours.\n\nIn the nineteenth year of Yung-lo (1422) an Imperial envoy, the eunuch Li, was sent from China to this country with a letter and presents to the king. On his arrival he was most honourably received, and was met by the king on landing and conducted by him to his palace. During the stay of the embassy the people who had rarities were permitted to offer them for sale. Cat's-eyes of extraordinary size, rubies, and other precious stones, large branches of coral, amber, and attar of roses were among the articles purchased. Giraffes, lions, zebras, leopards, ostriches, and white pigeons were also offered for sale.\n\nThe dress usually worn by the king is a long white garment, and a turban of fine white cloth, with a knob of brocade on the top; when he goes to the mosque to worship he changes this dress for a yellow robe, fastened at the waist by a girdle adorned with precious stones, and on his head he wears a golden crown. He goes abroad in\na carriage escorted by a company of soldiers. His officers have each a particular dress appertaining to their rank. The head-dress of the men is a turban; their garment is made of woollen, silk, or cotton stuff. The women wear a long robe; from their shoulders hangs a chain made of pearls and precious stones with silken tassels at the end like that worn by the Goddess of Mercy; from each of their ears hang four pairs of gold inlaid ear-rings, golden bracelets on their arms, and rings on their fingers.

There are in the town market-places, bathing establishments, eating-houses, and shops for the sale of sundry wares.

IX.\u2014Remarks on the Etymology of \u0160abb\u0101th. By H. Hirschfeld.\n\nThe latest researches on the noun in Semitic languages, in particular those of Prof. Barth and the late Prof. Lagarde, have opened up a vast field for discussion. Although starting from quite heterogeneous principles, yet, as they develop, they show many a point in common if examined more closely. The greater or lesser inclination of the student for speculative philology will lead him to devote his main interest to one of the two theories, but it will not absolve him from bestowing full attention on the other also, on account of its numerous important details. It would, however, be a delusion to think that either theory has completely solved the questions of the Semitic noun. No language allows itself to be confined by hard and fast rules, and Hebrew, like others, has developed many words which will not bear uniform treatment. In particular, words which lived in everybody's mouth, and had to undergo constant wear and tear, defy, more or less, violent attempts to force them within concise rules. An instance of those will form the object of the following remarks.\n\nAfter W. Lotz published his little book, Quaestiones de historia Sabbati (Leipzig, 1883), the discussion on the etymology of \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea ceased for a time. Without offering any new and plausible theory, he rejects an ancient one, which will have to be mentioned again later on, and adheres to that of Kim\u1e25i, Olshausen, Lagarde, and others, viz. that \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea is a contracted form of \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05ea. K\u00f6nig (\"Lehrgeb\u00e4ude,\" H\u00e4lfte ii, Th. 1, p. 180 sq.), as recently as last year, reduces this form to \u05e0\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea; whilst Ewald's\nexplanation that (is a form like and) means Der Feierer has, I believe, been abandoned by most scholars.\n\nThe foregoing etymologies have only been adopted for want of a better one, and, indeed, leave many questions open, of which I will only mention one, viz. how was condensed into . That the omission of the final is intimated by the D\u0101ge\u0161 forte in the of forms with suffix like , has been already justly urged by Barth (\"Nominalbildung,\" 1st ed., p. 24), since this D\u0101ge\u0161, in fact, owes its existence to quite different causes.\n\nProf. Barth, in his very ingenious book, places among the transitive forms with sharpened 2nd radical and originally short vowel (q\u0101tt\u0101l), which would, at any rate, be an improvement on the derivations mentioned above. Now, if derived from a root , the transitive character of the noun is embarrassing, because, apart from its being quite contrary to the idea hidden in the same, it is always of feminine gender (in Isaiah lvi, 2 and 6 the word is to be supplied). If, then, the in stands to designate the genus feminimum, we would have to look for another radical letter, and return to the theories of Olshausen, K\u00f6nig, etc., and thus move in a circle.\n\nThe late Prof. Lagarde has on several occasions treated on the etymology of , finally in his \"Uebersicht\" (p. 113), where he simply places it side by side with Arabic (\"long space of time\"). While abandoning in part an older theory given in his Psalterium Hieronymi (pp. 158\u201360), he, in a note, admits the existence of Assyrian sab\u0101tu \"to rest.\" As he, however, does not say how far his older theory is to be given up, we must take the points common to both, and assume that he derives from the intensive stem of the root in a manner similar to that of Olshausen and his followers, whilst the comparison with only adds another difficulty.\nNow if these derivations fail to give us a clear and concise etymology of the word in question, we are obliged to look for another one, and this was certainly given as early as in the fourth century of our era by Lactantius,\\(^1\\) who rightly maintains that the noun was derived from the number; in other words, that \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea is nothing but a contracted form of the old Semitic form of the numeral \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7. This assumption is strongly supported by Theophilus Antiochenus,\\(^2\\) who wrote even earlier that what the Hebrews call \u03c3\u03ac\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd is in Greek \u201cweek.\u201d Writing as they did at a date so much nearer to the period when Hebrew was a living language, their almost unanimous verdict reveals a tradition (the origin of which was unknown to them) which still existed in the memory of the public, and these circumstances should not have been overlooked or rejected by Lotz without proof.\n\nWe have now two points to consider\u2014\n\n(1) The linguistic possibility of reducing \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea to an original \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7.\n\n(2) The relation of \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea to the root \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea.\n\nAs regards the first point, \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7 represents the construct state of the masculine form of the (classical) Hebrew numeral for seven, and occurs in the connection \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7 \u05d9\u05b4\u05de\u05b5\u05bc\u05d9 nearly a hundred times in the O.T. against about thirty in connection with other nouns. The archaic form of the absolute state of the same numeral was evidently \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7, and the \\(a\\)-sound of the first syllable is not only retained in Aramaic, Arabic, and Ethiopic, but also in \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea, the feminine form in Hebrew, whilst the change of the Pata\u1e25\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Instit. vii, 14 (Patrologia vi, p. 781): Dies sabbati, qui lingua Hebraeorum a numero nomen accepit, unde septenarius numerus legitimus ac plenus est.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ed. Caillau, p. 161: Quod enim apud Hebraeos sabbatum dicitur Graece redditur hebdomas, quae quidem apud omne humanum genus appellatur; quam autem ob causam ita vocem ignorant.\ninto \u1e24ireq is only a modification just as in Assyrian sibiti.\\(^1\\) Now it is a very common phenomenon in Hebrew that a guttural in words of frequent use is so worn away as to disappear entirely,\\(^2\\) whilst, according to the position of this guttural in the word, either the preceding or the following consonant is doubled; otherwise we would have a short vowel in an open syllable, which the Hebrew language has a strong tendency to avoid. This would explain the Pata\u1e25 in the first syllable of \u05e0\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9, whilst the Q\u0101me\u1e93 of the second one is due to the weight of the accent. Of other instances of the same phenomenon in Hebrew I merely mention the following. The proper noun \u05d9\u05b0\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e2\u05b7 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4 (Ezra x, 31; 1 Chron. vii, 3) is contracted from \u05d9\u05b0\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e2\u05b7 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4 \u201cmy help is Y\u0101h\u201d (= \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2 \u05d9\u05d4), whilst \u05d9\u05b0\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e2\u05b7 (1 Chron. ii, 28) is evidently originally \u05d9\u05b0\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e2\u05b7 (or \u05d9\u05b0\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e2\u05b7); the verbal form \u05d9\u05b0\u05e0\u05b7\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e7\u05b5\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc (Amos viii, 8) is the Ktib for \u05d9\u05b0\u05e0\u05b7\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e7\u05b5\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc. All these cases are such in which \u05d9 forms the third radical. Of instances where the guttural standing as second radical was omitted, I only mention \u05d9\u05b0\u05e0\u05b7\u05e6\u05b5\u05bc\u05dc and \u05d9\u05b0\u05e8\u05bb\u05ea\u05b5\u05bc\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\\(^5\\) (both also mentioned by Lagarde, ib. p. 84). As the last, but not the least striking instance, may serve the word \u05d7\u05b6\u05d8\u05b0\u05d0 \u201csin,\u201d which Barth (p. 146) places under the group q\u0101\u1e6d\u0101l\u0101t,\\(^6\\) Lagarde under qatt\u0101l. But it seems rather to be a form qatlat, in which the quiescent guttural \u05e0 caused its vowel to be pronounced\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. Delitzsch, Assyrian Grammar (1889), p. 163.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf.

In one instance, indeed (Numb. xv, 24), we find the same word written without that \u05e0, viz. \u05e0\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9, which furnishes the exact parallel to \u05e0\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9. The possibility of the contraction can therefore not be doubted.\n\nWe have now to investigate the relation existing between our word and the root \u05e0\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9. From what preceded we gather that a priori they have nothing in common. The idea of resting for religious reasons after a certain spell of working days is far too complicated to be the original meaning of a primitive root. In Arabic \u0633\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u0652 has two significations\u2014\"to cut off\" and \"to be motionless\"; but we will not discuss here any connection which might exist between them. Qor. lxxviii, 7 contains the phrase \u0648\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0646\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0633\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u062a\u064b\u0627 \"we made your sleep motionless,\" which al-Beidh\u0101wi explains as \"cutting off from perception and movement,\" therefore \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0628\u0648\u062a \"the corpse.\" As the original meaning of \u0633\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062a\u0652 he gives \"to cut off.\" In Hebrew the first signification of \u05e0\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 seems to be \"to cease,\" in its more profane sense: e.g. Job xxxii, 1; Lam. v, 15; also Gen. ii, 2, particularly in the derived forms. Now when the seventh day was appointed for leaving off work, the noun \u05e0\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 and the verb \u05e0\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 were brought into immediate practical connection with each other, and thus the fusion of both was prepared in the minds of the people, who are the real enrichers of a language. Furthermore, to regard the \u05e0 in \u05e0\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 as radical is of comparatively recent date, as this seems not to have been the case in Aramaic. In Syriac the word is \u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e, pl. \u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e, in Jewish Aramaic (Targum) \u05e0\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9, \u05e0\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 pl.\nNow if the Q\u0101mez in \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea would correspond to long \u0101, and would not be merely heightened from \u0101, the Syriac form, if derived from a root \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea, should have been \u0161abb\u0101th\u0101. The Qoranic form \u0633\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062a\u064e, as well as the Ethiopic form, are nothing but reproductions of the Aramaic form, otherwise we should also expect (subbat or) sabb\u0101t. From the Ethiopic plural sanbat\u0101t Lagarde infers the radical character of the \u05e0. This is, however, not the case. When the word in Hebrew had once received its official stamp, and had to be inflected, the \u05e0 was retained for reasons of triliterality. There are many instances of exactly the same character, as \u05d7\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea, \u05e7\u05b0\u05e9\u05b9\u05c1\u05ea\u05b9\u05ea, \u05e2\u05b2\u05e8\u05b5\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea, \u05d3\u05b0\u05bc\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea, etc., in which neither \u05d4 is originally radical. Not to be overlooked is the Hebrew proper noun \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05d1\u05b6\u05df (Ezra x, 15), in which the Q\u0101mez could not have been dropped, had \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea been a form like \u05d1\u05b4\u05bc\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4; on the other hand, had the word been condensed from \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea we should expect this name to be \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05d1\u05b6\u05df.\n\nOf particular interest is the record which Assyrian documents furnish for \u0160abb\u0101th. Schrader (KAT\u00b2, p. 20 sqq.) reproduces a tablet in which the \"seventh day\" is called an \"evil day,\" on which no work should be done nor business transacted. A passage in another inscription calls this day \u0161abat-tuv, but writes it with only one \u05e0. An explanatory note attached to this text derives the word from \u0161a-bat, and translates \u016bm-n\u016bh-libbi \"the day of the rest of the heart.\" This clearly shows that to the annotator the real meaning of the word was anything but clear, but that his translation only gives what he knew of the character of that day, and that he never thought of tracing it to the root \u0161ab\u0101tu.\n\n\u00b9 Levy, TW to be corrected.\n\u00b2 See Barth in ZDMG. xli, 607, 632.\nThis will allow us to draw some conclusion as to the age of the Hebrew word \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea, which must be considerable, and the word was shaped before the language assumed that form which we find in the O.T. Other conclusions dealing with the age of the week, etc., are beyond the scope of the present observations.\n\nIn summing up the preceding remarks, I should like to comprise the same in the following theses:\n\n(1) The derivation of \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea from \u05d9\u05b8\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1 offers difficulties which it has been hitherto impossible to remove, in spite of many efforts.\n\n(2) The word is rather contracted from \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05ea, and this is not only possible but highly probable.\n\n(3) That contraction was greatly accelerated by the resemblance of the religious idea hidden in the expression \"seventh day\" with the meaning of the root \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea \"to cease (work),\" and thus \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea offers an interesting example of what is called popular etymology.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. THE PILLARS OF THE THUP\u0100R\u0100MA AND LANK\u0100R\u0100MA DAGABAS, CEYLON.\n\nDear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014The concentric pillars which surround the Thup\u0101r\u0101ma and Lank\u0101r\u0101ma dagabas at Anur\u0101dhapura, the ancient capital of Ceylon, have long been a puzzle to the archaeologist. These pillars are tall and slender; the Thup\u0101r\u0101ma dagaba has four concentric circles of them, and the Lank\u0101r\u0101ma has three. The first guess as to their purpose\u2014and a very natural one\u2014was that they had supported some kind of a roof to protect the pasadas, or procession paths, from the sun. Fergusson, with his wide knowledge of Buddhist architecture, conjectured that these pillars were only another and a developed form of the posts which form the pradakshina, or procession path, of the Sanchi and other st\u016bpas. To this he added the further suggestion that, as sculpture had not been developed in Ceylon to the same extent as painting, pictures on cloth or canvas of some kind had been hung upon them with scenes representing the life of Buddha. The hanging of lights, or garlands of flowers, was another possible theory in keeping with Buddhist practices. The difficulty up to the present has been to know which of all these guesses might be the correct one.\n\nThe Ceylon Government has lately published a very large and important work on the \"Architectural Remains of Anur\u0101dhapura,\" by Mr. J. G. Smithers, F.R.I.B.A.,\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nlate Architect to the Government of Ceylon. The book is almost wholly devoted to the d\u0101gabas of the old capital, and it contains no less than sixty-seven large plates, which, from their size, appear to give an exhaustive account of the details of the old monuments. Mr. Smithers, as a practical architect, rejects the supposition that the slim pillars of the two d\u0101gabas could possibly have supported any kind of roof; but he makes the suggestion that they may have been surmounted by Buddhist emblems. On reading this it recalled to my mind that the pillars known as \"Buddhist l\u0101ts\" were, as their name implies, long and slender, and they were all surmounted by emblematic objects, such as lions, elephants, or wheels. There is a pillar still standing in front of the Karli cave, with four lions on the summit, and Fergusson supposes that above these there was originally a chakra, or wheel. Hiuen Tsiang supplies an additional evidence. In describing Ceylon this pilgrim says: \"By the side of the king's palace is the vih\u0101ra of Buddha's tooth, several hundred feet high, brilliant with jewels, and ornamented with rare gems. Above the vih\u0101ra is placed an upright pole, on which is fixed a great Padma r\u0101ja [ruby] jewel.\"\u00b9 This was at the Thup\u0101r\u0101ma d\u0101gaba, where the position of the tooth temple, which was then at that place, may be seen on Mr. Smithers' plan, and here we have a pole, or pillar, surmounted by a Buddhist emblem. The slender form of the pillars at the Thup\u0101r\u0101ma d\u0101gaba show that they are only copies of poles or wooden originals. The word \"l\u0101t,\" which is applied to the Buddhist pillars in India, indicates the same character.\n\nPerhaps the best evidence for this theory of the pillars may be derived from a late Progress Report by Dr. F\u00fchrer, which recounts an archaeological survey he has made in Burma. In writing of the Sand\u014d Pay\u0101, the largest pagoda in Prome, he states that the platform on which it is constructed is paved with stone slabs, \"and all round its outer edge is a continuous series of carved wooden image-houses,\n\n\u00b9 Beal's translation, vol. ii, p. 248.\nand between these and the pagoda are garuntaings, or sacred posts, surmounted by garuda, with long streamers dependent from their summits.\" The word \"pagoda\" in Burma means a similar structure to the st\u016bpa of India, and the d\u0101gaba of Ceylon, and here we have it surrounded with \"sacred posts,\" which support a figure of Garuda, the Wahan of Vishnu. It is understood that up to the fifth century Burma derived its faith and an architectural influence from India; but after that date it looked also to Ceylon, and this would explain where the models for the Garuntaings had been found. Why the Buddhists of Burma had chosen the Garuda of Vishnu is not explained; but that is of no moment here, the point being that the posts are surmounted by emblematical figures.\n\nColumns, with emblems upon them, at temples were not confined to the Buddhists; the Brahmins had them at their temples as well. At the rock-cut kailasa of Ellura there are two columns, and on the top of one there is still the fragment of a trisula which surmounted it. At the well-known temple of Jagann\u0101tha at Puri there is a pillar called the Aruna Stambha; it stood originally before the Sun temple at Kon\u0101rak, and bore a monkey on its summit. There were others in Orissa, and one still stands at Jagepur (see illustration in Fergusson's \"Indian and Eastern Architecture,\" p. 433) which supported a \"garuda,\" the same fabulous creature that is borne on the \"sacred posts\" at Prome.\n\nThe following by Dr. B\u00fchler, if correct, seems still further to confirm this. Dr. F\u00fchrer had discovered some very interesting Jaina sculptures in the Kank\u0101li Tila at Mathur\u0101; among the objects represented on the sculptures were st\u016bpas\u2014showing that the Jainas also erected monuments of that character\u2014and regarding these Dr. B\u00fchler writes: \"With respect to the st\u016bpa, which we shall meet again more than once in the other plates, I repeat that it is a form of the funeral monument once used and worshipped by all Indian sects that followed the J\u00f1\u0101na and Bhakti M\u0101rgas, and I refer for some of the reasons for this theory\nto my article *Vienna Or. Journal*, vol. iv, pp. 328 f. I may add, however, that Brahminical Chaityas are occasionally mentioned in the *Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata*. Thus we read (*Mah.* i, 109, 13, 14): \u2018That country, O king, protected on all sides by Bhishma, in accordance with the sacred law, became lovely, being adorned with hundreds of chaityas and sacrificial posts.\u2019 The juxtaposition of the chaityas and y\u016bpas shows that Brahminical sacred buildings, probably st\u016bpas, were meant.\u201d\u00b9 This quotation from the *Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata*, if Dr. B\u00fchler be correct in his interpretation of it, although slight enough, would pass for a description of the Thup\u0101r\u0101ma and the Lank\u0101r\u0101ma d\u0101gabas; but it will be rather a surprise if it turns out that the pillars at these d\u0101gabas had their origin in the y\u016bpas, or sacrificial posts, to which the victims were tied at an early period, when, as we know, the sacrifice of animals was a part of the Brahminical system.\n\nW.

OBITUARY NOTICES.\n\nDr. Reinhold Rost.\n\n[The following is based on the obituary in the Academy of February 15, 1896.]\n\nDr. Rost has not long survived his retirement from the India Office. He died very suddenly on February 7 at Canterbury, whither he had gone on duties connected with St. Augustine\u2019s College. He had just completed the seventy-fourth year of his age.\n\nReinhold Rost was born in 1822 at a little manufacturing town in the duchy of Sax-Altenberg, where his father was a Lutheran Minister, holding the office of Archdeacon. After attending the Gymnasium in the capital of his native state, he entered at the neighbouring University of Jena, where he graduated as Ph.D. in 1847. Having already determined to devote himself to Oriental studies, he came at once to England, the great storehouse of Sanskrit MSS. His first post was that of Oriental Lecturer at the Missionary College at Canterbury, with which he remained associated till the last. From 1864 to 1869 he was Secretary to the\nRoyal Asiatic Society, and was then appointed Librarian to the India Office in succession to Dr. Fitzedward Hall, who survives him. This is one of the few posts in England that may be regarded as an endowment for Oriental research. The official duties are not heavy, but the collection of MSS. is one of the largest in the world, and their custodian is necessarily brought into contact with students of all countries. In addition he acts as adviser in philological matters to the Secretary of State for India, who still dispenses some of that literary patronage in which the old Company was so profuse.\n\nDr. Rost will long be remembered as Librarian to the India Office. If he left it to others to catalogue and edit the MSS., this was not through incapacity for either task. Though primarily a Sanskritist, he had to consider the claims of Arabic and Persian, of P\u0101li, Burmese, and Sinhalese, of Tibetan and Malay, and of countless vernaculars. Of all these languages we have mentioned, he possessed a competent knowledge; and he had further to give his attention to questions relating to archaeology, ethnology, and Indian history. In brief, Dr. Rost elected to turn himself into an Oriental encyclopaedia, which no one ever consulted in vain. Through his initiative MSS. were lent freely to foreign scholars; and it is hardly too much to say that on the Continent he was regarded as a steward of Oriental knowledge to whom everyone might appeal without hesitating for assistance and advice. This feeling was strongly expressed in a testimonial presented to him in 1892, when it was rumoured that he was to be retired compulsorily from his post. Frenchmen joined with Germans in testifying to the kindness and impartiality which he had always displayed towards fellow-students. The Government allowed him one year more of office and of work; but he was superannuated (sorely against the grain) in 1893.\n\nDr. Rost wrote little under his own name. His first publication was a short essay (1850) on a P\u0101li law book from Burma law, and he also compiled a Catalogue of the\nPalm-leaf MSS. in the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg. He was content to be known as the editor of H. H. Wilson's Selected Works, of Brian Hodgson's Collected Papers, and of four volumes of Miscellanies relating to Indo-China. He edited for Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co.'s publishing firm a series of \"Simplified Grammars,\" and for many years contributed literary notes to their trade circular, the \"Oriental Record.\" But his modesty did not deprive him of all public recognition. Edinburgh made him LL.D., and Oxford conferred on him the rarer distinction of Honorary M.A. He was an Honorary or Corresponding Member of the Royal Asiatic Society and of many learned Societies on the Continent and in the East. Prussia, Russia, and Sweden gave him decorations; and our own Government appointed him Companion of the Indian Empire in 1888.\n\nAbel Hovelacque, of Paris.\n\nScience and Oriental studies have suffered a great loss by the death of M. Abel Hovelacque, which occurred on Saturday, February 22nd, 1896. Born in Paris, Nov. 14th, 1843, he studied first for the Bar, but, at the same time, he was induced to take interest in linguistics, and attended Prof. H. Chav\u00e9e's classes, who taught him comparative philology. He particularly devoted himself to Sanskrit and Zend, and published some valuable pamphlets. He was a founder of the Revue de Linguistique (1867), where his first essays appeared, and of which he became Director in 1869; in 1877 he resigned the task, having for several years been deeply interested in anthropological researches. In the year 1876 a public school for Anthropology was founded in Paris, with five professors; among them Hovelacque was engaged to teach the science of language, and he fulfilled the task most successfully. In 1891 he was appointed, by his fellow-professors, Director of the school, which comprises at present\nno less than ten professors. For ten years his health had suffered, and from 1894 the illness seriously increased and led to the fatal issue, which the best care and attention were unable to prevent.\n\nIn the meantime he occupied himself with politics, and was elected in 1878 a member of the Paris Municipal Council, of which he was the President in 1886 and 1888; in 1889 he was sent to the Parliament as Deputy of the XIIIe Paris district, but resigned in 1894.\n\nHis principal works are the following ones:\u2014La th\u00e9orie \u00e9p\u00e9cienne de lautverschiebung (1869), Racines et \u00e9l\u00e9ments simples (1869), Grammaire de la langue send (1869; 2nd ed. 1878), Instructions pour l'\u00e9tude \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de la linguistique indo-europ\u00e9enne (1871), Euphonie sanskrite (1872), La France et les Slaves de Sud (1872), Langues\u2014races\u2014nationalit\u00e9s (1873; 2nd ed. 1875), La linguistique (1876; 2nd ed. 1877; 3rd ed. 1881; 4th ed. 1887: English translation, London, Chatham, 1877), Notre anc\u00eatre (1877; 2nd ed. 1878), L'Avesta Zoroastre et le Mazd\u00e9isme (1880), \u00c9tudes de linguistique et d'ethnographie (with Prof. J. Vinson, 1878), M\u00e9langes de linguistique et d'anthropologie (with Profs. J. Vinson and E. Rost, 1880), La langue khasia (1880), L'enseignement primaire \u00e0 Paris: laiques et congr\u00e9ganistes (1880), Les d\u00e9buts de l'humanit\u00e9 (1881), Les races humaines (1882), Morceaux choisis de Voltaire, J. J. Rousseau, et Diderot (1883), Pr\u00e9cis d'anthropologie (with Dr. G. Herv\u00e9, 1887), Les N\u00e8gres de l'Afrique sus-\u00e9quatoriale (1889), Recherches ethnologiques sur le horvan (with Dr. G. Herv\u00e9, 1894). Moreover, he contributed to many periodicals and other publications\u2014the Dictionnaire des Sciences anthropologiques (1886), L'homme (by Prof. de Morlet), Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Anthropologie, Revue de Linguistique, etc.\n\nG. Vinson.\n\nParis, March, 1896.\nIV. Notes and News.\n\nNotice to Members.\u2014A series of three maps was issued in 1835 to illustrate a paper, in Vol. XV, o.s., J.R.A.S., by Captain Felix Jones, on \"The Topography of Nineveh.\" These maps were issued apart from the Journal, and were in three large sheets. The Society is desirous of purchasing one or more sets of these maps, and the Secretary would be glad to hear from any member who wishes to dispose of a set.\n\nCaste Rules in Manu.\u2014Prof. Hillebrandt, of Breslau, in an interesting paper in vol. xii of the \"Germanistische Abhandlungen,\" has pointed out that many of the supposed caste rules in Manu\u2014under which the unfortunate C\u016bdra can be mutilated or tortured or killed for offending a Brahmin, and is declared to be incapable of holding property or of learning the Vedas\u2014can be matched by similar rules as to the treatment of slaves in German, Greek, and Roman law. Brahmanism, therefore, in this point, was not the maker of harsh rules, but was only preserving and carrying on social customs which had become historic facts in India, just as they had under similar circumstances elsewhere.\n\nThe Dharma \u015a\u0101stras.\u2014In a dissertation presented to the University of Leipzig for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Mr. G. B. Beaman takes the second chapter of the M\u0101nava Dharma \u015a\u0101stra, and dividing the whole into 167 paragraphs, discusses the source of each. He argues that of the whole, 46 were due to S\u016btras now lost, 16 are pure interpolations, 4 have been derived from the textbooks of the S\u0101\u1e45khya, and 99 (or 60 per cent.) are derived from extant Dharma or G\u1e5bhya S\u016btras. Taking the passage of Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya dealing with the same matter, and dividing it into 46 passages, he argues that 15 have been drawn certainly, and 5 doubtfully, from non-extant, and 26 (or 53 per cent.) from extant Dharma or G\u1e5bhya S\u016btras. In only 4 cases can we be sure that the author has borrowed from Manu. The argument is well and carefully conducted, and it is\na distinct advantage to have the results stated in this quantitative manner. It touches, it is true, only the passages referred to, but the author thinks these are a fair sample of the whole of Manu and Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya respectively.\n\nBald\u00e6us and his Work on Ceylon.\u2014Under this title Mr. Donald W. Ferguson, M.R.A.S., has published (Colombo: Observer Office) a reprint of his very careful and accurate articles on the life of Bald\u00e6us, and on the bibliography of the early editions of his work, which contained in its slight notice of Tamil grammar the first Tamil printing in Europe.\n\nBuddhist Texts.\u2014Dr. K. E. Neumann, of Vienna, is bringing out a complete translation into German of the Dialogues of the Majjhima Nik\u0101ya, and the first fasciculus, containing the translation of the first 63 pages of Trenckner\u2019s edition for the P\u0101li Text Society, has already appeared (8vo, pp. 96. Fr. Friedrich: Leipzig, 1896). We congratulate Dr. Neumann on so useful and important an undertaking, and trust it will receive adequate support. It is a bold step to commence such a work before the commentary (an edition of which is in preparation for the P\u0101li Text Society) has been published. In his introduction, which makes no mention of previous work in the same field, the author makes light of the value of Buddhaghosa\u2019s commentary. But the published fasciculus shows how thoroughly Dr. Neumann is at home with the texts of which he proposes to give us a version, and with his training and ability and enlightened sympathy he bids fair to contribute work of the first importance for the elucidation of Buddhism.\n\nThe Mah\u0101-bh\u0101rata.\u2014Professor Ludwig has published as a reprint from the \u201cSitzungsberichte der k\u00f6niglichen b\u00f6hmischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften\u201d a paper on the mythical basis of the Mah\u0101-bh\u0101rata (8vo, pp. 26. Riva\u010d: Prag), in which he maintains the proposition that we have in that poem the working together of two distinct elements\u2014a poem on the struggle between the sun and the\ndarkness of the night, and a kind of bardic poem (a s\u016bta) on a possibly actual war; but the former of the two, and not the latter, is the actual basis of the whole. The gods have, in fact, here become men, and we have before us a case of the anthropomorphic treatment of mythical tradition.\n\nGandh\u0101ra Sculptures.\u2014Mr. Anderson, at vol. i, p. 221, of his Catalogue of the India Museum, describes one frieze (G 36) without being able to identify it further than thinking that two of the figures are Buddha and Devasattva. Professor Serge D'Oldenbourg, at p. 274 of \"Zapiski\" (the Journal of the Oriental Section of the Russian Imperial Archaeological Society), very ingeniously points out that this frieze is an illustration of the episode of Jaya and Vijaya recorded at pp. 366 foll. of the Divy\u0101vad\u0101na. This is no doubt correct. And it shows the importance, from the point of view of archaeology, of such texts being translated. There are so many in charge of museums in India who are in the first place naturalists, and who therefore do not read, and cannot be expected to read, Sanskrit and P\u0101li, that translations of the texts referring to the objects in their charge is absolutely essential.\n\nBuddhist Text Society of India.\u2014The Government of Bengal has made a grant of 2000 rupees to this Society towards the publication of the series of rare Buddhist texts, collected at Government expense during the last fifty years, from Nepal, Tibet, and Burma.\n\nAssyrian Text Book.\u2014Eighty-three plates of cuneiform, a title-page, five pages of preface, a list of contents covering three pages, and a cover with two pages of advertisements, is the amount that an outlay of \u00a31 6s. obtains from the reckless purchaser who buys Prof. Craig's \"Assyrian and Babylonian Religious Texts.\" As far as a comparison of one or two of the pages goes, they are very correctly reproduced, but the publishers could easily have given students the benefit of cuneiform type in place of the rather unsatisfactorily printed autographed plates of which\nthe work is composed. Though several of the plates have already been published, the texts given by Prof. Craig form a very interesting collection, and students will look forward to the translations and notes, which he promises to give in the second volume.\n\nChronology of Genesis.\u2014Prof. J. Oppert's \"Chronologie de la Gen\u00e8se,\" published in the Revue des \u00e9tudes juives (tome xxxi, 1895), shows all the originality and deep learning that characterize this veteran Assyriologist's work. Prof. Oppert points out that the Creation, for which the Bible allows seven days, occupied, according to the Chaldean system, 1,680,000 years. He examines the dates of Genesis and of Berosus, with special reference to the Patriarchs before and after the Flood. The totals of the years they lived may be divided, as he points out, into epochs, which are multiples of the number 23; and other calculations reveal the existence of the numbers 70, 90, and 100 as multiplicands. He also points out that the figures in Genesis, to all appearance so dry, nevertheless enable one to guess the existence of myths current in early ages, but lost to us, in all probability, for ever.\n\nPandit \u012a\u00e7varacandra Vidy\u0101s\u0101gara.\u2014Mr. Sricharan Chakravarti has published at Calcutta a very appreciative little account of the life and work, literary and philanthropic, of this fine representative of the native scholar and patriot. A portrait is given (not a very flattering one), but there is unfortunately no bibliography, and the scholar is rather overlooked, throughout the book, in the philanthropist.\n\nProf. Sayce, Vice-President of the Society, has been re-appointed to the Chair of Assyriology at Oxford for a further term of five years.\n\nDr. Wilhelm Geiger, Professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology at the University of Erlangen, Germany, has arrived in Ceylon for the purpose of studying the Sinhalese language, which is his chief object in going out to the island. He is fully equipped with letters of introduction from the Colonial Office in London, and from his Government,\nand trusts that every help will be rendered him by the scholars in Ceylon. He is writing an account of the Sinhalese language for Dr. B\u00fchler's Encyclopaedia.\n\nThe Council of the Senate at Cambridge recommend that the Panjab University be adopted as an affiliated institution, subject to the condition that the privileges of affiliation be extended only to graduates in Arts.\n\nWe would call the attention of our readers to Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner, and Co.'s Catalogue of Oriental Books for sale, which will be found at the end of this issue of our Journal.\n\nV. Notices of Books.\n\nA First Catechism of Tamil Grammar. By the Rev. G. U. Pope, D.D., with an English Translation by the Rev. D. S. Herrick. (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1895.)\n\nDr. Pope has rendered essential service to Tamil literature. He has written three Grammars for the students of that language, besides editing in it several classical works. After many years of study, he is still profitably occupying himself in perfecting his former works, and in making them more extensively useful; and it is touching to read the following sentence from the prefatory note to this little volume, which shows how his heart still turns with affectionate remembrance to the language and the people among whom he laboured so long: \"Fifty-eight years' work at Tamil has made the writer ever more and more sensible of the beauties of the language, and his only wish is that this little book may still help forward the cause of sound education among those whom he loves.\"\n\nThis Catechism was written so far back as 1842. It was composed in Tamil, and has been extensively used in schools for Tamil children. It is now accompanied by an English translation by one of Dr. Pope's former pupils at Oxford; and has thus been made available for Europeans studying\nthe Tamil language. Dr. Pope also wrote a second Catechism of Tamil Grammar, which he proposes to publish in the same diglot form; and a third or Complete Grammar of the Tamil Language, in which the higher or the classical dialect of that very fertile tongue is included, should there be a demand for it, and should the issue of the two former be successful enough to give him sufficient encouragement.\n\nThe translation of this little book into English, thus making it bilingual, will effectually unlock its mysteries for English students. It is partly written in the Tamil method and partly in the English, and this combination will be good practice for the European, who usually goes to India at a comparatively late period of life, and is made competent by previous training to assimilate both methods. We have glanced through the book, selecting passages here and there, and it seems to us well and adequately translated. It must necessarily be a very great help to one who may honestly desire to become thoroughly acquainted with the language of the people among whom he is to dwell, and over whom he may possibly have to work and rule.\n\nOne good point about the book is that the student must learn the Tamil character, or he cannot perfect himself in the language. There is very little transliteration into the Roman character; but on that little we cannot help making just a remark or two. We observe that \\( \\text{\\&} \\) is transliterated both in this book and in the First Lessons in Tamil, which was recently published by Dr. Pope at Oxford, by \\( \\text{c} \\), whereas in Dr. Pope's books published at Madras \\( s \\) was used.

(Leipzig: Hirzel, 1895.)\n\nThis monograph, published as Part iv of the Proceedings of the Historical Division of the Royal Society of Science of Saxony, is devoted to a discussion, firstly, of the legend of M\u0101ra, as handed down in the early Buddhist records (pp. 1-220 and 322-327); and, secondly, of the early accounts of Gotama's first meeting with King Bimbis\u0101ra at R\u0101jagaha (pp. 220-322). All the text passages relating to both of these subjects are here collected and contrasted (where possible in parallel columns), and translated with numerous notes, in which the readings are discussed and a number of difficult or doubtful words are elucidated. The historical relationship to one another of these different texts, and of various paragraphs or even phrases used in them, is carefully discussed; and the question of the origin and gradual evolution of the conception of M\u0101ra is elaborately and convincingly worked out. No portion of the vast field of the history of Buddhist ideas has been hitherto treated with anything like the same completeness and thoroughness; and in applying to this particular portion the recognized canons of a strict historical criticism, the more general problem of the right treatment of the Buddhist records as a whole is incidentally dealt with in a similar spirit\u2014a spirit utterly opposed to the absurd and uncritical way of muddling up all the different versions of each episode as if they were of equal value (or rather of equal worthlessness).\n\nNaturally, in a monograph dealing with so great a mass of detail there are some points on which scholars may differ from the author. One of these is the reiterated use, when referring to the death of the Buddha, of the phrase 'enter into Nirv\u0101\u1e47a.' There is no word in the texts corresponding to any one of the four words thus chosen to reproduce the sense of the P\u0101li word parinibb\u0101yati. The Buddha, like every other Arahat, was supposed to have attained the state of mind called Nirv\u0101\u1e47a during his life, and in his case the precise time of that event was on the day of his Enlightenment.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nunder the Bo Tree. *Nibb\u0101na-dh\u0101tuy\u0101* (as the author rightly points out on p. 74) is, of course, a locative; but it is a locative, not in the sense of 'entering into' (which would require an accusative), but in the sense of a locative absolute. The meaning of the expression is really placed beyond doubt by such phrases as 'the wise [speaking of the Arahats] go out like this lamp' (Ratana Sutta 14), or 'the dying out of a flame,' used as a metaphor of the death of the Buddha at Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta, p. 62. The expression 'entering into Nirv\u0101\u1e47a' is only a very old Anglo-Indian blunder, dating from the time when the first writers on Buddhism, saturated with modern Western ideas, took for granted that Nirv\u0101\u1e47a must be some state beyond the grave. But the universal Indian usage of the time, whether in P\u0101li books by Buddhist authors or in Sanskrit books by both Buddhists and Hindus, confines the connotation of the word exclusively to the state of mind of a living Jivanmukta or Arahat.\n\nAnother matter of detail, of equal importance, is the use of the phrase 'Northern and Southern' for the Sanskrit and P\u0101li books. When Buddhism first became known in the West, it had been driven out of India, and the Sanskrit Buddhist MSS. came to us from Nepal in the north, while the P\u0101li ones came from Ceylon in the south. It was natural, therefore, then to distinguish them as Northern and Southern, and in that sense the distinction was quite correct. Insensibly, however, the use of the words was supposed to mean much more, namely, that the Sanskrit books were all written in Nepal, and the P\u0101li Pitakas composed in Ceylon. Such an inference is entirely unjustified. And no one would object to it more strongly than our author. But it leads to so complete a perversion of the history of Buddhist literature that the only way to avoid endless confusion is to drop the use of these ambiguous words altogether. So far as our present information goes, it is most probable that nearly all the early books\u2014that is, the books, whether Sanskrit or P\u0101li, earlier, or not much later, than the Christian era\u2014were composed in the valley\nof the Ganges. But we do not know the exact place of origin of any one of them. And no one can say for certain that the Divy\u0101vad\u0101na, for instance, or the Lalita Vistara, was written in a spot to the north of the place where the Padh\u0101na Sutta, for instance, or the Kath\u0101 Vatthu was composed. Why, then, continue the use of a phraseology which ignorant or careless readers may, and probably will, understand in a sense different from that intended? It should be added that the author very seldom does use it, and in the majority of cases has been led, by a sound instinct, to the use of more exact and less ambiguous terms.\n\nThe question raised in the last paragraph really lies at the root of all critical judgment of Buddhist questions. Even the terms P\u0101li and Sanskrit are objectionable, though in a less degree, and though they do not contain the suggestio falsi lurking in the terms Northern and Southern. There is no such thing as a P\u0101li Buddhism, much less a Sanskrit Buddhism. It is therefore a matter of the first importance that the present author has made the great advance (conspicuous, not only in the terms he usually uses when comparing the books, but also in the whole tone of his monograph) of specifying in each case the book itself by name. This is not only the safest way, it is the only right way. But when it has become universal (as it certainly will some day) it will render necessary the re-writing of much that has been written by Sanskritists on Buddhism. What would become of such a statement as this, found in the latest book of the kind?\u2014\n\n\"The distinction between Northern and Southern doctrine is indicated by the terms 'Great Vehicle' and 'Little Vehicle' respectively.\"\n\nTo point out the blunders, both of fact and of implication, in this striking announcement would become unnecessary if our author's excellent plan were followed of saying rather\u2014\"Such and such a doctrine is to be found in such and such a book,\" and then proceeding to discuss the historical position of the doctrine in question.\n\nThe crux of Pattakkhandho, p. 119, has already been\nsolved at \"Vinaya Texts,\" iii, 13\u2014and compare Milinda 5; Anguttara, iii, 73. 4; Divy\u0101vad\u0101na 633. D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya should be read for Majjhima Nik\u0101ya at pp. 33, 39. It is strange that at p. 118 no mention is made of the parallel passage at Majjhima i, 234 (where the right readings are given), and the meaning of kathala 'potsherd' seems clear enough from Culla Vagga, v, 22. 1; D\u012bgha, 2. 98; Puggala Pa\u00f1\u00f1atti, 3. 14; Samyutta, iv, 313. Cankam\u0101 orohitv\u0101 on p. 150 is not merely 'gave up walking,' but 'stepped down from the place [cloister one might call it] where he had been walking up and down meditating.' Such a cankama was a constant appendage to a vih\u0101ra. So on p. 151, lines 21 and following, the meaning is surely rather that Sa\u00f1jiva used easily to attain the state called Sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101-vedayita-norodha, whether he might have gone into a wood, or sat at the foot of a tree, or, etc. On p. 191 (last line), what the hearer gets to know is, inter alia, that there will be no rebirth for him into this world. The words to be supplied in the text at Samyutta, 2. 195, are, of course, the same as in Vinaya, vol. i, p. 14, and often found elsewhere. On page 75 (four lines from the bottom), for Halbgott read Mensch. On pp. 65, 81 the author, on the supposed authority of the Divy\u0101vad\u0101na, understands Gotamaka Cetiya to mean the Bo Tree. But it is quite clear that this pre-Buddhistic sacred place was close to Ves\u0101li\u2014so J\u0101taka, ii, 259\u2014and cannot therefore have been the Bo Tree at Gay\u0101, which was an Assattha, not a Nigrodha tree. The interpretation of \u0101cariyak\u0101\u1e47 at p. 71 is scarcely consistent with Mah\u0101 Vagga, vi, 37. 1, and the Sonada\u1e47\u1e0da Sutta at D\u012bgha, 1. 119; and on the same page the expression 'wonder-working truth' is, after all, supported by the use of the opposite phrase app\u0101tihi\u1e47\u1e47am katha\u1e41 'ineffectual talk,' of the talk of the Brahmans in the Tevijja Sutta. On p. 80, line 12, the ti on the last line of p. 32 of the text and the bhante on the first line of p. 33 show that in the latter case it is \u0100nanda who is speaking, and not the Buddha; and the logical sequence of the thought was already visible enough in the version in \"Buddhist Suttas,\" pp. 54, 55. Why\nshould the word *Zufall* have been chosen at p. 61 to express the similar result of similar causes?\n\nThe general results of the author's investigation into the history of the M\u0101ra legend are as follows:\n\n(1) That the Buddha had so far overcome both death and transmigration that for him and his disciples death led no longer to a new life and a new death.\n\n(2) Buddha himself made use of a poetical expression, drawn from existing beliefs and expressions in the pre-Buddhistic Brahmanical literature, in which he apostrophized M\u0101ra, the personification of death or evil, as defeated.\n\n(3) After his death these expressions were held to be not only poetical but historical. And as they are related to have been used at various times and places during his long career, so the earliest versions of the legend represent the attacks or temptations of the Evil One as having been continuous throughout his life.\n\n(4) But gradually the legend gets more and more to regard the victory of the Buddha as won, once for all, under the Bo Tree. And the episode of M\u0101ra's daughters is then introduced.\n\n(5) Last of all comes the long description of the Buddha's victory then and there over the hosts of M\u0101ra's army.\n\n(6) Together with this last phase we have the commencement of the train of ideas by which the Bodhisat is brought ever more and more into prominence.\n\n(7) It is in the Sutta Nip\u0101ta and the Samyutta Nik\u0101ya that we have the oldest form of the legend. The Mah\u0101-parinibb\u0101na Sutta account is later, and the account in the Sanskrit books, as a whole, later still. But these last have, in many details, preserved reminiscences of a form of the tradition older even than the oldest of the P\u0101li books, and are invaluable for a right understanding of the whole question.\n\nAll these conclusions will, we believe, be sooner or later accepted. But it is not so much on that account, or on account of the large number of philological points elucidated, as on account of the admirable critical spirit shown\nthroughout the work, that we think this monograph will make an epoch in the study of Buddhism, and of the history of Indian thought.\n\nIt will be a fortunate day when we get any one of the essential doctrines of Buddhism\u2014such, for instance, as Arahatsip, or the doctrine of the Sankh\u0101ras, or the scheme of causation, the Paticca-samupp\u0101da\u2014treated in the same masterly way; and we trust the author may be encouraged by the complete success of his present effort to deal hereafter with the daily increasing material for the treatment of one of these questions.\n\nR.H. D.\n\nCatalogue of Hebrew Books in the British Museum acquired during the years 1868\u20131892. By S. Van Straalen. 4to, pp. vi+532. (London, 1894.)\n\nThe Library of the British Museum has increased its treasures continually, since the time of the first Catalogue compiled by the masterly hand of Zedner twenty-five years ago. To Mr. Van Straalen we owe the Catalogue of the new acquisitions, elaborated in great part on the lines laid down by his predecessor. It would be out of place to speak here of the nature and value of the new acquisitions. They do not come up in the remotest way to the extreme value of the earlier collection, which abounds in Unica and Incunables. To acquire scarce books is, however, not a thing that depends upon the Librarian; chance will often throw a book in his path for which he may have been looking in vain for years. But as far as I have been able to ascertain, the efforts of the new Librarian are directed to obtain all those works which appear in the East, and are often printed in so very limited a number that they seldom reach the European market. In one point this Catalogue is superior to Zedner's, viz. in the addition of the pressmark, by which the student is saved a great deal of trouble and search. An excellent index, comprising both volumes, fills almost one-half of this Catalogue (pp. 311\u2013532). It is a pity\nthat the pages of vol. i have not been given in the reference. The work is done conscientiously and carefully, and the Catalogue will prove a boon to students of Hebrew literature in one of the greatest libraries of the world.\n\nI cannot let this occasion pass without expressing my regret that this volume has not been issued by the Trustees in the same size as the previous one of Zedner. The last-named is a beautiful handy octavo volume, whilst this new one is a large unwieldy quarto. The price of \u00a33 3s. is also almost prohibitive, and the type leaves much to be desired. It contrasts very unfavourably with, for instance, the beautiful Catalogue of Greek Papyri, issued also by the Trustees of the British Museum.\n\nM. G.\n\nBarlaam and Josaphat. English Lives of Buddha. Edited and Indexed by Joseph Jacobs. 8vo, pp. cxxxii +56. (London: D. Nutt, 1896.)\n\nIn an attractive, skilful, but sometimes flippant style, Mr. Jacobs has retold the old tale of the wanderings and transformations of the great legend of Renunciation, told of Buddha. He recasts in an easier form the solid work of Prof. Kuhn, which I brought under the notice of the readers of our Journal in 1894 (pp. 402-404). A general introduction, in which, I am sorry to say, I have not found any progress over Kuhn's elaborate and minute study, leads up to the summary of the framework and the short description of the Parables, with full but not complete bibliographical notes.\n\nIt is surprising that Mr. Jacobs should not have taken any notice in his introduction of Mr. Conybeare's important discovery of the Armenian version. The antiquity of the Armenian literature gives it, on account of this fact alone, a prominent position in the history of literary tradition; and the dependence of the Georgian and Gruzinian literature\u2014the latter also not mentioned by Mr. Jacobs\u2014upon\nthe Armenian, points to this version as the connecting link between the lost Pahlavi and those versions which are independent of the Greek. A direct translation from Arabic, as is assumed by Mr. Jacobs, is entirely out of question, and a Syriac intermediary is, to say the least, very doubtful. Mr. Jacobs has also not made use of the information contained in Mr. Ward's Catalogue, to which I referred in my last review, and from Slavonic and Rumanian literature many more parallels could have been added, even from my \"Literatura populara\" and Pypin's old but still valuable \"O\u010derk\u016f.\" For those who have no access to Kuhn's book, Mr. Jacobs' will prove very useful.\n\nM. G.\n\nPanca-krama. By L. de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin. 8vo, pp. 56. (Engelcke, Ghent.)\n\nThis little manual of the later Tantric Buddhism is divided into five chapters, four of which are assigned in the colophons to N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, and the fifth to \u015a\u0101kyamitra. The present editor is inclined to think that the work, as we now have it, has been recast by \u015a\u0101kyamitra on the basis of an older work of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. The latter's date is uncertain, but \u015a\u0101kyamitra was, according to T\u0101r\u0101natha, a contemporary of Devap\u0101la, son and successor of Gop\u0101la, the founder of the P\u0101la dynasty of Bengal, and would have lived therefore in the ninth century A.D. Both his teacher \u015a\u0101kya-prabhu, and the latter's teacher Punyakirti, came from \"the East\" (probably Bengal), and he himself, who also wrote a work entitled the \"Ko\u015bal\u0101lank\u0101ra,\" was born in Ko\u015bala. He belonged, therefore, neither to the North nor to the South, but to the famous Middle Country of Buddhism, in which almost all the Buddhist works known to us were composed. The whole of the little work is here edited from a single MS. in the Biblioth\u00e8que\nNationale, and in the roman character; and it is accompanied by the commentary also found in the same manuscript. The edition has all the advantages (and, it may be added, the inevitable shortcomings) incidental to such an edition from a single MS. Short as it is, it throws very valuable and welcome light on the mystic side of later Buddhist speculation, of which the germs, as the author rightly points out, can be clearly traced already in the P\u0101li books. The thanks of students are due to him for taking up this unexplored field in the Buddhist history of Indian thought; and they will look forward to the further labours in the same direction of which he holds out the promise, and more especially to a detailed comparison of the five stages of this treatise with the ancient five Jh\u0101nas on the one hand, and the Yoga system on the other.\n\nR.H. D.\n\nJin\u0101lankara by Buddha-Rakkhita. Edition with Introduction, Notes, and Translation by James Gray. 8vo, pp. 112. (London: Luzac, 1894.)\n\nThis little P\u0101li poem of 250 stanzas is a very interesting and curious production. The editor accepts, without question, the tradition (for which he gives no authority) that ascribes to the author the astounding date of 426 B.C. But the poem, if such it can be called, is a series of puzzles and tours de force in P\u0101li based on the legend of Buddha, and incorporating all the latest phases of it. It must be later, therefore, than any of the works in which that legend is set forth in gradually growing absurdity. And the only safe course is to argue from the fact that Buddhadatta, the contemporary of Buddhaghosa, wrote the only existing commentary upon it, that it must be at least as old as the fourth century of our era. Even so it is interesting, as probably the oldest specimen in P\u0101li of this kind of literary bad taste. Its sole importance is the light it can thus shed on the history of Indian literature; for it has\nno beauty of style, nor does it contribute anything to our knowledge of Buddhism. One line reads\u2014\n\nNamo tassa yato mahimato yassa tamo na,\n\nwhich is very forced as P\u0101li, but has the supposed excellent advantage of being able to be read either backwards or forwards. So verse 105 (comp. Kir\u0101t\u0101rjun\u012bya xv, 14) runs\u2014\n\nNon\u0101nino nan\u016bn\u0101ni nanen\u0101ni nan\u0101nino\nNunn\u0101nen\u0101ni nun\u0101 na n\u0101nanam n\u0101nanena no,\n\nwhich, as P\u0101li, is abominable, but is a very pretty trick with its n's only and its vowels. With the help of the commentator it is possible to puzzle out some sort of a meaning. Then we have a verse of four lines, each containing the same letters, but having four quite different meanings; and rhyming verses of many sorts, and alliterative puzzles of various kinds. It is really very ingenious, and it is good to have a correct edition of it; and the translation loosely reproduces Buddhadatta's solutions of the various puzzles. It is a pity the editor has not compared his author's work with the corresponding efforts in Sanskrit, which are usually placed a century or more later.\n\nR.H. D.\n\nThesaurus Syriacus: collegerunt Quatr\u00e8mere, Bernstein, etc., auxit, disposuit, digessit, edidit R. Payne Smith, S.T.P. Fasc. 1-9. (Oxford: Clarendon Press.)\n\nIt would be impossible to commence a review of this book without an expression of sorrow that the learned author should not have been spared to finish the work of his life. When the first fasciculus appeared in 1868, it was calculated that the remaining nine would be published in as many years; in the twenty-eight years which have elapsed since then eight parts have appeared, bringing the dictionary down to the nineteenth letter of the Syriac alphabet; the part which is to contain the last three letters\nis not likely to be finished before the end of this year, and even then the advice of those German scholars who demand a volume of *addenda* and *corrigenda* can scarcely be neglected. There has, therefore, been a mistake of eighteen years in the original calculation; a mistake which probably compares favourably with that committed with regard to another great lexicon also published by the Oxford Press.\n\nOf the life of the author this is not the place to speak, though it may be mentioned that at the commencement of middle life he gave up a lucrative headmastership in London in order to pursue his Syriac studies as sub-librarian of the Bodleian, and that we are indebted to him for a Catalogue of the Syriac MSS. in that library, as well as for several editions of Syriac texts. The founding of the Houghton Syriac prize, which has led many young scholars to study the language, was also due to his suggestion. However, the need of a new Syriac dictionary had probably been brought home to him before he returned to Oxford by the study of the Nitrian collection in the British Museum\u2014that famous collection of which the \"plums\" were picked by Cureton, Lagarde, and Land, but of which there still remains not a little for the student who is anxious to do original work.\n\n\"It never rains but it pours,\" and the learned world having been scantily provided with Syriac dictionaries until two years ago, has now quite a number at its disposal; and the late Dean's daughter and collaborateur is well forward with another. But when the collection of the Thesaurus commenced, the amount that had been done for Syriac lexicography was by no means considerable. While the native Arabic dictionaries are so scholarly and exhaustive that Golius, Freytag, and we may even add Lane, have had little to do beyond translating and rearranging to make them serve for the use of Europeans, the Syro-Arabic glosses of Bar-Ali and Bar-Bahlul, on which the Syriac lexicographer has to build, are on the level of Hesychius and Suidas. Till very lately copies of\nthese glossaries could only be seen at a few public libraries; however, an eminent French Semitist, M. Duval, has now nearly completed his elaborate edition of Bar-Bahlul, while an American scholar has, at any rate, made great preparations for editing Bar-Ali, of whose book one-half had previously been lithographed by Dr. Hoffmann, of Kiel. The only dictionary till recently in the hands of Europeans was the reprint made by Michaelis of the Syriac portion of the Heptaglott Lexicon of the Cambridge professor, Edmund Castell, bearing the date 1788, which, as has been well said, by no means came up to what the world might have expected of so eminent a scholar. Between the dates of Castell and Michaelis had come the Bibliotheca Orientalis of Assemani, and the Roman edition of S. Ephraem, placing Syriac scholarship on a very different level from the time when the literature was almost entirely represented by the Peshitta version of the Bible. Several persons before the Dean of Canterbury attempted to improve on Michaelis, but either gave up the idea or were prevented by death from carrying it out. Such among Dr. Payne Smith's own contemporaries were Cowper and Lagarde; earlier in the century the French Orientalist, Quatrem\u00e8re, and Bernstein, whose Glossary to Kirsch's Chrestomathy still arouses admiration for its consummate scholarship.\n\nThe materials collected by these two scholars were procured by the Clarendon Press for Dr. Payne Smith's Thesaurus; the notes of Quatrem\u00e8re were mainly based on the study of MSS. in the Paris Library, while Bernstein had worked through printed books. To these materials were added the notes collected by a Swedish scholar, Agrell, who had also planned a Syriac lexicon early in the century; and the valuable collections of Field, the editor of the \"Hexapla,\" and of R\u00f6diger, the distinguished colleague of Gesenius, afterwards came to swell the work. Although Dr. Payne Smith modestly placed the names of all these scholars on his title-page, as the collectors of the Thesaurus, claiming for himself only the merit of having increased, arranged, explained, and edited their materials, his own\ncontribution of words, phrases, and references, obtained from an exhaustive study of the Syriac MSS. in the Bodleian Library, as well as from perusal of many of those in the British Museum, and by excerpting each new Syriac publication as it came out, must be greater than that of any of his predecessors. Very few of the editors of Syriac texts have done anything to help the lexicographer; Lagarde, who surpassed his contemporaries in the number and importance of the texts he issued, published them quite \"naked,\" as he phrased it, i.e. without note, comment, or index; the collation of these texts with their Greek originals, where preserved, especially in the case of the Geoponica, where the order of the Greek differs entirely from that of the Syriac version, means a very serious task, which those who study these books with the aid of the Thesaurus will acknowledge that the Dean has faithfully performed. Where the texts have been translated and criticized, as is the case with Wright's Apocryphal Acts and Land's Anecdota Syrica, due notice has been taken in the Thesaurus of the opinions of the critics. Although, as appears from his review of Land's Anecdota, the Dean was a confirmed opponent of conjectural emendation, the columns of the Thesaurus abound in judicious emendations of the texts, suggested by a profound acquaintance with Syriac idiom.\n\nIn the matter of etymology and comparison with the cognate dialects, the Thesaurus is at least as scientific as any other of the great storehouses of the Semitic idioms, and far less fanciful than some of them. The best work in tracing Aramaic words to Aryan sources has been done by Lagarde, whose acquaintance with Zend, Armenian, and modern Persian in all probability far surpassed that possessed by any other Semitic scholar; but his results were not always tenable, and Dr. Payne Smith was doubtless right in rejecting many of them. The cognate roots in Hebrew, the Jewish Aramaic, and Arabic were supplied, to some extent, out of the materials of Bernstein; but many of these would suggest themselves to any scholar, and it is likely that there are subtle rules of sound-change.\nyet to be discovered which may bring many more affinities to light.\n\nThe inclusion of the Mandaic, Jerusalem Syriac, and New Syriac dialects is justified by convenience; the language of the Evangeliarium Hierosolomytanum has closer affinities with the Jewish than with the Christian Aramaic, but the \"Chaldee\" lexica do not recognize it; and the vocabularies of the other two dialects have hitherto been given only in out-of-the-way publications. The use of the Latin language, always hampering to the lexicographer, is to be defended by the interest taken by Roman Catholic scholars in the study of Syriac, and the Dean's example has been followed in Germany and at Beirut.\n\nTo estimate the amount that the Thesaurus has done for the furtherance of our knowledge of the language, a student has but to contrast his acquaintance with the words beginning with the last three letters of the alphabet with what he can learn from the Thesaurus about the others. The extraordinary wealth of vocables and of phrases brought to light lends some sort of colour to the claim of some of the Syrians, ridiculed as an idle boast by Gibbon, that their language was superior to that of the Arabs. Fifty years ago it would have been sufficient to confront a Syriac vocabulary with the Kamus to refute such a pretension. Equally important are the serried ranks of carefully selected and accurately referenced examples, accompanying each word and teaching the history of the language and its local distribution. Only possible in a dictionary on this scale, these collections are the indispensable foundation for the scientific study of a great literary idiom. Perhaps the chronological arrangement in the Thesaurus is sometimes defective, but this the student can easily remedy for himself.\n\nIt may be hoped that the completion of the work may be carried out with little delay, and with little deviation from the ideas and methods of the late Dean. With these the scholar who has been charged with the task is, through long co-operation, familiar.\n\nD. S. Margoliouth.\nPRAKRIT AND SANSKRIT INSCRIPTIONS OF KATTYWAR, ETC.\n\nPublished by order of H.H. the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Bh\u0101vnagar.\n\nThis is a collection of fifty-four inscriptions from K\u0101thi\u0101v\u0101\u1e0d and neighbouring parts of India, with English translations and forty-one plates. It is published by the Bh\u0101vnagar Archaeological Department, under the auspices of His Highness the late Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Bh\u0101vnagar, whose liberality deserves, indeed, most cordial acknowledgment.\u00b9\n\nSome of these inscriptions are of very great interest, and have played an important part in the history of Indian epigraphy, and more than half of them have been published at least once before. Although the new editors\u00b2 must have been well aware of this fact, they, I regret to say, have neglected to take full advantage of it; and the result is that the texts and translations of the more important and difficult inscriptions here offered to the public fall far short of the standard of scholarship that had already been attained by previous workers in the same field. Of the smaller number of inscriptions which are now published here for the first time, a few bring to light historical details of some value. But as the editors themselves confess that some of this fresh material has been taken from \"written copies,\" not from the originals or impressions, it is indispensable to have it re-edited critically before it can be utilized with confidence. Of the plates which accompany the texts some are fair, while others cannot for a moment be compared with the previously published plates of the same inscriptions.\n\nInstead of entering upon a detailed criticism of individual texts, for which I should have ample material, I propose to give here a short summary of the contents of the whole collection, in order to show, what the editors have failed to do, where and by whom some of these inscriptions have\n\n\u00b9 In this I quite agree with Prof. Peterson, who has written an introductory note on the earlier inscriptions of this collection.\n\u00b2 Their names are not given in the book.\nlast been edited before, and to indicate briefly the nature of those records\\(^1\\) which are now brought to public notice for the first time.

(Oxford, 1895.)\n\nTo the indefatigable zeal of Dr. Neubauer we owe this second volume of his great publication of medi\u00e6val Jewish chronicles. The historical literature of the Jews is very meagre in independent compositions. Only a few have enjoyed a comparatively wider circulation, whilst many lay unnoticed on the shelves of libraries or of cloisters. The former have also not had the good fortune of a critical edition. As a rule only one MS. was printed, without taking into consideration other MSS. of the same text. Of these three appear in Dr. Neubauer's edition, with varias lectiones and in a carefully prepared text. The first is \"The Scroll of Fasting,\" dating probably in its inception from the era of the Maccab\u00e6ans, for which Dr. Neubauer has made use of at least eight MSS. (p. 3). The second is \"The Order\" (i.e. the Chronological Order) of the world, from the printed edition, with which he has collated a MS. representing the so-called Franco-German tradition, and at least eight more fragmentary MSS. (p. 26). For completeness' sake Dr. Neubauer has added the so-called \"Minor Order\" (p. 68) in three recensions. He does\nnot assign great value to this compilation, a view from which I dissent. If anything, we find in this \"Minor Order\" traces of the old Hellenistic biblical chronology and of the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, in the dates assigned to the twelve children of Jacob.\n\nThus far we have been dealing with texts which had been printed previously, but not critically. All the rest is quite new, and if Dr. Neubauer would have published only these, his publication would have ranked very highly in the literature of chronicles. The next text is now an Arabic short chronology from the Creation down to 1159, taken from MSS. discovered recently in Egypt (p. 89). The gem of this collection is undoubtedly the chronicle in doggerel rhymes discovered by Dr. Neubauer in the Cathedral Library of Toledo. It deals with the early settlements of Jews in South Italy, the invasion of the Saracens in 872, the conquest of Egypt, etc. It was composed c. 1055, and throws a vivid light upon a period and circumstances hitherto totally unknown (p. 111).\n\nNext follows the diary of the famous David Reubeni, 1522\u20131525, from the facsimile of the unique MS. which once belonged to the Bodleian, but had disappeared since 1867. D. Reubeni pretended to be the emissary of the King of Ten Tribes, who had come to Europe to seek the assistance of the Pope and the King of Portugal against the Muhammedans. The description of his journey through \u1e24abor, Egypt, Palestine, etc., turns out to be accurate. Whatever may have been the true origin of his pretended mission, there is no doubt in my mind that D. Reubeni was anything but an impostor; and how Dr. Neubauer can say that his Hebrew style is that of a German Jew, is to me incomprehensible. It shows throughout traces of Arabic influence, and one has only to compare non-religious writings of the Jews in Yemen to find absolutely striking parallels to that style, which at the first glance is rather startling (p. 133).\n\nDr. Neubauer has added further eight appendices (p. 224 ff.) from scarce books on chronology and fragmentary MSS.,\nwhich complete the material thus richly brought together from various quarters.\n\nAn exhaustive Index of Names, elaborated by Dr. Greenburg (late of the Montefiore College), enhances the value of this excellent publication, which, moreover, is not marred by the omissions in which Dr. Neubauer indulged in the first volume. He has given us this time all the texts in full, leaving the student to pick and choose those portions in which he takes a special interest.\n\nOne would like to add a humble request to the Clarendon Press to do away with their Hebrew type. It is antiquated, thin\u2014a sore to the eye and a trouble to the reader.\n\nM. G.\n\nThe Religions of India. By Edward Washburn Hopkins, Professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology in Bryn Mawr College. (Boston, U.S.A., and London: Ginn and Co., publishers, 1895.)\n\nThis volume opens a new series of \"Handbooks on the History of Religions,\" under the general direction of Prof. Morris Jastrow, jun., of the University of Pennsylvania. The editor's plan is broad and comprehensive: he will deal himself with Babylonia and Assyria; the ancient Teutons are to have their turn next, at the hands of Prof. Chantepie de la Saussaye; and Prof. Jackson, of Columbia College, will then describe the religion of Persia. The series is based on large and generous ideas of the value of the study of religious history; and Prof. Hopkins is not hampered in his ethical or philosophical appreciations by any dogmatic restraints or ecclesiastical reserve.\n\nProf. Hopkins warns us at the outset that he does not desire to compete with Barth's well-known book under the same title. His aim and method are rather different. In the great procession of religions which passes across his stage, he proposes to introduce each successive figure, and\nlet her speak for herself. So his pages are rich in illustrative quotations, which will undoubtedly be of great service to the general reader; they are often selected with sympathy and insight; and the chapters on the Hinduism of the Epics will open up to many students more at home in the earlier literature, most interesting glimpses into the development of moral and religious ideas. Excellent bibliographical summaries will also point the way to those who seek further acquaintance with the original sources, and the more technical discussions of modern scholarship.\n\nIn so vast a range, from the era of the Vedic hymns to the preaching of Keshub Chunder Sen, every reader is sure to desire that more stress should have been laid on the particular aspects of the great religious evolution in which he is especially interested. Criticism of Prof. Hopkins will, therefore, mostly take the form of pointing out omissions, trying to rectify wrong proportions, or protesting against false emphasis. The treatment of the Vedic hymns is moderate and cautious in its attitude to different schools of interpreters; but betrays an infirm philosophic basis in the adoption of the Hindu division of the gods into \"Upper,\" \"Middle,\" and \"Lower,\" apparently for no better reason than because it is as good as another, for it can hardly be seriously pleaded that there was a chronological order either of worship or of hymn-production \"from above earthwards.\" The want of definite criteria, whether theoretic or practical, seems most apparent in this section. Moreover, the historical background is never clearly filled in: all through the book the details that are supplied enter only fitfully, and in unexpected places; and the presentment is at first too closely confined to the literary monuments, in forgetfulness of the fact that the Brahmanical schools, after all, only represented the views of a select aristocracy. There is only a brief glance at the unrecognized cults, of the existence of which later literature bears such ample traces; and the numerous signs of the survival of the lower animism pass almost unnoticed. In the description of the Brahmanic worship most students will probably\nfeel that the chapter on the same subject in Hardy's volume (in the M\u00fcnster series) conveys much more information, and in much more systematic fashion. The importance of ritual in modern study should have secured a fuller exposition of the leading ideas and practices. Still stranger, as it seems to us, is the neglect to trace the rise of the doctrine of transmigration, and the law of moral causation summed up in the one word *karma*. Prof. Hopkins justly repudiates the view (p. 425) that the *sams\u0101ra* was a Buddhist invention; but his early references to it (pp. 199, 204) strike us as quite inadequate in view of the immense importance of the belief for all subsequent phases of Hindu thought.\n\nThe transition from the account of ritual and philosophic Brahmanism to Buddhism is effected in a chapter on \"Popular Brahmanism,\" which enables Prof. Hopkins to make interesting use of some of the materials in the Law-books. A great deal more might have been added from the Buddhist texts (to say nothing of the J\u0101taka stories) had Prof. Hopkins been more familiar with them. As it is, the reader does not gather anything like a sufficiently vivid picture of the eager intellectual activity which marked the valley of the Ganges in the days when Jainism and Buddhism arose. Here and there an apt remark, such as that on p. 280, \"One cannot read the Upanishad without feeling that he is already facing an intellectual revolt,\" creates an expectation which the subsequent narrative fails to satisfy. This is particularly the case with the whole treatment of Buddhism. Like Jainism, this is presented as a great \"heresy\" (pp. 3, 283) or \"schism.\" This unfortunate limitation grievously contracts our author's view. In his sketch of the personality of Gotama, he is sympathetic enough\u2014\"no man had ever lived so godless, yet so godlike\"; but he makes no attempt to analyse the elements of the ideal type of the Buddha, or to explain its enormous influence on the subsequent history of India. The originality of the conception of the Order, and the nature of its early missionary spirit, do not seem to receive sufficient recognition. The ambiguity of the\nfollowing sentence (which is not a favourable specimen of our author's style) betrays, perhaps, the weakness of his grasp of this portion of his subject. After affirming that the monasteries are plainly of secondary growth, he continues:\n\n\"If one limit their national and political importance to a period one or two hundred years after the Master's time, he will not err in attributing to this cause, as does Barth, the reason for the rapid rise and supremacy of Buddhism over India.\"\n\nThe period named by Prof. Hopkins carries the story down to the reign of A\u1e63oka, but this is dismissed in a few lines (p. 340), and after two pages more Buddhism expires in the twelfth or thirteenth century A.D. Different opinions will of course be formed as to the religious and philosophical value of the teachings of the later books of the Great Vehicle. To some minds the theistic evolution represented in the \"Lotus,\" for example, is an extremely interesting instance of the influence of a powerful school of metaphysical speculation on a system of ethical culture which had started by repudiating it. We do not quarrel with Prof. Hopkins for not stopping to expound it. But the influence of Buddhism on art and architecture ought to have received some notice; and the famous edicts of A\u1e63oka surely deserved more notice than the bare allusion to the \"credo which is engraved all over India.\" The archaeological side of his whole subject, however, is left by our author in obscurity; nor has he any word of the suggestive pictures which Hiouen Thsang has drawn for us of life in the University of N\u0101landa, or the great Quinquennial Assembly celebrated by Sil\u0101ditya at Pray\u0101ga. In literature, on the other hand, the recognition of Buddhist traces in the later epic, though cautious, is careful and discriminating (pp. 423-426).\n\nThere are other large questions touched by Prof. Hopkins in the interesting chapter on India and the West. Through Pythagoreanism, from which all subsequent philosophies borrowed, India, he thinks, helped to form the mind of\nEurope. He is more confident of the indebtedness of both neo-Platonists and Gnostics to Indian thought than we can be. But we must not open up these far-reaching themes. In another edition misprints, such as Brittanica and M\u0101gadha, should be avoided. Some words\u2014\"chrematheism,\" \"esian,\" \"trinity,\" \"rubricated,\" \"coralled the kine,\" \"mangonize\"\u2014sound curious to English ears. Prof. Hopkins's book will not supersede that of Barth, but it will be a very useful supplement to it.\n\nCatalogue of Persian Manuscripts in the Cambridge University Library. By E. G. Browne, M.A., M.B.\n\nTo all who are interested in Persian literature the name of the compiler of this Catalogue will be a sufficient guarantee for its accuracy and scholarship. Mr. Browne, in this handy and most clearly printed volume, gives us the fruit of four years' \"arduous though intermittent labour.\" It is a work that should have been carried out long since, for a collection of MSS. without a published catalogue is of little use to any but those living on the spot. In the present case they were well-nigh inaccessible to students living in Cambridge itself, owing to the chaotic way in which all MSS. in Arabic character had been turned into the shelves without regard to language, subject, or even to size. Thus, before the Persian MSS. could be catalogued they had to be sorted out carefully from their Arabic, Turkish, and other companions.\n\nThe collection comprises some 340 MSS. in all. Among these Mr. Browne has found\u2014one may almost say discovered\u2014several rare and interesting works. Foremost among these with regard to antiquity comes the Commentary on the Qur\u02be\u0101n described on page 13 et seq. This work, of which no other copy seems to be known, has been subjected to a very careful examination, the results of which have in part already been made known to scholars through this Journal.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 J.R.A.S., July 1894, pp. 417-524.\nIn the present Catalogue the compiler gives us some further extracts, and reproduces interesting opinions with regard to authorship and date communicated to him by various eminent Orientalists on the Continent, such as N\u00f6ldeke and De Goeje. This commentary is of the greatest linguistic value, as the various peculiarities of writing, spelling, grammar, and vocabulary furnish us with fresh material for research into Iranian philology. The probable date of this MS. is fully discussed: it cannot, at any rate, be much later than the fifth century of the Hijra. The whole text, though the actual matter it contains is of little interest, is well worth a careful edition.\n\nOf really old texts little beyond the invaluable *Materia Medica* of Ab\u00fa Mans\u00far Muwaffaq (about A.H. 360) is accessible to the student. Our MSS.\u2014and hence our editions\u2014of the Shahnama are all more or less corrupt and much modernized.\n\nNext in interest we would place the *J\u0101rid\u0101n-i-Kab\u012br*, which is described on page 69 *et seq.*, a curious work on Isma\u02bfili doctrines. It possesses a twofold interest: firstly, from an ethical point of view, as representing the tenets of the hitherto little known \u1e24ur\u016bf\u012b sect of the Isma\u02bfilis; and, secondly, from a linguistic standpoint\u2014for a considerable portion of it is written in a dialect which Mr. Browne recognizes to be one of the West Persian dialects (akin to Luri and Kurdish), which M. Huart collectively designates *Pehlevi-Musulman*. It is not dated, but appears to be of the fifteenth century. A brief list is appended of some of the dialectical words and forms, together with their Persian equivalents, as given in the interlinear glosses; and in conclusion a few specimen extracts illustrating the dialect.\n\nA very full notice is given (p. 122 *et seq.*) of an interesting collection of *ta\u02bfsiyas*. History and poetry are represented by the usual standard works, already treated of in other catalogues, so that it was only left for Mr. Browne to identify and describe them briefly. The work as a whole leaves little or nothing to be desired, and can only add yet\nfurther to Mr. Browne's well-earned reputation for Persian scholarship. A few notes on the Persian Histories of India contained in the collection will be found below.\n\nE. D. Ross.\n\n'Notes on some of the Works relating to Indian History contained in Mr. Browne's \"Catalogue of the Persian Manuscripts in the Library of the University of Cambridge.\"\n\nPage 63, line 10.\u2014This Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad is probably identical with the Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad, son of Mu'tamad Kh\u0101n, mentioned on p. 167. He was the author of a most interesting memoir (finished in 1131 H.; there is a good copy in the India Office Library), and of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Mu\u1e25ammadi, an excellent obituary. His nephew, Mu\u1e25ammad Bakhsh, \u0100shob, tells us that he had a large library (see preface to the Shah\u0101dat-i-Farrukh\u0113iyar o jal\u016bs-i-Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h).\n\nPage 118, line 2 from end.\u2014I would suggest that as the text has \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0646\u06cc, it would be preferable to read A\u1e25mad Sh\u0101h Abd\u0101l\u012b, and not, as Mr. Browne proposes, A\u1e25mad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101n\u012b. He was of the Abd\u0101l\u012b tribe, and the one epithet is as often attached to his name as the other. The omission to mention Gentil as Mu\u1e25ammad Aslam's patron is due, I presume, to the fact that Rieu, 151, has already done so (see also Elliot, Mahomedan Historians, viii, 163). Gentil's pr\u00e9cis of this work is in the Orme Collections, now in the Record Department of the India Office. It is in an unnumbered folio volume of 65 pages, in black binding, inscribed \"Pour M. Orme historiographe de la Compagnie des Indes \u00e0 Londres,\" and the title is \"Pr\u00e9cis sur l'Empire Mogol depuis Azam Shah, fils d'Aurangzab, 1707 jusqu'en 1774.\" It bears the following note, apparently in Robert Orme's hand-\nwriting: \"Received June 21, 1785, at Colney: it was accompanied by a letter from Mons. D'Aragon, Secretary to the French Ambassador, to whom M. Anquetil Duperron had sent it with a letter dated June 4: I read it June the 22nd.\" See also Orme's Historical Fragments, 171, note to Note vi, and 237, Note xlix. Muhammad Aslam's work must also have formed the basis for the historical part of Gentil's M\u00e9moires sur l'Indoustan ou l'Empire Mogol (Paris, 1822), published by his son.\n\nPage 167, line 10.\u2014A.D. 1701. Is there not some misprint here? Sambat 1785 = 1728 A.D., and Mub\u0101r\u012br-ul-Mulk, Sarbuland Kh\u0101n, who was sent as governor to Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d Gujar\u0101t in 1138 H. (1725), held it till the eleventh year of Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h (1141\u20132 H. = 1728\u20139): see Ma'd\u012br-ul-Umar\u0101 (Bibl. Indica), iii, 803, 805. The same noble held the same government for a few months in 1712, but not at any earlier period. Thus 1701 A.D. must be due to an error of some sort.\n\nPage 168, lines 4 and 5.\u2014This entry of a purchase in 1167 H. of a book that had belonged to Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad (b. Mu'tamad Kh\u0101n) is interesting as throwing some light on the date of Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad's death, which is disputed. His nephew, Mu\u1e25ammad Bakhsh, Ashob, in the work already referred to, tells us that his uncle's library was dispersed and sold after his death by an unworthy son. Therefore, as this book was sold in 1167 H., it is legitimate to infer that Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad was then dead. See the difficulty as to the continuation of his T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Mu\u1e25ammadi after 1163 H. raised by Rieu, Catalogue. The last entry in it is of 1208 H. But how could he have been alive then? For we know from his Ta\u1e63kirah that he (Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad) was born at Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d (province of K\u0101bul) in 1098 H. His nephew mentions him as alive in 1151 H. at the time of N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h's invasion, but the year of his death is nowhere given. We may now assume that he died a little before 1167 H., and\nthat the later entries in the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Mu\u1e25ammadi are due to a continuator.\n\nPage 171, line 3.\u201423rd Muharram of the ninth year of Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h = 1139 H. = Sept. 19th, 1726. Properly, 22nd Muharram 1140 H. = Sept. 8th (n.s.) 1727. In the last line, same page, 1143 H. is correctly given for the 21st Muharram of the twelfth year, and that being so, Mu\u1e25arram 1139 H. would fall in the eighth and not in the ninth year.\n\nPage 174, line 4 from end.\u2014For \u0627\u064e\u0646\u0627\u0645\u060c Adn\u0101m, read \u0627\u064e\u0646\u0627\u0645\u060c \u016an\u0101m. The name is also spelt \u016an\u0101o (the o being nasalized). It is now the headquarters of a district in the Audh province between Cawnpore and Lakhnau: see plate 28 in Constable\u2019s Hand Atlas. The Persian extract shows that village R\u0101watpur was not in the province of Lakhnau (read Audh). It was in sark\u0101r Kor\u0101, and that was a subdivision of the Allah\u0101b\u0101d province: see the \u0100in-i-Akbari, vol. ii (translated by Jarrett), p. 167, where under sark\u0101r Kor\u0101, \u015f\u016bbah Allah\u0101b\u0101d, the last entry is of Mah\u0101l (or parganah) Mu\u1e25sinpur.\n\nPage 179, lines 1 and 9.\u2014For \u0633\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0646 read \u0633\u06af\u0627\u0646, the reference being obviously to the Sikhs, and the word is usually spelled Sik in the Persian character.\n\nPage 183, No. cvii.\u2014I think that this work is also to be found in the India Office Library, No. 1608 (in Ethe\u2019s printed but unpublished Catalogue, Nos. 472 to 477).\n\nPage 184, line 8.\u2014Jama\u2018-k\u0101mil in the official language of India does not mean \u201cgross receipts,\u201d but \u201cfull or total demand\u201d\u2014as in the phrase Jama\u2018-w\u0101sil-b\u0101qi, i.e. Demand, Collections, Balances.\n\nPage 193.\u2014The Khiz\u0101nah-i-\u2018\u0100mirah has been lithographed, Cawnpore, Nawal Kishor Press, Sept. 1871, p. 462.\n\nPage 282, No. cxc.\u2014This work has been printed at Calcutta under the title of Dast\u016br-ul-Insh\u0101, folio, p. 236, Isl\u0101m\u012b Press, 1270 H.

The legend is examined from a poetical standpoint,\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nand it is shown that it is mainly composed in four-line stanzas, the cesura in each line being well marked. The Professor does not give the cuneiform text, but the very careful transcription of the tablets supplies its place fairly well, enabling the student to restore the original characters, should he wish to do so; and a second transcription enables its poetical form to be seen and examined. The labours of others in the field are referred to, in some cases at full length, but the \"philological commentary\" is not so full as it might have been.\n\nT. G. P.\n\nVI.

Several scholars have answered it positively or negatively, but no one until now has brought forward an undeniable fact in support of his opinion. The object of my present note is to decide this point, and to introduce to the Society a text of P\u0101li origin in Chinese.\n\nThe canonical Buddhist books are collectively called by the Japanese, as well as by the Chinese, the San-ts'ang, \"Tripi\u1e6daka\" (\u4e09\u85cf), though we must never understand by this term what is meant by the term \"Pi\u1e6dakattayam\" in P\u0101li. The former contains, as Professor Rhys Davids has rightly pointed out,\u00b9 a number of works outside of the canon, and even Brahmanical treatises\u2014for instance, the S\u0101\u1e45khya-k\u0101rik\u0101-bh\u0101\u1e63ya (Nanjio's Catal., No. 1300). The Chinese translations of Indian works are arranged in three Pi\u1e6dakas, S\u016btra, Vinaya, and Abhidharma, as in the P\u0101li.\n\n\u00b9 See Milinda, pt. ii, p. xi, note (S.B.E., vol. xxxvi).\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nThese amount to some 1320 texts, some of which are a second or third translation of one and the same original. Besides these there are the so-called \"Indian Miscellaneous Works,\" numbering 147. That these 1467 texts might include some of the P\u0101li works now existing in Ceylon, Burma, and Siam, was an opinion advanced by some scholars. We are, however, left ignorant of the names of the dialects from which the translations were made, for no Chinese author mentions them distinctly. The Indian language in general, whether Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit, P\u0101li, or Sanskrit, is indiscriminately called the \"language of Fan,\"\u00b9 i.e. Brahmans, which is generally understood to be identical with Sanskrit. But there is no reason whatever why it should not mean also any other Indian dialect,\u00b2 for India is called the \"Kingdom of Fan,\" perhaps meant for \"Brahma-r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra.\"\n\nAs to the existence of the P\u0101li elements in China, Prof. Max M\u00fcller says in his \"Introduction to the Science of Religion\"\u00b3: \"In China, although the prevailing form of Buddhism is that of the Sanskrit canon, commonly called the northern canon, some of the books belonging to the P\u0101li, or southern canon, have been translated, and are held in reverence by certain schools.\"\n\nDr. Eitel, in his \"Handbook of Chinese Buddhism\" (1870), seems to think, as his preface and the article \"Samskrita\" show, that the Chinese texts are from P\u0101li as well as from Sanskrit. He says:\u2074 \"The most ancient Chinese texts seem to be translations from P\u0101li, the more modern texts from Sanskrit. Hiuen Thsang found (about 635 A.D.) in the Punjab little difference between Sanskrit and P\u0101li.\"\n\nI do not know, however, on what ground his conjecture is formed, and I doubt whether Hiuen Thsang really meant P\u0101li and Sanskrit. It is certain that most of the texts\n\n\u00b9 See Julien, \"M\u00e9thode pour d\u00e9chiffrer et transcrire les noms sanscrits,\" etc. (1861), p. 2 note; p. 8.\n\u00b2 Samghabhadra actually calls the P\u0101li text \"fan-p\u00ean,\" i.e. \"Text of the Brahman (language).\"\n\u00b3 1873; 2nd ed. 1893, p. 63.\n\u2074 2nd ed. 1888, p. 144b.\nwhich, for instance, Hiuen Thsang or I-tsing had before them were Sanskrit, for their transliterations are so clear and accurate that we can easily trace the words to the original sounds. But in the case of the earlier translators it is by no means easy to form an opinion as to the dialect of the original.\n\nMr. C. F. Koeppen, in his \"Religion des Buddha,\" says that the Chinese possess, besides Sanskrit texts, a number of P\u0101li works, which they obtained probably from Ceylon through some of their travellers. His statement, however, rests only on the authority of G\u00fctzlaff, who misunderstood almost every Sanskrit transliteration as P\u0101li, as may be seen in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1848, Vol. IX, pp. 199\u2013213. G\u00fctzlaff's \"List of Principal Works from the P\u0101li in Chinese Characters\" contains some 156 works, not one of which presents the appearance of P\u0101li origin; among them are even such well-known Sanskrit works as the Vajracchedik\u0101, Amit\u0101bha-s\u016btra, and the like. Afterwards, in 1880, when Chinese Buddhism had been studied with a greater accuracy, Dr. Edkins positively asserted that there are no P\u0101li books in China. Moreover, in speaking about Koeppen's statement, he says: \"Koeppen, saying that the Chinese have also a number of P\u0101li texts, has been misled by G\u00fctzlaff, who, coming to China after having lived in Siam, saw the Sanskrit inscriptions in the island of P'uto and took them to be P\u0101li. From him the opinion spread; but it is an error. The Buddhists of Burma, Siam, and Ceylon have never spread their religion in China or Japan, or introduced their sacred books into those countries.\" His was, I think, the last attempt at solution, which aims at\n\n---\n\n1 Take, for instance, the \"Sha-m\u00ean\": although it is nearer to P\u0101li \"Samano\" than to Skt. \"\u015arama\u1e47a,\" yet we have no right to judge from it that the original was P\u0101li, for we meet with \"Sha-m\u00ean\" also in those texts whose original is Sanskrit. But when we come across the word \"Sha-lo-mo-na\" (\u820d\u7f85\u6469\u8a36), we see at once that it can only be from Sanskrit \u015arama\u1e47a.\n\n2 1857, vol. i, p. 186 note.\n\n3 See \"Chinese Buddhism,\" ch. xxv, p. 401.\n\n4 Compare, however, note 1, p. 419.\nthe greatest precision among the opinions yet produced. The result of his research was that the early translations were from Pr\u0101krit, and not from P\u0101li, as Dr. Eitel supposed.\n\nNow as to the third council of the Buddhists under the great Asoka, which is generally believed to be unknown to Chinese Buddhists, Mr. O. Palladji, in his interesting \"Historische Skizzen des alten Buddhismus,\" drawn up from Chinese sources, mentions at length Asoka's council as well as the two former ones. One may well wonder why Mr. S. Beal, more than twenty years later, informed Prof. Oldenberg that Asoka's council is not found mentioned in the Chinese Pitaka. It may be due to Beal's oversight, or he may have had some ground for asserting this. He expressed more than once, if I remember well, the opinion that there is a trace of P\u0101li in the Chinese collection; but on examining the original on which his supposition rests, I found nothing to indicate its P\u0101li origin.\n\nIn the thorough examination of the Tripitaka by my friend Bunyiu Nanjo, he found no P\u0101li text, and traced most of the books to Sanskrit, and compared them with Tibetan texts, the names of which, at any rate, he, when possible, restored into Sanskrit.\n\nIt is thus well-nigh settled that the Chinese books, on the whole, are translations from the Sanskrit original, and that there is no P\u0101li work in China, and no mention of the Council of P\u0101\u1e6daliputta in the Chinese Buddhist books.\n\n---\n\n1 Erman's \"Russisches Archiv f\u00fcr Wissenschaftliche Kunde\" (1856), Band xv, pp. 206 and foll.\n2 See Oldenberg, \"Vinaya-pitakam\" (1879\u201382), vol. i, p. xxxii.\n3 We see with M. Barth the importance of a complete examination of the contents of the Chinese Pitaka (\"Religions of India,\" Engl. p. 108 note). One can give two or three quite different accounts from Chinese sources, which are a mixture of various elements. Compare, for instance, Wassilief's \"Buddhismus,\" in which many pieces of information from the Chinese are identical with the Tibetan, with Palladji's \"Historische Skizzen,\" which are not very much different from the Sinhalese chronicle.\n4 I should be sorry if I have omitted any later authorities who touched these questions, and would welcome any communications about them.\nI for my part doubted from the beginning the idea that there was not a single text in P\u0101li brought to China by any one of those 173 translators we know of, some of whom came from Southern India, from Ceylon, or from Siam, others of whom are said to have collected books in Ceylon as well as in India, to say nothing of those Chinese travellers who went to Ceylon to search for the law. He who brought a MS. may not have translated it himself, but may have left it behind to his successors to translate. Had there been a MS. there is no reason whatever why they should not translate it, seeing that several H\u012bnay\u0101na works were interpreted and preserved in the Chinese collection. Resting on this supposition, I have been for some time looking for a text of P\u0101li origin. My attention was naturally directed to the texts bearing on the Indian Chronology, while perusing many a work without any result. At last I came across a text which contains an account of the third Buddhist Council at P\u0101taliputta under the great Asoka. Besides, this book has the following stanzas, which have been hitherto found only in P\u0101li and not in Sanskrit books:\n\nP\u0101li.\n\nAnekaj\u0101tisams\u0101ram sandh\u0101vissam anibbisam\nGahak\u0101rakam gavesanto dukkh\u0101 j\u0101ti punappunam\nGahak\u0101raka dittho \u2019si puna geham na k\u0101hasi\nSabb\u0101 te ph\u0101suk\u0101 bhagg\u0101 gahak\u016btam visamkhitam\nVisamkharagatam cittam ta\u1e47h\u0101nam khayam ajjhag\u0101 \u2019ti.\n\n1 One from Ceylon, three from Siam, four from S.

But now I have seen thy house. Thou shalt not build thy house again. All thy ridge and ribs are shattered, (so as) not to be born anew. The heart has been separated from thirst (passion), and, as all desires have been exhausted, it has reached its Nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\n\nThese stanzas are the words which the Buddha is supposed to have uttered at the moment he attained to Buddhahood. The Lalita Vistara does not seem to know these verses\u2014in any case, not as the first words of the founder of Buddhism; for it gives (ch. xxii) quite a different verse as the Buddha\u2019s first words: \u201cThe vices are dried up; they will not flow again\u201d (\u015bu\u1e63k\u0101 \u0101\u015brav\u0101 na puna\u1e25 \u0101ravanti).\n\nThe text which contained those verses appeared to me, at first sight, as if it were a portion of the D\u012bpavamsa or Mah\u0101vamsa, inasmuch as it gives the three councils,\n\n---\n\n1 The P\u0101li is to be found in the Suma\u1e45gala-vil\u0101sin\u012b (p. 16), in the Samanta-p\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101 (but not in Oldenberg\u2019s text), Buddhavamsa, Dhammapada (Max M\u00fcller, \u00a7\u00a7 153, 154).

But on further perusal I found that the book was a translation of Buddhaghosa's Introduction to the Samanta-p\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101, a commentary on the Vinaya-pitakam,\\(^1\\) which gives the historical tradition from the Buddha's death to Mahinda's death in Ceylon.\n\nI was glad to find this text in the Chinese Pitaka, for I thought it might give us the following results, if I were not overestimating the value of its discovery:\n\n1. It can be no longer disputed that the Chinese Collection contains also P\u0101li elements.\n2. The Council of Asoka, under the presidency of Moggaliputta Tissa, is found mentioned in the Chinese Collection, but as yet only in the books of P\u0101li origin.\n3. Some of the information obtained from Chinese sources, and hitherto considered to be derived from Sanskrit books, may be from P\u0101li ones.\n4. Translations and transliterations of names and words contained in this book may furnish us a key to a further discovery of P\u0101li texts.\n5. In any case it will give us a large P\u0101li-Chinese vocabulary, as we have the text as well as the translation.\n6. It may help us in the collation of P\u0101li MSS. of the text translated, preserving as it does a tradition of very early date, i.e. before A.D. 489.\n7. The migration of a work of Buddhaghosa to China in 489 A.D. may serve to confirm the dates of his arrival in Ceylon in about 430, and of his sail to Burma in about 450.\n\n\\(^1\\) Childers, s.v. Atthakath\u0101; Rhys Davids, \"Buddhism,\" p. 237. A portion of this valuable record was published by Prof. Oldenberg in his \"Vinaya-pitakam,\" vol. iii (the end).\nWith the hope of realizing these points, I borrowed the Chinese text of the India Office, and began an examination into its contents last year. As I have other studies on hand, I am not able at present to lay the whole of my examination before the Society. I shall, however, notice in the following pages some of the points which, I think, may give an idea of the nature of the book.\n\nThe book in question is called in Chinese, \"Shan-chien-p'i-p'o-sha-l\u00fc,\" or \"I-ch'i-shan-chien-l\u00fc-p'i-p'o-sha\" (\u5584\u898b\u5f8b\u6bd8\u5a46\u6c99). If I were to translate it quite literally, this would mean \"All-good-appearing-vinaya-vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101.\"\u00b9 This, it will be at once noticed, is the exact meaning of the P\u0101li title. The first two characters \"i-ch'i\" are generally left out, and Nanjio\u00b2 restored \"Shan-chien-p'i-p'o-sha-l\u00fc\" to Sanskrit \"Sudar\u015bana-vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101-vinaya.\" No Sanskrit book with this title is known to have existed. It is neither found in the catalogues of Sanskrit books, nor is it mentioned by any Sanskrit author, or by any Chinese author writing about Sanskrit Buddhist books. The invention of this new title, therefore, to explain Chinese words which so exactly reproduce the P\u0101li title, seems to me unnecessary. This book is found also in Julien's \"Concordance Sinico-sanskr\u00e8te d'un nombre consid\u00e9rable de Titres d'Ouvrages Bouddhiques\" (J.A. 1849, pp. 353\u2013445), Nos. 55, 55a.\n\nThe translator, S\u0113ng-ch'ieh-po-t'o-lo (=Samgha-bhadra), was a Samana from a foreign country under the Ts'i\n\n\u00b9 This seems to be a translation of \"Samanta-p\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101\" ('pleasing all'). Samanta-pr\u0101s\u0101dika (adj.) occurs in the Mah\u0101vastu, p. 3; -t\u0101 ('having complete amiability') in the Dharmasa\u1e45graha, \u00a7 lxxxiv, p. 67, one of the eighty signs of the Buddha (41); the Chinese being \"I-ch'i man-tsu\" (I-ch'i=samanta). The Lalita Vistara, vii, p. 122, has this word, the translation of which is \"Chien-ch\u00ea-chieh-sh\u00eang-hsi,\" 'all those who look at him obtain joy.' Asoka is called \"Shan-chien\" ('good-appearing' meant for Priyadar\u015bin). The translator, not finding a suitable word for \"p\u0101s\u0101dika,\" may have used \"Shan-chien,\" \"Vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101,\" in a Buddhistic sense means 'commentary.' It ought to be Vinaya-vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101, not Vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101-vinaya. Cf. the Chinese Bk. xii, 16a.\n\n\u00b2 In his Catalogue of the Chinese Tripitaka, No. 1125 (see p. 248).\ndynasty, of the Siao family (A.D. 479\u2013502) (\u856d \u9f4a \u5916 \u570b \u6c99 \u9580, \u50e7 \u4f3d \u8dcb \u9640 \u7f85 \u8b6f).\n\nThe date of the translation is A.D. 489 (=the seventh year of the Yung-ming period of the Emperor Wu-ti) (\u6b66 \u5e1d \u6c38 \u660e \u4e03 \u5e74).\n\nThe book is recorded as belonging to the Hinay\u0101na. It is divided into 18 books, and consists of 440 leaves, each leaf containing about 400 Chinese characters.\n\nIt begins with the adoration \u201cNamo sabbesam Buddh\u0101nam\u201d (\u5357 \u7121 \u8af8 \u4f5b), and an opening verse. The first three books are devoted to the historical introduction; a rough analysis of the whole will be as follows:\n\nBk. i to Bk. iv, fol. 2. The history from the Buddha\u2019s Death to Mahinda\u2019s Death. The first section is devoted to the Council of R\u0101jagaha, which took place during the rainy season immediately after the Buddha\u2019s death at Kusin\u0101r\u0101. 500 Arhats meet under Mah\u0101kassapa: Up\u0101li recites the contents of the Vinaya, while \u0100nanda rehearses the Suttas in answer to the questions of the presiding ther\u0101. It lasted seven months.\n\nNext comes the Vajjiputtiya section. In it the \u201cTen Points\u201d brought forward by the Vajjian Bhikkhus are given, and the Council of Ves\u0101li, which met A.B. 100, is shortly described. The presiding theras of the second council were ten in number, Sa-p\u2019o-chia-mei (Sabbak\u0101m\u012b), Li-p\u2019o-to (Revata), and others, the members in all numbering 700. It ended in eight months.\n\nThe third is called the Asokar\u0101ja section, which covers some three books and fifty-two folios. It gives the rise of Asoka, his conversion to Buddhism by Ni-ch\u2019\u00fc-t\u2019o (Nigrodha), the building of Samgh\u0101r\u0101mas and medical halls, his invitation of Moggaliputta Tissa, whose life is also given at length, the examination of all Bhikkhus by Asoka, and then the Council of P\u0101taliputta, which lasted nine months, Tissa presiding over 1000 members. Then follow the ordinations of Mahinda and Samghamitt\u0101, the sending out of the Missionaries, the conversion of Dev\u0101nampiya Tissa, the planting of a branch of the Bo-tree in\nCeylon, the arrival of Samghamitt\u0101, and lastly, the deaths of Mahinda, Arittha, and others.\n\nThe whole agrees pretty well with that portion of the P\u0101li text edited by Prof. Oldenberg at the end of his Vinaya-pi\u1e6dakam, vol. iii.\n\nBk. iv, fol. 3 to Bk. vi. Commentary on the introductory portion of the Vinaya, i.e. the first part of the Suttavibha\u1e45ga.\n\nThe Mahamoggall\u0101na Khandhaka (Oldenberg, V.P. iii, 1, p. 7), the S\u0101riputta Khandhaka, and the Monkey Khandhaka (l.c. p. 23), etc., are explained.\n\nBks. vii\u2013xii. An explanation of the P\u0101r\u0101jik\u0101 rules.\n\nBks. xiii\u2013xviii. The Sa\u1e43gh\u0101dises\u0101 rules and other sections are explained.\n\nThe last part (Bk. xviii) gives some remarks in a very short form about the Kathina Khandhaka, Bhikkhun\u012b Khandhaka, etc., and also thirty-two questions to Up\u0101li (Up\u0101li-pucch\u0101) by Mah\u0101kassapa, and the answers as well. It ends with the words: \u201cThere are four wrong proceedings in the \u0100natt\u012b-kamma\u00b9 of the special priests [i.e. in the Ga\u1e47a-kamma], four in the \u0100natt\u012b-dutiya-kamma,\u00b9 and four also in the \u0100natt\u012b-catuttha-kamma\u00b9; therefore there are three times four, i.e. twelve wrong proceedings\u201d (\u5225\u4e58\u767d\u7faf\u78e8\u4e2d\u6709\u56db\u975e\u6cd5\uff0c\u767d\u4e8c\u7faf\u78e8\u4e2d\u6709\u56db\u975e\u6cd5\uff0c\u767d\u56db\u7faf\u78e8\u4e2d\u6709\u56db\u975e\u6cd5\uff1b\u4e09\u4e58\u5408\u5341\u4e8c\u975e\u6cd5).\n\nThe following extracts may perhaps serve to convince my readers of the fact that my identification is not imaginary. For shortness\u2019 sake I will omit the Chinese characters.\n\nI. The Chinese text, Bk. i, fol. 9.

The Chinese text, Bk. i, fol. 21; the P\u0101li (Oldenberg, Vinaya, vol. iii), p. 299.\n\n\"During four years after the death of King Pin-t'ou-sha-lo (Bindus\u0101ra), A-yuk (Asoka) killed all his brothers, leaving only a brother of the same mother. After four years he crowned himself and became king. It was 218 years since the Buddha's death that King Asoka took sole command of the land of Jambudipa (Yen-fu-li).\"\n\nThe P\u0101li: \"Te sabbe Asoko attan\u0101 saddhim ekam\u0101tikam Tissakum\u0101ram \u1e6dhapetv\u0101 gh\u0101tesi.

These incidents happened in the sixth year after Asoka ascended to the throne (i.e. 10 years after Bindus\u0101ra's death).\u00b9\n\nd. Ch. Bk. ii, fol. 9; P\u0101li, p. 312.\n\nPrior to the great Council at Po-ch'a-li-fu (P\u0101taliputta) Asoka summons several Bhikkhus and questions one after another:\n\nAsoka: \"What, sir, was the law of the Buddha\" (\u5927\u5fb7\u4f5b\u6cd5\u4e91\u4f55; Kimv\u0101di bhante samm\u0101sambuddho 'ti)?\n\nBhikkhu: \"The Buddha was one who held the doctrine of Distinction\" (\u4f5b\u5206\u5225\u8aaa\u4e5f; Vibhajjav\u0101di Mah\u0101r\u0101ja 'ti).\n\nAsoka, turning to Thera Tissa: \"Was the Buddha one who held the doctrine of Distinction\" (\u5927\u5fb7\u4f5b\u5206\u5225\u8aaa\u4e0d; Vibhajjav\u0101di bhante samm\u0101sambuddho 'ti)?\n\nTissa: \"Just so\" (\u5982\u662f; \u0100ma, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja 'ti).\n\n\u00b9 Compare Dipav., vi, 24; Oldenberg, Vinaya, i, p. L.\nAsoka, seeing that Religion had been purified, said to the Bhikkhus: \"Let us, sirs, hold the Uposatha to expound the morality [s\u012bla]\" (Suddham bhante d\u0101ni s\u0101sanam, Karotu bhikkhusamgho uposathan ti). Thereupon Moggaliputta Tissa becomes the president of the Assembly, which consists of 1000 chosen Bhikkus. He then refutes the opinions of all those adhering to heretical doctrines and wrong views. Here there is a difference between the Chinese and the P\u0101li. The words, \"Tasmim sam\u0101game Mogalliputta-Tissathero parappav\u0101dam maddam\u0101no Kath\u0101vatthuppakaranam abh\u0101si\"\u00b9\u2014\"In this assembly, Moggaliputta Tissa, refuting the opinions of the other parties, propounded the work Kath\u0101vatthu\"\u2014are not well traceable in the Chinese. At any rate, the name Kath\u0101vatthu is not mentioned there, though it is given in the list of the books in the Kuddakanik\u0101ya, as we have seen above.\u00b2\n\nIII. Ch. Bk. ii, fols. 12\u201317; P\u0101li, pp. 316\u2013319.\n\nThe Buddhist missionaries sent out after the Council of P\u0101\u1e6daliputta are as follows:\n\n1. Mo-shan-t'i (Majjhantika) to Chi-pin and Chi'en-t'o (Kasm\u012bragandh\u0101ra).\n2. Mo-ho-t'i-p'o (Mah\u0101deva) to Mo-hsi-sha-man-t'o-lo (Mahisa- or Mahi\u1e43saka-ma\u1e47\u1e0dala).\n3. Lo-ch'i-to (Rakkhita) to P'o-na-p'o-s\u016b (Vanav\u0101si).\n4. Tan-wu-t\u0113 (for Dhamma-gutta, but the P\u0101li has Dhammarakkhita) to A-po-lan-to (Aparantaka).\n\n\u00b9 Compare Mah\u0101v., p. 42; Dipav., vii, 40. The Kath\u0101vatthu is very likely Tissa's own compilation. See, however, Childers, s.v. Tipitakam (p. 507b), and Max M\u00fcller, Dhammapada, xxvi, xxvii.\n\u00b2 See above, p. 426.\n5. Mo-ho-tan-wu-te (for Mah\u0101-dhammagutta, but the P\u0101li has Mah\u0101dhamma-rakkhita) to Mo-ho-lo-ch'a (Mah\u0101rat\u1e6dha)\n\n6. Mo-ho-lo-ch'i-to (Mah\u0101-rakkhita) to Y\u00fc-na (Yona).\u00b9\n\n7. Mo-shih-mo (Majjhima), Chia-sh\u00ea (Kassapagotta), T'i-p'o (Deva), and Tun-ti-pi-shu (Dundubhissara) to the Border of the Snow Mountain (Himavanta).\n\n8. Shu-na-chia and Y\u00fc-to-lo (Sonaka and Uttara) to the Kingdom of the Gold Earth (Suva\u1e47\u1e47a-bh\u016bmi).\n\n9. Mo-sh\u00ean-t'o (Mahinda), I-ti-y\u00fc (Iddhiya or Itthiya), Y\u00fc-ti-y\u00fc (Uttiya), Po-t'o-sha (Bhaddas\u0101la), San-p'o-lou (Sambala), Hsiu-mo-na (Sumana), and P'an-t'ou-chia (Bha\u1e47\u1e0duka) to the Island of Lion (Sim-hala, Ceylon).\u00b2\n\nIV. The chronological table given in the Chinese Bk. ii, fol. 18b, does not exactly agree with that of the Samantap\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101 (p. 320), or of the Mah\u0101vamsa. The period, 236 years, between the Buddha's death (=the 8th year of Aj\u0101tasattu's reign) and Mahinda's mission to Ceylon (=the 18th year of Asoka's reign), is filled up by the following list of kings:\n\n\u00b9 \"Yonaka,\" the land of the Greeks, i.e. Baktria. The Chinese is \u53f2\u90a3 Y\u00fc-na, but a Korean text and the new Japanese edition have \u53f2\u90a3, Shih-na, and explain it as \u6f22\u5730\u4e5f i.e. China. A scholar said that China received Asoka's mission. His assertion probably rests on this misinterpretation of the Korean text.\n\n\u00b2 For all these geographical names see Rhys Davids, \"Buddhism,\" p. 227 note; Dipav., viii, 4\u201312; Mah\u0101v., xii (Turnour), pp. 73, 74.\n| Kings                                      | Reign |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------|\n| A-sh\u00ea-shi (Aj\u0101tasattu)                   | 24 years.\u00b9 |\n| Y\u00fc-t'o-yeh-po-t'o-lo (Udayabhadra or Ud\u0101yibhaddaka) | 16 years.\u00b2 |\n| A-t'u-lou-t'o (Anuruddha) Min-ch'u (Mun\u1e0da) | each\u00b3 8 years. |\n| Na-chia-tai-sha-chia (N\u0101ga-d\u0101saka or -dassaka) | 14 years.\u2074 |\n| Hsiu-hsiu-na-chia (Susun\u0101ga)             | 18 years. |\n| A-y\u00fc (or A-yuk, i.e. Chia-lo-y\u00fc; K\u0101l\u0101soka) | 28 years. |\n| 10 sons of the last . . . together        | 22 years. |\n| Mei-nan-t'o (for Chiu-nan-t'o)           | 22 years. |\n| Chan-t'o-ch\u00fceh-to (Candagutta)           | 24 years.\u2076 |\n| Pin-t'ou-sha-lo (Bindus\u0101ra)              | 28 years. |\n| [The interregnum between the death of the last and the enthronement of Asoka] | 4 years. |\n| A-y\u00fc (or A-yuk; Asoka)                   | 18 years. |\n| (when Malinda was sent out).             |       |\n\n234 years.\n\nWe have thus an anachronism of only two years in the list (compare Turnour, Mah\u0101v., p. xlvii, \u201c6 years\u201d). But this gap would be filled up if we read \u201c18 years\u201d for the reign of Anuruddha and Mun\u1e0da instead of \u201ceach 8 years.\u201d\n\n\u00b9 He reigned 32 years; the Buddha died in his eighth year.\n\u00b2 Aj\u0101tasattu and Ud\u0101yibhaddaka are omitted in Bk. ii, fol. 18b, perhaps by the copyist\u2019s mistake, but we can see from fol. 18a that Ud\u0101yibhaddaka reigned more than 15 years, and I put here 16 years from the P\u0101li. [The copyist seems to have jumped from A of Aj\u0101tasattu to A of Anuruddha while copying.]\n\u00b3 Not \u201ccollectively\u201d as in Turnour\u2019s Mah\u0101vamsa, p. xlvii. Samantap\u0101\u015b. (p. 320) has 18 years (Anuruddho ca mun\u1e0do ca \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101rasa).\n\u2074 Samantap\u0101\u015b., 24 years.\n\u2075 Mei (\u73ab) seems to be a misprint. There is no corresponding sound in the P\u0101li. It is, I think, a mistake for Chiu (\u4e5d), which is sometimes used for another \u201cChiu\u201d (\u4e5d) meaning \u201cnine,\u201d and the \u201cnine nanto\u201d for the P\u0101li \u201cnava nand\u0101.\u201d In one of my slips from the new Jap. edition of the Chinese Pitaka I note, \u201c\u73ab mei for \u4e5d chiu?\u201d; but I do not remember whether it is my conjecture or that of the Japanese Editors. Anyhow, it is pretty certain that it must be \u201cChiu\u201d nine.\n\u2076 Not 34 as in the Mah\u0101vamsa, which is an error.\nI do not know whether the difference in figures between the P\u0101li and the Chinese texts is to be attributed to various readings in the original, or simply to a mistake on the part of the Chinese translator or copyists.\n\nV. From the commentary itself, I shall notice only a point or two. In explaining \"Ariyakam\" in the P\u0101r\u0101jik\u0101, Buddhaghosa says:\n\na. \"Ariyakam n\u0101ma Ariyavoh\u0101ro Magadhabh\u0101s\u0101. Milakkhakam n\u0101ma yo koci Anariyako Andhadamil\u0101di,\" etc. The Chinese: \u5584\u8a9e\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u8b02\u70ba\u5584\u8a9e\uff1b\u6240\u4ee5\u5584\u4eba\u6240\u884c\uff0c\u662f\u6469\u7aed\u570b\u8a9e\u3002\u82e5\u908a\u5730\uff0c\u5b89\u9640\u7f85\u5f4c\u570b\u8a9e\uff0cetc. \"Now, as to the 'good language.' What is called the 'good language'? What is in use among the 'good' men. This is the language of the kingdom of Mo-chieh (Magadha). In case of the border lands, (there are) the language of the kingdom of An-t'o-lo-mi (Andhadamil\u0101),\" etc. (Ch. Bk. vii, fol. 13b.)\n\nNext, under the Sa\u1e45gh\u0101dises\u0101, Buddhaghosa says as to '\u0100di' and 'Sesa':\n\nb. \"Imam \u0101pattim \u0101pajjitv\u0101 vut\u1e6dh\u0101tuk\u0101massa yantam \u0101pattivu\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101nam. Tassa \u0101dimhi c'eva pariv\u0101sad\u0101natth\u0101ya \u0101dito sese majjhe m\u0101nattad\u0101natth\u0101ya... avas\u0101ne abbh\u0101natth\u0101ya ca sa\u1e45gho icchitabbo\" (Sam.-p\u0101s., fol. ne). The Chinese: \u6b64\u6bd4\u4e18\u5df2\u5f97\u7f6a\uff0c\u6b32\u6b32\u6e05\u6de8\u3002\u5f80\u5230\u50e7\u6240\u3002\u50e7\u8207\u6ce2\u5229\u5a46\u6c99\uff0c\u662f\u540d\u521d\u3002\u8207\u6ce2\u5229\u5a46\u6c99\u7adf\uff0c\u6b21\u8207....\u6469\u90a3\u57f5\uff0c\u70ba\u4e2d\u3002\u6b98\u8005\u8207\u963f\u6d6e\u8a36\u90a3\uff0e\n\n\"The Bhikkhu, having become guilty, wishes to be purified, and goes to the place of the Sa\u1e45gha. The Sa\u1e45gha confers on him the Po-li-p'o-sha (pariv\u0101sa)\u2014this is called the first. After having conferred the Pariv\u0101sa (the Sa\u1e45gha) next confers the Mo-na-to (M\u0101natta), which is the middle. Last of all, the A-fu-ho-na (Abbh\u0101na) is conferred on him.\" (Ch. Bk. xii, fol. 18b.)\nAlthough the Chinese translation is not always literal, yet it is not so free that we cannot recognize the original in the P\u0101li text. Several points seem to have been omitted, when probably the translator's knowledge of Chinese failed to interpret them, while many words seem to have been added to make the sense of the original clearer. For instance, as to some medical herbs, Samghabhadra adds whether they are found or not in Tong-king and Canton, and in some cases gives Cantonese names besides the Indian (see e.g. Bk. xv, fol. 19b).\n\nIt is probable that the translator dictated the meaning of Buddhaghosa's commentary from a MS., while the Chinese assistants wrote it down, and fashioned it into a Chinese composition. There are some passages so free and incorrect, that we can hardly attribute the version to anyone understanding the P\u0101li language.\n\nVI. I shall notice one more point about the verses quoted by Buddhaghosa from the \"Ancient Historical Records\" in the Sinhalese At\u1e6dhakath\u0101. The verses in the Samantap\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101 seem to consist of the three elements: (1) The verses composed by himself or by an unknown author. (2) Those taken from the ancient At\u1e6dhakath\u0101, which are indicated by the words: \"Ten\u0101hu por\u0101na\" (\"Therefore have the ancients said\"). (3) Those from the Dipavamsa, which are often preceded by the words: \"vuttam pi etam Dipavams\u0113\" (\"It is said in the Dipavamsa as follows\"). The first is called in Chinese simply \"Chi\" (\u5048) which had been meant originally for Skt. g\u0101th\u0101, hymn, verse, but later became a general name for any religious verse, whether a \u015bloka or any other metre. The second is called \"Wang-hsi-chi\" (\u5f80\u6614\u5048), \"Verses from Past Ages\" or \"Ancient Verses.\" The third, which is taken from the Dipavamsa, is called \"Wang-hsi-chi-tsan\" (\u5f80\u6614\u5048\u8b9a), \"Praise-Songs from Past Ages\" or \"Ancient Praise-Songs.\" Samghabhadra must have understood that the Dipavamsa was nothing but a version of the ancient Sinhalese Records, made specially\nfor chanting or recitation.\u00b9 The name \"Dipavamsa\" is not traceable in Chinese, but it is possible that the original had \"Dipavamsa,\" and Samghabhadra translated it by the \"Ancient praise-songs,\" in order to show what relation it had to the ancient historical record which he called simply the \"ancient verses.\"\u00b2\n\nIn the introductory part of the Chinese text of the Samanta-p\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101 there are more than seventeen verses from the Dipavamsa (also found in the later work Mah\u0101vamsa), though some of them widely differ from those found in the existing texts of the two books.\n\nThe above will, I think, suffice for our present purpose, and will, I hope, leave no doubt as to the existence, at any rate, of the book in question. There is only one other possibility, and it is this. The Chinese translation may be from the original of Buddhaghosa, i.e. the Sinhalese \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101, seeing that the date of the translation is as early as 489 A.D. But it would take us too far to discuss this point now.\n\nWe have then before us a translation of the Samanta-p\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101 (and under the same title) into the language of China, where the name or fame of Buddhaghosa had never reached.\u00b3 A MS. of his work, however, must have reached\n\n\u00b9 Compare Mah\u0101v., p. 257: \"And that he might promulgate the contents of the Dipavamsa, distributing a thousand pieces, he caused it to be read aloud thoroughly.\" The fact that the Dipav. is called here the \"Ancient praise-songs\" may in a way help Prof. Oldenberg's opinion that the work \"Por\u0101nehi kato\" mentioned in the Mah\u0101v., i. p. i, may refer to the Dipav. (Oldenberg, Dipav., p. 9).\n\n\u00b2 There are similar cases: whenever the P\u0101li text has \"Tambapanni,\" or \"Lanka,\" he translates it by the \"Island of Lion\" = Sihala, the object being to make it clear to the Chinese readers.\n\n\u00b3 But it is possible that some Buddhist book may refer to him under another name. No Chinese travellers known to us mention his name. In Fa-hien's time (A.D. 399-414) Buddhaghosa must have been very young and still in India. As the Hinay\u0101na faith was looked upon as heretical by Hiuen Tsiang (A.D. 629-645), Buddhaghosa's fame seems to have escaped his notice. I-tsing (A.D. 671-695), though a follower of the Hinay\u0101na, says nothing of that great Buddhist writer.\nthere soon after its compilation, probably brought by the translator himself, who may have been a direct disciple, or, at all events, a young contemporary, of Buddhaghosa.\n\nBuddhaghosa, a young Brahman of Magadha, who was born \"Bodhimand\u0101sama\u1e47ipa\u00f1hi,\" is said to have been converted by Revata, a Buddhist priest. The latter further instigated the young convert to go to Ceylon, pointing out that the Sinhalese \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101 were genuine, being composed by Mahinda, and a translation of them into the language of Magadha would be a work conducive to the welfare of the whole world.\u00b9 Buddhaghosa then came to Ceylon in the reign of Mah\u0101n\u0101ma (A.D. 410\u2013432)\u00b2\u2014strictly speaking, at the end of his reign, about 430 A.D.\u00b3\u2014and succeeded in carrying out his literary undertaking, during his stay there in the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra of Anur\u0101dhapura. The Samanta-p\u0101\u015b\u0101dik\u0101 must have been compiled at this time. He is said to have sailed to Burma about 450 A.D., taking with him all the works of his compilation.\u2074\n\nWe cannot trace him further than this, but his fame, and perhaps his works also, seem to have reached Siam, Kamboja, and even Camp\u0101 (Cochin China, now French). According to Dr. Bastian, Camp\u0101 was once a Buddhist country,\u2075 its Buddhism having been derived from Ceylon, and being generally connected with the name of Buddhaghosa. Had his \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101 made their way to Camp\u0101 it would not have been very difficult for them to have reached Canton, the place of this translation, in South China. But this does not seem to have been the case. We have no reliable record as to the fact that Kamboja or Camp\u0101 were Buddhist countries in the fifth century.\n\n\u00b9 Turnour, Mah\u0101v., p. 251.\n\u00b2 l.c., p. 252. Compare Kern, \"Buddhismus,\" p. 477; Max M\u00fcller, \"Dhammapada\" (S.B.E.), p. xii; Lassen, Ind. Alt. iv, p. 285.\n\u00b3 Rhys Davids, \"Buddhism,\" p. 236; \"Buddhist Birth Stories,\" p. lxiv.\n\u2074 Rhys Davids, \"Buddhism,\" p. 236; Lassen and Burnouf, \"Essai sur le P\u0101li,\" also quoted by Turnour, Mah\u0101v., p. xxx. Compare also Bishop Bigandet, \"Life of Gaudama\" (1866), p. 392.\n\u2075 This is confirmed by I-tsing (A.D. 671-695), who says that Camp\u0101 mostly belonged to the Sammitiya school, while there were a few adherents of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da school.\nSiam is said to have received Buddhism first in 638 A.D., though there are some traces of the existence of Buddhism at an earlier time. In any case it is reasonable to suppose that the conversion to Buddhism of the whole area from the western coast of Burma to the north limit of Cochin China, and with it the migration of the Sacred Books, would have taken a longer time than thirty-eight years (489-450=38).\n\nThe only other possibility as to how this MS. got to China at so early a date is by way of the sea. Either a Sinhalese or a Burmese who might have known Buddhaghosa, personally or by name, may have secured a copy of the Atthakatha and sailed to China, possibly stirred up by the missionary spirit which might have prevailed during or after the time of the great commentator. Suppose that man were a direct disciple or an admirer of Buddhaghosa; he would have simply followed the brilliant example of his teacher, who made for the eastern peninsula with his Buddhist works, as we have seen above. The voyage over the Indian Ocean would have been no difficulty before 489 A.D., for, as we know, Fa-hien returned home in 414 by a merchant ship which sailed between Ceylon and China by way of Java.\n\nThe man who brought the book is no other than the translator himself, i.e. Samghabhadra. Unfortunately we have no means of ascertaining his nationality. He is said to have been a samana of the Western Region, a name often used for \"India,\" of course including Ceylon. The use of the name Hsi-y\u00fc (Western Region) is very vague, and there is no reason why Burma should be excluded from it. So we have no guide at all in it. Still, it is more probable that he was a Sinhalese. The voyage from Burma to China must have been more difficult than that from\n\n---\n\n1 Rhys Davids \"Buddhism,\" p. 238, quoted from Crawfurd, \"Journal of the Embassy to Siam,\" p. 615.\n2 Three priests from Siam came to China between A.D. 503-589. See above note 1, p. 419. I-tsing says there was no Buddhism in his time, but there was before a wicked king of that country persecuted the Buddhist priests.\n3 But Buddhism may have been established in Asoka's time in Burma (two missionaries went to Suvanna-bhumi).\n4 See Nanjio, Catalogue, App. ii, 96.\nCeylon to China in his time. For the latter we have the witness of Fa-hien; but for a communication by the sea between Burma and China we have no record in so early a time, and the discovery of the Malacca Strait seems to be very late. But we have no positive proof that he came from Ceylon,\u00b9 and at present we must rest satisfied with the result that he must have come from some country where the orthodox Buddhism prevailed. He seems to have been a H\u012bnay\u0101nist, for his translation, which is closely connected with the tradition about him given below, is recorded as a H\u012bnay\u0101na work. He came to Canton and never proceeded to the North, and he brought with him the same tradition as the Sinhalese or Burmese about the date of the Buddha\u2019s death. These points can be seen from the following interesting tradition about his life in China:\n\n\u201cIn 534 A.D. (\u4e2d\u5927\u901a\u516d\u5e74) an ascetic, Chau P\u2019o-hsiu (\u96b1\u58eb\u8d99\u4f2f\u4f11), visited the temple on the mount Lu (\u8606\u5c71), met a sam\u0101\u1e47a called Kung-tu (\u5f18\u5ea6) there and obtained from him a historical record named\n\n\u2018A Dotted Record of many Sages\u2019 (\u8846\u8056\u9ede\u8a18).\n\nA tradition about the Record\u2014\n\nAfter the Buddha\u2019s death, the venerable Up\u0101li collected the Vinaya-pitaka. On the 15th day (Pu\u1e47\u1e47amadivase) of the 7th moon (Assayuja) he held the Pav\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101 ceremony, as it was the closing day of the Vassa (the Rain-Retreat). Up\u0101li then marked the Vinaya-pi\u1e6daka\u00b2 with a dot, and did the same every\n\n\u00b9 The following fact may perhaps help us. When the P\u0101li has various readings, as noted in Oldenberg\u2019s Samantap\u0101s., the Chinese has the same readings as the Burmese MS. (E.). Whether this tendency is found throughout the commentary, I am not at present able to state. If this be proved to be the case, we can see at least that the Burmese MS. keeps the readings of 489 A.D., not long after Buddhaghosa.\n\n\u00b2 It seems from this as if the Vinaya existed in book. But we need not understand it literally. Compare Turnour, Mah\u0101v., p. 207: the Vinaya was not in writing till the time of King Vat\u1e6da G\u0101mani, i.e. 88\u201376 B.C. But some seem to believe that it was written down in book in the first council.\u2014Bigandet, \u201cLife of Gaudama,\u201d p. 360. Has the custom of marking the sacred years ever existed in Ceylon or in Burma?\nfollowing summer. After Up\u0101li's death this method was carefully kept up, handing it down from teacher to pupil, until at last it came to the hand of Samghabhadra, the translator of the Vinaya Vibh\u0101\u1e63a, who brought that Vinaya-pi\u1e6daka to Canton. He held the Vassa in Canton (\u5ee3 \u5dde) A.D. 489 (\u9f4a \u6c38 \u660e \u4e03 \u5e74), and when he finished the Pav\u0101ra\u1e47a ceremony he added a dot to the Vinaya-pi\u1e6daka. At that time the number of dots was in all 975 (the Buddha's death therefore falls, according to this Record, in the year 486 B.C.).\u00b9 The ascetic Chau asked the saman\u0101 Kung-tu why the Record was not kept up after 489 A.D., the time of Samghabhadra. Kung-tu answered: 'In former ages there were many Ariya-puggalas who themselves marked the Record with dots. We are only common men, whose duty it is to keep and guard this Record, not to mark it.' The ascetic Chau continued the marking till A.D. 535 (\u5927 \u540c \u4e4b \u521d), when there were 1020 dots.'\u00b2\n\nSamghabhadra's date of the Buddha, B.C. 486, was not quite unknown to the Buddhist writers in China, but was never considered as authoritative. Perhaps it did not seem \"ancient\" enough to the Chinese Buddhists, who would have claimed a greater antiquity for the founder of their religion than that of Confucius. Prof. Max M\u00fcller told me that he noticed some years ago the \"Dotted Record\" in the Academy, as he was informed of it by his pupil Kasawara. I failed to find the Number of the Academy, but I do not think that there is any difference between Kasawara's information and mine, except in wording, for the source from which we derived it is in all probability one and the same. Now that we have identified Samghabhadra's translation with the Samanta-p\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101, the above tradition about him turns out to be more important than curious, and I did not think it superfluous to give it here.\n\n\u00b9 The Sinhalese date of the Buddha's death, 543 B.C., wants a curtailment of at least about 60 years, as pointed out by Turnour, which would bring us to 483 B.C., not to speak about a further curtailment made by Max M\u00fcller, Rhys Davids, and others. The anachronism seems to have been introduced after Samghabhadra's time.\n\u00b2 486 B.C. + 535 A.D. = 1021; perhaps the year 535 was not marked.\nIn conclusion, I may add, that I am still comparing the Chinese with the P\u0101li and translating it, when I can spare time. I have already collected some 800 names and words, whose Sanskrit equivalents are not to be found in Eitel\u2019s Sanskrit-Chinese Dictionary, or in Julien\u2019s \u201cM\u00e9thode pour d\u00e9chiffrer et transcrire les noms Sanskrits qui se rencontrent dans les Livres Chinois,\u201d but whose P\u0101li equivalents are found in Childers\u2019 P\u0101li Dictionary, or in the Mah\u0101vamsa. I strongly hope that this book will serve as a key to lead us to a further discovery of P\u0101li works, which might have found their way into the Chinese Tripi\u1e6daka. Mr. Palladji may have known our work, for his \u201cHistorische Skizzen des Buddhismus\u201d give an account which, on the whole, agrees with that of our book, though there are many points whose sources are not ascertainable.\u00b9 There must be some more P\u0101li works in China if we only look for them. This line of research is, I think, very important for the study of the Chinese Pi\u1e6daka, which is nothing but a mixture of all sorts of books coming from various sources. It may contain books compiled in the council of Asoka as well as those in the so-called council of Kanishka. There must be in it some elements from Sanskrit, P\u0101li, Tibetan, or Pr\u0101krit, as Dr. Edkins thinks, and further, it is possible that there is a trace of Mongolian or some dialects of Further India. It may seem to be impossible at first to recognize the elements from all those languages under the dress of Chinese, but when we have the texts in both languages before us, our work is comparatively simple and easy.\u00b2 When, for instance,\n\n\u00b9 Above note 3, p. 418. First I thought that Palladji might have drawn his materials from P\u0101li sources. There was in his time Turnour\u2019s \u201cEpitome of the P\u0101li Annals\u201d (1837). But the name which Palladji gives, e.g. Ribeta for Revata (p. 212), K\u0101madeva for Dev\u0101nampiya (p. 220, Ch. T\u2019ien-ai, \u201cHeaven-love\u201d; he translated this into Skt. K\u0101madeva), made me think that his account was from Chinese sources.\n\n\u00b2 A comparative study of the Sanskrit and Chinese texts is also very important. Without this even the interpretation of a Chinese text becomes impossible or unsuccessful. We often run the risk of thoroughly misunderstanding the Chinese translators. Compare, for instance, Beal\u2019s Fo-sho-hing-tsan-king (S.B.E., vol. xix), \u00a7\u00a7 564\u2013568 (=Ch. Bk. ii, fol. 11a), and my rendering in Heinrich L\u00fcders\u2019s paper, \u201cZu \u0100\u015bvagho\u1e63a\u2019s Buddha-carita,\u201d p. 2, note 2, and Tokiwa\u2019s in Leumann\u2019s note, p. 8 (G\u00f6ttingen, Phil.-histor. Klasse i, 1896).\nthe whole of the P\u0101li Pitaka is published, we can easily compare the contents of both.\\(^1\\) Then we shall see, at least, whether they agree or not. To do such work we must begin with the Vinaya works, Tibetan, Chinese, and P\u0101li, which in substance agree with one another.\\(^2\\) Prof. Oldenberg encourages the students of Chinese Buddhism to make a careful examination of the important literary documents of the Vinaya.\\(^3\\) I wish with him that Chinese scholars who are interested in the study of Buddhism, will pay attention to those texts preserved in the L\u00fc-ts'ang, which is as yet almost an unbeaten track of Chinese literature.\n\n\\(^1\\) The whole Vinaya edited by Oldenberg; many texts from the other Pitakas in the P\u0101li Text Society's publication.

(No. 548 of Ceylon List.)\n[From the Burmese.] By R. F. St. Andrew St. John, M.R.A.S.\n\nOne day, when the disciples were discussing the various forms of wisdom peculiar to the Buddha, the Lord came into the hall and inquired what they were discussing. On being informed, he said: \"Rahans, there will be no difficulty in understanding how I can now so easily overcome the opinions of Brahmans, princes, and others, bringing them to a right frame of mind, when you hear how, in a former existence as the high-born Vidh\u016bra, on the summit of Mount K\u0101l\u0101giri, I overcame and subdued the virulence of the Rakshasa Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka.\" He then related as follows:\n\nLong ago, in Kururajjam, in the city of Indapattanagaram, there reigned a king whose name was Dhana\u00f1caya Korabya, whose prime minister, Vidh\u016bra, expounded the law so well and sweetly that everyone was attracted to him, and all the rulers of Jambudvipa came to get his decisions. Now in the city of B\u0101r\u0101nasi there were four rich Brahmans who were friends, and they, having determined to renounce the lusts of this world, went into Himavanta. Having dwelt there some time as hermits, they came into the inhabited country in search of salt and pickles, and at last arrived at Camp\u0101nagaram, in the country of \u0100\u1e45ga, and dwelt in the king's garden. The rich people of the city, seeing that their deportment was correct, undertook their maintenance, and begged them to remain. One of these hermits, in a state of ecstatic meditation, used to go daily to the country of the N\u0101gas, another to T\u0101vatimsa, another to the country of the Ga\u1e47unas, and the fourth to the park called Mig\u0101jina, which belonged to King Dhana\u00f1caya Korabya, at Indapattanagaram. On\nreturning, each praised the delights of these places to his particular supporters, so that each desired, when the time of change came, to go to these places.\n\nWhen they at length died, by reason of the good works they had performed, one became Sakko, another became king of the N\u0101gas, another became king of the Ga\u1e47unas in a forest of silk-cotton trees, and the fourth took birth with the chief queen of King Dhana\u00f1caya Korabya. At his father's death Prince Korabya succeeded to the throne.\n\nKing Korabya was passionately fond of dice, but abiding by the instructions of his minister Vidh\u016bra, observed his fasts and religious duties. One-fast day, in order to be quiet, he went into his garden. Sakko, the N\u0101ga king, and the Ga\u1e47una king, also came to that garden to spend the fast-day in quiet meditation; and, in the cool of the evening, all four met at the auspicious water-tank and recognized each other. Sakko sat on the auspicious stone slab, and the others seated themselves in suitable places.\n\nSakko then asked: \"Which of us four kings, do you think, has performed the most excellent duty?\"\n\nVaruna, the N\u0101ga king, answered: \"I think mine is the best. The Ga\u1e47unas generally take our lives, and yet, when I saw their king, I displayed no anger.\"\n\nThe King of the Ga\u1e47unas said: \"This N\u0101ga king is the food in which we most delight, and yet, though oppressed by hunger, I did him no harm.\"\n\nSakko said: \"I have left the wonderful pleasures and delights of T\u0101vatimsa and come down to this earth to keep my fast.\"\n\nThen said King Korabya: \"I have left the delights of my palace and sixty thousand concubines and come to fast in this garden.\"\n\nThus the four kings extolled their own piety.\n\nThen said the three kings: \"O King Korabya, have you no wise man in your dominions who can dispel our doubts in this matter?\" King Dhana\u00f1caya Korabya answered: \"I have a wise minister named Vidh\u016bra, and he will probably be able to do so.\"\nSo they all agreed to go to the Judgment Hall, and, having caused Vidh\u016bra to take his seat on a splendid couch, stated their case to him.\n\nVidh\u016bra (after questioning them) replied: \"O kings, your words are all good, and there is no fault in them. Wise men say that, like an axle well fitted to the hub of a wheel, those persons who are longsuffering, who do no ill to obtain food, who avoid lust, and have no anxiety, are they who in this world have extinguished evil\" (Sama\u00f1\u00f1\u0101).\n\nOn hearing this, the four kings gave great praise to Vidh\u016bra, and said: \"Indeed, thou art a religious person. There is no one equal to thee. Thou canst decide clearly, as the worker in ivory cuts through an elephant's tusk with a saw.\"\n\nSakko presented him with a valuable cloth. The King of the Ga\u1e47unas gave him a golden flower garland. The King of the N\u0101gas presented him with a priceless ruby; and King Korabya gave him one thousand milch cows, ten bulls, ten elephants, ten horses, ten chariots with Sindh horses, and the revenue of sixteen villages.\n\nNow the King of the N\u0101gas had a queen, whose name was Vimal\u0101, and, when he returned, she noticed that the ruby he usually wore round his neck was gone, so she said: \"My Lord, where have you left your ruby?\" He answered: \"Lady, I wished to do honour to Vidh\u016bra, the son of Canda, the Brahman, who decided a case for me, and gave it to him. Sakko gave him a cloth. The Ga\u1e47una king gave him a gold garland, and King Korabya also gave gifts.\"\n\nQueen Vimal\u0101 asked whether he was one who preached the law; and on being told that there was no one equal to him, she thought thus: \"If I were to say\u2014'My Lord, I want to hear him preach the law: bring him here,' the King would not bring him. I will say that I want this wise man's heart, and, by worrying the King, get what I want.\" So she went into her inner chamber, and, giving notice to her attendants, went to sleep. On that day the N\u0101ga king, at the time when the Queen and concubines usually came to pay their respects to him, missing Vimal\u0101, asked where she\nwas. They told him she could not come, because she was ill. Hearing this, he got up from his seat, and, going to her couch and stroking her with his hand, said: \"Lady, you are like a withered leaf, and your body emaciated. What ails you?\"\n\nQueen Vimal\u0101 answered: \"O Lord of the N\u0101gas, in the land of men if women do not get what they want they suffer great pain. I have a strong desire to obtain the heart of this wise Vidh\u016bra, lawfully and not by force. When I have obtained his heart I shall be well. If I do not, I shall shortly die.\"\n\nThe King answered: \"Lady, if you wanted the sun, or the moon, there would be no difficulty. Even the kings of the island of Jambudv\u012bpa find a difficulty in getting to see him. How, then, can he be brought here?\"\n\nHearing this, the Queen turned her back on the King, saying: \"If I cannot get the heart of Vidh\u016bra, may I die on this very bed.\"\n\nWhen the King found she would not answer him he went into his chamber and threw himself on his couch, saying: \"Who can bring Vidh\u016bra's heart? Verily the Queen will die if she cannot get it.\"\n\nJust then the Princess Irandhati came, magnificently dressed, to pay her respects to her father, and, seeing him so unhappy, said: \"My father, you seem very unhappy: why is it?\"\n\nHer father replied: \"My daughter, your mother wants the heart of the wise Vidh\u016bra; but who can bring him to N\u0101ga-land? Dear daughter, you are the only person who can do it. If you wish to save your mother's life, search for a husband who can bring him.\" The King was so wrapped up in his desire to preserve his Queen's life, that he spoke thus shamefully to her, telling her to get a husband.\n\nIrandhati, having pacified her father, went in to see her mother, and, after comforting her, dressed herself in all her\n\n1 Irandhati: is this a form of Arundhati, one of the stars, and said to be the wife of the seven Rishis?\nornaments and, that very night, took her way through the water to the upper world, and went to a place in the Himavanta near a river where there is a mountain called K\u0101la. That mountain is sixty y\u016bjan\u0101s in height, and entirely composed of black rocks. Having gone thither, she collected a number of beautiful flowers, and strewed them all over the mountain, and made it look as if it were a heap of rubies; she spread a bed of flowers on the summit, and began to dance and sing, saying\u2014\n\nN\u0101gas, Devas, and Gandhabbas,\nKinnaras, and all who dwell\nIn this Himavanta forest,\nStay, and list to what I tell:\nLives Vidh\u016bra, wise and gracious,\nIn the courts of Kuru\u2019s Lord;\nWho Vidh\u016bra\u2019s heart will bring me\nShall receive me as reward.\n\nJust then Pun\u1e47aka, the nephew of the Deva Vessava\u1e47 (Kuvera), riding on his horse Manomaya, was on his way to the assembly of the Rakshasas, and heard her song. As she had once been his wife in a former existence, as soon as he heard her he was smitten with delight, and, stopping his horse, said: \u201cLady, by the power of my wisdom, I will bring you Vidh\u016bra\u2019s heart. Be not afraid. You shall be my wife.\u201d\n\nOn hearing this, Irandhat\u012b replied: \u201cGo at once and demand me of my father.\u201d\n\nOvercome with love, Pun\u1e47aka dismounted and stretched out his hand to put Irandhat\u012b on his horse, but she drew back, saying:\n\nIrandhat\u012b.\n\nBack, Pun\u1e47aka, nor take me by the hand;\nI am no orphan to be brought to shame:\n\n1 The g\u0101ta of Irandhat\u012b\u2019s song have been left out, except the first line, and only the Bur. translation given.\nVaru\u1e47a, lord of serpents, is my sire,\nAnd Vimal\u0101, my mother, his chief queen.\nIf, then, to wed me be thy firm desire,\nDemand me from them in accustomed form.\n\nHearing this, Punnaka at once proceeded to the Serpent King's palace, and addressed him thus:\n\nPunnaka.\n\nLord of the N\u0101gas, list unto my suit,\nAnd give Irandhati to me for wife.\nAges have passed since first our lots were linked:\nI love her still, and she to me inclines.\nTake as her price one hundred elephants,\nOne hundred steeds, and e'en one hundred carts\nPiled with the seven gems, to which are yoked\nOne hundred mules: an offering far too small.\nBut who could name a price for one so fair?\n\nVaru\u1e47a.\n\nO Raksha Prince, Vessava\u1e47\u2019s nephew true,\nFitted in every way to be my son-in-law\nArt thou; but not in haste may this be done:\nA hurried marriage ofttimes causes woe.\nFirst with my queen and kith I must consult.\nIrandhati is but a child, and 'tis\nThe nature of all womenfolk to pine\nWhen parted from their home. Perchance she, too,\nMay grieve when taken hence. Wait here awhile.\n\n(He enters the palace and addresses Queen Vimal\u0101.)\n\nQueen of my queens, my well-loved Vimal\u0101,\nThere waits without, in haste to wed our child\nIrandhati, the darling of our heart,\nVessava\u1e47\u2019s nephew, chief of all his hosts.\nHis gifts and words are fair. What thinkest thou?\nVimal\u0101.\n\nLord of this widespread realm, we need no gifts:\nIrandhat\u012b, whose beauty glads all hearts\nCannot be bought with gems: 'tis he alone\nWho brings Vidh\u016bra's heart shall wed the maid.\n\nVaru\u1e47a (coming out).\n\nLeader of hosts, if our consent you'd win,\nBring us the \"wise man's\" heart, thy lawful spoil.\n\nPu\u1e47\u1e47aka.\n\nSome are called wise and others are called fools;\nBut on this point all men are not agreed.\nHow shall I know the wise man from the fool?\n\nVaru\u1e47a.\n\nWhat! hast not heard of R\u0101ja Korabya,\nWho reigns at Indapattan? and of him\nWho guides with perfect wisdom his affairs,\nAll-wise Vidh\u016bra? 'Tis his heart we want.\n\nPu\u1e47\u1e47aka ordered his attendant to get ready his horse Manomaya, and, urged by his great love for Irandhat\u012b, having smoothed out his beard and hair and arranged his clothes, mounted and set off on his way to the dwelling of his uncle Kuvera (Vessavan).\n\nOn arriving there he recited some stanzas descriptive of the beauty and wealth of Kuvera's city. He recited these verses because he did not dare to carry off Vidh\u016bra without his uncle's permission. Kuvera, however, was deciding a dispute between two devas, and did not attend to him, so Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka sat down near the deva who had won his case. Kuvera, turning to the deva, gave him an order to go and take possession, so Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka took the order as if it were given to himself, and went off with him. On the way he thought thus: \"Vidh\u016bra's attendants are very\nnumerous; I shall not be able to take him unawares. King Korabya is passionately fond of dice. I will win him from Korabya by a cast of the dice. King Korabya is very wealthy, and will not play with me for anything of small value. In the hill of Vepulla, near R\u0101jagriha, there is a ruby fit to be worn by Cakkavatti monarchs; it is a ruby of great power. I will overcome him by means of that ruby.\u201d He accordingly went to R\u0101jagriha, in the country of A\u1e45ga.\n\n(The translator here remarks: \u201cWhy is it said that R\u0101jagriha is in A\u1e45ga, when it is in Magadha?\u201d\u2014It is because at that time the King of A\u1e45ga ruled over Magadha.)\n\nAscending to the top of Mount Vepulla, he came to the place where that wonderful ruby which is called Manohara (Captivating) is guarded by 100,000 Kumbhandas. Terrifying them by his terrible glances, he took the ruby and pursued his way to Indapattanagaram. On arriving there, he got off his horse and left it in concealment near the city. Taking the form of a young man, he approached King Korabya and addressed him thus:\n\nPu\u1e47\u1e47aka.\n\n\u201cIn this assembly of chiefs, who will play with me for an excellent stake? From which of you shall I be able to win something of value? Who of you wants to win my incomparable treasure?\u201d\n\nKorabya.\n\n\u201cYouth, what is your country? Your speech is not that of Kurur\u0101j, and your appearance is more comely than that of the people of my country. Tell me your race and name.\u201d\n\nPu\u1e47\u1e47aka.\n\n\u201cKing, I bear the noble title of Kacc\u0101yano. As for my parents and race, they dwell in the city of K\u0101lacampanagaram in A\u1e45ga; and I have come to this country to cast dice.\u201d\nKorabya.\n\n\"Since you have come here to gamble, what have you brought with you? If you have nothing, will not the princes who overcome you make you their slave? How, then, do you propose to play against princes?\"\n\nPunnaka.\n\n\"My lord king, my stake is a ruby.\\(^1\\) It is of immense value\u2014more valuable than any other. It brings whatever you desire, and is called Manohara. That is not my only property: I possess a steed that can drive away all my enemies. I will play for both of them. Let the winner take them.\"\n\nKorabya.\n\n\"Youth, what can you do with your one ruby and horse? We kings have many such rubies, and swift steeds innumerable.\"\n\n(Here ends the canto called \"Doh\u0101la.\")\\(^2\\)\n\nPunnaka.\n\n\"My lord king, why do you speak thus? My horse is worth a thousand, and my ruby is worth a thousand. Though your Majesty may have horses, they are not like mine. Just look at the qualities of my horse.\" Saying thus, he mounted Manomaya and rode round the city wall so fast that the city appeared to be surrounded by\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The ruby was not a red one, but a Veluriyam.\n\\(^2\\) Doh\u0101la, \"longing for\"; more especially applied to that of women in a certain condition.\na band of horses, which could not be distinguished, and even Punnaka himself was not distinguishable, but the red girdle on his waist was like the whirling of a firebrand. Having thus displayed the good qualities of his horse, he dismounted and said: \"O King, have you beheld the power of my horse?\" And, on the King replying that he had seen it, he said, \"Look again,\" and rode his horse across the surface of the lake which was in the royal park, backwards and forwards, so that not even its hoofs were wetted. Having caused it to stand on a lily-leaf, he spread out his hand and it stood upon the palm. When the King remarked, \"This is, indeed, very wonderful,\" he replied: \"Now behold the power of my ruby. You have only to look into it to see everything that is in this city or on the face of the earth, and all the delights of Devaland.\"\n\n(Here ends the canto called \"The Ruby.\")\n\n* * * * *\n\nPunnaka.\n\n\"Surely, O King, if I gamble with you and lose, take my ruby. But what will you stake?\"\n\nKorabya.\n\n\"Kacc\u0101ya\u1e47o, I will stake anything but myself, my queen, or my throne.\"\n\nPunnaka.\n\n\"If that be so, O King, since I am from a distant country and cannot tarry long, make ready the gaming-place.\"\n\nSo the King summoned all his nobles, and ordered a place to be prepared. The nobles, having spread curiously-worked carpets and arranged places for the King and his hundred nobles, suitably to their rank, reported to the King that all was ready.\n\nThen Punnaka requested the King to come to the\n\n1 The description of what may be seen in the ruby is too long to translate.\ngaming-place, and said: \"My lord king, you have stated that you will play with me for anything save your royal person, your queen, or your throne, and your words are as ivory [i.e. firm]; but I am a poor person and you are the lord of many. If you win, you will assuredly take my ruby; but if I lose, you may delay in paying me, and fall back upon the fact that you are a king: how, then, can I play on equal terms?\" But the King replied: \"Kacc\u0101yano, be not afraid; whether I win or lose I will act according to the law.\"\n\nSo Punnaka called all the kings who were present to bear witness, saying: \"Kings of Pancala, Paccuggata, S\u016brasena, Madda, and Kebhi, who are here assembled, you have heard the words of Korabya your lord. Take good note of them. You are all law-abiding kings, and I call upon you to be my witnesses, without fear or favour; listen and watch between us, and according to the custom of the righteous, with heed, observe closely, and do that which is right.\"\n\nThereupon King Korabya, surrounded by a hundred princes, proceeded to the gaming-shed, and they sat in their appointed places; and King Korabya placed the golden dice upon a silver table.\n\nThen Punnaka said suddenly: \"My lord king, the marks upon the dice are called 'th\u00e9,' 'than,' 'einz\u00e9,' and 'nguzon': take which you please.\" The King elected to take \"einz\u00e9,\" and Punnaka took \"than.\"\n\nThe King then called upon Punnaka to throw first; but Punnaka said: \"My lord king, I am a poor man: it is not right that I should begin; it is for you to throw first.\" So the King agreed.\n\nNow there was a fairy, who had been his mother in his third state of existence, who constantly looked after King Korabya, and through her power he had always won when he played with dice. He used also to sing the following verses whenever he played: (Sabb\u0101 nad\u012b vi\u1e45ka nad\u012b, etc.), which mean\u2014\n\n1 These words are not given in the Bur. Dictionary, but according to the text th\u00e9 = 8, than = 6, einz\u00e9 = 4, and nguzon = 2.\nRivers, all are crooked rivers;\nFirewood grows in every tree;\nWoman ever doeth evil\nGet she opportunity.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn order to invoke his fairy guardian he sang as follows:\u2014\n\nO fairy, now my guardian be;\nFame and renown bring quick to me:\nUpon thy kindness I rely.\nPure is the gold that forms each die;\nBrightly they shine within the bowl:\nStand near me and my luck control.\nSweet fairy, ever kind to me,\nCome now and bring me victory.\n\nThen King Korabya, singing his gambling song, threw the dice into the air, but through Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka\u2019s power they fell so that he would have lost; knowing, however, by his great skill that this would happen, he caught them before they fell on the silver table and again threw them into the air, but seeing that they would a second time fall against him, he again caught them in his hand.\n\nSeeing this, Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka looked round to see the reason, and observed the good fairy standing near the King. He thereupon glared fiercely at the fairy, and she fled terrified to the top of a mountain on the confines of the world. The King then threw them again thrice, but by Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka\u2019s power was prevented from putting out his hand to catch them before they fell. Then Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka threw, and seeing that he had won, rose from his seat and cried, \u201cI have won, I have won.\u201d And the sound of his voice was heard throughout all Jambudvipa.\n\nKing Korabya was very sad at having lost, so Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka, in order to comfort him, said: \u201cMy lord king, when two persons have a wager each puts forth all his strength\n\n\\(^1\\) See J\u0101taka No. 62.\nto win, but both cannot do so\u2014one must lose; and so it is in this dicing: your Majesty, however, has not lost your own person. Be not cast down, but give me that precious thing that I have won, and let me depart, for I have come from afar and may not delay.\"\n\n*Korabya.*\n\n\"Youth Kacc\u0101yano, I have everything that is on the face of this earth: take what you want and go.\"\n\n*Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka.*\n\n\"My lord king, in your realm there are elephants, horses, precious stones, and lovely virgins, but the greatest treasure of all is Vidh\u016bra, 'the wise minister.' In accordance with your promise give him to me.\"\n\n*Korabya.*\n\n\"Kacc\u0101yano, before we began to play I said I would stake anything but myself, my queen, or my throne, and this Vidh\u016bra is as my very self, and you ought not to take him. It is on him that I rely. He is even greater than I, for I worship him. He is the source of my good fortune and like an island of refuge.\"\n\n*Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka.*\n\n\"My lord king, as I have far to go and cannot stay to argue the question, let us call Vidh\u016bra and abide by his decision.\"\n\n*Korabya.*\n\n\"Kacc\u0101yano, you are honest in all your actions: I am pleased with your suggestion. We will go to Vidh\u016bra and abide by his decision.\" So the King, accompanied by all his nobles, took Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka with him and went to the Hall of Justice.\nWhen Vidh\u016bra saw the King coming he descended from the judgment-seat and sat in a suitable place.\n\nPunnaka then addressed him thus: \"O wise minister, you are well established in the law, and would not speak falsely even to save your life. These things are known unto all men. I, too, would know this, O wise one\u2014Art thou the servant of the King, or one of his kin?\"\n\nVidh\u016bra.\n\n\"Youth, I am not of the King's kith, neither am I greater, but I am one of his servants. Of these there are four classes, viz.: the house-born, the purchased, the self-made, and the captive. As I am one that pays respect to the King, I am a 'self-made' slave, and though I may be taken to another country, I shall still be the servant of the King. And if the King for any reason give me to you, or another, his gift will be lawful.\"\n\nPunnaka.\n\n\"O princes, my victory is twofold. As for this king of kings, his wish was contrary to law. Why should he not give me this wise Vidh\u016bra, who has given a true decision?\"\n\nKorabya (in anger).\n\n\"O Vidh\u016bra, though I have honoured and raised you to high estate, you have no regard for me, but regard only the face of the youth Kacc\u0101yano, whom you have only just seen. Youth, take this true slave and go thy way.\"\n\n(End of the canto called \"The Dice-throwing.\")\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nThe King, thinking he might still detain Vidh\u016bra by getting him to solve difficult questions, asked him as follows:\n\n1. Vidh\u016bra, how may householders dwell in safety?\n\n---\n\n1 Antoj\u0101ta, dhanakkita, sayamd\u0101supagata, karamar\u0101nita.\n2. What is the law of mutual assistance?\n3. Under what circumstances may they be without poverty and anxiety?\n4. What is the rule for fidelity?\n5. After passing from this life to another how may they be free from dread?\n\nVidh\u016bra replied\u2014\n\n1. \"O King, people should not commit adultery with their neighbours' wives, nor should they eat without giving food to those who deserve it. They should not rely on absurd casuistry, for it tends not to true wisdom.\n\n2. \"Daily they ought to observe diligently the five duties. They should observe their duties to one another as rulers and householders. They should not forget to heap up merit. In all matters they should act with deliberation. Instead of being arrogant they should be humble. They should obey the instructions of the righteous. They should be neither short-tempered nor malicious. They should be bold and unflinching in almsgiving. They should speak loving words and be tender in thought, word, and deed.\n\n3. \"They should be liberal to their friends and loving, doing to them as they would be done by. They should be mindful of seed-time and harvest, and when mendicants come round ever ready to fill their bowls.\n\n4. \"They should desire to follow the precepts of the righteous. They should be mindful of their good birth and lineage. They should read and converse on good books, discussing and asking questions.\n\n5. \"O King, they who do these things are free from danger and anxiety in this life, neither shall they have dread when they pass to another existence.\"\n\n(Here ends the canto called \"The Householder.\")\nNow when Vidh\u016bra returned from conducting the King back to his palace, Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka said: \"Vidh\u016bra, you have been given to me by the King and must go with me as my servant. Look closely to my advantage, for wise men have said that whosoever acts only for the good of his lord becomes well acquainted with it.\"\n\nVidh\u016bra.\n\n\"Young man, I know that you have got possession of me, and that it was because the King gave me to you. It was for your good also that I answered his questions. In return for this kindness remain two or three days in my house, and allow me to instruct my wives and children.\"\n\nPu\u1e47\u1e47aka.\n\n\"Vidh\u016bra, I will remain with you a few days, and during that time set your affairs in order and instruct your wives and children.\"\n\nSo Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka went with Vidh\u016bra to his house.\n\nNow Vidh\u016bra's house was built in three mansions, one suitable for each season. They were named Ku\u00f1jara, Mayura, and Piyaka. They were as well appointed as that of Sakko. So Vidh\u016bra installed Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka in one of those mansions, with everything that he could want and 500 damsels to attend upon him, and retired to the one in which his family was living, and entering into the chamber of his wife Anul\u0101, told her to call all his children; but she, by reason of her great grief, was unable to do so, and sent her daughter-in-law, saying: \"My tender and loving daughter-in-law, beautiful as the flower of the blue lotus (Indavaramuppalam), go and summon my son Dhammap\u0101la and your other brothers-in-law.\"\n\nVidh\u016bra received them with streaming eyes, and embraced them; and after a little while, having come out into the\n\n1 Ku\u00f1jara, \"elephant.\" Mayura, \"peacock.\" Piyaka, \"a spotted deer.\" But these names are also connected with certain plants.\nreception hall, thus addressed his sorrowing family:\u2014\"My beloved children, I, your father, may only remain here in peace for three days, and after that must go away with the youth Kacc\u0101yano and obey his commands. Indeed, he desires to depart on this very day, but, as I had not given you my instructions, I begged him to remain a day or two. I will now tell you your line of conduct, and do you all take it well to heart; and if the king asks you, when you go into his presence, whether your father gave you any commands, you can relate to him all I now say, and when he hears your words he will remember me with regret, and appoint you to proper posts.\" On hearing these words his family wept bitterly.\n\n(Here ends the canto called \"Lakkha\u1e47a.\")\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen the weeping had ceased, he said: \"My children, be not afraid: all the laws of 'Bh\u016bmakasa\u1e45kh\u0101ra' are impermanent.\\(^1\\) Wealth and riches are lost and destroyed. I will now relate to you the verses called 'R\u0101javasati,' attention to which will ensure earthly wealth and happiness.\"\n\nThe R\u0101javasati, or \"King-service.\"\\(^2\\)\n\n1. If anyone desire royal service, being seated, listen to me;\n   How a man, having entered the service of royal personages, may attain unto honour.\n2. That man obtains not a royal family who is inconspicuous in wisdom;\n   Nor the coward, the fool, nor the sluggard, at any time.\n\n\\(^1\\) I do not find this combination in Childers. According to the Burmese, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra means \"mutability,\" but here it seems to indicate the stages of existence both in this life and the next.\n\n\\(^2\\) This consists of 46 couplets, beginning\u2014\n\n1.

Even as a balance, rightly held with equal beam,\n   Obtaining full knowledge of all things, let him serve the king.\n\n6. By day or by night, learned in the king's service,\n   Unshaken, not wavering, let him serve the king.\n\n7. By day or by night, learned in the king's service,\n   Gaining knowledge in all things, let him serve the king.\n\n8. Though one say to him, the road is made ready for the king;\n   Even though the king urge him to go by it, he should not; let him serve the king.\n\n9. Let him not eat, as the king, food or dainties.\n   Let him even keep behind others; let him serve the king.\n\n10. Let him not wear garments, wreaths, perfumes, nor ornaments, nor speak, nor do as the king does:\n    Let him use other adornments; let him serve the king.\n\n11. Should the king take his pleasure, surrounded by courtiers and women,\n    With his courtiers and women let not the wise man dally.\n\n12. Not puffed up with pride; prudent, with senses well guarded;\n    Firmly resolved in his heart; let him serve the king.\n\n13. He should not dally with the king's wife, nor remain in a secluded place with her:\n    Let him not use the king's treasure; let him serve the king.\n\n14. Let him not love much sleep, nor drink intoxicating drinks;\n    Nor fling the dice, nor game in the king's presence; let him serve the king.\n\n15. Let him not mount the king's couch, chair, throne, or chariot,\nThinking, \"I am chosen for honour\"; let him serve the king.\n\n16. Let not the discerning man go too far from the king, nor too near him:\n   Let him stand in his presence so as to be seen and heard without difficulty.\n\n17. He should not say, \"The king is my friend; the king is my foster-brother\":\n   Swift is the anger of the king, as the smart of a mote in the eye.\n\n18. Though he think himself revered (by the king), the wiser and more learned man,\n   Let him not answer harshly the king when in the assembly.\n\n19. Though he has the right to enter the door, let him not enter without the king's permission:\n   King's authority is as fire: let him serve the king.\n\n20. If the king thinks to favour son or brother with villages, townships, districts, or provinces,\n   Being silent let him look on, nor cunningly speak ill of him.\n\n21. To the elephant-riders, the royal guards, the charioteers, and foot-soldiers, when he gives wages, and the king increases their pay,\n   Let him not interfere; let him serve the king.\n\n22. As a bow with an arrow fitted to it, bending as a bamboo reed,\n   Let him not act in opposition; let him serve the king.\n\n23. His words should be as few as those of a tongueless fish,\n   Measured, prudent, brave; let him serve the king.\n\n24. Let him not go to touch women, for loss of power is sure;\n   Cough, asthma, suffering, weakness, and wasting come upon him.\n\n25. Let him not talk over much, nor let him keep silence:\n   When the time is fit let him speak, not ramblingly but measuredly.\n26. Not wrathful nor jarring, gentle, truthful, not back-biting.\n   Let him not talk frivolous talk; let him serve the king.\n\n27.

Both Samanas and Brahmans, holy and profound in learning,\n   Let him lodge with care; and let him serve the king.\n\n33. Both Samanas and Brahmans, holy and profound in learning,\n   Let him refresh with food and drink; and let him serve the king.\n\n34. Both Samanas and Brahmans, holy and profound in learning,\n   Who have attained wisdom, let him serve, asking deep questions.\n\n35. Let him not omit customary gifts to Samanas and Brahmans;\n   Nor let him forbid beggars at alms-time.\n\n36. Wise, endowed with knowledge, skilled in rites and observance of the law,\n   Well knowing times and seasons, let him serve the king.\n\n37.

When (the king is) clothing and bathing, or feet-washing, head-lowered,\\(^1\\)\nAnd when struck not wrathful; let him serve the king.\n\n44. If one gives salutation to pots and does reverence to basins,\nWhy to the giver of all good things should not the best be given?\\(^2\\)\n\n45. Whosoever gives beds, clothes, vehicles, habitations, and houses,\nEven as a rain-cloud to beings, he pours down wealth.\n\n46. This R\u0101javasati if a man practise,\nHe propitiates kings, and obtains both wealth and honour.\n\nOn the third day Vidh\u016bra, having bathed and dressed himself, went to the King's palace, to pay his respects and take leave, and addressed the King thus:\u2014\"My lord king, this young man is taking me away; his mind is set upon going. I would speak to thee concerning the good of my family: listen, victorious one. When the youth asked me how I was related to thee, I truly replied that I was thy servant. That, indeed, is the only fault, as far as I can see, that I have committed. If a man slips upon the earth\n\n\\(^1\\) That is to say, \"he should not look at the king's face, but stand with averted eyes.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) The first line of 44 runs thus: \"Kumbha\u00f1\u00f1hi pa\u00f1jalim kayir\u0101 | c\u0101ta\u00f1c\u0101pi padakkhinam.\" The meaning is obscure, and the Burmese translation is: \"On beholding pots full of water, kingfishers and other birds, though they can give no advantages, yet we salute them with raised hands.\"\nand falls, on that spot even he must remain. That slip of mine I look at as my fault. Be not angry with me for that error, but take care of my family and possessions, and let them not be destroyed.\"\n\n*Korabya.*\n\n\"It is not pleasant to hear that you must depart. I will endeavour by some stratagem to prevent your departure. I will summon the youth to my palace and secretly make away with him.\"\n\n*Vidh\u016bra.*\n\n\"My Lord, though this thought of thine arises through love and pity for me, it is not right; there is no benefit in it. Put it from thee and think only of what is meritorious. All beings must grow old and die. I bear no ill-will to this youth. He may beat me, or free me, or kill me. Being his slave, I must submit to his will and go with him.\"\n\nSo Vidh\u016bra, having respectfully saluted the King, and admonished the nobles and attendants, left the palace; and all the queens and ladies, being unable to restrain their feelings, with dishevelled hair and streaming eyes, beating their breasts, followed him in great sorrow. The people of the city came in crowds to see him depart; and he exhorted them, saying: \"Be not sorrowful: actions, affections, seasons, food, are all impermanent. Both one's earthly body and possessions must come to an end; therefore, reflecting on these things, we should give alms and observe our religious duties.\" Having thus admonished them and sent them home, he proceeded to his house. Just then his son Dhammap\u0101la, and the rest of his family, having come out to look for him, met him at the gate; and when he saw his children, being unable to restrain his sorrow, he embraced them, weeping, and entered into his house. Now Vidh\u016bra \"the wise\" had a thousand sons, a thousand daughters, a thousand wives, and seven hundred concubines, and very\nmany slaves and kinsmen. The whole of these were smitten with grief and sorrow, and lay prostrate as the \"sal\" trees when smitten by a whirlwind from Mount Yugantara; and with a mighty murmur they besought him not to leave them; but, having comforted them, and set his household affairs in order, he left them and entered into the presence of Punnaka, saying: \"Youth, in accordance with my wish, you have waited here in my palace two or three days, and my instructions to my family are complete: do according to your wish.\"\n\nPunnaka.\n\n\"Since you have completed your arrangements let us depart, for the distance we have to go is long. Without fear take hold of my horse's tail, for this is the last time that you shall behold the habitation of men.\"\n\nVidh\u016bra.\n\n\"Of what should, then, I be in dread?\nTo none have I ever done evil\nBy thought, or by word, or by deed,\nTo make me the prey of the Devil.\" \u00b9\n\nThen, fearless as a lion, he uttered this act of truth: \"May this cloth with which my loins are now girt ne'er leave me as long as I require it\"; and, mounting on to the horse's crupper, and firmly grasping the tail, he said: \"Youth, I have firm hold of your horse's tail: go whithersoever you desire.\"\n\nAt that instant Punnaka thought, \"What is the use of my taking this Vidh\u016bra to a distant place? I will carry him to the Himavanta forest, and, having dragged him through the ravines and thorn-brakes till the life is out of him, cast his dead body into a chasm, and carry his heart to N\u0101ga-land.\" So he directed his horse Manomaya thither, and urged him swiftly through the trees. But by the\n\n\u00b9 \"Gaccheyya duggatim.\" But Buddhists believe that they will be tortured by devils in hell.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nvirtue of the Bodhisat's accumulated merit the trees kept away from his body for the distance of a cubit.\n\nWhen Punnaka looked back to see if he were dead, and beheld his face shining with brightness, he again urged his horse thrice through the thickets; but to no purpose. Being greatly enraged, he rode into a mighty wind, but by the power of the Bodhisat it divided in two; and though he did this seven times he was unable to kill him, so he carried him off to the mountain called K\u0101\u1e37\u0101giri.\n\nNow Vidh\u016bra's wives and family, thinking that he was a very long time in the upper chamber with Punnaka, ascended to see what he was doing; and when they saw him not, raised a great cry, saying, \"This demon in the likeness of a youth has carried off our lord\"; and they wept and wailed bitterly. And when the King heard the sound thereof, he inquired what was the matter; and when they told him, he comforted them, saying: \"Be not afraid, and cease from weeping, for he can preach the law sweetly, and will bring that youth to reason. Do not be so disturbed: he will soon return.\"\n\nWhen Punnaka arrived at the top of K\u0101\u1e37\u0101giri, he thought\u2014\"If I do not kill this Vidh\u016bra I shall not get Irandhat\u012b, and all my trouble will be for nought. I will kill him, and, having taken out his heart, carry it to Queen Vimal\u0101, and bear away Irandhat\u012b to my abode. It will not, however, do for me to kill him with my own hands, but I must cause his death through fear.\" So he set Vidh\u016bra down on the peak of the mountain, and took the appearance of a frightful demon, which threw Vidh\u016bra prone on his back, and then held him between its tusks as if it would devour him; but the Bodhisat was not in the least terrified. He then endeavoured to frighten him by taking the appearances of a lion, a must elephant, and a huge serpent; but the Bodhisat was not terrified by them. Then, thinking he would grind him to powder, he caused a mighty whirlwind to blow on him as he lay on the mountain-top; but that wind did not even disturb one hair of his head. He then caused the whole mountain\nof K\u0101l\u0101giri to be agitated, but was unable to terrify him; so he entered into the heart of the mountain and yelled loudly, but, though the noise was terrible, the Bodhisat was not disturbed.\n\nFinding that he could not terrify him by any of these means, he, in the form of a frightful demon, took him by both feet and hurled him from the top of K\u0101l\u0101giri; but the Bodhisat fell lightly, as a ball of dressed cotton, at a distance of fifteen y\u016bjan\u0101s. Then, taking him up again head downwards and finding that he was not yet dead, he hurled him again into the heavens, and he fell at a distance of sixty y\u016bjan\u0101s.\n\nAfter this had been done, the Bodhisat thought\u2014\"He may hurl me away again, or, taking me by the feet, beat me to death against this mountain, but I shall not be afraid; for to say nothing of these terrors, if at the end of this cycle, during the 'samvat\u1e6dath\u0101yi' (desolation?), even were I cast down from the realms of Vehapphalo into bottomless void, yet by reason of 'self-possession' I should have no fear; I should still be Vidh\u016bra, the wise minister of the King of Kuru.\" Then he said:\u2014\"Youth, your appearance is that of a good man, but you are not so. Your appearance is that of one who keeps himself under restraint, but you do not do so. You do that which is evil and profitless. Your actions are not meritorious. Why do you hurl me into these chasms? What advantage will you gain by my death? I do not think you are a man, but a Rakshasa: by what name are you known amongst Devas?\"\n\nPu\u1e47\u1e47aka.\n\n\"Have you not heard of Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka in the country of men? I am the general of the armies of King Vessavan. I desire to wed the lovely Irandhati, daughter of Vimala, the Queen of the N\u0101ga king Varu\u1e47a; and because I desire to wed her, it is my purpose to slay you.\"\n\n1 See Childers, under \"Kappo.\"\nVidh\u016bra.\n\n\u201cO Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka, descend not to the level of fools. Oftentimes men come to destruction for doing the evil that they ought not to do. Why do you want to marry this lovely N\u0101ga princess? What profit will you get by my death?\u201d\n\nPu\u1e47\u1e47aka.\n\n\u201cO wise minister, I will tell you. I know not whether it was because we were once married and loved each other in a former existence, but from the first moment that I saw her I was urged by love to demand her from the N\u0101ga king, who informed me in the verses beginning \u2018Dujjemukho,\u2019 etc., that I must obtain lawfully, as her price, the heart of Vidh\u016bra; and, therefore, I desire to get your heart. I do not desire to injure you for a mere idle whim. I won you lawfully and I desire to take your heart lawfully and present it to the N\u0101ga king, so that I may obtain Irandhati. And as your death would be a great advantage to me, I have brought you to this place.\u201d\n\nThe Bodhisat, on hearing this, reflected\u2014\u201cWhat does Vimal\u0101 want with my heart? Varu\u1e47a, having heard me preach the law, and having presented me with the ruby that adorns her neck, will probably, when he returned to the N\u0101ga country, have praised my preaching before his queens and courtiers; and, on that account, his chief queen, Vimal\u0101, wishing to hear me, has laid this stratagem, and Varu\u1e47a, not understanding it, has sent this ignorant Rakshasa Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka, and he is ill-treating me owing to his bad disposition. I indeed am wise, but if I die by the hand of this Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka what will be the use of my having been wise? I will even now show him my power.\u201d So he said: \u201cYouth, listen to the law called \u2018S\u0101dhunara,\u2019 and after you have heard it do with me according to your desire.\u201d\n\nPu\u1e47\u1e47aka, saying to himself, \u201cI do not think this law\n\n1 Vidh\u016bra either had the power of omniscience, or Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka thought aloud.\nhas ever been preached before to men and devas,\" raised up Vidh\u016bra and set him on his feet on the top of the mountain, saying: \"I have taken you out of the abyss and set you on the mountain. I have other business besides taking your heart, so that no good law may be unknown to men make it known to me.\"\n\nThe Bodhisat answered: \"Youth, since you have other business besides taking my heart, and have saved me from the abyss, and, desiring to hear the law called 'S\u0101dhunara,' have set me on the top of this mountain, I also will declare this law unto you; but my body is covered with dust and dirt, and it is not proper to preach when the body is defiled with dirt: permit me, I pray you, to bathe.\"\n\nSo Pun\u1e47aka brought bathing water, and caused the Bodhisat to bathe in it; and when he had done, dressed him and anointed him with fairy scents, and fed him with fairy food. Then, having prepared the top of K\u0101\u1e37\u0101giri in a suitable manner for preaching the law, the Bodhisat, sitting cross-legged, said\u2014\n\n\"Follow him who goes before thee;\nDry not, youth, the hand that's wet;\nNever to thy friend be faithless;\nFollow not the wanton's beck.\n\nThese are the four precepts of the 'S\u0101dhunara,' and he who adheres to them may be called a good man.\"\n\nPun\u1e47aka, not being able to understand, answered: \"O wise one, who is he that has gone before? Why must one not dry the wet hand? Who is he that errs against his friend? What is a wanton? Explain to me this law; it is too difficult for me to understand.\"\n\nWhereupon the Bodhisat replied: \"If another should confer acts of hospitality on oneself, though he has never seen or met one before, to that person one should in like manner repay with gratitude those acts which he has done. This is the law called 'Y\u0101t\u0101nuy\u0101yi.'\n\n\"If, for even one night, one should rest in a person's house, and obtain the slightest refreshment, one should not\ntransgress against that person, even in thought. This is the law called 'Allap\u0101ni parivajjaya.'\n\n\"Whosoever takes shelter beneath a tree, he should not break even a branch or twig thereof; it is his friend. This is the law called 'Mittadubbi.'\n\n\"Though a badly-disposed woman be taken in marriage, and obtain all the worldly goods it is possible to give her, yet, if she sees an opportunity for entertaining a lover, she will do injury to her husband without thought of gratitude. Verily, if a man be overcome by the blandishments of such a woman and gives her all her desires, his profit will be nought, and he will be harassed in body and mind. This is the law called 'Asatinam nagacche.'\"\n\n(Here ends the \"S\u0101dhunara\" canto.)\n\nThe Bodhisat having thus preached the law, Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka thought thus:\u2014\"The wise one appears by these four laws to ask for his life. He never saw my face before, and though I was not his close friend, yet he treated me in his house as if I had dwelt with him aforetime. I enjoyed his hospitality for three or four days, and now the only reason I have for ill-treating him is for the sake of a woman. If I look at these four laws I see that I have been false to my friend. If I were to kill him I should verily be one who follows not the law called 'S\u0101dhunara,' and if I am said to be one who does not according to this law I should not be desired by the N\u0101ga king's daughter. I will restore the wise one to his country, and gladden the hearts of his people and family\": so he said: \"O most excellent one, I dwelt in your home for several days, and you fed me; you are indeed a friend against whom I should not transgress. Truly, I will release you. I deserve not the N\u0101ga king's darling; through desire for her I ought not to have done this evil deed. Because you have preached the law well I will free you from death.\"\n\nWhen he said this the Bodhisat answered: \"O Deva, do not convey me to my home yet. Since I have never yet\nbeheld the treasures of the N\u0101ga king, take me to N\u0101galand.\"\n\nPunnaka thereupon answered gladly: \"We will go at once to the glorious land of the N\u0101gas, and thou shalt behold it. That country is full of all splendours and delights.\" When they arrived there, Punnaka, placing the Bodhisat behind him, went into the presence of the N\u0101ga king; and when the King saw them he said: \"Youth, you went to the country of men to fetch the heart of the wise Vidh\u016bra: now that you have brought him himself, is your purpose accomplished?\"\n\nAnd Punnaka answered: \"My lord king of the N\u0101gas, you desired Vidh\u016bra, and he has come. I obtained him lawfully. Behold him. There is great happiness in associating with good people, even though it be for a moment.\"\n\n(Here ends the chapter called \"K\u0101l\u0101giri.\")\n\nAfter the N\u0101ga king had conversed thus with Punnaka, he turned to Vidh\u016bra and said: \"O wise nobleman, is it because of these unwonted splendours, which you have not beheld in the country of men, that, without fear of death, you are unable to pay respect to me, but remain in a state of stupefaction? He who is afraid when opportunity arrives cannot be called wise. Judging from your present conduct, I am of opinion that your fame for wisdom amongst men is a mistake.\"\n\nThe Bodhisat.\n\n\"O N\u0101ga king, I have no fear of death. Who is likely to kill me? Verily, beings should not bow to those whom they are about to kill; neither should they bow down to those who are about to kill them.\"\n\nThe N\u0101ga king.\n\n\"Thy words are true, indeed; one should not bow down to the person who ought to be slain, nor should one bow to the slayer. For who would do obeisance to the person who desires to slay him?\"\nThe Bodhisat.\n\n\"O king of the N\u0101gas, this wealth and glory of yours are not lasting. I will ask you one question. Why did you obtain this fairy palace? Did you get it for nothing, or through the change of seasons? Was it wrought by your hand, or was it given you by some fairy? How did you get it?\"\n\nThe N\u0101ga king.\n\n\"O wise one, I got not this palace and wealth without cause; nor did I get it through the natural changes of the seasons. It was not given to me by the fairies; but I obtained it by merit accrued in a former existence.\"\n\nThe Bodhisat.\n\n\"O N\u0101ga king, what was this meritorious action? What was the good deed that you performed? Your glory and wealth are very great: of what good deeds are they the result?\"\n\nThe N\u0101ga king.\n\n\"O wise one, when I and my queen Vimal\u0101 dwelt in the city of Camp\u0101nagar\u0101m, in the country of \u0100\u1e45ga, we were both of like mind as to almsgiving, and never lost an opportunity for giving alms. Our house was full of all those things that are bestowed on ascetics, as it were a well of water, and we gave them the ten lawful gifts, viz.: rice, sweet liquor, scent, unguents, lamp oil, cloths, mattrasses, couches, monasteries, and medicine. As the result of those excellent deeds we enjoy these delights.\"\n\nThe Bodhisat.\n\n\"Since then, O N\u0101ga king, you obtained this palace as the result of a good deed, you know what is merit and also its results. Forget not this knowledge, and continue to act upon it. If you do so you will in the hereafter obtain another palace.\"\nThe N\u0101ga king.\n\n\"As there are no hermits or Brahmans in this country, as in the land of men, I am unable to give alms. What meritorious action can I do here so as to ensure a happy abode in the next state?\"\n\nThe Bodhisat.\n\n\"O King, be ever kind to your people, relations, and attendants, chastening them with a loving hand if necessary. Be not angry with them. By increasing your love and patience you will hereafter acquire a higher station amongst the Devas.\"\n\nThe N\u0101ga king.\n\n\"Vidh\u016bra, thou art the minister who art wont to instruct the intimate friends of the King of Kuru, and Korabya himself, through being long parted from you, is very sorrowful. He can only be comforted by your return.\"\n\nThe Bodhisat.\n\n\"O King, you say this through having reflected on the law of righteousness. It is well known that my great qualities can assist him in calamity.\"\n\nThe N\u0101ga king.\n\n\"Tell me truly, did Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka obtain you for nothing or did he win you by dice? He tells me that he obtained you lawfully.\"\n\nThe Bodhisat.\n\n\"My lord king, Dhana\u00f1caya lost me to Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka by a throw of the dice; and as I belonged to the King, he gave me to Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka. He obtained me lawfully.\"\n\nThe N\u0101ga king\n\n(Having taken Vidh\u016bra into the Queen's chamber).\n\n\"My Lady Vimal\u0101, you were sickly, downcast, and wasted on account of the wise Vidh\u016bra. He whom thou desiredst\nis even this man here. He can dispel all wrath and darkness from the hearts of men and Devas. O Queen Vimal\u0101, you desired his heart's flesh; he has now come to you: listen to the law that he will preach to you. It will be difficult to find his equal in wisdom.\u201d\n\nWhen Queen Vimal\u0101 saw the N\u0101ga king coming and leading Vidh\u016bra by the hand, with joy she raised her ten slender fingers to her head, and said: \u201cWise one, thou payest not reverence through stupefaction on seeing such splendours. It is a mistake to call thee \u2018wise.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Bodhisat.\n\n\u201cN\u0101ga princess, I am not afraid through beholding you. Who would kill one so wise as I am? N\u0101ga princess, no one about to be slain makes obeisance to his slayer, nor does the slayer do reverence to him whom he is about to slay.\u201d\n\nVimal\u0101.\n\n\u201cIt is as you say, O wise one. A person should not do reverence to those who intend to slay him.\u201d\n\nThe Bodhisat then asks the Queen the same question as he asked the King, and the Bodhisat preaches the law of kindness. The Queen states that she is satisfied with having heard the \u201claw,\u201d which is his \u201cheart\u201d; and that she thinks King Dhana\u00f1caya Korabya must be very sorrowful at being separated from him, and will be delighted to see him again.\n\nThe Bodhisat replies that this is undoubtedly the case, as there is no one so skilled in giving good advice as he is.\n\nThe Queen asks him to tell her how Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka managed to get possession of him, and the Bodhisat replies: \u201cBe not afraid, O N\u0101ga, and take no thought as to how to slay me. I present myself wholly to thee. If you still desire my heart I will take it out and give it you, and if you want my flesh I will cut it off and give it you.\u201d\nThe N\u0101ga king.\n\n\u201cO wise one, the \u2018heart\u2019 of a wise man is his wisdom. I have heard you preach the law, and my desire is fulfilled. Since Punnaka has brought thee to this country, according to my wish, and both the wishes of myself and queen have been fulfilled, we will give him our daughter Irandhati to wife; and do you, Punnaka, this very day convey Vidh\u016bra back to Indapattanagaram.\u201d\n\nSo Punnaka, being delighted at having obtained Irandhati, said: \u201cO wise nobleman, I will repay you for the good you have done me by giving you this \u2018Manohara\u2019 ruby, and this very day restore you to Indapattanagaram.\u201d\n\nThe Bodhisat.\n\n\u201cMay you dwell happily in your palace with this lovely N\u0101ga princess for the rest of your existence, and may nothing interfere with your mutual love; and since you are a true friend, you may give me the ruby and restore me to my home.\u201d\n\nPunnaka.\n\n\u201cGood, let us depart. Get up on to my horse.\u201d And placing Vidh\u016bra before him on his horse \u201cManomaya,\u201d in an instant, after bidding farewell to the N\u0101ga king, they arrived in the country of Kuru, where Punnaka set him down, and, after again thanking him, rode off to the realms of the four great R\u0101jas.\n\nOn the morning of the day on which Vidh\u016bra returned, King Korabya dreamed that there was a great tree near the door of his palace covered with sweet fruit, and which gave shade and shelter to all kinds of animals, and that all men made offerings and adorations to it. A cruel-looking black man, carrying a sword and wearing a bright red cloth, came and cut down this tree and took it away, to the great grief of everyone. Not long afterwards the same savage-looking man came back and set it up as it was before.\nWhen the King awoke he related his dream, and felt sure that it related to Vidh\u016bra; for none other than Vidh\u016bra could be like unto this tree, for his wisdom resembled the roots, his religious duties the branches, and his preaching the sweet fruit. He felt sure, therefore, that Vidh\u016bra was about to be restored to him, and was joyful. He therefore ordered the city to be decorated, the court to be prepared, and all the princes and nobles to be assembled.\n\nSo when Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka set Vidh\u016bra down in the law-court, and went off with Irandhat\u012b to \"Catumah\u0101r\u0101j,\" the King was overcome with delight; and, rising from his seat, took him by the arm and led him to the throne that had been prepared opposite to him, and thus addressed him: \"Vidh\u016bra, you have come back to rejoice my heart as a chariot that has been repaired after it has been broken. How did you escape from the hands of the youth who took you away?\"\n\nVidh\u016bra then related (in verse) all that had befallen him, and at the conclusion said:\u2014\"Thus, O King, because Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka had set his affections on Irandhat\u012b he carried me off to slay me; but obtained his desire only by placing full reliance on me. The King of the N\u0101gas, and his queen Vimal\u0101, too, by obtaining my heart, which is 'true wisdom,' were satisfied. In gratitude the N\u0101ga king restored me to my home and country, and I obtained the wonderful ruby which may be worn by Cakkavatti monarchs alone; I now present it to you, my Lord.\"\n\nThe King then related his dream to the assembly, released all those who were in prison, and proclaimed a universal holiday for a month.\n\nAfter the rejoicings were over, and to the end of his life, Vidh\u016bra instructed the King and his people with discourses in almsgiving and religious duties, and when he died passed to T\u0101vatimsa. All those who were confirmed in the law went to the land of the Devas.\n\nAt the end of the J\u0101taka the Buddha summed up as follows: \"The then king and queen are now my royal\nparents, the heads of the S\u0101k\u012b race; Vidh\u016bra's wife, Anul\u0101, is now R\u0101hul\u0101's mother; Varu\u1e47a the N\u0101ga king is now my disciple S\u0101riputtar\u0101, the son of the Br\u0101hm\u0101ni R\u016bpa,\\(^1\\) of the village of Upatissa; the Ga\u1e47una (Garu\u1e37a) king is now Moggal\u0101no, my second disciple, the son of the Br\u0101hm\u0101ni Moggali, of the village of Kolita; Sakko is now my uncle Dododhana's son, Anuruddha; King Korabya is now \u0100nand\u0101; Pun\u1e47aka is now Angulim\u0101la, the son of the Brahman Bhattagga, the chief teacher of Kosala, king of S\u0101vutthi; the horse Manomaya is my horse Ka\u1e47\u1e0daka; Queen Vimal\u0101 is now Khem\u0101, the nun, who was the queen of Bimbisara, king of R\u0101jagriha (see R.A.S. Journal, July 1893, p. 529); Irandhati is now Kisagotam\u012b; and Vidh\u016bra is now I, the Buddha.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) Both R\u016bpa and Moggali are here called \"Punp\u0113ma,\" the fem. form of \"Punn\u0101,\" \\(\\text{\u1017} \\text{\u1017} \\text{\u1017}\\) used by the Burmese to denote a Brahman. Stevenson has made no attempt in his dictionary to explain the word. The fem. is evidently Punpi + ma, the Burmese fem. affix. The word is probably a very old one, and derived rather from Sanskrit than Pali.\nART.

LAN-WU-LI.\n\nThe country of Lan-wu-li [Amoy dialect: Lam-bu-li = Ramni or Lambri] produces sapanwood, ivory, and white rattan. The inhabitants are warlike and often use poisonous arrows. With the north wind you come within a little more than twenty days to the country of Hsi-lan [Ceylon], which is under the government of Nan-p'i [Malabar]. Sailing from Lan-wu-li, you know that you are coming to Hsi-lan [Ceylon] by the flashing of lightning always visible. The king is black, with unkempt hair, and wears no covering on his head; he wears no regular clothes, but is merely wrapped in cloth of various colours, and his feet are protected by sandals of red leather [fastened] with gold thread. When going out he rides on an elephant or in a kind of litter [juan-tou, a word which Professor Schlegel, T'oung-pao, vol. vi, p. 163, suggests to be a transcription of a Ceylonese word handul, meaning a litter]. He eats every day a paste made of betel nuts burnt together with\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. Yule, Marco Polo, 2nd ed., vol. ii, p. 283, note 1. A German version of Chao Ju-kua's accounts of Lan-wu-li and Nan-p'i has been published in the T'oung-pao, vol. vi, p. 152 seqq., where the sinological reader will find the Chinese characters of some of the names.\nreal pearl ashes. His palace is decked with cats' eyes and blue and red jewels [sapphires and rubies?], cornelians, and other precious stones; the very floor he walks upon is so adorned. There is an eastern and a western palace, at each of which there is planted a golden tree; their stems and stalks being made of gold, their flowers, fruits, and leaves of cats' eyes, blue and red jewels, and the like precious stones. Underneath [each of] these trees there is a golden throne with [partition] walls of glass. When holding court, the king ascends the eastern throne in the morning and the western throne in the evening. At the spot where the king sits down there is continuous glittering of the jewels reflecting the sun's rays, the glass and the jewel tree shining upon each other like the glory of the rising sun. Two attendants constantly hold up a golden dish to receive the dregs of the betel nuts chewed by the king. The king's followers pay a monthly tax of one yi of gold [about 16 taels] into the Government treasury for receiving the betel-nut dregs, which contain camphor and all kinds of precious substances. The king holds in his hand a jewel [lit. precious pearl] five inches in diameter, which will stand the test of fire and shine at night like a torch; by rubbing his face with it every day, the king will keep his youthful looks, though he may be over ninety years old. The inhabitants are very dark-skinned; they wrap their bodies round with silk stuffs, are bareheaded, and go barefoot. They use their hands in taking their food. Household vessels are made of bronze.\n\nThere is in the country a hill [or, an island] called Hsi-lun [lit. fine wheel], peaks rising over peaks, [on the top of which] there is the imprint, over seven feet in length, of the foot of a huge man, a like imprint being visible in the water within a distance of over 300 li from that hill. The trees in the forests of the hills, whether high or low, all round are bent towards it [as if curtseying].\n\n1 There can be little doubt as to the identity of this hill Hsi-lun with the Sripada of Buddhist lore, the footprints of Buddha on Adam's Peak (as it is called by the Muhammadans\u2014the Samanta K\u016b\u1e6da of the Sinhalese). Some\nThe [mineral] products are cats' eyes, red glass, camphor [sic], blue and red pearls [sapphires and rubies]; and the land produces cardamoms, the bark of the Mu-lan tree [Mangrove Bark?], coarse and fine incense. Foreign merchants import, in exchange for these products, sandalwood, cloves, camphor [sic], gold, silver, porcelain, horses, elephants, and silk stuffs. The country sends yearly tribute to San-fo-ch'i [Palembang, Sumatra].\n\n16. Nan-p'i [Malabar].\n\nThe country of Nan-p'i is in the extreme south-west. From San-fo-ch'i [Palembang, Sumatra] one may arrive\n\ntime previous to the period of our author the veneration of this sacred object had received (according to Lassen, \"Indische Alterthumskunde,\" iv, 333) a fresh impetus by the devotion of the Sinhalese usurper Kirtti-Narasinha, who, being a native of Kalinga, had made himself master of the island by making use of a temporary confusion in its Government. This Sinhalese monarch, whose reign extended from A.D. 1187 to 1196, was a great worshipper of Buddha, and, on one occasion, ascended the sacred Peak with an army in four divisions, in order to worship at the Foot Print. But according to the Mah\u0101 Vansa, a much better authority, Par\u0101krama Bahu the Great, who conquered South India and Kambodia, was king 1164\u20131197; and there is no mention of Kirtti-Narasinha. The Arabs believed that Adam, after his expulsion from Paradise, was thrown on this very hill, and that the footprint belongs to him, whence the name Adam's Peak has arisen. When stepping out Adam set his other foot into the sea. The place has been a resort of both Muhammadan and Buddhist devotees throughout the Middle Ages, the Chinese, of course, taking the Buddhist view of this twofold tradition, though they have been informed of this legend, in which they call Adam \"P'an Ku,\" the creator of mankind. Cf. M\u00e9m. conc. les Chinois, vol. xiv, p. 25; and Reinaud, Relation, etc., vol. ii, p. 5 seq., and vol. ii, p. 8 seq. The Chinese name Hsi-lun (lit. fine, or small, wheel), while resembling that of the island, Ceylon, is probably connected with the Sanskrit tchakra, denoting a wheel\u2014\"empreinte d'une roue \u00e0 mille rais sous chaque pied du Bouddha\" (Julien, Hiouen-thsang, vol. iii, p. 475).\n\n1 Pronounced Nampi in Canton. I am inclined to interpret this name as the transcription of some Indian word. The list of states or places mentioned by our author as belonging to this country (Coilom, Guzerat, Cambay, etc.) greatly facilitates its identification with the then flourishing kingdom of Malabar, but it appears that the name Nan-p'i is an ethnical title rather than a political term. The only passage which has occurred to me as throwing light on this subject was in the Hsi-yang-ch'ao-kung-tien-lu (ch. iii, p. 3), a work placing on record the results of the famous expeditions of the eunuch Ch'eng Ho about A.D. 1430. Speaking of the inhabitants of the country of Ku-li, i.e. Kalikut, it says that there five different classes, or castes, are distinguished, viz.: 1, the Nan-p'i; 2, the Hui-hui, or Muhammadans; 3, the Ch\u00e9-ti; 4, the Ko-ling; 5, the Mu-kua. The Hui-hui are well known as Muhammadans; the term Ch\u00e9-ti I venture to identify with the \"Chetty,\" or merchants' caste (cf. Yule, Anglo-Indian\nthere with the monsoon in a little more than a month. The capital of the country is styled Mieh-a-mo; in Chinese this says as much as li-ssu [controller of sacrifice, priest?]. The chief of the country wears clothing on his body, but walks barefoot; he wraps his head in cloth [i.e. wears a turban], and wears a loin cloth, all being of white cotton. Sometimes he wears a white cotton shirt with narrow sleeves. When going out he rides on an elephant, and is covered with a golden cap decorated with red pearls and gems. On his arm a golden band is fastened, and a golden\n\nGlossary, p. 144, s.v. Chetty, and p. 615, s.v. Sett); Ko-ling may stand for \"Kling\" (cf. Yule, op. cit., p. 372). Mu-kua is apparently the same as Mucoa, Mukwa. \"The fourth class are called Mechua, and these are fishers\" (Varthema, Yule, p. 454). These identifications are based on similarity in sound merely, but the passage referred to gives us some further detail regarding the Nan-p'i and the Hui-hui. The former eat no beef, the Hui-hui eat no pork; the two castes, if we may so call them, do not intermarry, and have their own burial customs. In Calicut sixty per cent. of the entire population in those days (about A.D. 1430) were Hui-hui, or Muhammadans. I do not dare to forestall the opinion of Indian scholars with regard to the name Nan-p'i (Nambi). Could this word stand for namburi, \"a Brahman of Malabar\"? (Yule, p. 471, s.v. Nambooree)?\n\n1 It took Ibn Batuta forty days to sail from Sumatra to Kanlam.\u2014Yule, Cathay, p. 513.\n\n2 Mieh-a-mo, in Cantonese: Mit-d-mdt, in the Amoy dialect: Biat-o-bwat, possibly a Chinese corruption of Arabic Mid\u00e1vi or M\u00e1rvi (Marabia), said to have been an old city in the kingdom of Eli described by Marco Polo. However, the few notices collected by Yule as referring to this city (Marco Polo, 2nd ed., vol. ii, p. 375 seq.) do not encourage me in thinking seriously of this identification. Another possibility may be looked for in the name Ma'abar, now applying to the coast of Coromandel. This would involve the extension of Chao Ju-kua's Nan-p'i to both the east and west coast of Southern India. Certain analogies in the Chinese and Marco Polo's account seem to support this supposition. The king of Ma'abar, like the ruler of Nan-p'i, wears golden armlets and ankle-rings (cf. Yule, p. 322). Both monarchs take pleasure in surrounding themselves with a large number of fine women, even the number agreeing in the two accounts. According to Marco Polo (Yule, p. 323), the king has \"some five hundred wives\"\u2014\"for whenever he hears of a beautiful damsel he takes her to wife.\" The king of Nan-p'i, besides his five hundred women, had a body-guard of twenty men guarding the royal insignia right and left, while Polo says: \"there are about the king a number of Barons in attendance upon him. These ride with him, and keep always near him,\" etc. We learn from a later Chinese authority that the Nan-p'i caste refrained from eating beef. So Polo says (Yule, p. 325): \"The people are idolaters, and many of them worship the ox, because (they say) it is a creature of such excellence. They would not eat beef for anything in the world, nor would they on any account kill an ox.\"\n\n3 \"Ibn Batuta describes the King of Calicut, the great Zamorin, coming down to the beach to see the wreck of certain junks: his clothing consisted of a great piece of white stuff rolled about him from the navel to the knees, and a little scrap of a turban on his head; his feet were bare, and a young slave carried an umbrella over him.\"\u2014Yule, Marco Polo, 2nd ed., vol. ii, p. 330, note 1.\nchain surrounds his leg. Among the royal insignia there is a standard, adorned with peacocks' feathers, on a pole covered with vermilion, over twenty men guarding it right and left. He is attended by a guard of about five hundred picked foreign\\(^1\\) women, selected for their fine physique: those in the front, leading the way with pantomimes, have cloth wrapped about their bodies, but walk barefoot, using merely a piece of cloth around their loins; those in the rear ride on horses without saddles, their loins are wrapped in cloth, their hair is dressed, and they wear necklaces of real pearls, anklets and foot rings of real gold, their bodies are anointed with camphor and musk mixed with drugs, while umbrellas made of peacocks' feathers protect them against the sun. In front of these dancing women are carried the officers in the king's train, sitting on bags of white foreign cloth, called \"cloth-bag sedans,\" which are lifted on poles plated with gold and silver. In this country there is much sandy soil, and when the king goes out, they first send out an officer with over a hundred soldiers to sprinkle the ground with water to provide against gusts of wind whirling up the dust. The people are very dainty in their diet; they have a hundred ways of cooking their food, which varies every day. There is an official with the title \"Academician\" (Han-lin) who lays the meats and drinks before the king, and sees how much food he consumes; he regulates his diet in order that he may not exceed the proper measure. If perchance the king should fall sick for this reason, then he has to taste his faeces, and treat him according to their being sweet or bitter. The inhabitants of this country are of red-brown complexion; the lobes of their ears hang down to their shoulders. They are skilled in archery, and are good sword and lance men; they love fighting, and sit on elephants when doing so. In battle their heads are wrapped in turbans of coloured silks. They are particularly devout Buddhists. The country is warm, and there is no cold season. Rice, hemp, beans, wheat,\n\n\\(^1\\) fan, \"foreign\"; possibly standing for fan, \"Indian,\" \"Brahmin.\"\nmillet, and edible roots and provisions, are produced in sufficient quantity, and may be had at reasonable prices enough. They cut an alloy of white silver into coins, on which they engrave an official seal; the people use them for purposes of trade. The following products are found in this country: real pearls, all descriptions of foreign cloth, and cotton cloth. There is in this country a river with fresh water, which, at a place where a number of different passages unite, assumes very broad dimensions. By its side there are bold cliffs, on which there are constantly sparks [stars] to be seen. The magic emanating from these hardens into small stones resembling cats' eyes; their colour is clear and transparent; they lie buried in the recesses of the hills, until some day they are washed out by the rush of a flood. The officials at such times send out men in small boats to pick them up. The inhabitants consider them precious stones.\u00b9 The following States are subject to this country,\u00b2 viz.:\n\n1. Ku-lin [in Cantonese: K\u00f2-l\u00e1m = Kulam, Coilom].\n2. Hu-ch'a-la [Guzerat].\n3. Kan-pa-i [Canton: K\u00f2m-pa-y\u00e8t; cf. Yule, Marco Polo, vol. ii, p. 389, note 1: \"Kambayat\"; Cambay].\n4. Pi-li-sha [Barotsch?].\n\n\u00b9 \"The cat's eyes, by the Portuguese called Olhos de Gatos, occur in Zeylon, Cambaya, and Pegu.\"\u2014Baldaeus, Beschreibung der ostindischen K\u00fcsten Malabar und Coromandel: Amsterdam, 1672. S. Yule, Anglo-Indian Glossary, p. 774. Probably neither Ceylon nor Pegu are meant in this passage, but Cambay, which, as we shall see directly, is enumerated as one of the territories belonging to Nan-p'i.\n\n\u00b2 The Chinese text merely contains the following thirty characters, which I have tried to divide and identify as nearly as possible with the limited knowledge of mediaeval India now at my disposal. The characters are:\n\nRegarding the ports on the coast of Malabar during the Middle Ages, see Yule's note devoted to this subject in Cathay, p. 650 seqq.\n5. Ma-lo-hua [Canton: M\u00e1-l\u00f2-u\u00e1=Malwa].\n6. Fung-ya-lo [Amoy: Bang-ga-lo=Mangalor? cf. Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, vol. i, p. 188: Mangarut, Mangalor].\n7. Ma-li-mo [Amoy: Ma-li-bwat=Malabar?].\n8. Tu-nu-ho [Tanore?].\n9. A-li-joh, or A-li-no.\n10. Ngao-lo-lo-ni [Cananor?].\n\nThis country is very far, and the foreign vessels rarely go thither. Shih-lo-pa-chih-li-kan, father and son, belong to this race of people. They now live in the south of the city of Ch\u2018\u00fcan [Chinchew]. The products are carried from this country to Chi-lo-ta-lung [a name which I cannot identify] and San-fo-ch\u2018i [Palembang, Sumatra]; and the following goods are exchanged in barter against them: silks of Ho-ch\u2018ih [Playfair, Cities and Towns of China, No. 2208], porcelain, camphor, rhubarb, huang-lien [rhizoma of Koptis teeta?], cloves, camphor drops, sandalwood, cardamoms, and eagle wood.\n\nThe country of Ku-lin [Kulam, Coilom, Quilon] may be reached from Nan-p\u2018i by ship with the monsoon in five days. It takes a Chinchew junk [ch\u2018\u00fcan-po, i.e. an ocean junk of Ch\u2018\u00fcan-chou-fu] over forty days to arrive at Lan-li [Lambri]; there the winter is spent, and, in the following year, a further journey of a month will take her to this country. The customs of the people are, on the whole, not different from those of the Nan-p\u2018i people. The products consist in cocoa nuts, sapanwood, and a kind of wine made of honey and sugar [mi-t\u2018ang, perhaps syrup] mixed with cocoa nuts and the juice of some flower, the mixture being allowed to ferment.\u00b9 The inhabitants are devoted to archery; when assailing the enemy [or, in battle] they wrap their hair in silken turbans. For trading purposes they use gold and silver coins; twelve silver coins are worth one\n\n\u00b9 This is probably the beverage known as toddy, regarding which see Yule, Anglo-Indian Glossary, p. 706.\ngold coin.\\footnote{The relation between gold and silver, for centuries previous to the discovery of America, was twelve to one. Cf. Yule, \\textit{Cathay}, etc., p. 442.} The country is warm, and has no cold season. Every year ships come to this country from San-fo-ch'i [Palembang, Sumatra], Chien-pi [in Cantonese: Kam-pi, described by Chao Ju-kua as a revolting colony of San-fo-ch'i, with a warlike population, probably Malays, carrying on trade in tin, ivory, and pearls], and Chi-t'o [in Cantonese: Kat-to=Karta?]; and the articles they barter with are the same as in the case of Nan-p'i. The Ta-shih [Arabs] live in great numbers in this country.\\footnote{Coilom is well known as a resort of trade during the Middle Ages up to the time when the Portuguese appeared with ships of deeper draught which could not anchor in its shallow harbour.\u2014Reinaud, \\textit{Relation}, etc., p. lxxiii. According to Reinaud's traveller Soleyman, Coilom was the starting-point in India for the journey to China. Similarly, according to Chao Ju-kua, it was the landing-place in India for those coming from China; for, while junks made the trips from Chinchew to Lambri, and thence direct to Ku-lin (Coilom), it is distinctly said that foreign ships rarely go to Nan-p'i. To arrive in Chu-lien (Orissa), as we shall see further on, the traveller hailing from China had to change ship at Ku-lin (Coilom). This seems to show that China skippers were not in the habit of visiting the coast of Coromandel.} Whenever they have finished taking a bath they anoint their bodies with Y\u00fc-chin [turmeric], as they wish to resemble a Buddha in the gilt appearance of his body.\n\n17. Hu-ch'a-la [Guzerat].\n\nThe country of Hu-ch'a-la [Guzerat] rules over more than a hundred chou [cities]; its [main] city has a four-fold wall. The inhabitants of this country are white and clean-looking. Both men and women have double rings hanging down from holes in their ears; they wear tight clothes, and are wrapped in plain cotton cloth; they wear on their heads white hoods, and on their feet shoes of scarlet leather. They are forbidden to eat flesh. There are four\nthousand Buddhist temple buildings,\\(^1\\) in which there are living over twenty thousand nuns, who, twice every day, sing hymns, while offering food to Buddha or while offering flowers. When offering flowers they bind them into bouquets with cotton thread, of which they use about three hundred catties every day. They have over four hundred war elephants and about 100,000 cavalry horses. When the king goes in or out, he rides on an elephant; on his head he wears a cap [or, crown]. His followers ride on horseback and are armed with swords. The following products are found in this country: indigo in great quantities,\\(^2\\) red kino, myrobalans, and all kinds of foreign cloth. Every year these goods are transported to the Arabian countries for sale.\n\n18. **Ma-lo-hua** [Malwa].\n\nThe country of Ma-lo-hua [Malwa] connects with Hu-ch'a-la [Guzerat]. This country has under it over sixty chou [cities], and it is on the land road [i.e. it does not lie on the sea-coast]. The manner of dressing and the local customs are the same as those of Hu-ch'a-la [Guzerat]. Of products white cloth is very common. Every year 2000 oxen, or more, laden with cloth, are sent along the land road to other countries for barter.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Guzerat was famous for its many temples, most of which were situated on the south-western coast in the territory called Okamandala, which afterwards became the seat of a cruel set of pirates.\u2014Lassen, *Ind. Alterthumsk.*, vol. i, p. 134.\n\n\\(^2\\) Regarding the indigo of Guzerat, see Lassen, *op. cit.*, vol. i, p. 325; and Yule, *Marco Polo*, vol. ii, p. 383.\n19. CHU-LIEN [Orissa, the Empire of the Kesari Dynasty].\n\nThe country of Chu-lien\\(^1\\) is the Southern India of the Western Heaven. In the east it [i.e. its capital, or chief city] is five \\(li\\) distant from the sea; in the west you go to Western India \\([\\text{Hsi T'ien-chu}]\\), 1500 \\(li\\); in the south you go to Lo-lan, 2500 \\(li\\); in the north you go to Tun-t'ien, 3000 \\(li\\). This country has not, from olden times, carried on trade with us. By water you reach Chinchew in about 411,400, or more, \\(li\\).\\(^2\\) If you wish to go to this country, then you must change boat in Ku-lin [Coilom], and thence travel there; some say that from [or, by way of] the country of P'u-kan [Pag\u00e1n] you can also go there. In this country there is a city with a sevenfold wall, the wall being as high as seven Chinese feet, and extending twelve \\(li\\) from north to south, and seven \\(li\\) from east to west; the different walls are a hundred paces distant from each other. Four of these walls are built of brickwork, two of mud, and the one in the centre, of wood, and there are flowers, fruit-trees, and other trees planted [on them]. The first and second walls enclose the dwellings of the people\u2014they are surrounded by small ditches; the third and fourth walls are for the dwellings of court officers; the fifth wall is for the dwellings of the king's four sons; within the sixth wall are the Buddhist [?] monasteries where the various priests dwell; and the seventh wall encloses over four hundred buildings forming the royal palaces where the king lives.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Chu-lien may be a Chinese corruption of the name Chola. Cf. Yule, Anglo-Indian Glossary, p. 199.\n\n\\(^2\\) There must be an error in this statement; if not, the \\(li\\) has here been confounded with a considerably smaller measure.\n\n\\(^3\\) It appears that we possess an unmistakable record regarding this city in the fragments left to us of the history of the Kesari dynasty in India. It must be the ancient capital of that empire. Lassen (op. cit., vol. iv, p. 6), speaking of the events recorded in the history of Orissa, describes a king Jaj\u0101ti, not as the founder, but as the restorer, of the Kesari dynasty, who established his court at\nThere are in all thirty-two divisions [pu-lo, \u90e8\u843d, possibly pura, cities]: of these, twelve are in the west, namely [47 characters, see below]; eight are in the south, namely [38 characters]; twelve are in the north, namely [44\n\nthe city of Djadjapura. Here he built a palace, called Chaturved\u0101ra, because it had four gates. The chief event of Jaj\u0101ti's reign is, according to Lassen, the establishment of the service of a deity called Djagann\u0101tha, whose image had been carried away and concealed and was then recovered. Four images of that deity, including the original one, were brought to Puri, where a new temple was erected for them. \"The entire surroundings of the city,\" Lassen says, \"were devoted to the service of Djagann\u0101tha, or Vishnu, and the maintenance of that temple; and Jaj\u0101ti laid the foundation for the wealth of its priesthood. One of his successors, Lalita Indra Kesari, who ascended the throne in A.D. 617, was the founder of a large and well-defended city in the neighbourhood of the above sanctuary, which was divided into seven quarters and contained thirty-two streets and where the King resided\" (Lassen, l.c., p. 11). I am not able to say whether there is any connection between the \"thirty-two streets of the city\" mentioned by Lassen and the thirty-two pu-lo, or divisions, occurring in our text. These I would under ordinary circumstances consider to be divisions of the country, but I cannot do so in the face of Indian tradition as known to me through Lassen's account, pending an inquiry into the text forming the basis of that account of \"thirty-two streets,\" which Lassen appears to have derived from A. Stirling's \"An Account, Geographical, Statistical, and Historical, of Orissa Proper in Cattack,\" in As. Res. xv, p. 269 seqq., which I have not been able to look up. In the Sung-shih the names of two kings are mentioned who sent embassies with tribute from this country to China, viz.: in A.D. 1033, Shih-li-lo-ch'a-yin-to-lo-chu-lo, which may stand for Sri Raja Indra Chola [or, Andhra Chola]; and again, in A.D. 1077, Ti-wa-ka-lo, which may stand for D\u0113va Kala, or D\u0113va Kara. The last-named king made a good bargain with his colleague on the dragon throne, since the embassy, consisting of 72 men, were given 81,800 strings of copper cash, i.e. about as many dollars, in return for the articles of tribute, comprising glassware, camphor, brocates [called Kimhwa, \u9326\u82b1, in the Chinese text], rhinoceros horns, ivory, incense, rosewater, patchouli, assa foetida, borax, cloves, etc. This so-called embassy was probably, like most of the missions to the coast of China, nothing better than a trading expedition on joint account, the 72 ambassadors being the shareholders, or their supercargoes. It appears that the relations between China and Orissa were not resumed after this expedition, and it is very likely that Chao Ju-kua's chapter on Chu-lien is derived from the account of one of the travellers having reached China during the rule of the Kesari dynasty. Such an account would most probably have been placed on record by one of our author's predecessors in the office of Shih-po, or Superintendent of Trade, at Ch'\u00fcan-chou.\n\n1 The text says \"thirty-one,\" but the enumeration following (12+8+12) shows them to be \"thirty-two.\"\nWhen anyone among the people is guilty\n\nIt may not be quite hopeless to attempt identifying some of these names, whether they represent \"streets,\" \"divisions\" (of the city, or of the country), or \"cities\" (pura). Should they prove to be names of cities, their identification would assist us in gaining some positive knowledge of the political extent of the Kesari empire. The repetition of certain groups of sounds, such as p'u-t'eng (twice, viz. a, 23, 24, and b, 21, 22), which may stand for patam, as an ending in city names, or mung-ka-lan (four times, viz. b, 36, 37, 38; c, 12, 13, 14; c, 21, 22, 23; and c, 42, 43, 44), which may stand for Mangalor, might lead to some interesting discoveries.

At State banquets the king salaams with his four court ministers at the palace steps, and the whole company then engages in instrumental music, hymns, and pantomimes; he eats meat, though he takes no wine, and by the native custom dresses in cotton cloth and eats flour cakes; for his table and escort he employs fully ten thousand female attendants, three thousand of whom are in waiting every day in rotation. When contracting marriage, one first sends a female go-between with a gold and silver finger ring to the bride's house. Three days afterwards there is a meeting of the bridegroom's clan to decide on the amount of land, or cattle, or betel nuts, or wine, and the like, to be given as marriage gifts; and the bride's family sends the gold or silver finger ring, Y\u00fceh-no cloth,\\(^1\\) and the brocaded clothing worn by the bride, to their [intended] son-in-law. In case the man should wish to withdraw from the engagement, he will not dare to reclaim the marriage gifts; but if the girl should wish to reject the man, then she will make double compensation for it.

When they are victorious, their elephants are also granted honorary names to signalize their merit. The inhabitants are hot-tempered and reckless of life; nay, in the presence of the king they will fight man to man with swords, and die without regret. Father and son, elder and younger brothers, will have their meals cooked in separate kettles and served on separate dishes; yet they are deeply alive to family duty. The following articles are produced in the country: pearls, ivory, corals, transparent glass [po-li], betel nuts, cardamoms, opaque glass [lin-li], dyed silk cloth, and cotton cloth. Of quadrupeds, they have goats and oxen; of birds, pheasants and parrots; of fruits, the y\u00fc-kan [a kind of mango: *Spondias amara*], the t'eng-lo [some kind of epidendrum; according to Parker in *China Review*, vol. xix, p. 193: Rattan], dates, cocoa nuts, the kan-lo, the k'un-lun plum, and the jack fruit; of flowers, the white jasmine [18 characters, some of which probably represent Indian, if not Persian, or Arabic, sounds!]; of grain, green and black beans, wheat, and paddy; and the bamboo is indigenous there. In former times they have not sent tribute to our court; but in the eighth year of the period Ta-chung and Hsiang-fu [A.D. 1015] the chief of the country sent an embassy with pearls and the like articles as tribute. The interpreters, in translating their speech, said that they wished to evince the respect of distant people for [Chinese] civilization. They were ordered by Imperial decree to remain in waiting at the side gate of the Palace, and be entertained with a repast by the Associates in the College of Court Annalists. By Imperial favour they were ranked with the envoys from Kuei-tz\u016d [Kutsha in Eastern Turkestan].

The character which Mr. Parker has in *review* is probably \u5a46, so.\nthe Emperor's birthday, and the envoys had a fine opportunity to witness the congratulations in the \"Sacred Enclosure.\" In the tenth year of Hai-ning [A.D. 1077] they sent further tribute of local produce. The Emperor Sh\u00ean-Tsung sent an officer of the Inner Department [a chamberlain, nei-shih], to bid them welcome.\n\nThe remaining countries, Nan-ni-hua-lo, etc., are more than one hundred in number; they are all included under the term Western Heaven.\n\nOf the city which is called Wang-sh\u00ea [lit.

The Huang-hua-hai-ta-chi [\"Record of Imperial Chinese Missions to the West\"] by Chia Tan says: \"To reach T'ien-chu [India] from Annam, there is an overland road by which one may go to this country; yet Ta-mo [Dharma] came floating on the sea to P'an-y\u00fc [Canton], and we may fairly ask whether the sea journey be not more expeditious than that lengthy road overland?\"\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. the embassy mentioned in the Sung-shih. Note on p. 490, above.\n2 Wang-sh\u00ea, lit. Royal Lodge. I believe that our author here confounds the city of Radjagriha, the Wang-sh\u00ea of Buddhistic lore, with the new capital founded in A.D. 989 by Nir\u00fbpa Kesari and named Kataka, the translation of which name is given as \"Royal Residence.\" This is the same city which has given its name to the present province of Cuttack.\u2014Lassen, op. cit., vol. iv, p. 12.\n3 A great geographer of the T'ang dynasty, who lived about A.D. 730 to 805. He was the author of a number of important ethnographical works, none of which appear to have come down to our days. From his biography (T'ang-shu, ch. 166, p. 1 seq.) I conclude that he devoted considerable interest to foreign nations. He drew several maps, among others one entitled Hai-nei-hua-i, i.e. \"Chinese and Foreigners within the Seas\"; and that this was not a mere illustration of ethnographical types, which the word t'u (map, drawing) often denotes, may be concluded from the remark, made in the T'ang-shu, that \"it measured three chang and three chi'h in breadth, and that it was drawn on the scale of 100 li to the inch.\" The geographical section of the bibliographical chapter of the T'ang-shu (ch. 58, p. 32) mentions under his name, besides \"Ten books of Maps\" (Ti-t'u shih chuan), the work quoted by Chao Ju-kua, with a slight variant, placing su (four) for hsi (west) in the title.\n4 Alias Lu Hui-n\u00eang. Cf. R\u00e9myat, \"Sur la succession des trente-trois patriarches de la religion de Bouddha,\" in Mel. Asiat., i. p. 124; Lassen, Ind. Alt., vol. iv, p. 660 seq.; Eitel, s.v. Bodhidharma; Watters, Essays on the Chinese Language, p. 393; Mayers, Manual, No. 428.\nThe capital of the country of Peng-ka-lo [Bengala] in the west is called Ch'a-na-chi. This city is 120 li in circuit. The common people are combative and devoted solely to robbery. They use white cowry shells, ground into shape, as money. The country produces superior double-edged sword-blades, cotton, and other cloth. Some say that the doctrine of Buddha has originated in this country: for, when Hs\u00fcan Chuang, [the Master versed in] the Three Canons, of the T'ang dynasty, fetched the sacred books, he had come to the Western Heaven.\n\nNan-ni-hua-lo [or, Southern Ni-hua-lo].\u2014Its city has a threefold wall; and the inhabitants, in the morning and in the evening, bathe and besmear their bodies with turmeric, thus imitating the golden colour of a Buddha. They are mostly called Po-lo-men [Brahmans], as being genuine descendants of Buddha. The walls of their rooms and the mats they sit on are besmeared with cow-dung, which they look upon as a clean substance. In their houses they erect altars, three Chinese feet in height, which are ascended by three steps, and where they burn incense and offer flowers every day in the morning; this they call the sacrifice to Buddha. When the foreigners of Ta-shih [Arabs, Muhammadans] come to this country, they give them seats outside the doors, and lodge them in separate houses supplied with bedding and mess gear. When a married woman has been guilty of adultery she is killed, and the officials will not ask about it. The country produces first-class putchuck and fine white flowered and spotted cotton cloth. The people eat much kumiss [su-lo, ghee?], rice, beans, and vegetables; they will rarely eat fish or meat. The road leads to the Western Regions [Hsi-y\u00fc]. When there are raids made by the light horsemen from the Western Regions, all the resistance they offer is to lock\n\n---\n\n1 In Cantonese Ch'a-na-kat, which may correspond to some name like Chanagar = Chandernagor?

In their dwellings they use plaster in lieu of tiles. They have walled cities for the people to dwell in. The king dresses in brocaded silk, and his hair is wound into a spiral tuft\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The term *Tien-chu*, usually rendered by India, has a much more limited sense in Buddhist texts than the name thus rendered would suggest. The *Hsiang-chiao-yi-pien*, a well-digested Buddhist cyclopaedia of the Ming dynasty (see my notes regarding it in *Tsung-pao*, vol. vi, p. 318) says (ch. i. p. 4) that \"Bangala [Pang-ko-la] is in the east of T'ien-chu; Chao-no-p'o [Chandernagar?], in the middle; Magadha, in the south; Kapila [Buddha's birthplace in the north of Oudh: Cunningham, *The Ancient Geogr. of India*, p. 414 seqq.], in the west; and Gazma [Ka-she-na], in the north.\" Chao Ju-kua probably excludes the T'ien-chu of Buddhists from his own account, which forms the first part of this chapter, and is followed by a quotation from other sources, in which T'ien-chu is taken in another sense; for *Wu-tien-chu*, \"The Five Indic,\" was well known as a general term for India in the wider sense before Chao Ju-kua. \"Tien-chu is said to be an imitation of the sound Sun-tu or Sh\u00e9n-tu [Sindh], just as Tu-san is said to stand for Tu-fat [Tibet].\" I find this remark in a work published in A.D. 1175, the *Yen-san-lu*, by Ch'\u00eang Ta-ch'\u00eang, a most interesting cyclopaedic collection of miscellanies and by no means the kind of work which Wylie (*Notes on Chinese Lit.*, p. 129) represents it to be.\n\n\\(^2\\) The only interpretation I am able to offer with regard to this remarkable statement is, that at some time or other Nestorian Bishops were regarded \"chiefs of the country.\" With the exception of the Buddhist devotee Lo-hu-na, who called himself a native of T'ien-chu and who, as coming from T'ien-chu, or India, in the wider sense, may not be at all connected with the T'ien-chu here described, nothing occurs in this account which points to Buddhism or which strongly speaks against the assumption that Nestorians are referred to as \"chiefs.\" I am inclined to think that Chao Ju-kua's T'ien-chu refers to the coast of Madras, the legendary burial-place of St. Thomas (see Yule, *Marco Polo*, vol. ii, p. 342 seqq.), to which should be added the adjoining territory described by Marco Polo as the kingdom of Mut\u00e2li. Chao Ju-kua's T'ien-chu produces diamonds: of these Marco Polo says (Yule, vol. ii, p. 347) that \"no other country but this kingdom of Mut\u00e2li produces them.\" Possibly the pieces of tale referred to in the Chinese text as looking like silken gauze have some connection with Polo's \"delicate buckrams\" which look \"like tissue of spider's web.\" Whether a bishop, or some other church authority, was in charge of the St. Thomas Christians, it is most probable that he took his appointment from the Nestorian patriarch as the ecclesiastical \"King of Ta-tsin.\" Cf. *China and the Roman Orient*, p. 284 seqq.\non the top of his head, the remaining hair being cut short. When holding court in the morning he sits on a skin of the T\u00eang [explained as the name of an animal in a gloss of our text, the native dictionaries affording no clue in this matter], adorned with representations of various objects painted with red wax; and his courtiers all do him reverence and pray for his life. When going out he rides on horseback, and his saddle and bridle are thickly set with dark gold [wu-chin, whatever metal this may have been] and silver. His followers, three hundred in number, are armed with spears and swords. His consort wears a gold embroidered scarlet dress with large sleeves. Once in a year she shows herself in public, when a considerable bounty is given to the poor. In the country there is the sacred water which can still wind and waves. The foreign merchants fill glass bottles with it, and when they suddenly get into a rough sea, they still it by sprinkling out this water.\\(^1\\) It is said that,\\(^2\\) during the reign of Hs\u00fcan-wu of the Posterior Wei dynasty [A.D. 500\u2013515], T'ien-chu sent envoys offering large horses. This country produces lions, sables, leopards, camels, rhinoceroses, elephants, tortoise shell, gold, copper, iron, lead, and tin; golden rugs made by weaving gold threads, white cotton cloth, and ta-t\u00eang [rugs P]. There is a stone like talc, but of a reddish colour; when split it is as thin as a cicada's wing; when put together, these pieces look like silken gauze. They have diamonds, resembling fluor spar, which will not melt though a hundred times exposed to the fire; they cut jadestone. There are, further, sandalwood and the like incenses, sugar-cane, sugar-candy [shih-mi],\\(^3\\) and all kinds of fruit.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I am strongly tempted to here suspect an allusion to the use of consecrated water (aqua lustralis), known to the ancient Christians long before the existence of Roman Catholicism.\n\n\\(^2\\) The entire passage following down to the words \"they cut jadestone\" appears with almost the same reading in the T'ung-tien, a work of the eighth century A.D. Altogether Chao Ju-kua's accounts of Ta-ta'in and T'ien-chu are blended with matter occurring in older texts, to which fact the authors of the great Catalogue of the Peking Imperial Library have drawn attention.\n\n\\(^3\\) \"Sucr\u00e9 cristallis\u00e9.\" This is the translation adopted by Julien for the term shih-mi (lit. \"stone honey,\" \"petrified honey\") on the strength of a definition,\nhave trade once every year with Ta-tse'in and Fu-nan [Siam]; they use cowries as a means of exchange. They are clever in jugglery, and know the use of bows and arrows, armour, spears, flying ladders, and mining underground ways [or, tunnels], and also the contrivances of \"the wooden ox\" and \"the gliding horse\" [mu-niu-liu-ma]; yet, they are cowards in battle. They are good astronomers and chronographers, and understand the \"Siddham Rule Books\"...\n\n... [a gap of seven characters follows here in the text, though no gap is mentioned in the corresponding paragraph of the T'ung-tien]. They make paper of the leaves of the Pei-to [Patra] tree. During the periods Ch\u00eang-kuan [A.D.\n\nderived apparently from the ancient work I-wu-chih (P'ei-s\u00ean-y\u00fcn-fu, ch. xciii, p. 72). The I-wu-chih says: \"The juice pressed out of the sugar-cane produced in Chiao-chih [Tungking] is like i-hsing [\"sweet cakes\"], and is called t'ang [i.e. sugar]; when further boiled and exposed to the sun, it may be broken up like bricks, after it has coagulated and crystallized. To eat it, you take it into your mouth and dissolve it. At the time people called it shih-mi.\" This name shih-mi occurs as early as the Hou-han-shu, in the description of India, which involves that sugar-candy was known there during the first centuries of our era. The Hsi-ching-tea-chi, a record of events at the Western capital during the Han dynasty, even mentions that the king of Nan-y\u00fceh presented the emperor Kao-ti [B.C. 206-194] with shih-mi (see Pei-w\u00ean-y\u00fcn-fu, l.c.). Regarding Sugar and Sugar-cane in ancient India, see Lassen, op. cit., vol. i, p. 317 seqq.\n\n1 \"The Wooden Ox\" and \"the Gliding Horse,\" according to the San-kuo-chih (Chu, ch. v, pp. 13 and 15), were contrivances facilitating the transport of provisions invented by the great hero of the third century, Chu-ko Liang. The Chinese attach great value to these inventions, a detailed description of which has been preserved by the scholiast commenting on the passage referred to. I am not able, from a cursory perusal of it, to form a clear idea as to how they were constructed and how they worked.\n\n2 Hsi-tan chang-shu. According to Julien (Hiouen-Thsang, iii, p. 527), the first chapters of a syllabary in twelve chapters attributed to Brahma. Cf. Eitel, Handbook for the Student of Chin. Buddh., s.v. Siddha Vastu. Watters, \"The Shadows of a Pilgrim,\" in China Review, vol. xix, p. 220, shows it to be the beginning of a child's primer, or A B C, the first chapter of which was headed by the word Siddham, forming an auspicious invocation. This may be the primary meaning and would be the orthodox interpretation according to the traditional explanation of this term as found in Buddhist glossaries. Since a gap appears in the text following it, we cannot easily decide what the author was going to say. His speaking of the astronomical achievements of the Hindus, however, seems to suggest that by the term Hai-tan (=Siddh\u00e2nta) the astronomical literature is referred to. Alberini (Sachau, vol. i, p. 153) says: \"The book known among Muslims as Sindhind is called by them Siddh\u00e2nta, i.e. straight, not crooked nor changing. By this name they call every standard book on astronomy, even such books as, according to our opinion, do not come up to the mark of our so-called Zij, i.e. handbooks of mathematical astronomy. They have five Siddh\u00e2ntas,\" etc. Lassen (op. cit., vol. iv, p. 621) calls the Siddh\u00e2nta \"ein Lehrbuch, in dem ein wissenschaftliches System durch Gr\u00fcnde bewiesen wird, besonders ein astronomisches.\"\n627\u2013650] and T'ien-shou [A.D. 690\u2013692] of the T'ang dynasty they have sent envoys with tribute. At the time of Yung-hsi [A.D. 984\u2013988], a Buddhist devotee, by name Lo-hu-na, arrived here by sea; he called himself a native of T'ien-chu [India]. The foreign merchants [fan-shang, who must have been Buddhists; possibly Chinese merchants trading to foreign countries, if not Indians, Ceylonese, etc., since Muhammadans would not build a Buddhist temple], considering him a foreign priest [hu-seng], vied with each other in presenting him with gold, silks, jewels, and precious stones; but the devotee was not in want of these himself. He invested the presents thus received in the purchase of a piece of ground, on which he built a Buddhist temple; it stood in the southern suburb of Ch'\u00fcan [Chinchew], and the present Pao-lin-y\u00fcan [Monastery] is identical with it.\n\n(b) Extracts from Part II: Articles of Trade.\n\n1. Camphor.\n\nCamphor comes from P'u-ni [Brni, Borneo], according to some Fo-ni; it also comes from the country of Pin-su.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Pin-su, in Cantonese Pan-sok, the latter form representing the sound PansoR; for, since I had shown (\"Chinese Equivalents of the letter R in foreign names\" in Journ. of the China Br. Roy. As. Soc., vol. xxi, p. 220) that final n and final t were employed in Ancient Chinese transcriptions to represent final r in foreign names, M. Terrien de Lacouperie added k and p to the number of Chinese finals which can take the place of final r (see \"The Djurtchen of Mandaburia,\" in Journ. Roy. As. Soc., Vol. XXI, p. 442). Although this name Pansur is not mentioned anywhere else by our author, I do not hesitate to identify it with the country distinctly described as a producer of camphor under the name Fansur by Arab and other mediaeval writers. \"The camphor al-fansiri is mentioned as early as by Avicenna, and by Marco Polo, and came from a place called Pansir in Sumatra, perhaps the same as Barus, which has now long given its name to the costly Sumatra drug.\"\u2014Yule, Anglo-Indian Glossary, p. 116. The name Fansir is first mentioned by Mas'udi (about A.D. 940) and Abu Seyd (Reinaud, Relation, etc., vol. i, p. 7: fansir). Marco Polo describes a kingdom of Fansur which produces camphor. Chao Ju-kua was apparently not aware that this country of Pin-su (Pansur, or Fansur) and his San-fo-ch'i were situated on the same island; and he may be correct, in a certain sense, in maintaining that in San-fo-ch'i (Palembang) itself the drug was not produced, but merely imported for re-shipment. This passage need not, therefore, involve the exclusion of the camphor industry from Sumatra. Regarding the Fansur question and its literature, see Yule, Marco Polo, vol. ii, p. 235 seqq.\nThe common report that it is also found in San-fo-ch'i [Palembang, Sumatra] is an error; the fact is merely this\u2014that, owing to this country being an important thoroughfare for the traffic of all foreign nations, the produce of all other countries is intercepted and kept in store there for trade with foreign ships. The camphor-tree is like the pine-tree [shan]; it grows in the depths of the hills and the remotest valleys. So long as branches and trunk continue unhurt, the tree will contain the resin even for hundreds and thousands of years; otherwise it will evaporate. When the natives enter the hills, in order to gather the camphor, they must go in troops of several tens of men; they are provided with clothes made of trees' bark [or, fibre] and supplies of sha-hu [Sago] for grain. They go in different directions, and whenever they meet any camphor-trees, they fell with a hatchet and mark as many as ten, or more; they then cut these into lengths and distribute them equally, and each cuts into planks his share; these boards, again, they crack along the side and cross-wise so as to produce chinks, and the camphor collecting in these chinks is got out by forcing a wedge into them. The camphor which forms crystals is called Mei-hua-nao [lit. Plum Flower Camphor], because it resembles the plum flower; an inferior quality is called Chin-ch'iao-nao [lit. Gold Foot Camphor]; broken bits are called Mi-nao [lit. Rice-grain Camphor]; when these are mixed up with splinters, it is called Ts'ang-nao [lit. Granary Camphor]; the wooden boards, after all the camphor has been removed from them, are called Nao-cha [lit. Camphor Slips]. Nowadays people break these boards into small bits and mix them with sawdust, which mixture they place in a vessel of porcelain, covered by another vessel, the openings being hermetically closed; when roasted in hot ashes, the vapour formed by the mixture condenses and forms lumps, which are called Ch\u00fc-nao [lit. Collected Camphor]; it is used for women's head ornaments and the like purposes. There is further an oily sort of camphor called Nao-yu [lit. Camphor Oil], which is of a strong\nand stringent aroma; but it will do for moistening incense, or mixing with oil.\n\n2. Frankincense.\n\nJu-hsiang [Gum Olibanum], also called Hs\u00fcn-lu-hsiang,\u00b9 is produced in the three Ta-shih [Arabian] countries of Ma-lo-pa [Merbot], Shih-ho [Sheher], and Nu-fa [Dhofar],\u00b2 in the depths of the remotest mountain valleys. The tree which yields this drug may on the whole be compared to the Yung [Banian].\u00b3 Its trunk is chopped with a hatchet, upon which the resin flows out, and when hardened, turns into incense, which is gathered and made into lumps. It is transported on elephants to the Ta-shih [Arabs]; the Ta-shih [Arabs] load it upon their ships for barter against other goods in San-fo-ch'i [Palembang, Sumatra]; and it is for this reason that the incense is commonly collected at San-fo-ch'i. When the foreign merchants come to that place to trade, the Customs authorities, in accordance with the relative strength of its fragrance, distinguish thirteen classes of incense. Of these, the very best is called Chien-hsiang, or \u201cPicked Incense\u201d: it is round and of the size of the top of a finger; which is commonly called Ti-ju [lit. \u201cDripping Milk,\u201d \u201cDripping Incense\u201d]. The second quality is called P'ing-ju [lit. \u201cPotted Milk\u201d], and its colour is inferior to that of the \u201cPicked Incense.\u201d The next quality is called P'ing-hsiang [lit. \u201cPotted Incense\u201d]; they say, because, owing to its being prized so much at the time of gathering, it is placed in pots [vases, or jars\u2014p'ing].\n\n\u00b9 This word Hs\u00fcn-lu [old sound: hun-luk] I look upon as the Chinese equivalent of Turkish ghyunluk, \u201cfrankincense,\u201d though I am not prepared to say whether the Chinese have got this word from the Turks, or vice versa. Cf. China and the Roman Orient, p. 266 seq.\n\n\u00b2 Regarding the identification of these three names, see my Die L\u00e4nder des Islam, etc., p. 21, note 3, and p. 27 note 1; also Professor de Goeje\u2019s remarks on p. 58.\n\n\u00b3 From a passage in the Hsiang-p'u, a later work on incense, where the same sense is reproduced in almost identical words, I conclude that yung (Banian) is a misprint for sung (a pine-tree), the two characters being easily confounded. The passage referred to is quoted in the Pen-ts'ao-kang-mu, ch. xxxiv, p. 48.\nOf this last kind three further qualities, viz., superior, middling, and inferior, are distinguished. The next quality is called Tai-hsiang [lit. \"Bag Incense\"]; they say, because, at the time of gathering, it is merely put into bags; it is also divided into three qualities, like the P'ing-hsiang. The next kind is the Ju-t'a, because it consists of incense mixed with gravel. The next kind is the Hei-t'a, because its colour is black. The next kind is the Shui-shih-hei-t'a, because it consists of incense which has been water-damaged while on board ship, the aroma having turned and the colour having spoiled. Incense mixed of various qualities and consisting of broken pieces is called Ch'\u00ea-hsiao [lit. \"Cut-up\"]; when passed through a sieve and thus made into dust, it is called Ch'an-mo [i.e. \"Dust\"]. The above are the differences in the incense.\n\n3. Myrrh.\n\nMo-yao [Myrrh] comes from the country of Ma-lo-mo [probably another transcription for Merbot] in Ta-shih [Arabia]. The tree resembles in height and size the pine-tree [sung] of China; its bark is one or two inches thick. At the time of gathering the incense, they first dig a hole in the ground at the foot of the tree, and then cut the bark open with a hatchet, upon which the juice runs down into the hole for fully ten days, when it is taken.\n\n4. Dragon's Blood.\n\nHs\u00fceh-chieh [Dragon's Blood] also comes from the Ta-shih [Arabian] countries. This tree is somewhat like the myrrh-\n\n---\n\n1 Mo-yao, lit. Mo Medicine. The word mo, pronounced m\u00f2i in Cantonese, is a transcription for Arabic mur, myrrh.\n2 According to Part I, from the country of Chung-li, some Arab colony on the east coast of Africa. Cf. Die L\u00e4nder des Islam, etc., p. 39. I had endeavoured to identify this country with that of the Somali as adjoining Berbers (Pi-pa-lo); but Prof. de Goeje may be right in suggesting Socotra as the producer of Dragon's Blood. Probably the name Chung-li embraces the Somali coast with Socotra, the term shan, which I first translated by Gebirge, referring to an island here.\ntree, except that its leaves are rather different in size from those of the latter; the manner of gathering is also alike. There is a kind which is smooth like the surface of a mirror; in this case the tree is old, so that the juice flows out spontaneously, without being touched by the hatchet; this is the best quality. Incense which contains an admixture of bits of wood is made of the juice of the lakawood-tree, and is commonly called \"Imitation Dragon's Blood.\"\n\n6. DAMMAR.\n\nTu-nao-hsiang [dhuna, Dammar] comes from the country of Ch\u00ean-la [Kambodja]: it is the exsudation of a tree which resembles the pine and juniper family in shape; but the incense lies concealed in the bark. When the tree is old, it runs out spontaneously, as a white and lustrous resin, which just for this reason does not melt, though the summer heat may be at its height, and which is called the tu-nao [dhuna]. If, in the summer months, the trunk of the tree be scorched by a fire kept burning around it, this will cause the fluid resin again to flow out freely, so that it may be gathered during the winter, when it hardens; for, this incense is liquid in the summer, and hardens during the winter; it is called \"black tu-nao.\" The natives fill with it gourds [p'iao], and the shippers afterwards transfer it into porcelain vessels. The flavour of this incense is pure and lasting; the black variety easily melts and leaks through the gourd; but by breaking the gourd and exposing it to the fire, one may obtain something similar to the original substance. This is the article now called Tu-nao-p'iao.\n\n23. THE COCOA NUT.\n\nThe appearance of the Cocoa Nut [yeh-tsz\u00fc], as regards trunk and leaves, resembles that of the Tsung [the Chamaerops Fortunei, Lindl., known as the Chinese Coir-tree] and Areca\nPalms. The fruit grows on the leaf in bunches of several nuts of the size of a vessel holding five pints [sh\u0113ng]. It is the biggest of fruits, with the sole exception of the Jack Fruit. When cut the outer skin is at first green and tender, but after some time it turns yellow, and when kept a long time the skin shrivels and dries up. The nut shell contained in the outer skin can be made into vessels; the pulp inside the shell is of a jadelike white, and of an agreeable taste, resembling that of cow\u2019s milk. The juice [lit. wine] inside the pulp is extremely clear and fragrant when fresh; but when old, it turns muddy and is no longer drinkable. In the states of Nan-p\u2019i [Malabar] they make wine [toddy] out of the juice of its flower mixed with honey and sugar.\n\n30. Pepper.\n\nPepper comes from the following places in Sh\u00ea-p\u2019o [Java], viz.: Su-chi-tan [Sukitan, East Java], Ta-pan [Tuban], Pai-hua-y\u00fcan [Pajajaran?], Ma-tung [Madang?], and Jung-ya-lu [Jangola]; but the pepper coming from Hsin-t\u2019o [Sunda] is the best; the Ta-pan [Tuban] variety takes the second place. Pepper grows in the uncultivated wilds, and the villages in the country [here the text is interrupted] . . . . . the Chinese vine grape. The natives grow it on frames made of bamboo or other wood. [Here the text is again interrupted.] The flower opens . . . . [probably in the season specified in the preceding gap], and in the fourth moon the fruit ripens. The flower resembles the tail of a phoenix [f\u0113ng-wei, probably the flower so-called], and is blue and red in colour. The grains are gathered in the fifth moon [about June], dried in the sun, and stored in godowns, whence they are given out in the following year, carts drawn by oxen being used to transport them to the place of barter. The grain cannot stand the sun, but will endure rain; therefore, crops are but poor after dry weather, whereas heavy rainfalls may double the ordinary\nsize of the harvest. Some say that most of the pepper is grown in the country of Wu-li-pa [in Cantonese M\u00f2-li-pat = Malabar], in Nan-p'i, and that the produce bought by the foreign traders in Sh\u00ea-p'o [Java] comes from Wu-li-pa [Malabar].\u00b9\n\n32. Asa Foetida.\n\nAsa Foetida [a-wei] comes from the country of Mu-ch\u00fc-lan [in Cantonese Muk-k\u00fc-lam = Mekram], in Ta-shih [Arabia]. The tree is not a very high or large one, but the resin exudes freely from its bark. The natives wind a piece of string round a twig, remove its tip, and cover it with a bamboo tube, which fills with resin. This bamboo tube is broken up in the winter, when the resin is gathered and packed in skin bags. Some say that this resin is so poisonous that people do not dare to come near it themselves, but, when the drug has to be gathered, tie a sheep up at the foot of the tree and shoot arrows at the latter from a distance. The poison of the resin then drops upon the sheep, which dies of it, and its decayed flesh turns into Asa foetida. I do not know which of the two accounts is correct; meanwhile they are here both placed on record.\n\n\u00b9 The last paragraph is added to the text in two rows of small characters, and may possibly be a gloss added by another hand. It is certainly remarkable that Chao Ju-kua omits pepper among the products of Nan-p'i. In his description of Sh\u00ea-p'o, on the other hand, pepper appears named among other products, besides a special note, which says: \"There is vast store of pepper of these foreign countries, and the merchant ships, from the manifold profit they derive from that trade, are in the habit of smuggling copper cash for bartering purposes. Our Court has repeatedly interdicted all trade [with Sh\u00ea-p'o, Java]; but foreign merchants deceitfully changed its name into that of Sukitan.\" Under the head of \"Sukitan\" our author says: \"Pepper grows there in great abundance. In the proper season and in good years twenty-five taels of trade silver will buy from ten to twenty packages of pepper, each package holding fifty pecks [sh\u0113ng, equal to about an English pint]; in years of dearth, or in times of disturbance, the same sum will fetch only half that amount. The pepper-gatherers suffer much from the acrid fumes they have to inhale and are commonly afflicted with headache [malaria?], which will yield to doses of the Hsiung medicine of Szechuen [Ch'uan-hsiung, a species of Levisticum, also mentioned among the Chinese articles imported in Sh\u00ea-p'o, or Java].\" Under Hsin-t'o [Sunda] we learn that \"the pepper produced in the hills is small-grained, but heavy, and superior to that of Ta-pan [Tuban].\"\n42. Kingfishers' Feathers.\n\nKingfishers' Feathers are got in great quantities in Ch\u00ean-la [Kambodja], where they are produced in nests built by the side of lakes [or, ponds] in the depth of the hills. Each pool [pond, gully, etc.] serves as an abode for just a male and a female bird; the intrusion of a third bird always ends in a duel to the death. The natives take advantage of this peculiarity, rear a decoy bird, and walk about with it sitting on the left hand raised. The birds in their nests, on noticing the intruder, make for the hand and fight it, quite ignoring the presence of the man, who, with his right hand, covers them with a net and thus makes them prisoners without fail. The river Ku in Yung-chow\u00b9 is the habitat of a bird called Jung-ts'ui [lit. \"the downy Kingfisher\"], covered with a down of blue feathers all over the back, which is used by luxurious people as an ornament, the feathers being twisted and woven into each other so as to resemble wool satin. Although, of late years, the use of this luxury has been strictly forbidden by the mandarins, the better classes still continue to add it to their dress, for which reason the foreign merchants, defying the law, mostly smuggle it by concealing it in the cotton lining of their clothes.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Yung-chou Ku-chiang. Yung-chou is the name used during the T'ang and Sung dynasties for the present prefecture of Nan-ning in Kuangsi (Playfair, Cities and Towns of China, Nos. 5116 and 3076). The Ku River is a tributary of the Y\u00fc-chiang, the navigable southern affluent of the West River, or Sikiang, which had been mistaken for the West River itself by Mr. Michael Moss in his \"Narrative\" of an expedition on that river, as I have shown in a paper on \"The West River, or Sikiang\" in vol. iii (1874) of the China Review. The Ku River is described as flowing ten li east of the Nan-ning city (Nan-ning-fu-chih, quoted in the T'u-shu-chi-ch'\u00eang, sect. 6, ch. 1242).\n\n\u00b2 The Sung-shih, in its chapter on official dress (ch. 153, p. 10), contains a list of dress materials presented to the various grades of higher officials by the emperor. In the year A.D. 963, according to this list, officials of certain grades, among which the huang-ch'iin chu-s\u00fc fu-shih, i.e. the Imperial Commissioners and Assistant-Commissioners related to the Imperial family, are included, were to be presented each with a \"fine brocade of kingfishers' feathers.\" Our author, being one of the class concerned in this bounty, is sure to have been well informed on whatever regulations were connected with it. It is, therefore, of some importance to know that, in the year A.D. 1107, this liberality was stopped by the Emperor Hui Tsung as far as Kingfishers' feathers were\nconcerned. \"The ancient rulers,\" the Emperor says, alluding no doubt to the famous example set by King T'ang, the founder of the Shang dynasty, \"in their government measures, extended the principle of humanity to plants, trees, birds, and beasts: now the depriving of living creatures of their life, in order to obtain their plumage for quite an unnecessary purpose, is certainly not worthy of the kindness extended by the early rulers to all creatures. I, therefore, order the officials to stop the practice on pain of punishment.\" (Sung-shih, l.e., p. 16.) This is an early instance of a movement which has been resumed in our days by the societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals in condemning the practice of adorning ladies' bonnets with the plumage of birds killed for the purpose.\nART. XIII.\u2014The Army of the Indian Moghuls: Its Organisation and Administration. By William Irvine, late Bengal Civil Service.\n\nIn 1894 I began the preparatory studies for an account of the later Indian Moghul system of government and administration in all its branches, being impelled by the belief that some information of the kind was a necessary introduction to a History of that period, which I had previously planned and commenced. Before I had done more than sketch out my first part, which deals with the Sovereign, the Court Ceremonial, and the elaborate system of Entitlature, I noticed the issue of a book on a part of my subject by Dr. Paul Horn.\u00b9 The perusal of this excellent work diverted my attention to a later section of my proposed Introduction, the subject of the Army and Army Organization; and in this way I have been led to write this portion before any of the others. Except incidentally, my paper is neither a translation nor a review of Dr. Horn\u2019s essay; and though indebted to him, as acknowledged from time to time, my study covers, in the main, quite different ground, forming a complement to what he has done, and, as I think, carrying the subject a good deal farther in several directions. Dr. Horn seems to have read chiefly the authorities for the period before Aurangzeb \u2018\u0100lamg\u012br; while my reading has been confined in great measure to the reigns of Aurangzeb\u2019s successors in the period 1707\u20131803. The sources upon which we draw are thus almost entirely independent of each other; and I hope that my contribution to this rather obscure corner of Indian\n\n\u00b9\u201cDas Heer- und Kriegswesen der Gross-Moghuls,\u201d by Dr. Paul Horn, Privat-Dozent an der Universit\u00e4t Strassburg, 8vo, pp. 160. (E. J. Brill: Leiden, 1891.)\nhistory may not be thought inferior in interest to that of my predecessor. The paper which follows gives the first eight of the twenty-five sections into which I have divided my subject.\n\nII. COMMISSIONED RANK AND MODE OF RECRUITING.\n\nFew soldiers were entertained directly by the emperor himself; and for the most part the men entered first the service of some chief or leader. These chiefs were ranked according to the number of men that they had raised or were expected to raise. In this way originated the system of *mansab*, first introduced by Akbar (*Ajin*, i, 237). This mode of recruiting the army through the officers, renders it necessary to begin by a statement of the manner in which the officers themselves were appointed and graded.\n\n*Mansab* was not a term confined solely to the military service; every man in State employ above the position of a common soldier or messenger, whatever the nature of his duties, civil or military, obtained a *mansab*. In fact, there were for all grades, except the very lowest, only two modes of obtaining support from State funds: a man must either enter its active service, as the holder of a *mansab*, or he must petition for a *madad-i-mu'\u0101sh* (literally, \"help to live\"), on the ground of being a student of the holy books, an attendant on a mosque (*mutawalli* or *kh\u0101dim*), a man of learning and religious life (*darvesh*), a local judge (*k\u0101\u1e93i*), or an expounder of the Mahomedan law (*muft\u012b*).\n\nThe word *mansab* is literally (*Dast\u016br-ul-Insh\u0101*, p. 233) \"the place where anything is put or erected\" (*na\u1e63b kardan*, to place, fix, appoint); and then, as a secondary meaning, the state or condition of holding a place, dignity, or office. It seems to have been in use in Central Asia before the Moghuls descended into Hind\u016bst\u0101n; and Ross translates it by the vaguer term \"privileges.\"\u2014*T\u0101rikh-i-Rashid\u012b*, 103. This word *mansab* I represent by the word *rank*, as its object was to settle precedence and fix gradation of pay; it did not\nnecessarily imply the exercise of any particular office, and meant nothing beyond the fact that the holder was in the employment of the State, and bound in return to yield certain services when called upon.\n\nThe highest mansab that could be held by a subject, not of the royal house, was that of commander of 7000 men, though in the later and more degenerate times we find a few instances of promotion to 8000 or even 9000. The mansab of a prince ranged from 7000 up to 50,000, and even higher (Mir\u00e2t-ul-Istil\u00e2h, fol. 35). In the \u0100jin-i-Akbari (Blochmann, 248, 249) sixty-six grades are stated, beginning at commanders of 10,000, and ending at those set over ten men. Even at that earlier period there seem to have been only thirty-three of these grades in actual existence (Blochmann, 238). All the later authorities agree in holding that the lowest officer's mansab was that of twenty men; and these writers record, I find, no more than twenty-seven grades, beginning with that of 7000 and ending with that of twenty. In the earlier days of the dynasty, rank was granted with a niggard hand. In Akbar's time the highest rank was for long that of 5000, and it was only towards the end of his reign that a few men were promoted to 7000, while many officers exercised important commands although holding a comparatively low mansab. The great accession of territory in the Dakhin and the incessant wars connected with these acquisitions may account in part for the increase in the number and amount of mansabs granted by Sh\u00e2hjah\u00e2n and '\u0100lamg\u00eer. But the relative value of rank was thereby much depreciated; and the author of the Ma'asir-ul-Umar\u00e2 (i., 8), while considering Akbar's officers of 500 rank of sufficient importance to deserve separate biographies, contents himself in the later reigns with going no lower than those of 7000 or 5000, men below those ranks being too numerous and too insignificant to call for detailed mention.\n\nThe steps of promotion altered as the officer rose in grade. The usual gradation was as follows (Mir\u00e2t, B.M. 1813, fol. 35; Dast\u00fbr-ul-'Aml, B.M. 1641, fol. 44b):\u2014\nFrom 20 to 100 each rise was by 20\n,, 100 to 400 ,, ,, 50\n,, 400 to 1000 ,, ,, 100\n,, 1000 to 4000 ,, ,, 500\n,, 4000 to 7000 ,, ,, 1000\n\nThere is a slight discrepancy between this table and the facts as we find them in practice. It ought to be amended thus:\n\nFrom 20 to 60 a man rose by 10 each time\n,, 60 to 100 ,, ,, 20 ,,,\n\nOtherwise we should exclude the rank of 50, which was common enough. Again, we find in many tables no ranks of 250 or 350, although both of these are required to accord with the above scheme of promotion.\n\nWe also find mention in the historians of ranks which do not appear in the above scheme of grades. For instance, in D\u0101nishmand Kh\u0101n\u2019s Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101hn\u0101mah (fol. 41b, 56a) we find men appointed to 1200 and 2900, grades which do not fit in with the scheme given above, nor do these grades appear in the pay-table, copied from the official manuals, which we give a little further on.\n\nAs an additional distinction, it was the custom to tack on to a mans\u0101b a number of extra horsemen. To distinguish between the two kinds of rank, the original mans\u0101b, which governed the personal allowances, was known as the z\u0101t rank (z\u0101t = body, person, self), and the additional men were designated by the word suw\u0101r (= horseman). Thus a man would be styled \u201c2500 z\u0101t, 1000 suw\u0101r.\u201d It is said (Mir\u0101t, fol. 35) that men below 500 never had suw\u0101r added to their rank; but this is not borne out by what we find in actual practice. For instance, Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad (T\u0101zikrah, I.O.L. No. 50, fol. 96a) was in Rabi\u2018 II, 1119 H., made 400, 50 horse, and his younger brother 300, 30 horse. There are also instances in D\u0101nishmand Kh\u0101n of 150, 50 horse; 300, 10 horse; 300, 20 horse; 300, 80 horse; 400, 40 horse; and so on. In fact, unless this had been the case, it would be impossible to divide the ranks below 500 into\nfirst, second, and third grade, as was actually done. This division into grades we now proceed to describe.\n\nOn the distribution of rank into z\u0101t and suw\u0101r was founded a classification into first, second, and third class mansabs, by which the scale of z\u0101t pay was reduced proportionately. From this classification were exempted officers above 5000 z\u0101t; these were all of one class. From 5000 downwards, an officer was First Class, if his rank in z\u0101t and suw\u0101r were equal; Second Class, if his suw\u0101r was half his z\u0101t rank; Third Class, if the suw\u0101r were less than half the z\u0101t, or there were no suw\u0101r at all (Dast\u016br-ul-Insh\u0101, 222). I think that here Blochmann (\u0100in, i, 238, lines 5 and foll.) obscures the subject by using \"contingent\" as the equivalent of suw\u0101r, instead of leaving the untranslated original word to express a technical meaning.\n\nPay was reckoned in a money of account called a d\u0101m, of which forty went to the rupee. There were also coins called d\u0101ms; but the d\u0101ms of account, bearing a fixed ratio to the rupee, must be distinguished as a different thing from the coin, though called by the same name. Here Dr. Horn, 16, is of opinion that the reckoning was made in such a small unit as the $\\frac{1}{40}$ of a rupee, less to make a grand show with big figures than because the value of the rupee varied. On this head I am of exactly the opposite opinion, for I think that the principal, if not the only object, was to swell the totals and make the pay sound bigger than it really was. That spirit runs through everything done in the East, at any rate in the Indian portion of it, as could easily be shown were it worth while to labour the point further. As for the second reason, I have considered it as well as I am able, not being a currency expert; and it seems to me that with a fixed ratio between the two coins, it was a matter of indifference to the receiver of pay whether the amount was stated in the one or in the other unit of value. The two units being tied together by the fixed ratio, and the disbursements being in fact made (as we know) in rupees, the payee suffered, or did not suffer, equally by either mode of calculation.\nIn the following table, which shows all the mans\u0101bs with their pay according to class, I have reduced the d\u0101m to rupees, as being simpler and more readily intelligible. In the present day, this reckoning by d\u0101ms has quite disappeared. When reading this table of pay, which shows the sanctioned allowances for a year of twelve months, it must be remembered that few of the officers received the whole twelve-months' pay, the number of months' pay sanctioned per annum ranging from four to twelve. Officers were also supposed to keep up an establishment of elephants and draught cattle. Apparently they were also liable to pay a fixed quota of their own allowances towards the expenses of the Emperor's elephants and cattle, an item known as kh\u016br\u0101k-i-daw\u0101bb, feed of four-footed animals. There were other petty deductions.\n\n**TABLE OF MAN\u015eAB-I-Z\u0100T WITH YEARLY PAY IN RUPEES.**\n\n| Rank (Man\u015fab-i-z\u0101t) | Yearly Pay in Rupees |\n|---------------------|----------------------|\n|                     | First Class. | Second Class. | Third Class. |\n| 1                   | 7000         | 350,000       | \u2014            |\n| 2                   | 6000         | 300,000       | \u2014            |\n| 3                   | 5000         | 250,000       | 242,500      |\n| 4                   | 4500         | 225,000       | 217,500      |\n| 5                   | 4000         | 200,000       | 192,500      |\n| 6                   | 3500         | 175,000       | 167,500      |\n| 7                   | 3000         | 150,000       | 142,500      |\n| 8                   | 2500         | 125,000       | 117,500      |\n| 9                   | 2000         | 100,000       | 92,500       |\n| 10                  | 1500         | 75,000        | 67,500       |\n| 11                  | 1000         | 50,000        | 47,500       |\n| 12                  | 900          | 37,500        | 36,250       |\n| 13                  | 800          | 31,250        | 30,000       |\n| 14                  | 700          | 27,500        | 26,250       |\n| 15                  | 600          | 23,750        | 22,500       |\n| 16                  | 500          | 20,000        | 18,750       |\n| 17                  | 400          | 12,500        | 12,000       |\n| 18                  | 300          | 10,000        | 9500         |\n| 19                  | 200          | 7500          | 7000         |\n| 20                  | 150          | 6250          | 6750         |\n| 21                  | 100          | 5000          | 4500         |\n| 22                  | 80           | 3500          | 3250         |\n| 23                  | 60           | 2500          | 2375         |\n| 24                  | 50           | 2125          | 2000         |\n| 25                  | 40           | 1750          | 1625         |\n| 26                  | 30           | 1375          | 1250         |\n| 27                  | 20           | 1000          | 875          |\n(Dast\u00fcr-ul-'Aml, B.M. No. 1641, fol. 44b, id. B.M. No. 1690, fol. 173b, Dast\u00fcr-ul-Insh\u0101, p. 234.) The rates of pay in Akbar's reign, as given in the last column of Blochmann's table (\u0100jin, i, 248), were much higher than the above, which refers to '\u0100lamg\u012br's time and later. It will be noticed that the difference of pay between first, second, and third class is as follows:\n\n| From   | To     | Pay          |\n|--------|--------|--------------|\n| 20     | 60     | 5,000 D\u0101m, or Rs. 125 yearly. |\n| For    | 80     | 10,000 ,,    | 250 ,, |\n| From   | 100    | 20,000 ,,    | 500 ,, |\n| For    | 1000   | 100,000 ,,   | 2500 ,, |\n| From   | 1500   | 300,000 ,,   | 7500 ,, |\n\n(B.M. 6599, fol. 144b).\n\nIn addition to the simple division by man\u1e63ab alone, there was also a grouping of officers into three classes. From 20 to 400 they were merely \"officers with rank\" (man\u1e63abd\u0101r); from 500 to 2500 they were Nobles\u2014Blochmann, i, 535 (\u0100mir, pl. Umar\u0101, origin of our form \"Omrah\"); from 3000 to 7000 they were Great Nobles (\u0100mir-i-A\u02bf\u1e93am, pl. 'Uzz\u0101m, Umar\u0101-i-kib\u0101r (Blochmann, i, 529, note), or Pillars ('Umdah). All man\u1e63abd\u0101rs were kept on one or other of two lists: (1) \u1e24\u0101zir-i-rik\u0101b, present at Court; (2) Ta\u02bfin\u0101t, on duty elsewhere.\n\nSuw\u0101r Rank.\u2014The grant of suw\u0101r in addition to z\u0101t rank was an honour. Dr. Paul Horn, 15, supposes, however, that these horsemen were paid out of the z\u0101t allowances. In that case a man who had no suw\u0101r would be better paid than another who was honoured with the addition of suw\u0101r to his z\u0101t rank. Naturally Dr. Horn, 16, holds that this \"eigentlich nicht recht glaublich ist.\" He is quite right in his conjecture. The explanation is, that the table of pay in Blochmann, i, 248, and that given above, are exclusively for the z\u0101t rank, from which money the officer had to maintain his transport, his household, and some horsemen. For the suw\u0101r rank there was a separate table, pay for these horsemen being disbursed under the name of\nthe T\u0101bin\u0101n. As Orme says (\"Hist. Frag.\", 418), the officer raising the troops was responsible for the behaviour of his men; he therefore brought men of his own family or such as he could depend on.\n\nT\u0101bin\u0101n.\u2014Blochmann, i, 242, note 1, who, apparently, translates this word as well as suw\u0101r by \"contingent,\" derives it from the Arabic t\u0101bin, one who follows.\u00b9 The books (B.M. 1641, fol. 46b, B.M. 6599, 144b and 148b) give a long table setting forth their pay in d\u0101ms, beginning with that for five horsemen and ending with that for 40,000, but as the basis for calculation remains the same throughout, it is sufficient here to work out the pay for one horseman. For five horsemen, then, 40,000 d\u0101ms a year were allowed. That would be 8000 d\u0101ms for one man; and this sum in d\u0101ms yields Rs. 200 a year (at the fixed rate of 40 d\u0101ms to the rupee), or Rs. 16 10a. 8p. per man per mensem. Bernier, 217, states the rate as somewhat higher\u2014\"he that keeps one horse shall not receive less than 25 rupees a month.\" For this sum, of course, the man provided his own horse and armour, and paid for his own and his horse's keep. One Dast\u016br-ul-'Aml, B.M. 6599, fol. 144b, tells us that the number of horses to men among the troopers (t\u0101bin\u0101n-i-bar\u0101dari) was according to the rule of dah-bist (lit. \"ten-twenty\"), meaning apparently that the total number of horses was double that of the number of men. The scale was as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n3 \\text{ three-horsed men} &= 9 \\text{ horses} \\\\\n4 \\text{ two-horsed men} &= 8 \\text{ horses} \\\\\n3 \\text{ one-horsed men} &= 3 \\text{ horses} \\\\\n10 \\text{ men} &= 20 \\text{ horses}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThat is, with 1000 men there would be 2000 horses. The pay of the men with the extra horses was higher, but not in proportion. Thus, a one-horsed man received 8000 D.\n\n\u00b9 Steingass, 272, \u1e63e\u1e6d\u1e6d, A, following in the steps of another; but Pavet de Courteille, Dict. Turc. Oriental, 194, claims it as a Chaghat\u00e6 word, with the meanings of \"a troop of 50 men, the body-guard, the pages.\"\nor Rs. 200 a year (Rs. 16 10a. 8p. per mensem), while the two- or three-horsed man got 11,000 D. or Rs. 275 a year (Rs. 22 14a. 8p. per mensem). In some places we find other rates of pay recorded. For instance, Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h enlisted \u0100\u1e25ad\u012bs, men a little superior to common soldiers, at Rs. 40 a month (D\u0101nishmand Kh\u0101n, second \u1e62afar of the second year, i.e. 1120 H. = 22nd April 1708). A century later, as Fitzelarence tells us, \"Journal,\" 73, 142, the rate was Rs. 40 a month in the Dakhin, and Rs. 22 in Hind\u016bst\u0101n. Service in the cavalry was socially an honourable profession; thus a common trooper was looked on as being, to some extent, a gentleman, and such men, even when illiterate, often rose to the highest positions.\n\nThe pay of the Tabin\u0101n was drawn by the man\u1e63abd\u0101r, who was entitled to retain 5 per cent. of their pay for himself (\u0100\u02be\u012bn, i, 265). Pay was not always allowed for a whole year; often only for six, five, or four months. This fact renders it impossible to calculate the actual expenditure, for, although we generally can find out whether a man\u1e63abd\u0101r was first, second, or third class, we do not know for what number of months in the year his pay was sanctioned.\n\nChel\u0101s.\u2014As a counterpoise to the mercenaries in their employ, over whom they had a very loose hold, commanders were in the habit of getting together, as the kernel of their force, a body of personal dependents or slaves, who had no one to look to except their master. Such troops were known by the Hind\u012b name of chel\u0101 (a slave). They were fed, clothed, and lodged by their employer, had mostly been brought up and trained by him, and had no other home than his camp. They were recruited chiefly from children taken in war or bought from their parents during times of famine. The great majority were of Hindu origin, but all were made Mahomedans when received into the body of chel\u0101s. These chel\u0101s were the only troops on which a man could place entire reliance as being ready to follow his fortunes in both foul and fair weather. Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n Bangash's system of chel\u0101s is described by me in J.A.S. Bengal, part i, 1878, p. 340.\nIII. Rules connected with Pay and Allowances.\n\nIn the preceding paragraphs have been shown in general terms the rates of pay for the cavalry, and some of the rules by which pay was governed. When we come to the actual working out in detail of this part of the army administration, our difficulties increase. The official manuals, which are our only guide, are couched in the briefest of language, and naturally presume a knowledge of many things of which we are ignorant. Nor can we be certain whether the rules that they lay down were of general application or were applicable to certain classes of troops only. Thus the data are insufficient for any complete exposition of this part of the general subject. The matters treated of in the next following paragraphs are, moreover, of a somewhat miscellaneous description, and many of them might be better classed under other heads, such as Discipline, Recruiting, and so forth; but as there is not enough material to yield complete information, I have thought it better to deal with the greater part of them, as the native authors do, in their relation to the calculation of pay.\n\nRates of Pay.\u2014The rates of pay for officers and men of the cavalry, forming numerically far the most important part of the army, have been already stated when dealing with the man\u1e63ab system. The rates for Infantry and Artillery, so far as recorded, will be stated when we come to those branches of the service.\n\nDate from which Pay Drawn.\u2014On an officer being first appointed, if by his rank he was exempt from having his horses branded (d\u0101gh), his pay began from the date of confirmation ('arz-i-mukarrar). If such branding were necessary, pay began from the date of branding (the day itself being excluded), and as soon as this condition had been complied with, a disbursement was made of one month's pay on account. In the case of promotion, if it were unconditional, the rules were the same as above; if conditional, the pay began from the date of entering on office (Dast\u016br-ul-'Aml, B.M. 1641, fol. 37a, 58a; id. 6599, fol. 146b, Dast\u016br-ul-Insh\u0101, 233).\nConditional (Mashr\u016bt) and Unconditional (Bil\u0101-shart) Pay.\u2014Rank and pay might be given absolutely, or they might be conditional on the holding of some particular office. The temporary or mashr\u016bt ba khidmat rank was given as an addition to the permanent, bil\u0101-shart rank which a man already occupied. On ceasing to hold the office, such as that of governor (s\u016bbahd\u0101r) or military magistrate (faujdar), the mashr\u016bt rank and pay were taken away.\n\nPay always in Arrears.\u2014In later times pay due from the imperial treasury to the mansabd\u0101rs, as well as that due from the mansabd\u0101rs to the private soldiers, was always in arrears. In fact, we should not go far wrong, I think, if we asserted that this was the case in the very best times. The reasons are obvious. More men were entertained than could be easily paid; Indian Mahomedans are very bad financiers; the habit of the East is to stave off payment by any expedient. To owe money to somebody seems in that country the normal condition of mankind. For example, even such a careful manager as N\u012bz\u0101m-ul-Mulk, in his alleged testament, dated the 4th Jam\u0101d\u012b II, 1161 H. (31st May, 1748), is credited with the boast that he \u201cnever withheld pay for more than three months\u201d (\"Asiatick Miscellany,\" Calcutta, 1788, vol. iii, 160). Another reason for keeping the men in arrears may have been the feeling that they were thereby prevented from transferring their services to some other chief quite as readily as they might have done if there were nothing owing. Disturbances raised by troops clamouring for their pay were among the unfailing sequels to the disgrace or sudden death of a commander. The instances are too numerous to specify. On this head Haji Mustapha, Seir, iii, 35, note 29, says truly enough:\u2014\u201cThe troops are wretchedly paid, twenty or thirty months of arrears being no rarity. The ministers, princes, and grandees always keep twice or thrice as many men as they have occasion for, and fancy that by withholding the pay they concern the men in the preservation of their lord\u2019s life.\u201d We can also quote Lord Clive as to the state of things in the Bengal s\u016bbah in 1757 (\"Minutes\nof Select Committee of 1772,\u201d reprint, 52)\u2014\u201cThere were great arrears due to the army by Sir\u0101j-ud-Daulah as well as by Mir Ja\u2018far, and the sums amounted to three or four millions sterling. It is the custom of the country never to pay the army a fourth part of what they promise them; and it is only in times of distress that the army can get paid at all, and that is the reason why their troops always behave so\u201d (badly?).\n\nPay in Na\u1e33d and in J\u0101gir.\u2014Pay (tankhuc\u0101h: literally, tan \u2018body,\u2019 khuc\u0101h \u2018need\u2019) might be either Na\u1e33d, that is, given in cash (nakd); or J\u0101gir (literally, j\u0101 \u2018place,\u2019 gir, taking, from giriftan), that is an assignment (j\u0101gir) of the land revenue of a certain number of villages (mau\u1e93a\u2018) or of a subdivision (parganah). A certain number of officers and soldiers, chiefly those of the infantry and artillery, who were, as a rule, on the pay list of the emperor himself, were paid in cash. This seems to have been the case in all reigns up to quite the end. But the favourite mode of payment was by an assignment of the government revenue from land. Such an arrangement seems to have suited both parties. The State was a very centralized organization, fairly strong at the centre, but weak at the extremities. It was glad to be relieved of the duty of collecting and bringing in the revenue from distant places. This task was left to the j\u0101gird\u0101r, or holder of the j\u0101gir, and unless such a man\u1e63abd\u0101r were a great noble or high in imperial favour, the assignment was made on the most distant and most imperfectly subdued provinces.\u00b9 On the other hand, a chance of dealing with land and handling the income from it, has had enormous attractions in all parts of the world, and in none more than in India. Nobles and officers by obtaining an assignment of revenue hoped to make certain of some income, instead of depending helplessly for payment on the good pleasure of the Court. Then in negotiating for a j\u0101gir there were all sorts of possibilities. A judicious bribe might secure to a man\n\n\u00b9 This may have been a development of Taim\u016br\u2019s practice of granting the pay of his amirs from his frontier provinces.\u2014Davy and White, \u201cInstitutes,\u201d 237.\na larger jagir than was his due; and if he were lucky, he might make it yield more than its nominal return. Many such considerations must have been present to their minds. Whatever be the true reasons, of this there can be no doubt, that the system was highly popular, and that the struggle for jagirs was intensely keen. A recent French writer, M. Emile Barb\u00e9, \"Le Nabab Ren\u00e9 Madec,\" 117, speaking of a jagir given in 1775, says: \"Cette apparition des jaguirs dans l'Empire Mogol \u00e0 son declin est un fait sociologique du plus haut int\u00e9r\u00eat.\" The system of jagir grants may be an interesting sociological fact\u2014as to that I have nothing to say for or against; but it was not introduced into the Mogol Empire during its decline. Jagirs existed in that empire's most flourishing days, having been granted as early as Akbar (Blochmann, Ajin, i, 261), while under Shahjah\u0101n they existed on a most extensive scale.\n\nIf the jagir were a large one, the officer managed it through his own agents, who exercised on his behalf most of the functions of government. Such jagirs were practically outside the control of the local governor or faujdar, and formed a sort of imperium in imperio. The disastrous effects of the system, in this aspect, need not be further dwelt on here. On the other hand, a small jagir was more frequently left by the assignee in the hands of the faujdar, through whom the revenue demand was realized. Gradually, as the bonds of authority were relaxed from the centre, the faujdars and subahdars ignored more and more the claims of these assignees, and finally ceased to remit or make over to them any of the collections.\n\nI append here the first steps of official procedure followed in the grant of a jagir. We are to suppose that one Khw\u0101jah Rahmatullah has been recalled from duty in some province, and that on appearing at court he has applied for a new jagir. Through the Diwan-i-tan, a great officer at the head of one of the two revenue departments, a haki\u1e33at, or Statement of Facts, was drawn up, in the following form (B.M. No. 6599, foll. 156a to 157b):\u2014\nStatement (Ha\u1e33\u1e33at).\n\nKhw\u0101jah Rahmatullah, son of Khw\u0101jah Ahmad, a native of Balkh, who was attached to the standards in Province So-and-so, having come to the Presence in pursuance of the exalted orders, and the j\u0101g\u012br which, up to such-and-such a harvest, was held by him in the said Province, having been granted to So-and-so, in this matter what is the order as to the tankhv\u0101\u1e25 j\u0101g\u012br of the above-named.\n\n[on the margin] { Presentation (mul\u1e0dsamat)\nDay so-and-so, month so-and-so\nOffering (naz\u0101r)\n9 Muhrs (gold coins) and\n18 Rupees.\n\nThis \u1e25a\u1e33\u1e33at was passed on by the Diw\u0101n-i-tan to the Diw\u0101n-i-\u02bf\u0101la (or waz\u012br). The latter placed it before the Emperor. If an order were given for a j\u0101g\u012br to be granted, the waz\u012br endorsed on the paper, \u201cThe pure and noble order issued to grant a j\u0101g\u012br in tankhv\u0101\u1e25 from the commencement of such-and-such a harvest.\u201d This paper then becomes the voucher for the chief clerk to the Diw\u0101n-i-tan, who wrote out a siy\u0101ha daul, or Rough Estimate, as follows:\n\nRough Estimate.\n\nKhw\u0101jah Rahmatullah, son of Khw\u0101jah Ahmad, of Balkh. Whereas he was on duty in Province So-and-so, and according to order has reached the Blessed Stirrup (i.e. the Court)\u2014\n\nOne thousand, Personal (z\u0101t)\n200 men, Horse (suw\u0101r)\nPay in d\u0101ms\n\n34 lakhs\n\nPersonal Troopers\n(t\u0101bin\u0101n)\n\n18 lakhs 16 lakhs\n\n= Total, 34 lakhs.\nFeed of Four-footed animals (Kh\u016br\u0101k-i-daw\u0101bb) remitted.\n\nParganah So-and-so,\nsituated in Province\nSo-and-so,\n20 lakhs of D\u0101ms.\n\nParganah So-and-so,\nsituated in Province\nSo-and-so,\n14 lakhs of D\u0101ms.\n\nIt will be seen, on referring to a previous page, that as the man was 1000 z\u0101t, but had only 200 suw\u0101r rank, he was a third class Haz\u0101ri. By the table this gives him 18 lakhs, and then 200 horsemen at 8000 d\u0101ms each comes to 16 lakhs, making the 34 lakhs which are sanctioned in the above.\n\nThe daul, or estimate, was made over to the diary-writer (w\u0101ki'ah navis), who, after he had entered it on the w\u0101ki'ah (diary), prepared an extract called a memorandum (y\u0101d-d\u0101sh\u012b) for submission to the office of the confirmation of orders ('arz-i-mukarrar, lit. second petition). The y\u0101d-d\u0101sh\u012b repeated the facts much in the same form as the h\u0101k\u012bkat and the daul. On it the waz\u012br wrote: \"Let this be compared with the diary (w\u0101ki'ah) and then sent on to the confirmation office ('arz-i-mukarrar).\" On the margin the diary-writer (w\u0101ki'ah navis) then reported: \"This y\u0101d-d\u0101sh\u012b accords with the w\u0101ki'ah.\" Next the superintendent (d\u0101rogh\u0101h) of the confirmation office wrote: \"On such-and-such a date of such-and-such a month of such-and-such a year this reached the confirmation office. The order given was\u2014'Approved.'\" We need not follow here the further fate of the order after it left the Court and reached the governor of the province referred to.\n\nLoans, Advances, and Gifts.\u2014The technical name for a loan or advance of pay was mus\u0101'adat (Steingass, 1225, H, helping, favour, assistance, aid), and the conditions as to interest and repayment are given in Book ii, \u0100in 15, of the \u0100in-i-Akbar\u012b (Blochmann, i, 265). Historians frequently mention the advance of money under this name. In later times, especially from the reign of Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h, no commander ever took the field without\nthe grant of the most liberal cash advances to meet his expenses. Possibly these were never repaid, or were from the first intended as free gifts. When we meet with the phrase *tankhw\u0101h-i-inam*, I presume that there can be no doubt of the payment being a gift. Here the word *tankhw\u0101h* seems to denote the order or cheque on the treasury, and the word *inam* (gift, present), differentiates it from other *tankhw\u0101h*, which were in the nature of payments to be repeated periodically. The recovery of loans and advances came under a head in the accounts called *mut\u0101libah* (Steingass, 1259, asking, claim, due). Another term of somewhat similar import, *b\u0101z-y\u0101ft* (Steingass, 146, the resumption of anything, a deduction, stoppage), seems to have been confined to the recovery of items put under objection in the revenue accounts by the *mustaufis*, or auditors. At one time the recovery of an advance was made from a man\u2019s pay in four instalments; but towards the end of \u2018\u0100lamg\u012br\u2019s reign, it was taken in eight instalments (B.M. No. 1641, fol. 58b).\n\n*Deductions.*\u2014Of these I have found the following: *kas\u016br-i-do-d\u0101m\u012b* (fraction of the two d\u0101ms), *kharch-i-sikkah* (expenses of minting), *ayy\u0101m-i-hil\u0101l\u012b* (days of the moon\u2019s rise), *hi\u1e63\u0101h-i-ijn\u0101s* (share in kind), *khur\u0101k-i-daw\u0101bb* (feed of four-footed animals).\n\n*Kas\u016br-i-do-d\u0101m\u012b.*\u2014*Kas\u016br* is, literally, fractions, deficiencies, faults. This item was a discount of five per cent., that is, of two d\u0101ms in every forty, and therefore styled \u201cdo-d\u0101m\u012b\u201d (B.M. 1641, fol. 37a). The origin of this is to be found possibly in Akbar\u2019s five per cent. deductions from the Ahad\u012b troopers on account of horses and other expenses (*Ain*, i, 250, line 14). The rate of deduction is differently stated in fol. 58b, B.M. 1641, as four d\u0101ms in the 100, if the officer drew seven or eight months\u2019 pay, and two d\u0101ms in the 100, if he drew less than that number of months.\n\n*Kharch-i-sikkah* was also deducted: in \u2018\u0100lamg\u012br\u2019s reign the rates were Rs. 1 12a. 0p. per cent. on Sh\u0101hjahan\u2019s coinage, and Rs. 1 8a. 0p. per cent. on the coin of the reigning emperor. Under the rules then in force, the Sh\u0101hjah\u0101n\u012b\ncoins, not being those of the reigning emperor, were uncurred, and therefore subject to a discount. Why a deduction was made on the coins of the reigning emperor, is harder to explain. It was not till Farrukhsiyar's reign, I believe, that the coinage was called in annually, from which time only coins of the current year were accepted, even by the government itself, at full face-value.\n\nAyy\u0101m-i-hil\u0101t.\u2014This was a deduction of one day's pay in every month except Ramzan. Mansabd\u0101rs, \u0100hadis, and barkand\u0101s (matchlockmen) were all subject to it. But, towards the end of '\u0100lamg\u012br's reign, it was remitted until the Narbada was crossed, that is, I presume, so long as a man served in the Dakhin (B.M. 1641, fol. 55b, 62b). The reason for making this deduction is difficult to fathom; and about the name itself there is some doubt. In the first of the two entries just quoted, I read the word as talaf\u012b (Steingass, 321, obtaining, making amends, compensation, reparation); but this variant, instead of throwing light on the subject, leaves it as obscure as before.\n\nHi\u1e63\u1e63ah-i-ijn\u0101s.\u2014Jins (goods) is used in opposition to nakd (cash), and this item (hi\u1e63\u1e63ah=share, ijn\u0101s=goods) seems to mean the part of a man's pay delivered to him in kind. Apparently this item did not apply to the cavalry. In the case of the matchlockmen, artillerymen, and artificers, the deduction was \u00bc if the man were mounted, and \u00bd if he were not. This represented the value of the rations supplied to him. There is another entry of rasad-i-jins (supplies of food?), the exact nature of which I cannot determine (B.M. 1641, fol. 62b).\n\nKh\u016br\u0101k-i-daw\u0101bb.\u2014This is, literally, kh\u016br\u0101k, feed, daw\u0101bb, four-footed animals. It was a deduction from a mansabd\u0101r's pay on account of a certain number of horses and elephants belonging to the emperor, with whose maintenance such officer was saddled. The germ of this exaction can, I think, be found in Akbar's system of making over elephants to the charge of grandees (\u0100in, i, 126). \"He (Akbar) therefore put several halkahs (groups of baggage elephants) in charge of every grandee, and required them to look after them.\"\nAkbar would seem to have paid the expenses; but in process of time, we can suppose, the charge was transferred to the officer's shoulders entirely, and in the end he had to submit to the deduction without even the use of the animals being given to him. At any rate, the burden became a subject of great complaint. This is shown by a passage in Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n, ii, 602.\n\n\"In the reign of '\u0100lamg\u012br the man\u1e63abd\u0101rs for a long period were reduced to wanting their evening meal, owing to the lowness of the assignments (p\u0101eb\u0101\u1e6di) granted by the emperor. His stinginess reminds one of the proverb 'one pomegranate for a hundred sick men,' yak an\u0101r, sau bim\u0101r. After many efforts and exertions, some small assignment (j\u0101g\u012br) on the land revenue would be obtained. The lands were probably uncultivated, and the total income of the j\u0101g\u012br might not amount to a half or even a third of the money required for the expenses of the animals. If these were realized from the officer, whence could come the money to preserve his children and family from death by starvation? In spite of this, the Akhtah Beg\u012b (Master of the Horse) and other accursed clerks caused the cost of feeding the emperor's animals to be imposed on the man\u1e63abd\u0101rs, and, imprisoning their agents at court, used force and oppression of all kinds to obtain the money.\n\n\"When the agents (wakils) complained of this oppression to the emperor, the head of the elephant stables and the Akhtah Beg\u012b so impressed matters on the emperor's mind, that the complaints were not listened to, and all the men were reduced to such an extremity by this oppression, that the agents resigned their agency. In Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h's reign, the Kh\u0101n-i-Kh\u0101n\u0101n decided that when the man\u1e63abd\u0101rs received a j\u0101g\u012br for their support, the number of d\u0101ms required for the cost of feeding cattle should be deducted first from the total estimated income, and the balance should be assigned as the income. In this way, the obligation for meeting the cost of feeding the animals was entirely removed from the heads of the man\u1e63abd\u0101rs and their agents. Indeed, to speak the truth, it was an order to absolve them\nfrom the cost of the cattle provender.\u201d Dowson (Elliot, vii, 403) could make nothing of this passage.\n\nIn the case of officers below a certain rank, the deduction of kh\u016br\u0101k-i-daw\u0101b was not made. The rule says that where the pay (tankhuc\u0101h) did not come up to 15 lakhs of d\u0101ms, the deduction was not made; but apparently no lower rank than that of 400 \u1e63\u0101\u1e6d, 200 suuc\u0101r, was liable. This rank would by the tables draw a pay of 20 lakhs of d\u0101ms. As to the rate of deduction, the records are so obscure that I am unable to come to any conclusions. Sometimes we are told that the calculation was made at so many d\u0101ms on each 100,000 d\u0101ms of pay; at others, that for each 100,000 d\u0101ms one riding and five baggage elephants were charged for. A distinction in rates was made between Mahomedans and Hindus, the former paying more; also between officers holding j\u0101yirs in Hind\u016bst\u0101n and those holding them in the Dakhin and Ahm\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d, the former paying slightly less than the latter.\n\nFines.\u2014We come now to the subject of fines, which were of various sorts, such as taf\u0101wat-i-asp (deficiency in horses), taf\u0101wat-i-sil\u0101h (deficiency in equipment), taf\u0101wat-i-t\u0101bin\u0101n (deficiency in troopers), also called, it would seem, k\u0101mi-i-bar\u0101d\u0101ri, tarakku\u1e6d o \u2018adam-i-ta\u1e63hi\u1e25ah (non-verification), sak\u0101\u1e6d\u012b (casualties), bartaraf\u012b (rejections).\n\nTaf\u0101wat-i-asp.\u2014This is literally \u201cdifference of horses,\u201d and refers to a classification of horses by their breed and size, which will be referred to more fully under the head of Branding and Verification. In each rank or man\u1e63ab a certain number of each class of horse had to be maintained, and if at Verification it was found that this regulation had not been complied with, the result was a fine. In the section on Branding I give the rates so far as recorded.\n\nTaf\u0101wat-i-sil\u0101h.\u2014This \u201cdifference in armour\u201d was a fine for not producing at inspection arms and armour according to the required scale. The amount of fine and so forth I have stated further on under the head of Equipment.\n\nTaf\u0101wat-i-t\u0101bin\u0101n (difference of followers) or k\u0101mi-i-bar\u0101d\u0101ri (deficiency in relations) was a fine imposed on an\nofficer for non-production of the number of men stipulated for by the suw\u0101r rank. The following rates are stated in B.M. 1641, fol. 37a, and I presume that the deductions apply to man\u1e63abd\u0101rs as well as to Ahadis, and that they were made from the monthly pay for each man deficient, although the entry is so brief as to remain very obscure:\n\n| Number of Months for Which Pay was Drawn |\n|------------------------------------------|\n|                                          |\n| Four Months | Five Months | Six Months | Seven Months | Eight Months |\n| R. A. P.    | R. A. P.    | R. A. P.    | R. A. P.      | R. A. P.     |\n| 280         | 300         | 400         | 700           | 800          |\n\nIn another passage, fol. 41, the same authority explains the matter thus. In the twenty-first year of \u2018\u0100lamg\u012br, a report on this subject having been made, the emperor allowed a term of four turns of guard (chauki) for a man\u1e63abd\u0101r to produce men of his own class or family (bar\u0101dari), and for this period pay for the men was passed as if they had been present. But subsequently, on the first Rabi\u2018 of the twenty-third year, the delay was extended to two months, and for the time during which such men were not actually present, pay at half-rates was sanctioned.\n\nAhsh\u0101m.\u2014In the case of the Ahsh\u0101m, or troops belonging to the infantry and artillery, we have a little more definite information under this head (B.M. 1641, fol. 64a). Officers of this class fell into three subdivisions, has\u0101ri (of a thousand), \u1e63ad\u012bw\u0101l (hundred-man), and mirdahah (lord of ten). The first class was always mounted (suw\u0101r) and the second sometimes; these mounted officers might be two-horse (d\u00fcaspah) or only one-horse (yakaspah) men. Working on these distinctions, we get the following scheme of pay. D\u00fcaspah Suw\u0101r: Where, inclusive of the officer\u2019s own retainers (kh\u0101sah), there were one hundred men present per 100 of rank, pay was drawn at d\u00fcaspah rates. But\nif the number were under fifty per 100 of rank, pay was passed to the haz\u0101r\u012b as if he were a mounted \u1e63ad\u012bw\u0101l; subject to restoration to d\u00fcaspah pay when his muster again conformed to the standard. Yakaspah: If, including kh\u0101sah men, there were fifty men present per 100 of rank, full pay was given; if only thirty-one or under, then the haz\u0101r\u012b was paid as a \u1e63ad\u012bw\u0101l piy\u0101dah (unmounted), and certain other deductions were made. Piy\u0101dah (unmounted officer).\u2014If a \u1e63ad\u012bw\u0101l produced under thirty-one men out of his hundred, he received nothing but his rations. When the numbers rose above thirty, he was paid as a mirdahah till his full quota was mustered. In the case of a mirdahah, the production of two men entitled him to his pay. If one man only was paraded for inspection, a deduction from the pay was made, varying, on conditions which I have not mastered, from one to three annas per man.\n\nTawakkuf-i-ta\u1e63hihah (Delay in Verification).\u2014The rules for Branding and Verification will be found further on. If the periods fixed were allowed to elapse without the verification having been made, a man was reported for delay; and then a mansabd\u0101r was cut the whole, and an ah\u0101di the half, of his pay (B.M. 1641, fol. 58b).\n\nSaka\u1e6di and Bar\u1e6dara\u1e6di.\u2014The first word is from saka\u1e6d shudan \u2018to die\u2019 (applied to animals, Steingass, 687), and may be translated casualties. The other word means setting aside or rejecting, in other words to cast a horse as unfit. We find the groundwork of the saka\u1e6di system in the \u0100j\u012bn-i-Akbar\u012b, Blochmann, i, 250. In later times there were the following rules for regulating pay in such cases. First it was seen whether the man was d\u00fcaspah (paid for two horses) or yakaspah (paid for one horse). In the first case, (1) if one horse died (saka\u1e6d shavvad) or was cast (bar taraf shud), the man was paid at the yakaspah rate; (2) if both horses died or were turned out, the man obtained his personal pay for one month, and if after one month he had still no horse, his personal pay was also stopped. In the second case, that of a yakaspah, if there were no horse, personal pay was disbursed for one month;\nbut after one month nothing was given (B.M. 1641, fol. 41a).\n\nIf an ahadi's horse died while he was at headquarters, the clerk of the casualties, after having inspected the hide, wrote out his certificate (sakat-namah), and pay was disbursed according to it. If the man were on detached duty when his horse died, the brand (dagh) and the tail were sent in to headquarters (B.M. 1641, fol. 29b).\n\nOther incidents of military service considered as affecting pay.\u2014Among these may be mentioned: (1) Ghair-haziri (absence without leave); (2) Bimari (illness); (3) Rukhsat (leave and furlough); (4) Farari (desertion); (5) Bartarafti (discharge or resignation); (6) Pension; (7) Fausti (death).\n\n(1) Ghair-haziri.\u2014If a man were absent from three consecutive turns of guard (chauki), his pay was cut; but if he did not attend the fourth time, the penalty was dismissal, and all pay due was confiscated. Absence from night guard or at roll-call (jaiizah) involved the loss of a day's pay. If absent at the time of the emperor's public or private audience, or on a day of festival (\"id\"), half a day's pay was taken (B.M. 1641, fol. 39a, 62b).\n\n(2) Bimari.\u2014Absence on the ground of illness was overlooked for three turns of guard (chauki), but after that period all pay was stopped, and a medical certificate (bimari-namah) from a physician was demanded (B.M. 1641, fol. 39a, 58a). The rule is somewhat differently stated in B.M. 6599, fol. 163b.\n\n(3) Rukhsat.\u2014Men who went on leave for their own business received no pay while doing no duty (B.M. 1641, fol. 41b). In another place in the same work, fol. 64b, we find a different statement. We are there told that for one month a man received half-pay; if he overstayed his leave it was reduced to one-fifth or one-tenth; and after three months' absence he was classed as an absconder. Leave on account of family rejoicings or mournings was allowed for one turn of duty; if the man were absent longer his pay was cut (B.M. 1641, fol. 39a). Again, on fol. 57b, a rule is stated, of which I am not able to understand the bearing. It\nseems to be that not more than two months of arrears were to be paid to a man who took leave; but whether that means the arrears due to him when he left, or the pay accruing during his absence, I cannot say.\n\n(4) Far\u0101ri.\u2014If, among the Ahsh\u0101m, an absconder who had been some time in the service, left after drawing his pay in full, the amount was shown on the margin (hasho) of the pay-bill (kabz) as recoverable, and one month\u2019s pay was realized from the man\u2019s surety. If a recruit absconded after drawing money on account, the whole advance was recovered, but a present of one month\u2019s pay was allowed. If a matchlockman deserted the service of one leader to enter that of another, he was cut half a month\u2019s pay (nim-m\u0101hah). But, if it were found that the mirdah\u0101h or sadiw\u0101l, to whom he had gone, had induced him to desert, such officer had to pay the fine himself (B.M. 1641, fol. 64b). Pay of absconders was reckoned up to the date of the last verification, and three months\u2019 time was allowed (idem, fol. 57b). By the last phrase I understand that they were allowed that time to reappear, if they chose. If they were again entertained, their rations only were passed, that is, I presume, for the interval of absence (idem, fol. 64b).\n\n(5) Bartaraf\u012b.\u2014If the discharged mansabdar produced a clear verification roll, he received half of the pay of his z\u0101t rank, and the full pay of his horsemen (tabin\u0101n). Matchlockmen received their pay in full up to the date of discharge (B.M. 1641, fols. 57b, 62a).\n\n(6) Pension.\u2014So far as I have ascertained, there was no pension list, under that express name. No retiring allowances could be claimed as of right. When a man retired from active service, we hear sometimes of his being granted a daily or yearly allowance. Such was the case, for instance, when Niz\u0101m-ul-Mulk in Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h\u2019s reign threw up the whole of his offices and titles, and retired into private life. But the ordinary method of providing for an old servant was to leave him till his death in undisturbed possession of his rank and j\u0101gir.\n\n(7) Faut\u012b.\u2014It seems that in the case of deaths a different\nrule prevailed, according to whether the death was a natural one or the man lost his life on active service. In the one case half-pay and in the other full-pay was disbursed to the heirs on the production of a certificate of heirship (w\u0101ri\u015f-n\u0101mah) attested by the k\u0101z\u012b.\n\nIV. Rewards and Distinctions.\n\nThe promise of honorary distinctions has been in all ages and in all countries one of the most potent agencies employed to incite men to exertion. We have our medals, crosses, orders, and peerages. The Moghul sovereigns were even more ingenious in converting things mostly worthless in themselves into objects to be ardently striven for and dearly prized. Among these were: (1) Titles; (2) Robes of Honour; (3) Gifts of Money and other articles; (4) Kettle-drums; (5) Standards and Ensigns.\n\n1. Titles.\u2014The system of entitlature was most elaborate and based on strict rule. This subject belongs, however, to the general scheme of government, and need not be set forth at length here. Suffice it to say, that a man would begin by becoming a Kh\u0101n or Lord (added to his own name). After that, he might receive some name supposed to be appropriate to his qualities, coupled with the word Kh\u0101n, such as Ikhl\u0101\u015f Kh\u0101n, Lord Sincerity; an artillery officer might be dubbed Ra\u2019d-and\u0101z Kh\u0101n, Lord Thunder-thrower, or a skilful horseman, Yakah-T\u0101z Kh\u0101n, Lord Single Combat, and so on. Round such a title as a nucleus, accreted all the remaining titles with which a man might from time to time be invested. As the empire declined in strength, so did the titles increase in pomposity, and long before the end of the dynasty the discrepancy between a man\u2019s real qualities and his titles was so great as often to be ridiculous. Still, these titles were never given quite at random, nor were they self-adopted. Yet I read quite recently in a history of India, by a well-known and esteemed author, that one governor of Bengal was \u201ca\nBrahman convert calling himself Murshid Kuli Khan.\" Now Murshid Kuli Kh\u0101n no more called himself by that name than has Baron Roberts of Candahar called himself by the title he bears. Both titles were derived from the accepted fountain of honour, the sovereigns of the states which those bearing them respectively served.\n\n(2) Robes of Honour.\u2014The khila't was not peculiar to the military department. These robes of honour were given to everyone presented at court. Distinction was, however, made according to the position of the receiver. There were five degrees of khila't, those of three, five, six, or seven pieces; or they might as a special mark of favour consist of clothes that the emperor had actually worn (malb\u016bs-i-kh\u0101\u1e63). A three-piece khila't, given from the general wardrobe (khila't-kh\u0101nah), consisted of a turban (dast\u0101r), a long coat with very full skirts (j\u0101mah), and a scarf for the waist (kamrband). A five-piece robe came from the toshah-kh\u0101nah (storehouse for presents), the extra pieces being a turban ornament called a sarpech and a band for tying across the turban (b\u0101l\u0101band). For the next grade a tight-fitting jacket with short sleeves, called a Half-sleeve (nimah-astin), was added. A European writer, Tavernier (Ball, i, 163), thus details the seven-piece khila't: (1) a cap, (2) a long gown (ka'bah), (3) a close-fitting coat (arkalon), which I take to be alkh\u0101lik, a tight coat, (4) two pairs of trousers, (5) two shirts, (6) two girdles, (7) a scarf for the head or neck.\n\n(3) Gifts, other than money.\u2014These were naturally of considerable variety. I have drawn up the following list from D\u0101nishmand Kh\u0101n's history of the first two years of Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h's reign (1708\u20131710): Jewelled ornaments, weapons, principally swords and daggers with jewelled hilts, p\u0101lk\u012bs with fringes of gold lace and pearls, horses with gold-mounted and jewelled trappings, and elephants. The order in which the above are given indicates roughly both the frequency with which these presents were granted and the relative value set upon them, beginning with those most frequently given and the least esteemed.\n(4) Kettledrums.\u2014As one of the attributes of sovereignty, kettledrums were beaten at the head of the army when the emperor was on the march; and in quarters they were beaten every three hours at the gate of his camp. The instruments in use, in addition to the drums, will be found in the \u0100jin-i-Akbari (Blochmann, i, 51). As a mark of favour, kettledrums (nakk\u0101rah) and the right to play them (naubat) might be granted to a subject. But he must be a man of the rank of 2000 suw\u0101r or upwards. As an invariable condition, moreover, it was stipulated that they should never be used where the emperor was present, nor within a certain distance from his residence. Marching through the middle of Dihli with drums beating was one of the signs by which Sayyad \u1e24usain \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, Am\u012br-ul-Umar\u0101, notified defiance of constituted authority, when he returned from the Dakhin in 1719, preparatory to dethroning the Emperor Farrukhsiyar. The drums when granted were placed on the recipient\u2019s back, and, thus accoutred, he did homage for them in the public audience hall. In Lord Lake\u2019s case the investment was thus carried out: \u201cTwo small drums of silver, each about the size of a thirty-two pound shot, the apertures covered with parchments, are hung round the neck of the person on whom the honour is conferred, then struck a few times, after which drums of the proper size are made.\u201d\u2014Thorn, \u201cWar,\u201d 356.\n\n(5) Flags and Ensigns.\u2014The flags and ensigns displayed, along with a supply of spare weapons, at the door of the audience hall and at the entrance to the emperor\u2019s encampment, or carried before him on elephants, were called collectively the K\u016br (Pavet de Courteille, \u201cDict.,\u201d 425, ceinture, arme, garde), and their charge was committed to a responsible officer called the K\u016br-beg\u012b. An alternative general name sometimes employed was m\u0101hi-o-mar\u0101tib (Fish and Dignities), or more rarely, the panj\u0101h (literally, Open Hand). It is, no doubt, the K\u016br which Gemelli Careri describes thus (French ed. iii, 182): \u201cOutside the audience tent I saw nine men in red velvet coats embroidered with\ngold, with wide sleeves and pointed collars hanging down behind, who carried the imperial ensigns displayed at the end of pikes. The man in the middle carried a sun, the two on each side of him had each a gilt hand, the next two carried horse-tails dyed red. The remaining four, having covers on their pikes, it could not be seen what it was they held.\"\n\nIn the \u0100jin, i, 50, we are told of eight ensigns of royalty, of which the first four were reserved exclusively for the sovereign. The use of the others might, we must assume, be granted to subjects. The eight ensigns are\u2014(1) Aurang, the throne; (2) Chatr, the State umbrella; (3) S\u0101ib\u0101n or Aft\u0101bgir, a sunshade; (4) Kaukabah (plate ix, No. 2); (5) \u2018Alam, or flag; (6) Chatr-luk, or yak-tails; (7) Taman-tok, another shape of yak-tails; (8) Jhanda, or Indian flag. To these we must add (9) Mahi-o-mar\u0101tib, or the fish and dignities.\n\nThe origin and meaning of the different ensigns displayed by the Moghul Emperors in India have been thus described, Mir\u0101t-ul-Istil\u0101h, fol. 5b:\n\n(1) Panj\u0101h, an open hand, is said to mean the hand of \u2018Ali. Taim\u016br ordered it to be carried before him for a charm and as a sacred relic. It was said that he captured it when he overcame the Siy\u0101hposh tribe. In 1753 Gentil saw four different \"pondjehs\" (ie. panjahe) carried on horseback in Sal\u0101bat Jang\u2019s cavalcade; they were copper hands fixed on the end of a staff (\"M\u00e9moires,\" 61).\n\n(2) \u2018Alam, a flag or standard.\u2014This was supposed to be the flag of \u1e24usain, and obtained by Taim\u016br at Karbalah. To it he attributed his victory over B\u0101y\u0101zid, the Kaisar of R\u016bm.\n\n(3) Mis\u0101n, a balance, was a reference to the equal scales of Justice, and was adopted as having been the emblem of N\u016bsh\u012brw\u0101n the Just. There is a figure on a plate in Gentil\u2019s \"M\u00e9moires,\" which is probably the Mis\u0101n.\n\n(4) Aft\u0101b, or Sun, was obtained from the fire-worshippers when they were conquered; it was an article used in their worship.\n(5, 6) *Azhdaha-paikar*, Dragon-face.\u2014From the time of Sikandar of the Two Horns, the rajahs of Hind had worshipped this emblem in their temples, and when Taim\u016br made his irruption into India it was presented to him as an offering. It consisted of two pieces, one carried in front and the other behind the emperor.\n\n(7) *Mahi*, or Fish, was said to have been an offering from the islands of the ocean, where it was worshipped.\n\n(8) *Kumkumah* (Steingass, 989, a bowl, a jug, a round shade, a lantern).\u2014This also was obtained from the Indian rajahs. The *\u0100jin-i-Akbari*, i, 50, has *kaukahab* for apparently the same thing (see figure No. 2 on plate ix). There is also what looks like the *kaukahab* in a plate in Gentil\u2019s \u201cM\u00e9moires.\u201d The definition of *kaukahab* in Steingass, 1063, corresponds with the figure in the *\u0100jin*, viz. \u201ca polished steel ball suspended from a long pole and carried as an ensign before the king.\u201d Careri, iii, 182, tells us that he saw a golden ball hanging by a chain between two gilt hands, and adds that \u201cit was a royal ensign carried on an elephant when the army was on the march.\u201d\n\nAll these emblems, we are told, were carried before the emperor as a sign of conquest over the Seven Climes, or, in other words, over the whole world.\n\n*Mahi-o-mar\u0101tib*.\u2014Some words must be added with special reference to this dignity, which was borne on elephants or camels in a man\u2019s retinue. It was one of the very highest honours, as it was not granted to nobles below the rank of 6000 *\u1e93\u0101t*, 6000 *sunc\u0101r* (*Mir\u0101d-ul-Istil\u0101h*, fol. 3). *Mahi* (literally, a fish), was made in the figure of a fish, four feet in length, of copper gilt, and it was placed horizontally on the point of a spear (*Seir*, i, 218, note 150, and 743, note 51). Steingass, 1,147, defines *mahi-mar\u0101tib* as \u201ccertain honours denoted by the figure of a fish with other insignia (two balls).\u201d But in careful writers I have always found it as *mahi-o-mar\u0101tib*, \u201cfish and dignities,\u201d and, as I take it, the first word refers to the fish emblem and the second to the balls or other adjuncts which went with it. The *mar\u0101tib* Thorn, \u201cWar,\u201d 356, describes as a ball of copper gilt\nencircled by a *jh\u0101lar* or fringe about two feet in length, placed on a long pole, and, like the *m\u0101hi*, carried on an elephant. Can this be Gemelli Careri\u2019s \u201cgolden ball\u201d? Perhaps it was identical with the *kumkumah* or *kaukabah* already described above. The translator of the *Seir-Mutaq-herin*, i, 218, note 150, tells us that the fish was always accompanied by the figure of a man\u2019s head in copper gilt. This must have been in addition to the gilt balls. The *m\u0101hi*, as conferred on Lord Lake on the 14th August, 1804 (Thorn, \u201cWar,\u201d 356), is described as \u201crepresenting a fish with a head of gilt copper and the body and tail formed of silk, fixed to a long staff and carried on an elephant.\u201d James Skinner, who recovered Mah\u0101daji-Sendhia\u2019s *m\u0101hi-o-mar\u0101tib* in a fight with the Rajputs, speaks of it as \u201ca brass fish with two chourees (horse-hair tails) hanging to it like moustachios\u201d (Fraser, \u201cMemoir,\u201d i, 152). Gentil, \u201cM\u00e9moires,\u201d 62, calls the *m\u0101hi* simply \u201cthe head of a fish on the end of a pole.\u201d As a sign of the rarity of this dignity, he adds that while in the Dakhin (1752\u20131761) he only saw four of them.\n\n*Sher-mar\u0101tib*, or lion dignity.\u2014This is a name only found, so far as I know, in Gentil, \u201cM\u00e9moires,\u201d 62; and he only saw it displayed by Sal\u0101bat Jang, n\u0101\u1e93im of the Dakhin. At the head of the dedication of the above work to the memory of Shuj\u0101\u2018-ud-Daulah, are the figures of two elephants; one of which bears a standard that is most likely identical with this *Sher-mar\u0101tib*. The flag bears a lion embroidered on it, and the head of the staff is adorned with the figure of a lion.\n\n*\u2018Alam.*\u2014The flags seem to have been triangular in shape, either scarlet or green in colour, having a figure embroidered in gold and a gold fringe. The staff was surmounted by a figure corresponding to the one embroidered on the flag. A plate in Gentil\u2019s \u201cM\u00e9moires\u201d shows four of these embroidered emblems\u20141st, a *panjah*, or open hand; 2nd, a man\u2019s face with rays; 3rd, a lion (*sher*); and 4th, a fish. A flag, or *\u2018alam*, could be granted to no man under the rank of 1000 *suw\u0101r*.\nAft\u0101bgiri.\u2014This sun screen (aft\u0101b, sun; gir, root of gir\u012bftan, to take), shaped like an open palm-leaf fan, was also called S\u016braj-mukh\u012b (Hindi, literally, sun-face). By the Moghul rules it could only be granted to royal princes (Mir\u0101t-ul-Istil\u0101h, fol. 3). In the eighteenth century, however, the Mahrattas adopted it as one of their commonest ensigns, and even the smallest group of their cavalry was in the habit of carrying one.\n\nT\u016bman-togh.\u2014This is one of the two togh mentioned in Akbar\u2019s list, \u0100in i, 50, and figured on plate ix of that volume. Pavet de Courteille, \u201cDict.,\u201d 236, has \u062a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u063a\u064e\u062d (togh), \u201c\u00e9tendard se composant d\u2019une queue de \u0642\u064e\u0637\u064e\u0627\u0633 (kat\u0101s) ou b\u0153uf de montagne (i.e. yak) fix\u00e9e \u00e0 une hampe, au dessus d\u2019un pavillon triangulaire.\u201d This yak\u2019s-tail standard was not unfrequently granted to high officers of rank, by whom it was esteemed a high honour. The togh consisted generally of three tails attached to a cross-bar, which was fixed at the end of a long pole or staff.\n\nSummary.\u2014Thus, apart from titles or money rewards, or ordinary gifts, a man might be awarded any of the following honorary distinctions, of a more permanent character\u2014(1) the right to carry a flag or simple standard, (2) the right to display a yak-tail standard, (3) the right to use kettle-drums and beat the naubat, (4) the right to display the fish and its accompanying emblems, (5) the right to use a litter adorned with gold fringes and strings of pearls. Of course, all these things were dependent on the caprice of the monarch; for in the Moghul, like in all Oriental states\u2014Ba yak nuktah mahram (\u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651\u0645\u064c) mujrim (\u0645\u064f\u062c\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0645\u064c) shavvad: By one spot \u201cconfidant\u201d becomes \u201ccriminal.\u201d\n\nV. Procedure on Entering the Service.\n\nSingle men who resorted to the Court in the hope of obtaining employment in the army, were obliged first to seek a patron. A man generally attached himself to a chief from his own country or of his own race: Mughals became the\nfollowers of Mughals, Persians of Persians, Afghans of Afghans, and so on. At times men of high rank who desired to increase their forces would remit large sums of money to the country with which they were specially connected, and thereby induce recruits of a particular class to flock to their standard. For instance, in the reign of Muhammad Shah (1719\u20131748), Muhammad Khan, Bangash, filled his ranks in this way with men from the Bangash country and with Afridi Pathans. According to a man's reputation or connections, or the number of his followers, would be the rank (mansab) assigned to him. As a rule, his followers brought their own horses and other equipment; but sometimes a man with a little money would buy extra horses and mount relations or dependents upon them. When this was the case, the man riding his own horse was called, in later parlance, a silahdar (literally, equipment-holder), and one riding somebody else's horse was a bargir (burden-taker). The horses and equipment were as often as not procured by borrowed money; and not unfrequently the chief himself made the advances, which were afterwards recovered from the man's pay. The candidate for employment, having found a patron, next obtained through this man's influence an introduction to the Bakhshi-ul-Mamalik or Mir Bakhshi, in whose hands lay the presentation of new men to the emperor, and on his verdict a great deal depended as to the rank (mansab) which might be accorded.\n\nThe Bakhshi.\u2014This officer's title is translated into English sometimes by Paymaster-General, at others by Adjutant-General or Commander-in-Chief. None of these titles gives an exact idea of his functions. He was not a Paymaster, except in the sense that he usually suggested the rank to which a man should be appointed or promoted, and perhaps countersigned the pay-bills. But the actual disbursement of pay belonged to other departments. Adjutant-General is somewhat nearer to correctness. Commander-in-Chief he was not. He might be sent on\n\n1 Blochmann, Ain, i, 261, has Paymaster and Adjutant-General.\na campaign in supreme command; and if neither emperor, vicegerent (wakil-i-mu\u1e63\u1e6dlak), nor chief minister (wasir) was present, the command fell to him. But the only true Commander-in-Chief was the emperor himself, replaced in his absence by the wakil or the waz\u012br. The word Bakhshi means 'the giver,' from bakhshid\u0101n, P. 'to bestow,' that is, he was the giver of the gift of employment in camps and armies (Dast\u016br-ul-Insh\u0101, 232). In Persia the same official was styled 'The Petitioner' ('\u0101r\u012bz). This name indicates that it was his special business to bring into the presence of the emperor anyone seeking for employment or promotion, and there to state the facts connected with that man's case. Probably the use of the words Mir 'Arz in two places in the \u0100jin-i-Akbari (Blochmann, i, 257, 259) are instances of the Persian name being applied to the officer afterwards called a Bakhshi. The First Bakhshi (for there were four) seems to have received, almost as of right, the title of Amir-ul-Umar\u0101 (Noble of Nobles); and from the reign of '\u0100lamg\u012br onwards, I find no instance of this title being granted to more than one man at a time, though in Akbar's reign such appears to have been the case (\u0100jin, i, 240, Blochmann's note).\n\nDuties of the Bakhshi-ul-Mam\u0101lik.\u2014These duties comprised the recruiting of the army; maintaining a list of mansabd\u0101rs with their postings, showing (1) officers at Court, (2) officers in the provinces; keeping a roster of the guard-mounting at the palace; preparing the rules as to grants of pay (tankhw\u0101h); keeping up a list of officers paid in cash, and an abstract of the total pay-bills; the superintendence of the mustering for branding and verifying the troopers' horses and the orders subsidiary thereto; the preparation of the register of absentees, with or without leave, deaths, and dismissals, of cash advances, of demands due from officers (mu\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101libah), of sureties produced by officers, and the issue of written orders (dastak) to officers sent on duty into the provinces.\n\n1 Dast\u016br-ul-Insh\u0101, 232, Dast\u016br-ul-'Aml, B.M. 6599, fol. 159a, and B.M. 1641, fols. 28, and 17b to 22a.\nOne special duty belonging to the Bakhshi was, in preparation for a great battle, to assign posts to the several commanders in the van, centre, wings, or rear-guard. The Bakhshi was also expected on the morning of a battle to lay before the emperor a present state or muster roll, giving the exact number of men under each commander in each division of the fighting line.\n\nThe other Bakhshis.\u2014Besides the First Bakhshi, ordinarily holding the title of Amir-ul-Umar\u0101, and styled either Bakhshi-ul-Mam\u0101lik (B. of the Realms) or Mir Bakhshi (Lord B.), there were three other Bakhshis at headquarters. It is a little difficult to fix upon the points which distinguished their duties from those of the First Bakhshi. The Second Bakhshi, usually styled Bakhshi-ul-Mulk (B. of the Kingdom), was also called the Bakhshi-i-Tan.\\(^1\\) As tan (literally, body) was a contraction for tankhw\u0101h, pay (literally tan, body, khw\u0101h, desire, need), it might be supposed that his duties were connected with the records of j\u0101girs, or revenue assignments granted in lieu of pay, just as in the revenue department the accounts of these grants were under a special officer, the Diw\u0101n-i-Tan. But on examining such details of the Second Bakhshi's duties as are forthcoming, I find that this supposition does not hold good. On the whole, the duties of the First, Second, and Third Bakhshis seem to have covered much the same ground. The main distinction, perhaps, was that the Second Bakhshi dealt more with the recruiting and promotion of the smaller men, while only those above a certain rank were brought forward by the Mir Bakhshi. The Second Bakhshi was, it would appear, solely responsible for the bonds taken from officers, a practice common to all branches and ranks of the imperial service. His office would seem also to have been used to some extent as a checking office on that of the First Bakhshi, many documents\n\n\\(^1\\) D\u0101nishmand Kh\u0101n, 18th Shaww\u0101l 1119, Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n, ii, 601, Y\u0101b\u012bya, Kh\u0101n, fol. 114a.\nrequiring his seal in addition to that of the Mir Bakhshi, and copies of many others being filed with him. The same remarks apply generally to the Third Bakhshi, the greatest difference being perhaps that he took up only such recruiting work as was specially entrusted to him, and that whatever he did required to be counter-sealed by the First and Second Bakhshi. His duties were on altogether a smaller scale than those of the other two.\n\nFrom the details in one work, Dastur-ul-'Aml, B.M. 1641, fols. 28b, 29a, it might be inferred that the Second Bakhshi's duties were connected with the Ahadis, or gentlemen troopers serving singly in the emperor's own service. The difficulty, however, at once arises that the Fourth Bakhshi had as his alternative title that of Bakhshi of the Ahadis. The Third Bakhshi was also called occasionally Bakhshi of the Wala Shahis, that is of the household troops, men raised and paid by the emperor out of his privy purse.\u00b9\n\nProvincial and other Bakhshis.\u2014In addition to the Bakhshis at headquarters there were officers with similar functions attached to the governor of every province. With the office of provincial Bakhshi was usually combined that of Waki'ah-nigar, or Writer of the Official Diary. And in imitation of the imperial establishments, each great noble had his own Bakhshi, who performed for him the same functions as those executed for the emperor by the imperial Bakhshis.\n\nFirst Appointment of an Officer.\u2014On one of the appointed days, the Bakhshi laid before His Majesty a written statement, prepared in the office beforehand and called a Haqikat (statement, account, narration, explanation). The man's services having been accepted, the emperor's order was written across this paper directing the man to appear, and a few days afterwards the candidate presented himself in the audience-hall and made his obeisance. When his turn came the candidate was brought\n\n\u00b9 K\u0101mvar Kh\u0101n, entry of 1st Jam\u0101di I, 1119.\nforward, and the final order was passed. The following is a specimen of a \u1e24ak\u012bkat, with the orders upon it:\n\nReport\n\nis made that So-and-so, son of So-and-so, in hope of serving in the Imperial Court, has arrived at the place of prostration attached to the Blessed Stirrup (i.e. the Court). In respect of him what are the orders?\n\n[First Order.] The noble, pure, and exalted order issued that the above-named be brought before the luminous eye (i.e. of His Majesty), and he will be exalted according to his circumstances.\n\n[Second Order in two or three days' time.] To day the aforesaid passed before the noble sight; he was selected for the rank (mans\u0101b) of One Thousand, Two Hundred Horse (suw\u0101r).\n\nThe next step was the issue of a Ta\u1e63d\u012bk, or Certificate, from the Bakhsh\u012b's office, on which the Bakhsh\u012b wrote his order. It was in the following form:\n\nCertifies\n\nas follows, that So-and-so, son of So-and-so, on such-and-such a date, of such-and-such a year, in the hope of serving in this homage-receiving Court, arrived at the Blessed Stirrup and passed before the luminous sight. The order, to which the world is obsequious and the universe submissive, was issued that he be raised to the rank (mans\u0101b) of One Thousand, Two Hundred Horse (suw\u0101r).\n\nOne Thousand, z\u0101t.\nTwo Hundred, suw\u0101r.\n\n[Order thereon of the Bakhsh\u012b.] Let it be incorporated in the Record of Events (W\u0101ki\u2018ah).\n\nOn the arrival of the Certificate (Ta\u1e63d\u012bk) in the office of the W\u0101ki\u2018ahn\u012bgar, or Diary Writer, he made an appropriate entry in his record and furnished an extract therefrom,\nwhich bore the name of a *Y\u0101d-d\u0101sh\u1e6d*, or Memorandum. In form it was as follows:\u2014\n\n**Memorandum (Y\u0101d-d\u0101sh\u1e6d).**\n\nOn such-and-such a date, such-and-such a day of the week, such-and-such a month, such-and-such a year, in the department (*ris\u0101lah*) of One endowed with Valour, a Shelter of the Courageous, the Object of various Imperial Condescensions, Submissive to the Equity of the world-governing favours, the *Bakhshi* of the Realms So-and-so, and during the term of duty as Event Writer of this lowliest of the slaves So-and-so, it was reduced to writing that So-and-so, son of So-and-so, having come to the place of prostration in the hope of service at the Imperial Court, on such-and-such a date passed before the pure and noble sight. The world-compelling, universe-constraining order obtained the honour of issue, that he be raised to and selected for the rank (*man\u1e63ab*) of One Thousand Personal (*z\u0101t*) and Two Hundred Horsemen (*suv\u0101r*) in the chain (*silk*) of rank-holders (*man\u1e63abd\u0101r\u0101n*). \u2014 On such-and-such a date, in accordance with the Certificate (*Ta\u1e63d\u012bk*), this Memorandum (*Y\u0101d-d\u0101sh\u1e6d*) was penned.\n\nOne Thousand, *z\u0101t*.\nTwo Hundred, *suv\u0101r*.\n\nI. [Order of the Waz\u012br.]\n\nAfter comparing it with the Diary (*W\u0101ki\u02bfah*), let it be sent to the Office of Revision (*\u02bfArz-i-mukarrar*).\n\nII. [Report of the Event Writer.]\n\nAgrees with the diary (*W\u0101ki\u02bfah*).\n\nIII. [Order of the Superintendent of Revision, literally Renewed Petition (*\u02bfArz-i-mukarrar*).]\n\nOn such-and-such a date, of such-and-such a month, of such-and-such a year, it was brought up for the second time.\nIn the later notices of the system we find few mentions of the paper called in the \u0100jin (Blochmann, i, 258) the ta'likah, which was, it seems, an abridgment of the Yad-dasht. This paper the ta'likah, formed at that time the executive order issued to the officer concerned (\u0100jin, i, 255). I have found ta'likah used once in this sense as late as 1127 H. (1716), by Sayyad 'Abd-ul-Jalil, Bilgr\u0101mi, in his letters sent from Dihli to his son (\"Oriental Miscellany,\" Calcutta, 1798, p. 247).\n\nThe Ahad\u012bs.\u2014Midway between the nobles or leaders (mansabd\u0101rs) with the horsemen under them (t\u0101bin\u0101n) on the one hand, and the A\u1e25sh\u0101m, or infantry, artillery, and artificers on the other, stood the Ahad\u012b, or gentleman trooper. The word is literally 'single' or 'alone' (A. a\u1e25ad, one). It is easy to see why this name was applied to them; they offered their services singly, they did not attach themselves to any chief, thus forming a class apart from the t\u0101bin\u0101n; but as they were horsemen, they stood equally apart from the specialized services included under the remaining head of A\u1e25sh\u0101m. The title of Ahad\u012b was given, we are told (Seir, i, 262, note 201), to the men serving singly \"because they have the emperor for their immediate colonel.\" We sometimes come across the name Yakkah-t\u0101z (riding alone), which seems, when employed as the name of a class of troops, to mean the same body of men as the Ahad\u012bs. Horn, 20, 56, looks on the Ahad\u012bs as a sort of body-guard or corps d'\u00e9lite; and in some ways that view may be taken as true, though there was not, as I think, any formal recognition of them as such. The basis of their organization under Akbar is set out in \u0100jin 4 of Book ii (Blochmann, i, 249), and they are referred to in several other places (i, 20, 161, 231, 246, 536). In the strictest sense, the body-guard, or defenders of the imperial person, seem to have been the men known as the W\u0101l\u0101 Sh\u0101hi (literally, of or belonging to the Exalted King), and, no doubt, these are the four thousand men referred to by Manucci (\"Catrou,\" English ed. of 1826, p. 297) as 'the\nemperor's slaves.' Whether slaves or not, the *W\u0101l\u0101 Sh\u0101hi* were the most trusted troops of the reigning sovereign. From various passages I find that they were chiefly, if not entirely, men who had been attached to his person from his youth and had served under him while he was still only a royal prince, and were thus marked out in a special manner as his personal adherents and household troops. The *Yas\u0101wals* or armed palace guards were something like the *W\u0101l\u0101 Sh\u0101hi* so far as they were charged with the safety of the sovereign; but they differed from the latter in not having the same personal connection with him. The *Ah\u0101dis* received somewhat higher pay than common troopers. In one instance we are told expressly what those rates were in later times. On the 2nd \u1e62afar of his second year (1120 H. = 22nd April, 1708), Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h, as D\u0101nishmand Kh\u0101n tells us, ordered the enlistment of 4,700 extra *Ah\u0101dis* at Rs. 40 a month, the money to be paid from the Exchequer.\n\nTowards the end of the eighteenth century the household troops, we are told, *Seir*, i, 94, note 90, amounted to 40,000 men, all cavalry, but usually serving on foot in the citadel and in the palace. They consisted then of several corps besides the *Ah\u0101dis*, such as the *Surkh-posh* (wearers of red), the *Sult\u0101ni* (Royal), the *W\u0101l\u0101 Sh\u0101hi* (High Imperial), the *Kamal-posh* (Blanket Weavers). Haji Mustapha is not, however, quite consistent with himself, for elsewhere (*Seir*, i, 262, note 201), when naming still another corps, the *A\u02bfl\u0101 Sh\u0101hi* (Exalted Imperial), he asserts that the *Surkh-posh* were all infantry, eight thousand in number. The curious title used above, *Kamal-posh*, comes from the Hind\u012b word *kammal*, a coarse blanket, having also the secondary meaning of a kind of cuirass (*Seir*, i, 143, note 105). The latter is no doubt the signification here.\n\n---\n\n1 The word meant may be *Bandahh\u0101e*, or, perhaps preferably, the *K\u016bl*, the Chaghat\u0101i for 'slave.'\u2014P. de Courteille, 433.\nVI. Branding and Verification.\n\nFalse musters were an evil from which the Moghul army suffered even in its most palmy days. Nobles would lend each other the men to make up their quota, or needy idlers from the bazaars would be mounted on the first baggage pony that came to hand and counted in with the others as efficient soldiers. Great efforts were made to cope with this evil, and in the earlier times with some success. In the later reigns, notably from the middle of Muhammad Sh\u0101h\u2019s reign (1719\u20131748), all such precautions fell into abeyance, amid the general confusion and ever-deepening corruption.\n\nMustapha, the translator of the *Siyar-ul-Mut\u0101kharin*, gives us an instance of the length to which this cheating was carried (*Seir*, i, 609, note). In Bengal, in the year 1163 H. (1750), when \u2018Al\u012b Wird\u012b Kh\u0101n, Mah\u0101bat Jang, was n\u0101\u1e93im, an officer receiving pay for 1700 men could not muster more than seventy or eighty. Mustapha, who wrote in 1787\u20138, adds from his own experience\u2014\u201cSuch are, without exception, all the armies and all the troops of India; and were we to rate by this rule those armies of 50,000 and 100,000 that fought or were slaughtered at the decisive battles of Pal\u0101s\u012b [Plassey] and Baksar [Buxar] (and by some such rule they must be rated), we would have incredible deductions to make. Such a rule, however, would not answer for M\u012br K\u0101sim\u2019s troops (1760\u20131764), where there was not one single false muster, nor would it answer for \u1e24aidar \u2018Al\u012b\u2019s armies.\u201d\n\nIt was to put down these evil practices that the emperor Akbar revived and enforced more strictly than before a system of descriptive rolls of men and horses, the latter being branded with a hot iron before they were passed for service. This branding, with the consequent periodical musters for the purpose of comparison and verification, formed a separate department under the *Bakhshi* with its\nown superintendent (d\u0101roghah), and this was known as the d\u0101gh-o-ta\u1e63hi\u1e25ah, from d\u0101gh, a brand, a mark, and ta\u1e63hi\u1e25ah, verification. The usual phrase for enlisting was asp ba d\u0101gh ras\u0101nidan, \u201cbringing a horse to be branded.\u201d Branding was first introduced by \u2018Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Khilj\u012b in 712 H. = May, 1312 \u2013 April, 1313, but on his death it was dropped (Dast\u016br-ul-Insh\u0101, 233). The emperor Sher Sh\u0101h, Afgh\u0101n, started it again in 948 H. = April, 1541 \u2013 April, 1542. Akbar (\u0100jin, i, 233) re-established the practice in the eighteenth year of his reign (about 981 H., 1573\u20134), and it was continued until the time when the whole system of government finally broke down in the middle of the eighteenth century. At first many difficulties were made (Dast\u016br-ul-Insh\u0101, 234), and evasions were attempted, but at length the system was made effective. The great nobles, holding the rank of 5000 and upwards, were exempt from the operation of these rules; but when ordered, they were expected to parade their horsemen for inspection (Dast\u016br-ul-\u2018Aml, B.M., No. 6599, fol. 144b). The technical name for these parades was \u0101l\u0101 mahallah (Steingass, 1190), a word evidently connected with that used in Akbar\u2019s time for branding, viz. d\u0101gh-o-mahall\u0101 (\u0100jin, i, 242; Buddoni, ii, 190).\n\nAs said before, the recruit was supposed, at any rate so far as the State was concerned, to furnish his own horse. Orme states the case thus:\u2014\u201cEvery man brings his own horse and offers himself to be enlisted. The horse is carefully examined: and according to the size and value of the beast, the master receives his pay. A good horse will bring thirty or forty rupees a month. Sometimes an officer contracts for a whole troop. A horse in Indostan is of four times greater value than in Europe. If the horse is killed the man is ruined, a regulation that makes it the interest of the soldier to fight as little as possible.\u201d\u2014\u201cHistorical Fragments,\u201d 4to edition, 418. Along with his horse the man\nbrought his own arms and armour, the production of certain items of which was obligatory. In actual practice, however, the leaders often provided the recruits with their horses and equipment. When this was the case the leader drew the pay and paid the man whatever he thought fit. Such a man, who rode another's horse, was called a b\u0101ryir (load-taker); while a man riding his own horse was in modern times called a silahd\u0101r (weapon-holder). The latter word is the origin of the Anglo-Indian phrase of \"Sillidar cavalry,\" applied to men who are paid a lump sum monthly for themselves, horse, uniform, and equipment.\n\nDescriptive Rolls.\u2014When an officer entered the service (B.M. No. 6599, fol. 160a) a Chihrah or descriptive roll of the new mansabd\u0101r was first of all drawn up, showing his name, his father's name, his tribe or caste, his place of origin, followed by details of his personal appearance. His complexion might be \"wheat-colour\" (gandum-rang), \"milky,\" i.e. white (sh\u012br-f\u0101m), \"red\" (surkh-post), or \"auburn\" (maigun-rang). His forehead was always \"open\" (far\u0101gh); his eyebrows either full (kush\u0101dah) or in whole or in part moshah (?); his eyes were sheep-like (mish), deer-like (dh\u016b), ginger-coloured (ad rak), or cat's eyes (gurbah). His nose might be \"prominent\" (buland) or \"flat\" (past). He might be \"beardless\" (amrad) or \"slightly bearded\" (rish o barwat agh\u0101z); his beard might be black (rish o barwat siydh), or \"slightly red\" (siy\u0101h i maigun-num\u0101), \"thin\" (khall ?), marash (?), goat-shaped (kosah-i-khurd), or \"twisted up\" (shakikah). So with any moles he might have; the shape of his ears, whether projecting or not,\n\n1 Literally 'face,' 'countenance.' It must not be confounded with ch\u012bra\u1e25, which means (1) a kind of turban, (2) a pay-roll, on which the recipients signed, (3) the pay itself. Ch\u012bra\u1e25 is used in the second sense in Ahw\u0101l-ul-Kha\u1e63\u0101k\u012bn, fol. 230b; and also by Ghul\u0101m \u1e24asan, \u0160am\u012bn, when telling us of the taunt addressed in 1170 H. (1757) by \u0100\u1e25mad Kh\u0101n, Bangash, to Najib Kh\u0101n, Najib-ud-daulah, of having been once a private trooper in Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, where his pay-rolls (ch\u012bra\u1e25-h\u0101s) were still in existence.\nwhether the lobes were pierced or not, and whether he was pock-marked or not\u2014all these things were noted.\n\nRoll for Troopers.\u2014The troopers (\u1e6dab\u012bn\u0101n) were also described, but not quite so elaborately. A specimen is as follows (B.M. No. 6599, fol. 163a):\n\nTroopers\u2019 Roll (Chihrah-i-\u1e6cab\u012bn\u0101n).\n\nKamr \u2018Ali, son of Mir \u2018Ali, son of Kab\u012br \u2018Ali, wheat complexion, broad forehead, separated eyebrows, sheep\u2019s eyes, prominent nose, beard and moustache black, right ear lost from a sword-cut. Total height, about 40 sh\u0101nah.\n\nHorse.\u2014Colour kab\u016bd (iron-grey?). Mark on left of breast. Mark on thigh on mounting side. Laskar (?) on thigh on whip side. Brand of four-pointed stamp +\n\nDescriptive Roll of Horses (Chihrah-i-asp\u0101n).\n\nThe next thing done was to make out an elaborate description of the horse or horses (B.M. No. 6599, fol. 160b). There were twenty principal divisions according to colour, and eight of these were again subdivided, so that there were altogether fifty-eight divisions. Then there were fifty-two headings for the marks (kh\u0101l-o-khat) which might occur on the horse\u2019s body.\n\nThe Imperial Brand.\n\nThe hot iron was applied on the horse\u2019s thigh (Seir, i, 481, note 27). The signs used in Akbar\u2019s reign are given in the \u0100jin, i, 139, 255, 256; but in the end he adopted a system of numerals. In \u2018\u0100lamg\u012br\u2019s reign and about that time there were twenty different brands (tamghah), of which the shapes of fifteen have been preserved and are reproduced below (B.M. No. 6599, fol. 161a). I am not certain of the spelling, and in most instances I am utterly unable to suggest a meaning for the names.\n| Name                        | Form of Brand |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|\n| 1. Chah\u0101r parh\u0101 (four feather?) |               |\n| 2. Chah\u0101r parh\u0101 jomar-khaj   |               |\n| 3. Chah\u0101r parh\u0101 d\u016br khaj     |               |\n| 4.

Chah\u0101r b\u0101rah makar khaj  |               |\n\nThe Noble\u2019s Brand.\n\nIt is obvious that in addition to the imperial brand, a second mark was required by each noble for the recognition of the horses ridden by his own men. Accordingly we find direct evidence of this second marking in Bernier, 216, and again 243, when he speaks of the horses \u201cwhich bear the omrsh\u2019s mark on the thigh.\u201d Towards the end of the period the great nobles often had the first or last letter of their name as their special brand (*Seir*, i, 481, note 27), as, for instance, the\nsin-d\u0101gh (\u0633) of Sa\u2019dat \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, n\u0101\u1e93im of Audh. Ghul\u0101m \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n (B.M., Add. 24,028, fol. 63b) tells us that about 1153 H. (1740\u201341) Mu\u1e25ammad Ish\u0101q Kh\u0101n used the last letter of his name, a k\u0101f (\u0643), as his brand.\n\nClassification of Horses.\n\nAccording to the \u0100jin, i, 233, there were seven classes of horses founded on their breed\u2014(1) \u2018Arabi, (2) Persian, (3) Mujannas, resembling Persian, and mostly Turki or Persian geldings, (4) Turki, (5) Y\u0101b\u016b, (6) T\u0101zi, (7) Jangl\u0101h.\n\nIn \u2018\u0100lamg\u012br\u2019s reign we find (B.M. No. 6599, fol. 163a) the following classification: (1) \u2018Ir\u0101k\u012b, (2) Mujannas, (3) Turki, (4) Y\u0101b\u016b, (5) T\u0101zi, (6) Jangl\u0101h. This is practically the same as Akbar\u2019s, except that Arab horses are not mentioned. This must be an oversight, since we learn from many passages in the contemporary historians that Arab horses were still in use. The T\u0101zi and Jangl\u0101h were Indian horses, what we now call country-breds, the former being held of superior quality to the latter. The Y\u0101b\u016b was, I suppose, what we call now the K\u0101bul\u012b, stout-built, slow, and of somewhat sluggish temperament. The Turki was an animal from Bukh\u0101r\u0101 or the Oxus country; the \u2018Ir\u0101k\u012b came from Mesopotamia.\n\nIn \u2018\u0100lamg\u012br\u2019s reign the proportion in which officers of the different ranks were called on to present horses of these different breeds at the time of branding was as follows:\n\n| Rank of Officer | Class of Horse |\n|-----------------|---------------|\n|                 | \u2018Ir\u0101k\u012b | Mujannas | Turki | Y\u0101b\u016b | Total |\n| 400             | 3     | 1       | 1     | 0    | 5     |\n| 300\u2013350         | 2     | 1       | 1     | 0    | 4     |\n| 100\u2013150         | 0     | 0       | 3     | 0    | 3     |\n| 80\u201390           | 0     | 0       | 2     | 0    | 2     |\n| 50\u201370           | 0     | 0       | 1     | 1    | 2     |\n| 40              | 0     | 0       | 1     | 0    | 1     |\nThese figures differ from those in the Ain, i, 248-9, where the number of horses is given for all mansabs, up to the very highest.\n\nAccording as the standard was exceeded or not come up to, the branding officer made an allowance or deduction by a fixed table. This calculation was styled taf\u0101wat-i-aspa\u00f1 (discrepancy of horses)\u2014B.M. No. 6599, fol. 163a. The extra allowances were as follows:\n\n| Horse Required by Regulation | Horse Produced | Additional Allowance |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------------|\n| Turki                       | 'Ir\u0101ki        | Rs. 12              |\n| Turki                       | Mujannahs     | 6                   |\n| T\u0101zi                        | Turki         | 8                   |\n| Y\u0101b\u016b                        | Turki         | 9                   |\n\nWhen an inferior horse was produced the following deduction was made:\n\n| Horse Required by Regulation | Horse Produced | Deduction |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|-----------|\n| Turki                       | Jangli        | Rs. 12    |\n| Y\u0101b\u016b                        | Jangli        | 10        |\n| T\u0101zi                        | Jangli        | 8         |\n\nSubordinate Establishment.\n\nAn establishment of farriers, blacksmiths' forges, and surgeons had to be maintained by each mansabd\u0101r, according to the following scale (B.M. No. 1641, fol. 38b):\u2014\n### Numbers of Establishment\n\n| Rank of Officer | Farriers (Na'iband) | Blacksmiths' Shops (\u0100hangar) | Leeches or Surgeons (J\u0101r\u0101h) |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 4000            | 8                   | 2                             | 2                           |\n| 3600            | 7                   | 2                             | 2                           |\n| 3000            | 6                   | 2                             | 2                           |\n| 2500            | 5                   | 1                             | 0                           |\n| 2000            | 4                   | 1                             | 2                           |\n| 1500            | 3                   | 0                             | 1                           |\n| 1000            | 2                   | 0                             | 1                           |\n\nOr, according to a more recent scale:\n\n| Range          | Farriers | Blacksmiths' Shops | Leeches or Surgeons |\n|----------------|----------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| 1500\u20134000      | 6        | 3                  | 0                  |\n\n### Verification (Ta\u1e63\u1e25\u012b\u1e25ah)\n\nSomething on this subject will be found in the \u0100\u02bein, i, 250, where the reference is confined to the ah\u0101d\u012bs; Dr. Horn, so far as he goes into the matter at all, deals with it on p. 49 of his work. In later times, at all events, the rule of mustering and verification seems to have been of almost universal application. For example, in a work called the Guldastah-i-Bah\u0101r, a collection of letters from Chhabilah R\u0101m, N\u0101gar, compiled in 1139 H. (1726\u20137), of which I possess a fragment, I find on fol. 18a an instance of the verification rules being enforced against a mansabd\u0101r in the end of Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h\u2019s reign (1118\u201324 H.). Chhabilah R\u0101m, who was then faujd\u0101r of Karrah M\u0101nikpur (\u0161\u016bbah Allah\u0101b\u0101d), complains to his patron that the clerks had caused his j\u0101g\u012br, in parganah J\u0101jm\u0101u, bringing in ten lakhs of d\u0101ms, to be taken away from him, because he had not produced vouchers of d\u0101gh-o-ta\u1e63\u1e25\u012b\u1e25ah. He sends the papers by a special messenger, and prays his correspondent, some influential man at Court, to obtain the restoration of the j\u0101g\u012br in question.\nThe intervals after which verification was imperative differed according to the nature of the man's pay. If he were paid in *j\u00e1gir*, he had to muster his men for verification once a year, and, in addition, a period of six months' grace was allowed. If the officer were paid in *nakd* (cash), the time allowed depended upon whether he was\u2014(1) present at Court (*h\u00e1zir-i-rik\u00e1b*), or (2) on duty elsewhere (*ta'in\u00e1t*). In the first case he had to procure his certificate at six-month intervals, or within eight months at the outside. In the second case he was allowed fifteen days after he had reported himself at Court. An *ah\u00e1di* seems to have been allowed, in a similar case, no more than seven days. Where an officer drew his pay partly in *j\u00e1gir* (assignment) and partly in *nakd* (cash), if the former made more than half the total pay, the rule for *j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs* was followed; if the *j\u00e1gir* were less than half, the *nakd\u00ed* rule was followed. (B.M. 1641, fols. 31a, 39b.)\n\nWhen the interval and the period of grace had elapsed, the man was reported for *tawakkuf-i-ta\u015fhih\u00e1h* (delay in verification). A *man\u015fabd\u00e1r* lost the whole of his pay for the period since the last verification; or, if he were important enough to have been presented to the emperor (*r\u016b-shin\u00e1\u0161*, known by sight), he might succeed in obtaining his personal pay. An *ah\u00e1di* lost half his pay, and it was only by an order on a special report that he could be excused the penalty. The proportion of horsemen (*t\u00e1bin\u00e1n*) that a *man\u015fabd\u00e1r* must produce differed when he was at Court and when he was on duty in the provinces. In the first case he was bound to muster one-fourth, and in the second one-third, of his total number. There were three seasons appointed for verification, from the 26th Shaww\u00e1l to the 15th Z\u016bl Ka'dh (twenty days), the 19th \u1e62afar to the 15th Rabi' I (twenty-five days), and the 16th Jam\u0101d\u012b II to the 15th Rajab (twenty-nine days). (B.M. 1641, fols. 31a, 39b, 58b; B.M. 6599, fol. 148a.)\nVII. The Different Branches of the Service.\n\nAlthough in writing this paper I think it better to retain the divisions of the original authorities, who distribute the army into mansabdars with their tabin\u0101n, ahadis, and ahsh\u0101m, it is quite true that, as Dr. Horn says, p. 11, the Moghul army consisted of cavalry, infantry, and artillery. But the second and third branches held a very subordinate position towards the first. The army was essentially an army of horsemen. The Moghuls from beyond the Oxus were accustomed to fight on horseback only; the foot-soldier they despised; and in artillery they never became very proficient. Until the middle of the eighteenth century, when the French and English had demonstrated the vast superiority of disciplined infantry, the Indian foot-soldier was little more than a night-watchman, and guardian over baggage, either in camp or on the line of march. Under the Moghuls, as Orme justly says (\"Hist. Frag.,\" 4to, p. 418), the strain of all war rested upon the numbers and goodness of the horse which were found in an army.\n\nThere was no division into regiments. Single troopers, as we have already said, enlisted under the banner of some man a little richer or better known than themselves. These inferior leaders again joined greater commanders, and thus, by successive aggregations of groups, a great noble's division was gathered together. But from the highest to the lowest rank, the officer or soldier looked first to his immediate leader and followed his fortunes, studying his interests rather than those of the army as a whole. It was not till quite the end of the period that, under the influence of European example, and also partly in imitation of the Persian invaders, it became usual for the great nobles to raise and equip at their own expense whole regiments without the intervention\n\n1 For remarks to the same general effect, see W. Erskine, \"History,\" ii, 540.\nof petty chiefs. In Audh, Safdar Jang and Shuj\u0101\u2018-ud-Daulah had such regiments, as, for instance, the Kissilb\u0101sh, the Sher-bachah, and others, which were all clad alike, and apparently were mounted and equipped by the Naw\u0101b himself.\n\nWhen Akbar introduced the man\u1e63ab system, which ranked his officers according to the number of men supposed to be under the command of each, these figures had possibly some connection with the number of men present under those officers\u2019 orders, and actually serving in the army (Horn, 39). But it is tolerably certain that this connection between the two things did not endure very long: it was, I should say, quite at an end by the reign of Sh\u0101hjah\u0101n (1627\u201358). Indeed, if the totals of all the personal (z\u0101t) man\u1e63abs in existence at one time were added together, we should arrive at so huge an army that it would have been impossible for the country, however heavily taxed, to meet such an expense. If paid in cash, the army would have absorbed all the revenue; if paid by assignments, all the land revenue would have gone direct into the hands of the soldiery, leaving next to nothing to maintain the Court or meet the expenses of the other branches of the government. The inference I wish to draw is, that from the grant of rank it does not follow that the soldiers implied by such rank were really added to the army. The system required that a man\u2019s rank should be stated in terms of so many soldiers; but there is abundant testimony in the later historians that man\u1e63ab and the number of men in the ranks of the army had ceased to have any close correspondence.\n\nThus it seems to me a hopeless task to attempt, as Dr. Horn does, p. 39, following Blochmann (\u0100jin, i, 244\u20137), to build up the total strength of the army from the figures giving the personal (z\u0101t) rank of the officers (man\u1e63abd\u0101rs). The difficulty would still exist, even if we had sufficiently reliable accounts of the number of such officers on the list at any one time. For we must remember that the number of men kept up by any officer was incessantly varying. On a campaign, or on\nactive employment in one of the provinces, either as its governor or in a subordinate position, an officer kept up a large force, generally as many as, if not more than, he could find pay for. On the other hand, while attached to the Court at Dihli, his chief or only duty might be to attend the emperor's public audience twice a day (a duty which was very sharply enforced), and take his turn in mounting guard at the palace. For duties of this sort a much smaller number of men would suffice. If we reckoned the number of men in the suwar rank, for whom allowances at so much per man were given by the State to the mansabdars, we might obtain a safer estimate of the probable strength of the army. But for this also materials fail, and in spite of musterings and brandings, we may safely assume that very few mansabdars kept up at full strength even the quota of horsemen (tabinans) for which they received separate pay. In these matters the difference between one noble and another was very great. While one man maintained his troops at their full number, all efficiently mounted and equipped, another would evade the duty altogether. As, for instance, one writer, Khushal Chand, in his Nadir-us-samani (B.M. Or. 1844, fol. 140a) says: Lutfullah Khan Sadik, although he held the rank of 7,000, \"never entertained even seven asses, much less horses or riders on horses.\" In Muhammad Shah's reign he lived quietly at home at Panipat, 30 or 40 miles from Dihli, his attention engrossed by his efforts to get hold of all the land for many miles round that town, and passing his days, in spite of his great nominal rank, like a mere villager.\n\nIt seems to me equally hopeless to attempt a reconstruction of the force actually present at any particular battle by adding together the numerical rank held by the commanders who were at that battle. This Dr. Horn has tried to do on p. 67, without feeling satisfied with the results. But, as far as I can see, there was little, if any, connection between the two matters. The truth is that, like all things in Oriental countries, there existed no rules which were\nnot broken in practice. A man of high rank would, no doubt, be selected for the command of a division. But it was quite an accident whether that division had more or fewer men in it than the number in his nominal rank. The strength of a division depended upon the total number of men available, and the extent of the contingents brought into the field by such subordinate leaders as might be put under the orders of its commander. It was altogether a matter of accident whether the number of men present corresponded or not to the rank of the commanders.\n\nBernier, 43, has an excellent remark on the vague way that numbers were dealt with by historians: \"Camp-followers and bazar-dealers . . . I suspect, are often included in the number of combatants.\" Again, on p. 380, he seems to come to the conclusion that it would be a fair estimate to take the fighting men at about one-third of the total numbers in a Moghul camp. I have seen somewhere (I have lost the reference, but I think it was in Kh\u0101f\u012b Kh\u0101n) an admission that the gross number of a so-called \"fauj\" (army) was always reckoned as including no more than one-third or one-fourth that number of fighting men. I give below, for what they are worth, a tabular summary of Dr. Horn's figures (pp. 39-45)\u2014\n\n| Period     | Cavalry | Matchlockmen and Infantry | Artillery-men | Authority                  |\n|------------|---------|---------------------------|--------------|----------------------------|\n| Akbar      | 12,000  | 12,000                    | 1000         | Blochmann, i, 246.         |\n| Do.        | 384,758 | 3,877,557                 |              | \u0100jin-i-Akbari.\u00b9             |\n| Sh\u0101hjih\u0101n  | 200,000 | 40,000                    |              | Badsh\u0101hn\u0101mah, ii, 715; \u0100jin, i, 244. |\n| Aurangzeb | 240,000 | 15,000                    |              | Bernier.                   |\n| Do.        | 300,000 | 600,000                   |              | Catrou.                    |\n| Mhd.

Equipment\u2014(A) Defensive Armour.\n\nThe generic name for arms and armour was *sil\u0101h*, plural *asl\u0101h* (Steingass, 693). Weapons and armour of all kinds were much prized in India, much taste and ingenuity being expended on their adornment. Every great man possessed a choice collection. The following extract describes that of the Naw\u0101b Waz\u012br at Lakhnau, in 1785:\u2014\"But beyond everything curious and excellent in the Naw\u0101b\u2019s possession are his arms and armour. The former consist of matchlocks, fuzees, rifles, fowling-pieces, sabres, pistols, scymitars, spears, syefs (long straight swords), daggers, poniards, battle-axes, and clubs, most of them fabricated in Indostan, of the purest steel, damasked or highly polished, and ornamented in relief or intaglio with a variety of figures or foliage of the most delicate pattern. Many of the figures are wrought in gold and silver, or in marquetry, with small gems. The hilts of the swords, etc., are agate, chrysolite, lapus-lazuli, chalcedony, blood-stone, and enamel, or steel inlaid with gold,\ncalled *tynashee* or *koft* work. The armour is of two kinds, either of helmets and plates of steel to secure the head, back, breast, and arms, or of steel network, put on like a shirt, to which is attached a netted hood of the same metal to protect the head, neck, and face. Under the network are worn linen garments quilted thick enough to resist a sword. On the crown of the helmet are stars or other small device, with a sheath to receive a plume of feathers. The steel plates are handsomely decorated with gold wreaths and borders, and the network fancifully braided.\" (\"Asiatic Miscellany,\" i, 393. Calcutta, 1795. 4to.)\n\nThe fines for not producing at inspection a man's own armour and that of his elephant (*p\u0101khar*) were as follows (B.M. 6,599, fol. 162a):\n\n| Rank of Officer | Amount of Fine for Non-Production of |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                 | Headpiece (*Kh\u016bd*). | Body Armour (*Baktar*). | Elephant Armour (*P\u0101khar*). | Greaves (*R\u0101n\u0101k*). | Harhai (?) |\n| Rs. a. p.       | Rs. a. p.            | Rs. a. p.              | Rs. a. p.                  | Rs. a. p.          | Rs. a. p. |\n| 400             | 2 0 0                | 5 0 0                  | 4 0 0                     | 2 0 0              | 1 0 0    |\n| 350             | 2 0 0                | 4 0 0                  | 3 12 0                    | 1 12 0             | 0 15 0   |\n| 300             | 1 12 0               | 4 0 0                  | 3 8 0                     | 1 8 0              | 0 14 0   |\n| 250             | 1 8 0                | 3 8 0                  | 3 4 0                     | 1 4 0              | 0 13 0   |\n| 200             | 1 0 0                | 3 0 0                  | 3 0 0                     | 1 0 0              | 0 12 0   |\n\nArmour was worn by all horsemen who could afford it; nay, officers of a certain rank were required to produce it at the time of inspection, subject to a fine if it were not forthcoming. Its use was never discontinued; it was even worn by men of European descent when they entered the native service. For instance, James Skinner, writing of the year 1797, says, \"as I was exercising my horse in full armour\" (Fraser, \"Memoirs,\" i, 125); and again, \"I was only saved by my armour\" (id. 127). George Thomas,\n\n---\n\n1 Read *sari-asp* in B.M. 1641, fol. 37a, but to neither reading can I assign a meaning.\nIrish adventurer, also wore armour (id. 229). Nor is the use of armour entirely discontinued even to this day, as those can testify who saw the troops of the Bundelkhand States paraded before the Prince of Wales at Agra in January, 1876.\n\nThe armour was worn as follows (W. Egerton, 112, note to No. 440):\u2014Depending from the cuirass was generally a skirt, which was at times of velvet embroidered with gold. Underneath the body armour was worn a kabchah,\\(^1\\) or jacket quilted and slightly ornamented. Silken trousers and a pair of kashmir shawls round the waist completed the costume of a nobleman of high rank. As to these quilted coats, we are told elsewhere (Seir, i, 624, note) that \"common soldiers wore an ample upper garment, quilted thick with cotton, coming down as far as the knee. These coats would deaden the stroke of a sabre, stop the point of an arrow, and above all kept the body cool by intercepting the rays of the sun.\" Or as a still later writer tells us (Fitzclarence, \"Journal,\" 143)\\(^2\\):\u2014\"The irregular cavalry throughout India are mostly dressed in quilted cotton jackets; though the best of these habiliments are not, as I supposed, stuffed with cotton, but are a number of cotton cloths quilted together. This serves as a defensive armour, and when their heads are swathed round, and under the chin, with linen to the thickness of several folds, it is almost hopeless with the sword to make an impression upon them. They also at times stuff their jackets with the refuse silk of the cocoons, which they say will even turn a ball.\" This habit of swathing the body in protective armour till little beyond a man's eyes could be seen, gives the point to the scoffing remark of D\u0101\u016bd Kh\u0101n, Panni, at\n\n\\(^1\\) Apparently the diminutive of \u1e33ab\u0101, a close long gown or shirt (Steingass, 950).\n\n\\(^2\\) Lieut.-Col. Fitzclarence was, I believe, created Earl of Munster in 1831, and if so, he is the Lord Munster referred to by Dr. Horn on p. 8 as the author of a series of questions on Mahomedan military usages. His \"Journal,\" the work of a close observer and graphic writer, proves that he was quite competent to write for himself, and not merely \"schreiben zu lassen,\" the history that he had planned.\nthe battle against \u1e24usain \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, fought on the 8th Sha\u2018b\u0101n, 1127 H. (6th Sept., 1715), that his assailant, one M\u012br Mushrif, \u201ccame out to meet him like a bride or a woman, with his face hidden\u201d (Ghul\u0101m \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, Mukaddamah-i-Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam-n\u0101mah, fol. 22b).\n\nI now proceed to describe each part of the armour, seriatim, beginning with the helmet.\n\nKh\u016bd, Dabalghah, or Top.\u2014This was a steel headpiece with a vizor or nose-guard. There are several specimens in the Indian Museum; and in W. Egerton, \u201cHandbook,\u201d several of these are figured, Nos. 703 and 704 on plate xiii, No. 703 on p. 134, and another, No. 591, on p. 125. Kh\u016bd is the more usual name, but dabalghah is the word used in the \u0100jin (Blochmann, I, iii, No. 52, and plate xiii, No. 43). The latter is Chaghatae for a helmet; and Pavet de Courteille gives four forms, \u062f\u0628\u0627\u063a\u0647, \u062f\u0628\u0627\u063a\u0647, \u062f\u0628\u0627\u063a\u0647, \u062f\u0628\u0627\u063a\u0647 (p. 317), and \u062f\u0628\u0627\u063a\u0647 (p. 322). I have only met with it once in an eighteenth-century writer (Ahwal-ul-Khaw\u0101kin, c. 1147 H., fol. 161b), and then under the form of \u062f\u0628\u0627\u063a\u0647, dabalghah. Top, for a helmet, appears several times in Egerton; for instance, on p. 119 and p. 125. This is apparently an Indian word (Shakes., 73), \u062a\u0648\u0628, which must be distinguished from the word top, \u062a\u0648\u0628, a cannon, to which a Turkish origin is assigned. A helmet seems to have been called a top by the Mahrattas and in Mais\u016br; but the word is not used by writers in Northern India. If we disregard the difference between \u062a\u0648\u0628 and \u062a\u0648\u0628, then we can derive top, \u2018a helmet,\u2019 and topi, \u2018a hat,\u2019 as does the compiler of the \u201cMadras Manual of Administration,\u201d iii, 915, from the ordinary Hindi word topna, \u2018to cover up.\u2019 But I hardly think this is legitimate.\n\nKhoghi.\u2014The next name to the dabalghah on the \u0100jin list, the khoghi, No. 58, must be something worn on the head; but there is no figure of it, and I fail to identify the word in that form. From the spelling it is evidently of Hindi origin; and a note in the Persian text has ghokhi as an alternative reading. Has it anything to do with ghoghi, a pocket, a pouch, a wallet (Shakespear, 1756), or\ngh\u016bngh\u012b, cloths folded and put on the head as a defence against the rain (Shakes., 1758)? The latter may point to a solution: the khoghi, or, better, the gh\u016bgh\u012b, may have been folds of cloth adjusted on the head to protect it from a sword blow.\n\nMighfar is defined (Steingass, 1281) as mail, or a network of steel worn under the cap or hat, or worn in battle as a protection for the face, also a helmet. It is evidently the long piece of mail hanging down from the helmet over the neck and back, as shown in No. 45, plate xii, of the \u0100\u02bein, vol. i, and called there and on p. 111, No. 54, the zirihkul\u0101h (cap of mail). It was through the mighfar that, according to Ghul\u0101m \u2019Al\u012b Kh\u0101n\u2019s history, the arrow passed which wounded \u2019Abdullah Kh\u0101n, K\u016b\u1e6db-ul-Mulk, just before he was taken a prisoner at the battle of \u1e24asanpur (13th Nov., 1720), and the following verse brings in the word, as also the joshan:\n\nChah y\u0101re kunad mighfar o joshan-am,\nCh\u016bn B\u0101r\u012b na kard akhtar roshan-am.\n\n\u201cWhat aid to me is vizor and coat of mail,\n\u201cWhen God has not made my star to shine.\u201d\u00b9\n\nBaktar or Bagtar.\u2014This is the name for body armour in general, whether it were of the cuirass (chah\u0101r-\u0101\u02beinah) or chain-mail (zirih) description. Steingass, 195, defines it as a cuirass, a coat of mail. See also the Dast\u016br-ul-Insh\u0101, 228. The bagtar is No. 58 in the \u0100\u02bein list (i, 112), and is shown as No. 47 on plate xii. From the figure it may be inferred that, in a more specific sense, baktar was the name for fish-scale armour. Bargustu\u010d\u0101n, as Mr. H. Beveridge has pointed out to me, is a general name for armour used in the \u1e6cabak\u0101t-i-N\u0101\u1e63iri, text 119\n\n\u00b9 Mukaddamah-i-Sh\u0101h \u2019\u0100lam-n\u0101mah by Ghul\u0101m \u2019Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, B.M. Add. 24,028, fol. 40a. The last line probably contains an allusion to Roshan Akhtar, the original name of Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h, to whom \u2019Abdullah Kh\u0101n succumbed.\n(Raverty, 466 and note); but that work belongs to a period long before the accession of the Moghuls. Steingass, 178, restricts bargustuw\u00e2n to horse armour worn in battle: the Ahw\u00e2l-i-Khaw\u00e2kin, fol. 218b, applies it to the armour worn by elephants, and I have found it in no other late writer.\n\nChah\u00e2r-d\u00eenah.\u2014This is literally 'four mirrors': it consisted of four pieces, a breast plate and a back plate, with two smaller pieces for the sides. All four were connected together with leather straps. Steingass, 403, has 'a kind of armour.' It is No. 50 in the \u00c2jin, i, 112, and figure No. 49 on plate xiii. It is also shown in Egerton, plate ix, and again on p. 144. The specimens in the Indian Museum are No. 364 (p. 103), 450, 452 (p. 112), 569, 570 (p. 119), 587 (p. 124), 707 (p. 135), 764 (p. 144).\n\nZirih.\u2014This was a coat of mail with mail sleeves, composed of steel links (Dast\u00fbr-ul-Insha, 228). The coat reached to the knees (W. Egerton, 125, note to No. 591). It is No. 57 in the \u00c2jin, i, 112, and No. 46 on plate xiii of that volume. There are six examples in the Indian Museum\u2014W.E. 361, 362 (p. 103), 453 (p. 112), 591, 591 T (p. 125), 706 (p. 135). Apparently, judging from the plate in the \u00c2jin, the baktar (fish scales) or the chah\u00e2r d\u00eenah (cuirass) was worn over the sirih. W. H. Tone, \"Maratta People,\" 61, note, gives a word beuta as the Mahratta name for the chain-mail shirt that they wore. I cannot identify or trace this word.\n\nJaibah.\u2014Blochmann, \u00c2jin, i, 111, No. 56, and his note 4, says it was a general name for armour. He gives no figure of it. Erskine, \"History,\" ii, 187, has jaba. Steingass, 356, says it is from the Arabic jubbat, and spells it jubah, a coat of mail, a cuirass, any kind of iron armour. The word is used in the '\u00c2lamg\u00eern\u00e2mah, 245, l. 7:\u2014\"tan ba seb-i-jabah o joshan pair\u00e2stah\"\u2014\"body adorned with the decoration of jabah and joshan.\" It is also used in Ahw\u00e2l-ul-Khaw\u00e2kin (c. 1147 A.D.), fol. 164a, in the form jaibah.\nOther items of body armour (Dast\u00fcr-ul-Insh\u0101, 228) were the joshan, the jihlam, the angarkhah, the daghlah. In other authorities we also meet with the \u015b\u0101diki, the ko\u1e6dhi, the bhanj\u016b, and the salhkaba. Of the last, the salhkaba, \u0100jin, No. 66, we have no figure, and I am unable to identify it, as I have never seen the word elsewhere. Other words which have defied identification are harhai, as I read it (B.M. 6599, fol. 162a; B.M. 1641, fol. 37a), and three articles in the Dast\u00fcr-ul-Insh\u0101, p. 228, which I read s\u016bbi, malk, and masari. We have also the kamal, the ghughawah, the kanth\u0101-sobh\u0101. Finally, there were the dastw\u0101nah or arm-pieces, the r\u0101nak or greaves, and the mosah-i-\u0101hani, a smaller pattern of leg-piece.\n\nJoshan.\u2014This is No. 59 of the \u0100jin list, p. 112, and is figured as No. 48 on plate xiii. It appears to be a steel breastplate extending to the region of the stomach and bowels. Blochmann, p. xi, calls it an armour for chest and body; Steingass translates more vaguely \u2018a coat of mail.\u2019\n\nJihlam.\u2014According to the dictionary (Shakes., 825), this is the Hind\u012b for armour, coat of mail, vizor of helmet; but I do not know what was its special nature or form. Steingass, 405, has chahlam, a sort of armour; also chihal-tah, a coat of mail. K\u0101m R\u0101j, 58b, has a passage\u2014\u201cMir Mushrif came quickly and lifted his jihlam from his face.\u201d This makes the word equivalent to vizor. It is not in the \u0100jin.\n\nAngarkhah.\u2014Hindi for a coat, possibly identical with that sometimes called an alkh\u0101li\u1e33 (a tight-fitting coat). Probably this coat was wadded so as to turn a sword-cut. It is No. 63 of the \u0100jin, i, 112, and figure No. 52 of plate xiv, where we see it a long, loose, wide coat worn over the armour.\n\nDaghlah or Dagla.\u2014The second of these is the Hindi form of the word. It was a coat of quilted cloth.\n\nChihilkad.\u2014This is No. 67 of the \u0100jin, 112, and is shown as figure No. 54 on plate xiv. Mu\u1e25ammad Kasim, \u0100hw\u0101l-\nul-Khaw\u0101k\u012bn, 161b, spells it \u0644\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0644\u064e\u062d\u064e, chalk\u0101t. It was a doublet worn over the armour, and possibly identical with the chilt\u0101, literally forty-folds (Shakespear, 884; Steingass, 398).\n\n\u1e62\u0101d\u012bk\u012b.\u2014\u0100jin, 112, No. 62, and No. 51 on plate xiv, a coat of mail something like the joshan in shape, but with epaulettes.\n\nKothi.\u2014We have this in the \u0100jin, 112, No. 61, and it appears on plate xiv, No. 50, as a long coat of mail worn under the breastplate and opening down the front.\n\nBhanj\u016b.\u2014This is No. 64 of the \u0100jin list, i, 112, but I have never seen the word anywhere else; it must be a Hind\u012b word, but it is not in Shakespear's Dictionary. The only figure is the one reproduced from Langl\u00e8s by Egerton, No. 9 on plate i, opposite p. 23. This might be almost anything; the nearest resemblance I can suggest is that of a sleeveless jacket.\n\nKamal.\u2014This word is literally 'a blanket,' and from it the corps known as the kamal-posh (blanket-wearers) derived its name. The word seems to have had the secondary meaning of a cuirass or wadded coat, possibly made of blanketing on the outside. There were wadded coats of quilted cotton, as well as of wool, which would stand the stroke of a sabre. Some stuffed with silk refuse were considered capable of withstanding a bullet (Seir, i, 143, note 105). This sort of protection was very common. \"Almost every soldier in the service of a native power has his head secured by many folds of cotton cloth, which not only pass round but likewise over it and under the chin; and a protection for the back of the neck is provided of similar materials. The jacket is composed of cotton thickly quilted between cloths, and so substantial as almost to retain the shape of the body like stiff armour. To penetrate this covering with the edge of the sword was to be done only by the practice of cutting.\" (Valentine Blacker, \"War,\" 302.)\n\nGh\u016bghwah.\u2014This must, from its position in the \u0100jin list, No. 55, be some kind of armour, but I cannot identify the word, which is of Hind\u012b form. In plate xiii, No. 44,\nthe thing is shown as a long coat and cowl of mail, all in one piece. In Egerton's plate (No. i, figure 4) it is something quite different, of a shape which it is difficult to describe, and for which it is still more difficult to suggest a use. The word seems to have some affinity to khoghi or ghughi (see ante). It represents the Eastern Hindi form of ghogh\u0101, following the usual rule of vowel modification, thus: H. H., gh\u014dr\u0101; E. H., ghurw\u0101 'a horse.' There being also a slight indication of the diminutive in this form, ghughw\u0101 would be a small ghogh\u0101. There is a chain epaulette shown in one of the plates in R\u00f6ckstuhl and Gille, which suggests the shape of the ghughw\u0101 figured by Egerton, and possibly that was its purpose.\n\nKanth\u0101-sobh\u0101.\u2014This is No. 70 in the list in the \u0100jin, 112, and, as we can see from figure 7 on plate i of W. Egerton's catalogue, it was a neck-piece or gorget. No. 69 (r\u0101nak) and No. 71 (mozah-i-\u0101hani) are both worn by the man and not the horse; then why does Blochmann, in his note, suggest that No. 70 (kanth\u0101-sobh\u0101) was attached to the horse's neck? The derivation is from kanth\u0101 (Shakes., 1616) a necklace, and sobh\u0101, id. 1338, ornament, dress, decoration.\n\nDastuc\u0101nah.\u2014This was a gauntlet, or mailed glove, with steel arm-piece. It is No. 68 of the \u0100jin, 112, and is shown as No. 55 on plate xiv. The specimens in the Indian Museum are Nos. 452, 453, 454, 455 (Egerton, p. 112), 568, 570 (id. 119), 587, 590 (id. 124), 745 (id. 139). Three of these are shown, two on plate xii, opposite p. 122, and one on plate xiv, opposite p. 136.\n\nR\u0101nak.\u2014In the \u0100jin list, 112, No. 69, appears the word r\u0101k or r\u0101g, which is quite unmeaning. When we turn to No. 56 on Blochmann's plate xiv, we see that the thing itself is an iron leg-piece or greave. Now, wherever there are lists of armour in the MS. Dast\u016br-ul-'\u0100ml, I find a word \u0631\u0627\u06a9, which is invariably shown with a fourth letter of some sort; it might be read r\u0101tak, r\u0101lak, r\u0101nak, but never r\u0101k. As r\u0101n means in Persian the 'thigh,' I propose to substitute for Blochmann's r\u0101k the reading r\u0101nak,\nthe diminutive ending being used to denote relation or connection, a formation like *dastak* (little hand), a short written order, fit to be (as it were) carried in the hand. The word *r\u0101nak* is not in Steingass.\n\n*Mozah-i-dhani.*\u2014This \"iron-stocking\" is No. 71 on page 112 of the \u0100jin, and No. 56 on plate xiv. It is a smaller form of the *r\u0101nak*.\n\n*Patkah.*\u2014I find in Ghul\u0101m \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n, *Mukaddamah*, fol. 38b, an epithet \u067e\u06cc\u06a9\u0647 \u067e\u0648\u0634\u0627\u0646, *patkah-posh\u0101n*, applied to both Sayyads and horse-breakers (*ch\u0101buk-suwar\u0101n*). It appears to refer to some part of military equipment, but what it is I do not know. It is evidently used in a depreciatory sense.\n\nHaving enumerated the man's defensive armour, we go on to that of the horse. The elephant armour I will leave till we come to the special heading devoted to those animals.\n\n*Kaj\u012bm.*\u2014This is in \u0100jin, 112, No. 72 (*kajem*), and is shown as figure No. 57 on plate xiv. Erskine, \"History,\" ii, 187, has the form *kichim*. It was a piece of armour for the hind-quarters of a horse, and was put on over a quilted cloth called *artak-i-kaj\u012bm* (\u0100jin, 112, No. 73).\n\nThe other pieces of armour for the horse were the frontlet (*kashk\u0101h*: \u0100jin, 112, No. 74, and plate xiv, No. 60) and the neck-piece (*gardani*: \u0100jin, 112, No. 75). Blochmann's description of the latter (p. 112, note 3) does not seem very appropriate, as he makes it a thing which hangs down in front of the horse's chest. *Gardani*, however, is the name still applied to the head and neck-piece, the hood, of a set of horse-clothing. It is the neck-shaped piece in figure No. 58 of Blochmann's plate xiv, and is separately shown in Egerton's plate i, figure No. 3. *Kashk\u0101h* is the word used in Persian for the Hindu sect-mark or *tilak*, applied on the centre of the forehead. R. B. Shaw, J.A.S. Bengal for 1878, p. 144, gives it as the Eastern Turki for an animal's forehead.\n\nHorse trappings were often most richly adorned with silver or gold, embroidery or jewels. When so enriched they were styled *s\u0101s-i-til\u0101e*, or *s\u0101s-i-mar\u0101\u1e63\u1e63a'*. The names\nof the various articles are as follows (W. Egerton, 125): pallah (headstall) and 'in\u0101n (reins), zerband (martingale), dumch\u012b (crupper), khogir (saddle), \u012bstak (shabraque), b\u0101l\u0101tang (surcingle), rik\u0101b (stirrups), shik\u0101rband (ornamental tassels at corners of saddle). The list of stable requisites can be seen in \u0100jin, i, 136.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. THE T\u0100J OR RED CAP OF THE SH\u012a\u2018AHS.\n\nDresden,\nApril 21, 1896.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Two days ago, while translating a Persian MS. entitled \"Bas\u0101tin-us-Sal\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn\"\u2014a history of the \u2018\u0100dil Sh\u0101h\u012b kings of Bij\u0101pur\u2014I met the following passage, which occurs in the account of the reign of Isma\u2018\u012bl \u2018\u0100dil Sh\u0101h, the second king of the dynasty:\n\n\"He ordered all the soldiers in his army to wear on their heads the red t\u0101j [cap] of twelve notches [tarak]; and whoever did not wear the t\u0101j was not allowed to come to the sal\u0101m [lev\u00e9e]. Moreover, in that reign it was impossible for anyone to go to and fro in the city without the t\u0101j. If anyone chanced to be seen without a t\u0101j he was punished by the King. This custom continued to the end of the reign of Isma\u2018\u012bl Sh\u0101h.\"\n\nIt was a curious coincidence that the very day after translating this passage I received my copy of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for April, and in Dr. Denison Ross\u2019 paper on \"The Early Years of Sh\u0101h Isma\u2018\u012bl,\" I read on pp. 254\u20135 what appears to be the traditionary account of the origin of the red caps mentioned above.\n\nI have in my possession a small history of the \u2018\u0100dil Sh\u0101h\u012b dynasty, entitled \"Guldastah-i-Bij\u0101pur,\" which gives a likeness of each of the kings, and Isma\u2018\u012bl \u2018\u0100dil Sh\u0101h is represented wearing a head-dress corresponding to the description of the t\u0101j.\nIsma'il\u2014like his father, Yusuf '\u0100dil Sh\u0101h\u2014was a Sh\u012b'ah; but his father was a tolerant one, and Isma'il extremely bigoted. The prime minister, Kam\u0101l Kh\u0101n, was a Sunni, and whilst he held the reins of government during the minority of Isma'il, he restored the Sunni faith; but when Isma'il, after the assassination of Kam\u0101l Kh\u0101n, assumed the government himself, one of his first acts was to re-introduce the Sh\u012b'ah religion; and it was in connection with this that he ordered the wearing of the red t\u0101j of twelve points, doubtless symbolical of the twelve Im\u0101ms. Sh\u0101h Isma'il \u0160af\u0101vi and Isma'il '\u0100dil Sh\u0101h were contemporaries, and the former sent an embassy to the Court of the latter.\u2014Yours faithfully,\n\nJ. S. King (Major).\n\nTo the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n2. Parsee Punchayet.\n\n131, Hornby Road, Bombay,\nMarch 6, 1896.\n\nTo the President of the Royal Asiatic Society, London.\n\nSir,\u2014I am directed by the Trustees of the Parsee Punchayet to request you to be good enough to bring the following matter to the notice of your Oriental scholars travelling through and taking interest in Central Asia.\n\nYou know that the regions of Central Asia were once either inhabited by the ancient Zoroastrians, or were under their direct or indirect influence. So the Parsees, or the modern Zoroastrians, being the descendants of those ancient Zoroastrians, take an interest in these regions. They would welcome any information obtained in these regions that would throw some light on their ancient literature and on the manners, customs, and history of their ancient fatherland of Iran. If your scholars and travellers will put themselves in literary communication in English with us, their contribution on these subjects will be very gratefully received. The Trustees will be glad to patronize any publication in English treating of the researches in these\nregions from an Iranian point of view.\u2014I have the honour to be, sir, your most obedient servant,\n\nJivanji Jamshedji Modi,\nSecretary, Parsee Punchayet.\n\n3. Kuranda.\n\n102, Cheyne Walk, Chelsea,\nLondon, S.W.\n\nSir,\u2014Your correspondent Mr. St. Andrew St. John may be interested in knowing that Barleria prionitis is still, in Maratha, \u201cKanta-koranta\u201d and \u201cPivala- (yellow) koranta.\u201d It is of a rich cream-colour. Mr. Nairne, the latest writer on the subject, says \u201cbuff.\u201d There are many others of the genus, blue, lilac, pink, and white. None are at all like the English \u201cblue-bell\u201d (wild hyacinth), or the \u201cBlue Bells of Scotland\u201d (Anglic\u00e9 \u201charebells\u201d). These belong to other orders, and are not familiar to natives of the plains of India. It is, therefore, perhaps to be regretted that the word \u201cblue-bell\u201d should be used in translation of the Indian name of a tropical plant, even if its flower were blue.\u2014I remain, yours truly,\n\nW. F. Sinclair.\n\nRugby,\nApril 18, 1896.\n\nSir,\u2014In the passage quoted by Mr. St. John from my translation of the J\u0101taka, vol. ii, p. 46, in the number of the Journal for April, 1896, p. 364, \u201cyellow robe\u201d stands in inverted commas. If the robe were yellow in truth, the point is lost. The man in question violated all the rules of taste by wearing a white outer robe, a blue under robe, holding a carved fan, etc., etc.; and the sentence was intended to mean\u2014\u201che wore a blue robe instead of the proper yellow robe.\u201d Would not an Englishman be understood if he were to say of some clergyman, \u201chis \u2018white tie\u2019 on this occasion was bright blue\u201d?\u2014Yours truly,\n\nW. H. D. Rouse.\n4. Ch\u016bh\u0101 Sh\u0101h Daula.\n\nIn the Panj\u0101b certain dwarfs are seen called \"Ch\u016bh\u0101 Sh\u0101h Daula,\" Rats of the shrine of Sh\u0101h Daula, a Muhammadan Saint.\n\nIn 1851 I saw two of these dwarfs exhibited at Paris, riding on ostriches, and described as a peculiar race of pigmies. I asked our new member, Muhammad Latif, to send an account of them for our Journal, with the following result.\n\nRobert N. Cust,\nHon. Sec. of R.A.S.\n63, Elm Park Gardens, S.W.\nMay 20, 1896.\n\nJallandhar City, Panj\u0101b,\nApril 27, 1896.\n\nSir,\u2014I have made inquiries regarding the people known in the Panj\u0101b as \"Ch\u016bh\u0101 Sh\u0101h Daula\" found in Gujrat District and elsewhere in the Panj\u0101b. The hereditary custodians of the shrine of Sh\u0101h Daula, in the city of Gujrat, maintain, that parents not endowed with a child make a vow at the Chawng\u0101l, or mausoleum of the Saint, that, should they be gifted with a child, male or female, they would make an offer of him or her at the shrine of the Saint. Through the blessings of the Saint a child is born to the parents, and in fulfilment of the vow they offer the child at the shrine. The child's head is invariably small, and so the epithet Ch\u016bh\u0101 or \"Mouse\" is given to it. The story, however, is wrong. In the first place, why should parents ask the gift of a child whose head is so small that the child, when grown up to manhood, becomes an idiot and is devoid of all senses? A child so born is quite useless to the parents and to the world at large. Secondly, the story as to the blessings of the Saint is absurd, since the gift of a child in such condition is rather a curse to the parents than a blessing.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, that Ch\u016bh\u0101\u2014males or females\u2014born with small heads, are extraordinary creatures, and\nthe fashion has grown in the Panj\u0101b of making an offer of a child so born at the shrine of Sh\u0101h Daula in Gujrat, and the child is called \"Ch\u016bha Sh\u0101h Daula.\" I made inquiries about the matter from old and well-informed people, and they all agree, that there is nothing supernatural in the birth and constitution of the sect in question, and that they are merely extraordinary creatures.\n\nAt a time, it was gravely suspected by the authorities, that the hereditary custodians of the shrine of Sh\u0101h Daula in Gujrat, who keep a number of these extraordinary creatures at the shrine (who prove to them a source of gain), employ artificial means of making the heads of newborn children small, and prevent the natural growth of the head by squeezing it in an iron vessel, and keeping it in such condition for a length of time until its further growth has ceased. But at length careful inquiries into the causes of the smallness of the head showed, that it was due neither to supernatural powers, nor to artificial agencies, but that the people were merely extraordinary creatures.\n\nThe saint Sh\u0101h Daula was born in 975 A.H. (1567 A.D.), and died at the age of 150 in 1125 (1713 A.D.), or in the time of the Emperor Jahand\u0101r Sh\u0101h. He was a descendant of the Behlol kings, and on the mother's side was related to Sultan S\u0101rang Khan, Ghakkar chief. He was an eyewitness of the events of the reigns of Akbar, Jahangir, Sh\u0101hjahan, and Aurangzeb, the four celebrated Moghul emperors.\u2014Yours obediently,\n\nMahomed Latif.\n\n5. Rosaries in Ceylonese Buddhism.\n\nI have found no references in European literature to the rosaries of the Buddhists of Ceylon; and several writers on the Buddhism of that island, whom I addressed on this subject, gave it as their opinion that rosaries are unknown to Ceylonese Buddhists.\n\nHaving devoted some attention to Buddhist ritual, and\ndescribed in detail the rosaries of the Tibetan\\(^1\\) and Burmese\\(^2\\) Buddhists, I took advantage of a recent flying visit to Ceylon to inquire locally into this question, and I found that rosaries are used by all the Ceylonese Buddhist monks, as well as by the laity.\n\nThey call the rosary *M\u0101l\u0113*, the Sinhalese form of the Sanskrit *M\u0101l\u0101* \u2018a garland.\u2019 It is also called *Nava gu\u1e47a m\u0101l\u0113* or \u2018the nine-virtues\u2019 garland,\u2019 for the reason, it is said, that one of the chief uses to which it is put is to tell over the beads the nine virtues or attributes (*gu\u1e47a*) of the Buddha. As, however, the word *gu\u1e47a* also means \u2018a string,\u2019 it is possible that this epithet may have had a more general meaning.\n\nThe beads number 108, as in the Tibetan, Burmese, and some of the Japanese\\(^3\\) rosaries; and they are manipulated in the same manner. The material of which the beads are composed varies with the wealth and caprice of the owner. The commonest rosaries have their beads of coconut shell, or of a seed, the name of which I have mislaid; while many are made of a yellowish wood like that of the so-called *Bodhi*-tree of the Burmese and Japanese, though the wood is not that of the *Pipal*-tree (*Ficus religiosa*). Some rosaries are of *Sandal*-wood, and a few are of precious stones. But no importance seems to be placed upon the particular material of the beads, as is done in Tibet, where the rosary has attained its highest development.\n\nAs to the time and manner in which the rosary was introduced into Ceylonese Buddhism, the monks whom I interrogated at Colombo could not tell, but they told me that it has certainly been used at least since the time of Buddhaghosa, who mentions the use of the rosary in the *Silaniddesa*.\n\nThe rosary is daily used by the Ceylonese Buddhists in reciting the formulas which are employed in the exercise of the mystic meditation called *Kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101nam*. This latter\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See my \u201cBuddhism of Tibet,\u201d pp. 202\u2013210.\n\n\\(^2\\) *Proc. Asiatic Soc. Bengal*, Dec. 1892.\n\n\\(^3\\) J. M. James in *Trans. Jap.

Each of these is based on a certain formula or rite.\" Forty modes of Kammatth\u0101n\u0101ni are mentioned in the Visuddhi Magga. A particular one of these is selected, and its formula is repeated by the monk or lay devotee many times on the rosary, in order to concentrate the mind upon it. These formulas sometimes seem to be categorical lists of elements, etc., but they probably seldom, if ever, consist of unmeaning mummery and jargon such as with the Tibetan Buddhists. Nor are the formulas repeated to such inordinate lengths as with the L\u0101mas.\n\nOf the G\u0101th\u0101s which are daily told by monks on the rosaries, the most common are the three on the greatness of the Buddha, the Law, and the Assembly, commencing\u2014Buddhanussati Iti pi so Bhagav\u0101 araham Samm\u0101, etc., which are said to be extracted from the Mah\u0101 Parinibb\u0101na Sutta.\n\nPerhaps some resident of Ceylon will give us more details about these rosaries and their formulas. And we still require definite information on these points in regard to Siam.\n\nL. A. Waddell.\n\nMedical College, Calcutta,\n\nApril 21, 1896.\n\n6. The Bakhti\u0101ri Dialect.\n\nDear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014It is rather late to allude to an article in the October, 1895, number, but I had not time to read it till lately. I refer to the poem in the Bakhti\u0101ri dialect, mentioned in Mr. Browne's article on \"Poetry of the Persian Dialects,\" on page 816 of that number.\n\nIn the last line \u0645\u064f\u062d\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u06cc\u0644 should be two words = \"Mohammad the hero.\" In the same line \u0631\u0647\u0646\u0645\u06cc\u0633 I was\n\n\\(^1\\) Childers' P\u0101li Dict., p. 179.\ntold by a Lur, = \"let him go\"; which would be equivalent to the gloss Mr. Browne quotes, but not as he takes it.\u2014I remain, yours very truly,\n\nW. McDouall.\n\n7. Epigraphic Discoveries at Mathur\u0101.\n\n[From the Academy of May 2nd.]\n\nVienna,\nApril 20, 1896.\n\nA letter from Dr. F\u00fchrer, accompanied by a batch of impressions of inscriptions, informs me that a grant of 300 rupees from the Government of the North-western Provinces enabled him to resume his explorations at Mathur\u0101 during February last. Dr. F\u00fchrer spent this (for excavations) rather insignificant sum partly on \"prospecting operations\" in the large Katra Mound, which is said to conceal the ruins of Ke\u015bava's ancient temple, destroyed by Aurungzebe, and partly on diggings in some unexplored portions of the Kank\u0101li Til\u0101, which some years ago yielded the splendid collection of important Jaina inscriptions.\n\nThe Katra Mound furnished none of the hoped-for Brahmanical sculptures and inscriptions, but only, as in former times, fragments belonging to a Buddhist St\u016bpa of the Kushana period. But the results of Dr. F\u00fchrer's work in the Kank\u0101li Til\u0101 were as valuable as those of 1889\u201393. Besides a number of smaller fragments of inscriptions, giving the names of various Jaina schools and teachers, he found a longer one, which, in spite of the omission of the reigning king's name, possesses a considerable interest, and perhaps indicates that the dates of the Kushana kings, Kanishka, Huvishka, and V\u0101sudeva or V\u0101sushka, must be interpreted otherwise than is usually done.\n\nThe curiously misspelt text of the mutilated document runs thus:\n\n1. Namascarav\u0101sthan\u0101 \u0100rah\u0101ntan\u0101 | Mah\u0101r\u0101jasya r\u0101jatir\u0101jasya svarvaccharasvate d[\u016b] . . . . .\n2. 200 90 9 (?) hemamitamase 2 divase 1 \u0101rah\u0101to Mah\u0101virasya pr\u0101tim[\u0101*] . . . . .\n3 . . . . sya Okh\u0101rik\u0101ye vitu Ujhatik\u0101ye ca Okh\u0101ye sr\u0101vik\u0101-\nbhagtniy[e*] . . . . .\n4. . . . . \u015brikasya \u015aivadin\u0101sy\u0101 ca eteh \u0101r\u0101h\u0101tayat\u0101ne sth\u0101pit[\u0101] . . . . .\n5. . . . . . . devakulam ca |\n\nWith the obvious corrections namas-sarva\u00b0 for namasvarva\u00b0,\nsaivaccharasate for savaccharasavate, dhitu for vitu, sr\u0101vik\u0101\u00b0\nfor sv\u0101vik\u0101\u00b0, and eta\u012bh for eteh, as well as with the highly\nprobable restoration d\u016b[tiye nava (?)-navatyadhike at the end\nof l. 1, the following translation may be given:\n\n\"Adoration to all Siddhas, to the Arhats! In the second\ncentury [exceeded by ninety-nine (?)], 299 (?) of the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\nand R\u0101j\u0101tir\u0101ja, in the second month of winter, on the first\nday\u2014an image of the Arhat Mah\u0101v\u012bra was set up in the\nArhat-temple by the following [persons], by . . . . and by\nUjhatik\u0101, daughter of . . . . [and] of Okh\u0101rik\u0101, by Okh\u0101,\nthe lay-sister . . . . or . . \u015birika and \u015aivadinna . . . . .\nand a temple.\"\n\nAs the first two numeral signs are very distinct, and only\nthe third is somewhat blurred and of unusual form, it is\nevident that the document was incised at all events after\nthe year 290 (possibly in the year 299) of an unnamed\nera, and during the reign of an unnamed king who bore\nthe titles mah\u0101r\u0101ja and r\u0101j\u0101tir\u0101ja. The last-mentioned\ncircumstance permits us to determine, at least, to which\ndynasty the king belonged. For though the two combined\ntitles occur before the names of Azes, Azilises, Gondopherres,\nPakores, Kadphises I and II, Kanishka, Huvishka, and\nV\u0101sudeva, only one of the last three kings can be here\nintended, because, as far as is known at present, none of\nthe first six ruled over Mathur\u0101. And to this conclusion\npoints also the type of the characters of the inscription.\nIt fully agrees with that of the numerous votive inscriptions\nof the time of the Kushana rule over Mathur\u0101; and it\npreserves in the broad-backed \u015ba with the slanting central stroke, and in the tripartite subscript ya, two archaic forms which during this period occur only occasionally for the later \u015ba with the horizontal cross-bar and the bipartite ya. These characteristics, as well as the general appearance of the letters, preclude also the (otherwise possible) assumption that the inscription might belong to the time of a later Kushana king, who ruled after V\u0101sudeva and before the conquest of Mathur\u0101 by the Guptas about 400 A.D.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the date of Dr. F\u00fchrer's inscription, which differs from those found in the other inscriptions of the Kushanas of Mathur\u0101, gains a considerable importance. Hitherto we possessed only documents with the years 5\u201328 for Kanishka, 29\u201360 for Huvi\u0161ka, and 74 (misread 44)\u201398 for V\u0101sudeva; and these dates have been taken by most Sanskritists to be years of the \u015aaka era of 78 A.D., supposed to have been established by Kanishka, but by Sir A. Cunningham as years of the fifth century of the Seleucid era, or equivalent to [40]5\u2013[4]98, i.e. 93\u2013191 A.D. If we now have reason to believe that the new date Sam 299 fell in the reign of one of these three kings, that may be explained in two ways. Either it may be assumed that the Kushanas of Mathur\u0101 used two eras\u2014one established by Kanishka, and a second which began much earlier; or it may be conjectured that their dates with the figures 5\u201398 are abbreviated by the omission of the hundreds, and that, being in reality equivalent to 205\u2013298, they have to be referred to the era which occurs so frequently in the lately discovered Kharosth\u012b inscriptions from the Panjab, as well as in some older finds.\n\nIt seems very tempting to consider the Mathur\u0101 date of \u015aod\u0101sa, Sam 72, the Taxila date of his contemporary Patika, Sam 78, the date Sam 102 of M. Senart's No. 35 (Notes d'\u00c9pigraphie Indienne, v), the Takht-i-Bahi date of Gondopherres, Sam 103, the date, Sam 113, of Dr. Waddell's Kaldavra inscription (Vienna Or. Jour., vol. x, No. 1), the Panjtar date of a Gushana king (name lost), Sam 123, the date, Sam 200, of M. Senart's No. 34, the\ndate, Sam 276 or 286, of the Hashtnagar image, and Dr. F\u00fchrer's new Mathur\u0101 date, Sam 299 (?), as links of one and the same chain, to which also the abbreviated dates of Kanishka and his successors, Sam [20]5-[2]98, belong. If all these dates are really connected in the manner suggested, the beginning of this Northern era must fall in the first half of the first century B.C. For the time of Gondopherres, who ruled in its 103rd year, is undoubtedly the first half of the first century A.D.\n\nFor the present, and until more dated inscriptions of this period with royal names are found, this suggestion, which coincides in the main with M. Senart's views expressed at the end of his article quoted above, is nothing more than a bare possibility. Perhaps further explorations in the Kank\u0101li Til\u0101, which Dr. F\u00fchrer intends to undertake, will prove its correctness.\n\nG.

General Meetings of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nApril 14, 1896.\u2014Sir William Wilson Hunter in the Chair.\n\nIt was announced that\u2014\n\nMr. W. J.

Merk, C.S.I.,\n\nMajor Leigh, I.S.C.,\n\nMajor Deane, I.S.C.,\n\nhad been elected members of the Society.\n\nMr. Beveridge read a paper on \"Anquetil Du Perron.\" It dealt chiefly with his personal history, and was mainly an abstract of the \"Discours Pr\u00e9liminaire\" of the \"Zend-avesta.\" His voyage to India was described, as also his interviews with Siraj-ud-Daula and Mir Madan (the hero of Plassey), and his wonderful journey of 1200 miles from Colgong to Pondicherry. The only novelty in the paper was some extracts from the proceedings of the Councils of Bombay and Surat of September and October, 1759, which gave details about Du Perron's encounter with another Frenchman in the streets of Surat. It appeared from these that Du Perron's antagonist was a M. Biquant.\n\nA discussion followed, in which Dr. Thornton, Mr. Desai, Sir Henry Norman, Mrs. Rhys Davids, and the Secretary took part.\nMay 12, 1896, Anniversary Meeting.\u2014Lord Reay (President) in the Chair.\n\nIt was announced that\u2014\n\nThe Rev. G. Margoliouth and\nMr. H. North Bushby\n\nhad been elected members of the Society.\n\nThe Right Hon. the Lord Loch, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., P.C.: Gentlemen,\u2014It is a very pleasing duty that has devolved on me, and that is to propose the re-election of Lord Reay for another term of three years. I feel sure you realize how much good he has done to the Society during the past three years. Since he has presided over us, he has been able to use his great influence with a view to save the Arch\u00e6ological Commission in India from destruction; and I am sure if that were the only service that he had performed to the Society, he would be deserving of our most sincere thanks. But besides that, he attended at the Congress at Geneva, and he moved our motion that the Congress should formulate a scheme for the transliteration of Oriental alphabets. The carrying of that motion, and the subsequent publication of the Congress scheme, will go far to settle a question which has divided Orientalists for many years, and the settlement of which is of practical importance. These are only two of the services which Lord Reay has performed for the Society, and I am sure that they are quite enough to lead you to join with me in voting his re-election for another term of three years. I believe the financial position of the Society is very satisfactory, and I believe also that there is an increased number of members joining us. I only wish that we could enlist still greater interest in the work of the Society, so that we might really get a very large increase of our members, and put all anxiety as regards our funds out of the question. For although our financial position is good, and I believe improving, still at the same time we should like very much indeed\u2014and I believe Professor Rhys Davids will confirm me in this\u2014we should like to have several hundreds a year\nmore than we at present have for the purpose of carrying on more efficiently the great work of interpreting the East to the West which the Society was founded to do. I have much pleasure now in moving that Lord Reay be elected for another term of three years.\n\nMr. R. N. Cust, LL.D. (Hon. Secretary): I rise to second the proposition made by Lord Loch. Lord Loch spoke in the name of the Members of the Society; I speak in the name of the Council. We heartily desire the re-election of Lord Reay. I have known the Society now for many many years, and am one of the oldest members of the Council. We have been fortunate in having so many distinguished noblemen and gentlemen as our Presidents\u2014Sir Henry Rawlinson, Sir Bartle Frere, Sir Edward Colebrooke, Lord Northbrook, Sir Henry Yule, Sir Thomas Wade, and now Lord Reay; and we heartily desire, and hope it will be agreeable to all of you, that Lord Reay be asked for another term of three years to remain in the office. There are special reasons also why we desire it, because the International Congress is to take place at Paris next year, in which Lord Reay will represent the Society in a way which no one else could do so well.\n\n[Lord Loch then put the motion to the meeting, and it was carried with enthusiasm.]\n\nThe Right Hon. the Lord Reay, G.C.S.I., LL.D.: Lord Loch and Gentlemen,\u2014I can assure you that I highly appreciate the compliment which you have paid me, and the very flattering remarks which both Lord Loch and Dr. Cust have made on this occasion. I consider it a great privilege to preside over a Council and over a Society in which there are so large a number of most distinguished Orientalists; and I need not say that it is only because I know that I have the support of these distinguished Orientalists that I, who have no claim whatever to call myself an Orientalist, venture to preside over this Society, in which I have become more and more interested in the past three years; and also because the distinguished Secretary, Professor Rhys Davids, places his knowledge\nand experience always in the most kind and generous way at my disposal. I ought to add that, if there be a special reason which makes me desirous to remain a little longer in your midst, it is the expectation that, during the next three years, London will at last obtain an Oriental School worthy of the Metropolis, placed on the same footing as the great schools which cast lustre on foreign capitals. I do not hesitate to say that I consider every year of delay in the establishment of such a school as a national disgrace. (Hear, hear.) I trust that at last we shall carry a Bill creating a Statutory Commission to reorganize the London University on the lines of the Report of the Royal Commission. As you are aware, the Royal Commission reported in favour of a large recognition of Oriental studies in London. That is a debt England owes to India\u2014to itself as a great Asiatic Power. This Asiatic Society forms one of the most precious links between Occidental and Oriental learning. The interest I take in Indian affairs has certainly increased, not decreased, since I have come to realize the aims of this Society; and I wish to see it become more and more the headquarters of the eminent men who, I am happy to say, in growing numbers, desire to give not only their time but their money to this Society. If I can be of some use, and not disappoint those who have so kindly proposed and elected me as their President for the ensuing term, it will be a source of every satisfaction to me.\n\nThe following Report of the Council for the year 1895 was then read by the Secretary:\n\n**REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1895.**\n\nThe Council regrets to have to report the loss by death, or retirement, of the following thirteen members:\n\nThere have died\u2014\n\n1.

receipts from the sale of the Journal, which had become practically nothing for many years, have now, since 1884, gone on pretty steadily increasing, until, in the year under review, they amounted to \u00a3217, a very substantial addition to the slender income of the Society, and the largest so far received under that head.\n\nThe Council regrets that there is no entry this year under the head of donations to the Society. In former years there were considerable donations made from time to time in aid of the researches carried on by the Society. It would have been impossible for the Society without such help to have set on foot and successfully carried out the long series of translations which it was able to publish under the old Oriental Translation Fund. The necessities of the cause have grown with the growth of knowledge. And whereas other learned societies, especially those dealing with natural science, are either housed rent free by the Government, or receive an allowance in lieu of rent, this Society has no such grant, and has lately been compelled to submit to an increase in the high charge it has to pay for rent. The consequence is that our shelves are crowded with MSS. which ought to be translated, and which the Society cannot hope, even with the present improvement in its financial position, to translate. The Oriental Translation Fund has now been started afresh, and by the great generosity, at first of Mr. F. F. Arbuthnot, since supplemented by the Earl of Northbrook and Mr. Sturdy, it has done and is doing good and important work. But it very urgently needs further support, and the Council, therefore, publishes the following list of donations given to the Society in the past in the hope that friends of Oriental research may be stimulated to like efforts in the future:\u2014\n\nJ.H.A.S. 1896.\n**LIST OF PRIVATE DONATIONS TO THE FUNDS OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.**\n\n| Year | Donor Name | Amount (\u00a3) |\n|------|------------|------------|\n| 1833 | Major-General Sir John Malcolm, G.C.B. | 20 0 0 |\n| 1836 | Major-General Sir Henry Worsley, K.C.B. | 100 0 0 |\n| 1837 | \" | 1000 0 0 |\n| 1838 | Mr. Sergeant Rough | 10 0 0 |\n| 1843 | James Alexander, Esq. | 100 0 0 |\n| 1844 | \" | 100 0 0 |\n| 1845 | \" | 100 0 0 |\n| 1846 | \" | 100 0 0 |\n| 1861 | B.

The Council hopes that the slight but regular growth in the receipts will render it possible to make this a permanent feature in the accounts.\n\nAs already stated in last year's Report, the Council has invested \u00a3300 during the year under review to\nreplace the amount taken to pay for the repair of the roof, etc., from the Society's capital fund. The fund now (12th May, 1896) stands thus:\n\n| Description                          | \u00a3   | s. | d. |\n|--------------------------------------|-----|----|----|\n| \u00a3802 13s. 10d.

This makes it all the harder that this Society, one of the oldest of the learned Societies, should have been omitted from the list of those who have house-room provided for them by the national Government.\n\n\u00b9 This increase is due to the special Government grant referred to in the note on the first table.\n\u00b2 These increases were due to the improved state of the ordinary revenue of the Society.\n## ABSTRACT OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE YEAR 1895.\n\n### RECEIPTS.\n\n| Description                                                                 | \u00a3   | s. | d. |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|----|----|\n| Balance at Bank, January 1st, 1895                                          |     |    |    |\n| Subscriptions                                                               |     |    |    |\n| 90 Resident Members at \u00a33 3s.                                               | 283 | 10 | 0  |\n| 155 Non-Resident Members at \u00a31 10s.                                        | 232 | 9  | 6  |\n| 6 \" in advance (1 being 5 years' subscription)                             | 12  | 15 | 0  |\n| 2 \" arrears paid in 1893                                                   | 3   | 0  | 0  |\n| 32 \" at \u00a31 1s.                                                             | 83  | 12 | 0  |\n| 2 \" paid by mistake                                                        | 2   | 2  | 0  |\n| 2 Compounders' extra subscription at \u00a31 13s.                               | 3   | 6  | 0  |\n| 3 Compounders at \u00a315 15s.                                                  | 47  | 5  | 0  |\n| Donation from the India Office                                             |     |    |    |\n| Dividends on N.W. 4 per cent.

Thomson Lyon.\n\nExamined with the books and vouchers, and found correct, February 6th, 1896.\nThe Council regrets to have to announce the death of two of the Honorary Members of the Society\u2014Dr. Reinhold Rost and Professor von Roth. In their place the Council recommends the election of Professor Baron von Rosen, of St. Petersburg, and of Professor Windisch, of Leipzig.\n\nBy the rules of the Society five gentlemen retire from the Council, two of whom are re-eligible, that is to say\u2014\n\nMr. Arbuthnot,\nDr. Thornton,\nProf. Douglas,\nMr. Strong, and\nSir Raymond West;\n\nand the death of Dr. Rost creates one vacancy. The Council recommends the election in their stead of\u2014\n\nMr. Arbuthnot,\nProf. Macdonell,\nDr. Thornton,\nMr. Watters,\nMr. Wollaston, and\nMr. Walhouse.\n\nBy the rules of the Society Professor Cowell, Sir M. E. Grant-Duff, and Sir Fred Goldsmid retire from the Vice-Presidency. The Council recommends the election in their stead of\u2014\n\nThe Right Hon. Sir M. E. Grant-Duff, G.C.S.I., F.R.S.,\nMajor-General Sir F. J. Goldsmid, C.B., K.C.S.I., and\nSir Raymond West, K.C.I.E., LL.D.\n\nThe usual statement of accounts is laid on the table.\n\nMr. T. H. Thornton, C.S.I., D.C.L.: My Lord Reay, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014I have been asked to move the adoption of the Report which you have just heard, and I very gladly do so. At the same time I must confess it is somewhat of a mystery to me why I have been\nselected for this very honourable office; but though the honour is quite undeserved, I like it all the same. It is possible that whoever has selected me for this honour, has selected me on the Aristotelian principle, which is a very true one, that things are sometimes best explained by their contraries, and that therefore he has chosen one, who cannot claim to be an Orientalist, as the exponent of a Report of one of the most ancient and most successful Asiatic Societies in existence. But though, in common with many of my brethren in the Indian Civil Service, I cannot claim to be an Orientalist (because during my career in India I was far too preoccupied in affairs to be able to prosecute Oriental studies), yet I still take the deepest interest in them. Like a devout Hindoo, the retired Anglo-Indian still worships towards the Land of the Rising Sun, and is glad to seek refuge from the keen blasts of the North in the sunshine of the Light of Asia.\n\nAnd now as to the Report itself. It is a somewhat chequered record\u2014on the one hand, of terrible losses; but on the other hand, of steady progress and hope for the future. We have lost, ladies and gentlemen, the most illustrious of our members, the great Sir Henry Rawlinson, who for many years was the Director of our Society. We have lost the unrivalled scholarship and the genial presence of Sir Thomas Wade. We have lost the painstaking research of Dr. Trilokya N\u0101th Mitra; and we have more recently lost the wide knowledge, the extended experience, of our late friend and colleague, Dr. Rost. Yes, they are gone; but they will not soon be forgotten. Bedded like rocks in the stream of human progress, their work and their memory survive. \"The waters flow by\"\u2014so runs the Afghan proverb\u2014\"the waters flow by, the floods cease, but the stones remain for ever.\" But fortunately for human happiness, no man, however great, is indispensable; and it so happens, therefore, that in spite of our losses, the year's history is one, not of sensational, but what is perhaps better, of continuous and satisfactory advance.\n\nWhen I first joined this Society, on my retirement from\nIndia about the year 1881, its income from subscriptions was \u00a3538; the receipts from the sale of the Journal and advertisements amounted to the magnificent sum of \u00a31; and on the year's income and expenditure there was a loss of \u00a387. Now, during the year 1895, in spite of long-continued financial depression, and in spite of our having, in the case of a certain class of members, reduced the amount of the subscription\u2014notwithstanding all this, the total amount of the receipts from subscriptions amounted to \u00a3570; our income from the sale of the Journal and advertisements was \u00a3217, the largest amount from that source ever received; there was a surplus of \u00a3112, and during the year a sum of nearly \u00a3300 was invested: so that at the end of the year the debt to capital, which had accrued, owing to our having to sell out securities from time to time, in order to meet deficits to the extent of \u00a31700, was reduced to \u00a3900\u2014in other words, at the close of the year a debt of about \u00a3800 was wiped out. Moreover, though the income from subscriptions has not very largely increased, the number of subscribers has increased in far greater proportion, owing to the reduction in the amount of fee in certain cases.\n\nIt is a very satisfactory feature that, during the year 1895, eleven of our new subscribers were natives of India. I trust that if any of our new members, natives of India, happen to be present\u2014I think I see one in the room here\u2014I hope that they will inform their compatriots how very glad we shall be to welcome many more.\n\nBut, though our financial position is far better than it was, you must not suppose that we are wealthy. Such is far from being the case, for our ideas are far grander than our resources. We could wish, for instance, to have co-operated much more effectively and substantially in aid of the formation of the Oriental Translation Fund, which, thanks to the liberal generosity of Mr. Arbuthnot\u2014(applause)\u2014and of our late President, Lord Northbrook, and others, has been formed, and, as we are told in the Report, is doing excellent work. But matters are improving, and let us hope that some day or other there may arise another Colonel North,\nequally open-handed and generous with him who has just departed, but with Oriental instead of nitrate proclivities.\n\nBut the most satisfactory, though not always, I admit, the most successful, means of raising money is\u2014to deserve it. Let us consider, therefore, how far during the year we have deserved the contributions that we have received, and that we hope to receive. Let us inquire how far, during the year, we have endeavoured to carry out the objects of our institution, that is to say, what we have done towards the \"investigation and encouragement of Arts, Science, and Literature in relation to Asia.\"\n\nWell, on this point the Journal itself will tell you a great deal. In the first place, the Journal for 1895 contains 27 original communications, some of them of very great value, and\u2014this is an important point\u2014nearly all of them would, in all probability, have never seen the light but for the opportunity afforded for their publication in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. Among the more important of these papers I would venture to mention that of Mr. Guy Le Strange's text and translation of \"Ibn Serapion's Description of Mesopotamia and Bagdad in A.D. 900\"; and Dr. Winternitz' very learned paper on \"The Connection between the Nejamesha, Naigamesha, and Nemeso.\" These are not what would usually be considered lively reading, but as specimens of laborious and careful scholarship, they are of the greatest value. Then there is Mr. Hopkins' valuable account of \"The Origin and Early History of the Chinese Coinage,\" and Mr. Strong's \"History of the Island of Kilwe,\" from a previously unpublished old Arabic text, which is given in extenso. Then there is a Sinhalese gentleman, Don Martino de Zilwa Wickremasinghe\u2014and we are particularly glad to welcome as a fellow-worker one born in that remarkable island, which can boast an unbroken succession of good scholars for more than 2000 years\u2014who has deciphered for us \"The Sinhalese Inscriptions on Copperplates in the British Museum.\" Dr. B\u00fchler's \"Notes on Past and Future Archaeological Explorations in India\" is full of interesting\nand valuable suggestions; and then there is Mr. Chalmers' paper on \"The Nativity of the Buddha\"; Mr. Browne's \"Notes on the Poetry of the Persian Dialects\"; Mr. Rapson's papers on \"The Counter-marks on the Early Persian and Indian Coins.\" Each of them adds to the world's knowledge on the subjects discussed; and I dare say there are many other papers that have struck other members and subscribers as being papers of very great value.\n\nThen, again, the Report contains forty-five Reviews or Notices of Books. And here I would venture to express on behalf, I think I may say, of the Council, our thanks to those gentlemen who, at considerable trouble, have undertaken to review the books that from time to time appear in our Journal. We have no funds from which to remunerate them, and therefore their kindness is all the greater. Then, again, in the Notes of the Quarter that are published in our Journal will be found a contemporaneous record of Oriental research. And in addition to all this we have had several Committees of some importance\u2014one, for instance, on Transliteration, which is still sitting; and we have also had several interesting meetings and discussions.\n\nWell, for such success as has been obtained in all these departments of our work, the main credit, of course, is due to our able and indefatigable Secretary, Mr. Rhys Davids\u2014(applause); but no small portion of the results of the year is due to the inspiring energy of our distinguished President\u2014(applause)\u2014who has stimulated us by his example and taken the keenest interest in our work. Thanks to his Lordship, the Royal Asiatic Society was admirably represented at the last Oriental Congress at Geneva, and it was through his initiation that the Society took part in pressing upon the Government the importance of establishing a teaching University for London, and in connection with it an Oriental department, and thus removing what his Lordship has appropriately described as a most disgraceful blot upon the educational escutcheon of the Metropolis. And now that we have, I am glad to say, re-elected our distinguished President for another term of three years, we look forward\nwith the greatest pleasure to the prospect of his again adequately and honourably representing our Society at the forthcoming Congress at Paris.\n\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, I have not much more to say. I referred in the commencement of my speech to the severe losses that we had experienced; but I do not like to conclude without saying that we are far from being discouraged. We have still with us many distinguished representatives of Oriental scholarship in the widest sense; some have already achieved for themselves a worldwide reputation, e.g.: Professor Sir M. Monier-Williams, or Professors Cowell, or Legge, or Sayce, or Douglas, or Bendall, or Rhys Davids; then there is our learned and ever active Honorary Secretary, Dr. Cust, and many others that I could name\u2014Mr. Browne, who has given us some very valuable papers; Professor Macdonell, whom you have just elected on the Council; Mr. Rogers and Mr. Beveridge; and there is our friend Dr. Leitner, sitting immediately in front of us\u2014he, too, is one of the illustrious band whose names are already known. But apart from all these, there are rising members of this Society whose work is of the highest promise. Amongst this younger generation we have Hopkins and Fraser, great in Chinese, and Guy Le Strange, Strong, and Ross in Persian and Arabic; and on the Indian side Rapson, and Taylor, and Chalmers, and Houghton, and Wickremasinghe; while in the domain of historical research we have in Edward Maclagan a very promising son of a distinguished father and old friend of ours; and last, and not least, there is to be mentioned the name of Mrs. Rhys Davids, the wife of our distinguished Secretary. (Hear, hear.) So altogether, notwithstanding our losses, the outlook is most encouraging. Death may make havoc in our ranks, but there are fine recruits ready to fill up the gaps, or, to change the metaphor, as in nature, so in scholarship\u2014\n\nRoses shall be where roses were,\nNot shadows, but reality;\nAs if they never perished there,\nBut slept in immortality.\n(Applause.) \u2014 With these remarks I have the honour to propose the adoption of the Report and the several recommendations contained in it.\n\nMr. J. Kennedy, I.C.S. (ret.): I have been asked, my Lord, to second the adoption of Dr. Thornton's resolution. When the request was first made to me, I, too, asked myself precisely the same question that Dr. Thornton asked himself, why was I selected for this office? and as I could find no answer in myself, I set about a diligent study of the Report. That Report is almost entirely financial; and as it so happens, I have on one or two occasions had the honour to act as Auditor for this Society, and I have had occasion to examine somewhat closely the financial aspects of the Society's work; I can therefore speak with the greater confidence on one or two points of the very gratifying Report before us. The income of this Society is mainly derived from four sources\u2014a grant from the India Office, certain rents (derived by subletting the rooms to other societies), subscriptions, and the sale of the Journal. The grant from the India Office and the rents from other societies are of course more or less fixed, and, taken together, they almost cover the rent of this building; the solvency of the Society therefore depends entirely on the subscriptions and the sale of the Journal. Of the subscribers, the non-residents are the most numerous, and in many respects a most important section, though financially each non-resident member subscribes less than a resident member. The greater part of the non-resident subscriptions goes really to defray their share in the publication of the Journal. The Society, therefore, must mainly depend upon an increase in the number of resident subscribers. Now the circle from which the Society draws its resident subscribers is a limited one, and any increase under this head must be slow. I do not know whether the Council has ever considered the advisability of altering the rule with regard to composition, but at present it seems to me that the permission to compound instead of\nsubscribing annually is a source of loss, and not a source of gain, to the Society. It might be well either to abolish the rule altogether, or to modify it according to some scale of age as has been done, for instance, in the London Library. Then I come to the sale of the Journal, the most gratifying feature of this year's statement: eight years ago the income of the Journal did not reach anything like \u00a3100; this year we have derived over \u00a3217 from that source alone, and this result is in the main due undoubtedly to the enterprise and energy of our Secretary, which has resulted in the excellence and variety of the articles in the Society's Journal. I lay stress on the word variety, because some years ago in India there was an impression that the Society's interests were too much devoted to a few departments only. No one can now complain that the Society's interests are in any way restricted. We have subjects of all ages from the earliest periods to the eighteenth century, and ranging from the Magians of Persia and the Gnostics of Alexandria to the furthest East.\n\nAt the same time I think the Journal might be improved perhaps in two ways. I think that though we have articles on all subjects connected with history, and all subjects which go to the making of history\u2014religion, ethnology, numismatics, and archaeology\u2014yet of articles on history proper in its narrowest sense we have remarkably few. They are conspicuously absent. And such articles, I submit, appeal to a certain section of students, and might advantageously find a home in the Society's Journal. Another point in which we might improve, I think, is by the insertion of summaries of research\u2014occasionally or annually in the Journal. This would be an immense boon to many of us who are not able to follow all the literature of the subjects; and by some reduction perhaps in the notices of the less important books, room might be made in the Society's Journal for such summaries. Then, again, I think that we have this year had two or three papers of interest which were not printed in the Journal. That\nsystem, I submit, might be somewhat extended. We must all of us have often felt that it was impossible to criticize adequately, or in any case it was presumptuous of us to criticize, articles which the authors had devoted months and years to elaborating, when they were submitted to us at an hour's notice. These articles, I think, are better studied at home in the Journal, whereas very often articles of interest might be read here though they found no place in the Journal, and made no pretence to original research, provided they contained sufficient novel matter of general interest to the subscribers.\n\nAs to the expenditure, I need only say that the Society's expenditure has always been on the most frugal scale\u2014one might be almost tempted to call us penurious, but it is a case of necessity and not of choice. Every year your Council is now able to show us a balance in our favour, an increasing balance as a rule; and I think we may all thank the Council most heartily for the wise and judicious manner in which our finances have been managed.\n\nDr. Thornton: I wish to be permitted, Lord Reay, to supplement what I said, for I find I have made an omission in my speech. I wished to mention our great indebtedness to the services of our excellent Assistant-Secretary\u2014(Hear, hear, and prolonged applause)\u2014who knows every book in the library, and is always most ready to help those in search of the information. When I said in the earlier part of my speech that \"no man was indispensable,\" I was careful to limit the observation to the male sex. For men may come and men may go,\u2014but what should we do without Miss Hughes? (Applause.)\n\nThe Chairman: We should be very pleased if any members present would make suggestions, either with reference to the Journal, or the recommendations of the Council, or any other matters affecting the Society. We are in Committee of Supply, and any member has the right to speak.\n\nMr. Raynbird: For some sixteen years I have been engaged on original research. It has been a tremendous\nstruggle for me, and I was very pleased to hear what his Lordship had to say with regard to the Oriental School for London. I owe my first taste for Oriental learning to a visit to my brother down in the centre of Russia. I was there about four months, and picked up some few words of Russian. Afterwards I was a student under the late Dr. Rost, and in studying Sanskrit with him I was very much struck with the similarity of some of the Russian and Sanskrit words. I am sorry to say that owing to a lack of facilities for studying Sanskrit, and especially, what I consider most important, for the study of the Indian vernaculars, the Prakrit, my studies have been obliged to be to a great extent laid on one side. They have been especially in the non-Aryan vernaculars of Northern India\u2014Gondi, Khond, Uraon, and Malto\u2014as well as the Kolarian group, Santhali, Mundari, Ho, Kharia, Bhil, Korwa, Agaria, and others. In these studies I was assisted especially by my wife, who is a native of India. And what I wanted to say now was that I should like very much, if it were possible, to be able to prepare a paper on this subject, \"The Comparison of the non-Aryan Languages of Central India with the neo-Aryan Languages of India\"; but I am sorry to say it is a work that I cannot do myself. I have tried to do it; I have worked hard for the last sixteen years, but it is impossible for me; and unless I get assistance, I must abandon it. I wish to put this before you, because I think it is only right that the Oriental public should know what is going on. I remember at the Oriental Congress held in London, Mr. Baines called attention to these non-Aryan languages of Central India. They are dying out with the advance of the railway. I and my wife have done as much as we could to preserve them, and I believe there are other students at work on the subject; but, as I am sure everyone in this room must be aware, they are studies that are entirely uncommercial. If I have been personal in this matter, I hope you will excuse me; I thought it was well that those of you who are pushing this matter of the Oriental School might\nrealize the urgency of it. I do not plead for myself in any way, but for the subject on which I am engaged, because I believe for many years many Oriental scholars have been trying to throw some light upon this subject, but for want of materials they have not been able to make much advance. Such materials as were available to me I have made over to the Royal Asiatic Society; I believe they are on the shelves at the present day. (Hear, hear.)\n\nMr. Desai: Ladies and gentlemen, allusion has been made to India. I may say that the Indians will receive with entire satisfaction the election of Lord Reay, who has been beloved by every citizen of India. I think there could not be a better stimulus to the Asiatic Society than the election of Lord Reay. I have spoken to several Indians who might be willing to join the Asiatic Society, and I think the election of Lord Reay will be an additional stimulus to them, and before long there will be a good many Indians joining this Society.\n\nDr. Leitner: Apart from the personal satisfaction which we all feel at the re-election of Lord Reay and of the members of the Council who have done so very well indeed in the past, I should like to take the opportunity of referring again to the importance of his still further advocating the establishment of a great Oriental School. The importance of this cannot be sufficiently accentuated; and I may mention, with reference to this point, the labours in the past of myself and others, rewarded as they were in the establishment of an Oriental Section at King's College in 1859-64, in which one of my pupils, Dr. Wells, now the Chief Interpreter at the Foreign Office, is Professor. The amalgamation between University College and King's College, in London, in the present Oriental School under the Imperial Institute, has turned out two or three promising scholars, amongst whom I may mention Mr. Ross. I feel inclined, with reference to this School (although personally pleased with the fact that both my son and my nephew have been scholars of the Institute), to find great fault with its want of organization, and to express\nthe hope that this Society will not be satisfied with the Oriental School there, the result of a paper that was read here by Sir Charles Wilson. No, have a School that shall not be an apology for one\u2014that shall combine the scholarly manner, say of the Vienna Academy, and the practical (perhaps too practical) tendency of the Berlin School, in which the classical languages are sacrificed to the vernaculars; in which the dialects of Arabic are, e.g., studied in preference to the classical Arabic, by which alone a man can acquire any influence among Muhammadans. You ought to make it politically, academically, and practically the best possible School in the world. As soon as our President gains his main point of having established that School, I hope he will insist that it shall benefit, first and foremost, by the examples of the schools that I have mentioned, and then by such real liberality to be shown by the State towards it, as in the case of the French, German, and Russian Schools. It is almost too bad, I would say, considering how Oriental questions are pressing on us, to have to stop at the present not altogether successful stage. The formation of a great Oriental School is a necessity to science and to this country. My Lord, we hope that, in your chair as President of this Society, and in your seat in Parliament, and in all other positions which you are filling with so much credit to yourself and advantage to the public\u2014that this should be insisted on in a manner in which, and be accomplished with a thoroughness and liberality with which, it has never been done before. Such a School we must have, if this country is to keep its own in its struggle with other countries, from every point of view\u2014scientific and other.\n\nNow, coming back to this Society, a great deal has been done by it, and it is ungracious to find fault; still, the success of this Society will depend on its sympathy with criticism, and on its readiness to benefit by it. The Journal has, certainly, been much improved. The proof of that is in its large sale, which we owe to the Secretary. Whether the suggestions that have now been made might not be taken\ninto serious consideration, I will not venture to say; but I certainly would suggest that the Journal be in touch, not merely with the best learning and the best research, but also with Oriental actualities. I do not wish for a moment to bring you within the range of political discussion; but when you had such an inquiry as that of the Mahdi, the academical treatment of it would not only have dissipated many mists that gathered round that question, but would have materially assisted in telling us much of what we have since learned from Slatin Pasha's book, and, indeed, it would have taught that excellent official something, namely, the importance of studying classical Arabic. This would have enabled him to become the master of the situation, and the Khalifa would never have dared to keep him in captivity, because of the commanding influence he would have acquired. Do not think I wish to urge your intrusion for one moment on the domain of politics; but I do wish this Society, on all obscure questions of this kind, to take the position of the leading academical society, to which its antecedents entitle it, by dealing from an academical standpoint with Oriental actualities.\n\nExcuse my having taken up your time. I sincerely trust that this Society will be the acknowledged representative of the various specialities which the Society, as a whole, so worthily represents; that in the Council itself we may find the authorities on all the branches of Oriental learning\u2014Turkish, Arabic, Sanskrit, Persian, and so forth; and that you will put the concluding seal of success on Oriental learning by enlarging the domain of discussion and re-entering on that of its active promotion. In the success of the Oriental School none will more sincerely rejoice than the men who have tried to obtain what for many years they have thought essential to the success of this country. But I hope now many years will not pass before we shall have it as a fait accompli.\n\nProfessor Bendall: I would mention one small point in supplement to what fell from Dr. Thornton and in defence of our Journal. A very recent event was the assassination\nof the Shah. That was attributed to the Babis. Now I think the papers on the Babis published in our Journal show that we take real interest in the Oriental movements of the nineteenth as well as those of the eighth century.\n\nThe Secretary: I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Council proposes in place of two honorary members, whose services we have unfortunately lost during the past year, to elect Professor Baron von Rosen, of St. Petersburg, and Prof. Windisch, of Leipzig. I have no doubt that that proposition will meet with the very cordial sympathy of the meeting. Professor Baron von Rosen is the very life and soul of the famous Oriental School of St. Petersburg, of which we so earnestly wish we had a copy here in London; he has edited its special Journal for a great many years, and although he is himself a scholar of the very highest standing, he is always willing to give his time and his help to all the young students there who are engaged in research. Among his other work, I may add, Professor von Rosen contributed very largely by his articles on the Babis and their literature to the elucidation of a question which has been mentioned just now as coming most particularly within the purview of this Society. Then the other gentleman whom the Council recommends as an honorary member, Professor Windisch, is a many-sided man. Well known as one of the leading Professors of Sanskrit in Germany, he is also, I think I may say, one of the first Keltic scholars in Europe, having specially taken up the Irish side of Keltic studies. He has been elected during this last year as Rector of Leipzig University, and has been for many years the Secretary of the German Oriental Society. His recently published monograph on \"M\u0101ra and Buddha\" will be known to most of you as an excellent example of the right method of historical criticism in the comparison of documents of varying age in their treatment of one set of ideas. In all that has been done by both of these distinguished scholars they have been carrying out the objects this Society was founded to\npromote. It is very difficult for us, who have only thirty vacancies to fill up, to choose rightly, and, of course, it is always somewhat invidious to choose at all, but I think there can be no doubt that the gentlemen the Council has named to you are worthy of the honour of being our honorary members. (Applause.)\n\nMr. Adler: I do not know if I am in order in suggesting a name for the Council, but I should like to suggest the name of Mr. Thomson Lyon, who has acted, I think, as Auditor of this Society for some time. He is a young man: I do not know if that be a fault: it will probably improve in time. He has done good work on the Transliteration Committee; and I can speak of my own knowledge from this fact, that there is no member of this Society so popular at the reunions abroad of the Oriental Congresses as Mr. Lyon.\n\nThe Chairman: Before I put the motion which has been so eloquently and exhaustively moved by Dr. Thornton and so suggestively seconded by Mr. Kennedy, I shall only make a very few remarks. In the first place, it is quite true that this Society meets in rooms which are of a very modest character. But if it be any relief to your feelings, I may mention that I was lately present at a meeting of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique in Paris, and certainly the room where those gentlemen met was smaller and even lower as to its ceiling than this room. But I was very pleased to see that they were evidently proud of their humble surroundings; and I am not sure that if the day ever comes that you will be in palatial surroundings, that the work will be more satisfactory than that which is performed now in these humble apartments. I heard M. Jules Simon relate, in most eloquent language, when he had lately to address an audience in the magnificent buildings of the new Sorbonne, how he regarded the day when he was admitted through a little door by M. Cousin to the tiny room in which M. Cousin lectured, as an event in his life which made him feel rather uncomfortable in those more sumptuous surroundings of the University.\nLet us not forget, gentlemen, that after all this Society, its character and its future, depend on the seriousness of the work of its students; and so long as this Society shall have in the future, as it certainly has at present, the hearty co-operation of Orientalists of all departments and of all schools, both here and in India, of men like Professor Bhandarkar and of other learned Pundits in our Eastern dependency, and the respect which we now undoubtedly enjoy of all foreign societies, so long it shall prosper, even if its finances are not in the most brilliant condition. I wish your Treasurer could deliver a statement such as the Chancellor of the Exchequer made the other day about the finances of England; but I do not see that we can attain that condition for a very long time to come.\n\nI listened to Mr. Kennedy's suggestions with great interest. One of them, he will be pleased to hear, will be carried out at once, for a proposal about the composition fee is to be made presently. Then his suggestion with regard to the papers which are read, and not printed in the Journal, must undoubtedly be considered. Perhaps even Mr. Kennedy might go a step further, and we might make this alteration, that a paper in the Journal which had been circulated among the members, might be discussed at one of our meetings\u2014and some papers are well adapted to a debate. The members would come here after having read the paper in the Journal. There would be no necessity to read a paper, and we could at once enter upon a lively discussion. That is a suggestion growing out of the suggestion made by Mr. Kennedy. It would be to the same effect as if a sermon were published and the congregation invited to discuss the sermon. (Hear, hear.) I merely mention this as an idea which, perhaps by a revolutionary evolution, I deduced from what Mr. Kennedy said.\n\nThe very interesting speech made by Mr. Raynbird was not, I think, at all egotistical, but struck me, as I suppose it did most of the members present, as very practical and\nvery much to the point. We might certainly improve neglected opportunities in many ways. We have all listened with pleasure to Dr. Leitner's speech. He has taken up more or less the position of a candid friend of our Society, and he has a right to assume that position, because we all know that he does take a real interest in our work. We also know that he himself undertakes a good deal of work in the field that we cover, and there is plenty of room for all. What he has said about our Oriental School deserves our assent. I hope he did not think I meant merely widening the scope of any existing Oriental School. What I desire to get is an Oriental School forming an essential and principal branch of the London University, with recognized courses of instruction and degrees. We shall then be able to compete with the very important schools which exist abroad. I hope Dr. Leitner will be one of the witnesses called by the Statutory Commission, and will give evidence on the organization of Oriental studies in Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and St. Petersburg. We can draw on the experience which has been gained in those various capitals. I am sure Professor B\u00fchler's evidence would also be most valuable. In conclusion, I wish to thank you for having attended this meeting in such large numbers, and to say that the active co-operation of members, the suggestions made to us either about the Journal or about our meetings, will be most acceptable to those responsible for the increased usefulness of the Society. (Applause.)\n\n[Dr. Cust here took the chair, as the President had to leave.]\n\nM. Gaster, Ph.D.: I have to move a small change in one of our rules, and shall not detain you more than a few minutes. I should like to draw your attention to the fact that the intellectual income of the Society is derived from two sources\u2014men with brains and money, and men with brains but without money; and the question is, how can we enlist the greatest number of scholars and workers in the Society to make the Journal as complete as possible, and to widen the interest and work of the\nSociety. I have been entrusted, therefore, with the following resolution to submit to you: \"That persons residing in London, who earn their livelihood by teaching or research, should be eligible as members of the Society on the same terms as non-residents.\" That is to say, they will pay 30s. instead of \u00a33 3s. They will not be members of the Council, but will be entitled to all the other privileges which the non-resident members enjoy, and we should have the right to enjoy their intellectual services on behalf of the Society. It might bring us only a few shillings, but it will also bring mints of intellectual gold and increased interest in the proceedings of the Society.\n\nDr. Leitner: I have much pleasure in seconding this motion, and there is very little to be added to the eloquent and practical remarks of Dr. Gaster. It often happens that the working men in literature and science are not blessed with this world's means, and yet their adhesion is very valuable. I should almost think a guinea would be enough, but 30s. may not deter them. Besides the advantage of having new members, I think you are really tapping the brains of new men for your Society. I do not quite understand what is meant by their not being members of Council, and I am glad to see that is not embodied in the words of the resolution. I think it might be left for the Society to decide whether they should be eligible. I would welcome them there, and would simply make the rule that all engaged in teaching, and especially in the teaching and authorship of Oriental languages, should be admissible as members of the Society, and reserve all further questions for the Council to settle.\n\nGeneral G. G. Alexander: It seems to me that a proposition of that kind is so important that sufficient notice ought to be given, that it might be well thought over before it is brought to the vote; and, generally speaking, I think it is desirable to give notice beforehand of any motion that deals with the constitution of the Society. I propose, therefore, that the consideration of it be adjourned to some future meeting.\nThe Chairman: The rule is that \"The Anniversary Meeting of the Society shall ordinarily be held on the second Tuesday in May to receive and consider a report of the Council on the state of the Society; to receive the Report of the Auditors on the Treasurer's Accounts; to elect the Council and Officers for the ensuing year; to elect Honorary Members; and to deliberate on such other questions as may be proposed relative to the affairs of the Society.\" This is the only occasion on which the Society meets collectively; the question has been thoroughly thrashed out in the Council. It is a liberal measure, and should not be put off. It may not be offered again.\n\n[The motion was put, and carried unanimously.]\n\nProfessor Bendall: I have great pleasure in moving that Rule 42 should run as follows:\n\n\"42.\u2014The following compositions are allowed in lieu of annual subscriptions\u2014\n\n\"For resident members for life, forty-five guineas.\n\n\"For non-resident members for life, twenty-two pounds ten shillings; for four years' subscription in advance, five guineas.\"\n\nThis question has been carefully considered by the Council, who appointed a small committee, of which I was a member, to go into the question. The Secretary was good enough to get us the rules of several other societies. We had, I think, before us, the rules of the London Library, but we thought them somewhat too elaborate. We came to the following somewhat simple result, but still in the direction which was indicated by Mr. Kennedy. We quite agreed that the Society did stand to lose by the existing rate of composition, which is ten years' subscription. I cannot say that it is inappropriate that I have been asked to bring this forward, for I am a standing example of the loss the Society suffers by it. I entered fifteen years ago, and compounded\u2014I remember it was a great pull on me then\u2014and for the last three or four years, since the ten years have passed, you have\nbeen steadily losing by me. Perhaps in more fortunate days I may be able to join that noble army of the compounders who voluntarily pay extra; but meanwhile, we propose that the composition be calculated on a basis of fifteen years' subscriptions, as it is in most of the other societies.\n\nMr. H. Morris: I formally second that motion.\n\nMr. Thomson Lyon: May I ask when the change is to come into effect, for I was in the course of making an arrangement to commute?\n\nThe Chairman: I think it need have no retrospective effect if you have already communicated your intention.\n\nMr. Thomson Lyon: In that case I should be quite prepared to vote for it.\n\n[The motion was put, and carried unanimously.]\n\nMr. Morris: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, the change which I have now to propose is a formal one, but it goes very much in the direction of what Dr. Gaster said just now, of widening and broadening the basis of the Society. In Rule 9 you have this\u2014\n\n\"Any person who has rendered distinguished service towards the attainment of the objects of the Society shall be eligible for election as an Honorary Member.\"\n\nThat makes two classes of persons, Ordinary Members and Honorary Members; and now we propose another clause respecting those who have distinguished themselves, and yet at the same time are unable to pay the ordinary subscriptions, and it is proposed to add Rule 9a\u2014\n\n\"It shall be in the competence of the Council to elect in special cases any person as a Member of the Society without payment; such member to receive the Society's publications, and have all the privileges of a non-resident member.\"\n\nThere are already two gentlemen who have been dealt with under the section which we propose, and the Secretary seemed to think it was out of order to have no rule providing for such cases; and therefore the Council agreed that\nwe should put these words in the rule in order that there should be no favour in the future. We had one very pathetic case of a gentleman abroad, who was unable to pay, and yet wanted to keep up his touch with the Society and to receive the publications. I beg therefore to propose the addition of Rule 9a.\n\nMr. Kay: I beg to second it.\n\nThe Chairman: This has always been the practical rule of the Geographical Society. There are men whose means are very narrow, and who cannot pay the subscription. They are very few; we have only two, but they are men who are certified to be most deserving of the indulgence.\n\n[The motion was put, and carried.]\n\nMr. Morris: In Rule 24 we find\u2014\n\n\"The Ordinary Meetings of Council shall be held once a month from November to June inclusive, and five shall form a quorum.\"\n\nand in Rule 26 we find\u2014\n\n\"Five Members of Council shall constitute a quorum.\"\n\nThis is a mere piece of redundancy; therefore the Council proposes that in Rule 24 the words \"and five shall form a quorum\" be expunged.\n\nRule 45 is another small matter. It says that\u2014\n\n\"Every person elected a Non-Resident member shall make the payment due from him within eight calendar months after his election.\"\n\nThis rule was written when we were a very long distance from India, and a very long distance from other Oriental countries. Nowadays, as you all know, we are very close to India and other Oriental countries, so we propose to alter the eight into six.\n\n[These changes were put to the meeting, and carried.]\n\nProfessor Rhys Davids: At this late hour I would not venture to trouble you with the paper I was announced to read. With the permission of the Chairman, the reading will be postponed to the next meeting.\nJune 9th, 1896.\u2014Mr. F. F. Arbuthnot in the Chair.\n\n1. A letter from Dr. Waddell on \"Ceylon Rosaries\" was read; and Mr. Wickremasinghe exhibited some ancient beads found in a dagaba, and described the use of the beads. Mr. Sewell, Professor Bendall, Dr. Gaster, and Professor Rhys Davids took part in the discussion. Dr. Waddell's letter will be found in this Number of the Journal.\n\n2. The Secretary read Mr. J. Takakusu's paper on \"The Discovery of a P\u0101li MS. in the Chinese Buddhist Collection.\" Mr. Watters, Dr. Gaster, and Professor Rhys Davids took part in the discussion. The paper appears in this Number of the Journal.\n\nII. CONTENTS OF FOREIGN ORIENTAL JOURNALS.\n\n1.

Obituary Notice.\n\nHenri Sauvaire.\n\nHenri Sauvaire died on the 4th April last, aged 65 years, at Robernier, a property he possessed in the south of France, and which some fifteen years ago became his permanent place of abode. His death will be lamented by many who had experienced the charm of his genial and kindly nature, and who have lost in him a much valued friend; but it is an unquestionable loss also to all interested in Arabic studies.\n\nSauvaire's life was spent in the Consular Service of his country. From 1857 he held successive appointments in\nthe Levant as Oriental interpreter. He was attached in 1860 to the French Mission in Syria. In 1876 he was placed in charge of the French Vice-Consulate at Casablanca, in Morocco; and in 1879 he was promoted to the rank of Consul. In the following year he was, at his own request, placed on the unattached list (en disponibilit\u00e9); and in 1883 he was granted his retirement, to which he had become entitled by the rules of the Service.\n\nThroughout the years of his official life, his hours of leisure were unremittingly devoted to the cultivation of the language and literature of the Arabs, a labour of love which endured almost to the last day of his life, and in which his distinguished talents and unflagging industry long ago gained him a deservedly high reputation. His cabinet of Muhammadan coins, formed during his long residence in Egypt and Syria, ranks as one of the very finest private collections of the kind that has been made, remarkable alike for its richness and for the many rare specimens it includes. But of still greater value are the innumerable papers on Oriental numismatics, due to his indefatigable pen, published for the most part in the Annuaire de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Numismatique, in the Journal of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique, and some also in the Journal of this Society and in the Numismatic Chronicle. In all these Sauvaire's learning and scholarly care are conspicuously shown, and not a few have thrown light upon obscure points of history.\n\nAmong other works deserving particular notice is a series of articles on the history of Muhammadan numismatics and metrology, consisting of a large selection of extracts from the works of native writers. They were collected into four volumes, which appeared in 1882\u20137, forming a store of materials which future students of the subject will find of the greatest service.\n\nIn 1876 were published his excerpts from the Muhammadan history of Jerusalem and Hebron, the *Uns al-Jalil* of Mujir ad-din: in 1884, his translation of the journal of a Moorish envoy sent, in 1691, to the Court\nof King Charles II of Spain: in 1893, an exhaustive description of an Arab astrolabe, dated A.H. 609 (A.D. 1212\u20133) and made at Seville, in the scientific portion of which he was assisted by M. de Rey-Pailhade. In the following year the first volume appeared of his translation, enriched with numerous and valuable notes, of 'Abd al-B\u0101sit's historical account of the pious foundations of Damascus. Both the last-mentioned works were reprints from the Journal Asiatique.\n\nSauvaire was Correspondent of the Institute, and took part at Paris last summer in the celebration of its centenary. So far back as 1865, he was appointed Knight of the Legion of Honour, and among his other well-earned distinctions was that of Commander in the Spanish order of Isabella the Catholic.\n\nIn a letter received by the writer in December last, Sauvaire mentioned that he was engaged in the final revision for the press of an account of the Judicial Astrology of the Arabs, extracted and translated from Ibn al-Kummi's Madkhal (or Mudkhil), a work which will without doubt add to the debt due to its author for his labours in the cause of Eastern research.\n\nH. C. K.\n\nIV. Notes and News.\n\nAmerican Oriental Society.\u2014This Society held its annual meeting in the middle of April last, and about thirty papers on various branches of Oriental inquiry were submitted for publication in its Journal. We are glad to learn that the financial position of the Society is satisfactory, and that a new issue of the Journal may shortly be expected. There is a good deal of first-class work in Oriental matters now being done by American scholars, who have so often received part of their training in Germany; and the prospect of help in our researches from the New World is full of promise.\nSanskrit at Yale.\u2014Mr. Edward Washburn Hopkins, author of \"The Religions of India\" and \"Ruling Castes in Ancient India,\" has been appointed Professor of Sanskrit in succession to Professor Whitney.\n\nA Survey of Vernacular Languages.\u2014Mr. G. A. Grierson, C.I.E., with the encouragement of the Government of India and the Royal Asiatic Society of Calcutta, has undertaken a work of considerable interest and importance in which Bombay is concerned\u2014namely, a survey of the vernacular languages of Northern, Central, and Western India. This is intended to be preliminary to a fuller linguistic survey which may be arranged for later on if the preliminary survey be successful. The idea is, in the first place, to compile a catalogue of the name of every language and dialect spoken in India. It will surprise most people, we (Bombay Gazette) imagine, to hear that this is so little determined that some estimate the number at 150 and others at 250. The next thing will be to obtain specimens of each language or dialect in the shape of a translation of some one fable or other piece of English suitable for the purpose; and finally, there will be the classification of the languages according to their affinities and characteristics.\u2014Homeward Mail.\n\nP\u0101li and Sanskrit in Japan.\u2014The Rev. Shaku Konen has returned from his journey to Ceylon, undertaken with a view of studying Buddhism there, and has opened a school at Kanagawa, in Japan, for the study by Japanese Buddhists of the P\u0101li documents of their religion.\u2014Another Japanese, Mr. Tokuzawa Chiezo, is still studying P\u0101li at the Widyodaya College, in Colombo.\u2014Mr. Sensei Murakami is lecturer on Indian Philosophy at the Tokyo University; and a Chair of Sanskrit has been recently established there, with Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio as Professor.\n\nStudy of Persian in London.\u2014Dr. E. Denison Ross, M.R.A.S., has been appointed to the Chair of Persian at University College, London. This Chair was held for many years by Dr. Rieu, now Professor of Arabic in Cambridge, conjointly with the Chair of Arabic; but it has now been decided to separate the two Chairs.\nDr. Richard Morris.\u2014The First Lord of the Treasury has granted pensions of \u00a325 a year on the Civil List to each of the three unmarried daughters of this distinguished philologist, late member of Council of the R.A.S.\n\nWright's Arabic Grammar, 3rd Edition.\u2014This new edition of the standard Arabic Grammar in English very modestly styles itself again \"translated from the German of Caspari,\" although it has outgrown this till nearly twice the size of the original. We can confine ourselves to simply notifying the fact that the first volume has just appeared, whilst the second is in the press. Part of it was already prepared by the late Prof. Robertson Smith; the remainder went through the hands of Profs. de Goeje in Leyden and Bevan in Cambridge. For the numerous remarks bearing on common Semitic philology, references are made in the new edition to the author's \"Lectures on the Comparative Grammar, etc.,\" edited, 1890, by the late Robertson Smith. The names mentioned as editors and coadjutor are sufficient guarantee for the excellence of this edition.\n\nIndian Chronology.\u2014The work on Indian Chronology, upon which Miss Duff has been so long engaged, is promised for publication before the end of the year. Modelled on Fynes Clinton's \"Epitome of the Chronology of Greece and Rome,\" it aims at giving in tabular form all those dates relating to the civil and literary history of India, between the sixth century B.C. and the sixteenth century A.D., which have been established by the historical, archaeological, and literary researches of recent years. As each date is accompanied by references to the sources from which it is derived, the book, besides giving a chronological register of events, will serve, at the same time, as an index to the bibliography of Indian Chronology generally; a fact which should make it useful to scholars engaged in this branch of research. An appendix of dynastic lists, arranged similarly to those in Prinsep's \"Useful Tables,\" will be included in the work.\n\nIndian and Oriental Armour.\u2014The public are indebted to Lord Egerton of Tatton for a new edition of his most\ninteresting work on Indian and Oriental armour. The catalogue originally drawn up for the illustration of the arms at the India Museum has to a certain extent become useless by the transfer of the collection to South Kensington, and as yet neither the authorities at South Kensington nor at the British Museum have published a separate catalogue. As the \"Handbook of Oriental Arms\" alludes to both of those collections, its author deemed it advisable to bring out a new edition, and to add a chapter on Arab arms, with which our recent experiences in the Soudan have made us more fully acquainted. He also desired to describe his own collection, which contains some examples not found in either of our national collections, and which also exemplifies the great variety and richness of design in Oriental arms. Hence the present volume. It has been beautifully illustrated, some of the plates being in colours.\n\nGraeco-Buddhist Sculptures.\u2014As is well known, these sculptures, found in such large numbers in and about the district formerly included in the kingdom of Gandh\u0101ra, have only hitherto been dated conjecturally, on reasoning based on artistic grounds alone. Hofrath G. B\u00fchler read a paper last month before the historical branch of the Vienna Academy on an inscription in Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b characters found on one of the sculptures in the Lahore Museum, which he dates, on pal\u00e6ographical grounds, in the second century A.D. This confirms the conclusions reached, by Mr. V. A. Smith and Prof. Gr\u00fcnwedel, on artistic grounds. The inscription merely mentions that the statue was the gift of one Sanghamitra.\n\nOriental Translation Fund.\u2014The next work to be published by the Oriental Translation Fund is B\u0101na's romance, Kadamb\u0101r\u012b, translated, with occasional abridgments, by Miss C. M. Ridding. A full abstract of the continuation by the author's son is added, with translations of some portions. This volume will appear in the autumn.\nV. Notices of Books.\n\nNotes on Buddhist Bas-reliefs. By Serge D'Oldenbourg. 4to, pp. 28. (St. Petersburg, 1895.)\n\nThis work forms a part of the publications of the Faculty of Oriental Languages at St. Petersburg, and the pages of the separate offprint are numbered 337-365. In it the learned author passes in review the bas-reliefs and paintings at Bharhut, Ajanta, and Boro Budur. The text is, unfortunately, in Russian, but, with the help of Mr. Ross, I have been able to make out the results arrived at. These are as follows:\n\nBharhut.\n\nPl. xviii.

Of the above twenty-six identifications, eighteen were given in the list appended to my \"Buddhist Birth Stories\"; the remaining eight have been discovered by various scholars since.\n\nAjanta.\n\nSome of the paintings described by Burgess, in the Ninth Report of the Archaeological Survey of Western India (Bombay, 1879), are identified as follows:\n\np. 32.

To make, in the absence of any guiding inscriptions, such identifications as these, requires rare gifts of attention and of memory; and the results here set forth show the only way along which the many still unidentified bas-reliefs can be explained.\n\nR.H. D.\nGuru-P\u016bj\u0101-Kaumud\u012b. Small 4to, pp. 128, with a plate. (Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1896.)\n\nThis very interesting volume contains thirty short papers on points of Indian history or philology, written by as many friends and pupils of Professor Weber and presented to him by way of congratulation on the jubilee of his doctorate of philosophy in the University of Breslau. It is prefaced by an eloquent and graceful letter from Hofrath Dr. Georg B\u00fchler, in which the splendid services rendered by our distinguished Honorary Member through so many years to the cause of Indian research in all its branches, are set forth, and expression is given to the deep feelings of gratitude and reverence with which he is regarded, not only by his own pupils, but by scholars throughout the world.\n\nIt would be of course impossible within the limits of a book-notice in this Journal, even if one had the necessary knowledge, to pass in review each of the thirty essays dealing with points so widely scattered over the whole field of Indian study. Every Indianist must consult the volume itself, and more particularly for the questions coming within the range of his own speciality. But the whole volume is a remarkable sign of the times in two directions, which have certainly not been present to the minds of the writers, and are therefore all the more suggestive.\n\nThis is the first volume published by a number of distinguished Oriental scholars in which (apart from the plate illustrative of a question of paleography) there is not a single Oriental character employed. We have, of course, seen a similar phenomenon in the Journal of the P\u0101li Text Society. But that is a journal devoted to only one branch of Indian history. And though, no doubt, the complete success of the use of transliteration as applied to P\u0101li has opened the eyes of other scholars; still the prejudice in favour of Oriental type has been so strong, and has so many good reasons (and, what is of more importance, such powerful sentiments) in its favour, that\nno one, even a few years ago, would have expected so striking an occurrence. Professor Weber was one of the first to rise superior to the feeling against transliteration, and to see that the balance of advantage lay, after all, on its side. It is a (no doubt quite unconscious) tribute to his foresight, that this gift volume of affectionate regard should be entirely transliterated.\n\nThe second matter is really, to a great extent, dependent on this other. Of the thirty essays, no less than one-third deal with points of P\u0101li or other Buddhist subjects. Now, of course, most Sanskritists are willing, not only to admit, but to maintain, that in the reconstruction of the temporarily lost history of Indian thought, documents in the prakrits must be allowed their proper value side by side with documents in Sanskrit; and the ideas of Jains or Buddhists or other heretics are not, merely by their opposition to the Brahmanical theologies, on that account of no importance. But these studies still rank only as bye-paths; and the necessity of mastering strange and uncouth alphabets would have gone a great way to deter scholars from turning off from the beaten track. Here, again, Professor Albrecht Weber was one of the first to welcome all available evidence, whether expressed in Sanskrit or not, and has been always eager to press forward\u2014et nihil tetigit quod non lustravit\u2014into unexplored fields of inquiry. It is especially fitting, therefore, that this Festgabe to him should consist so largely of what, to a narrower Sanskritist, would be extraneous studies. But this second tribute to his foresight is as undesigned as the other; and it marks a real step forward, which can now never again be lost, in the method of Indian research.\n\nWe take this opportunity of adding our congratulations to those of Professor Weber's friends and pupils, and of echoing the wish that he may be long spared to enjoy the high position he has won in the world of scholars, and to add still further by his creative work to the dignity and the value of the studies he has done so much to promote and foster.\n\nR.H. D.\nDie Sprache und Schrift der Ju\u010den. Von Dr. Wilhelm Grube, A.O. Professor an der K\u00f6nigl. Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin. (Leipzig, 1896.)\n\nThose who are interested in the study of the people and the language known by such names as N\u00fcchi, N\u00fc-ch'en, and Juchen, will be grateful to Professor Grube for his \"Die Sprache und Schrift der Ju\u010den.\"\n\nThis work begins with a short preface in which we have a few remarks about the grammar of the Juchen language. The first section of the treatise proper contains a Juchen-Chinese Glossary. This is a classified vocabulary of a number of Juchen terms with Chinese transcriptions of their sounds, and the equivalents of the terms in Chinese. The student should use this glossary with care and caution, as some of the Chinese transcriptions and renderings are at least doubtful. He will probably find that he has to suppose the sounds of the Juchen terms to be given by the \"fan-ts'ieh\" process more frequently than Dr. Grube thinks. He will also observe that in some instances the terms given here as the Juchen equivalents for Chinese words and phrases are different from those given in Mr. Wylie's Vocabulary and in other books. Many of the terms given in the present glossary as Juchen are purely Chinese, and many others are closely related to modern Manchu words.\n\nThe second part of the treatise gives a list of the Juchen words in the glossary arranged according to the number of strokes in the characters; the third part gives an alphabetical index to the characters; the fourth part gives a Juchen-German glossary of the Juchen words in the original vocabulary; and the fifth part gives a series of Chinese documents with a literal translation of each into Juchen terms, together with transcriptions of the latter and translations from the Chinese into German.\n\nI propose now to make a very few observations on some passages in this curious and interesting book.\n\nAt p. 6 we find the Chinese compiler of the glossary gives \"Han-shi-ha-ch'eng-yin\" (\u585e\u98df\u54c8\u7a31\u56e0), that is,\n\"the period of cold food,\" as the equivalent of the Chinese Ch'ing-ming (\u6e05\u660e) period. The latter, however, denotes the period which immediately follows the Hanshi, which is not a chil or period properly speaking. No. 101 on this page gives Ch'ung-yang or double yang, the ninth day of the ninth month, as in Juchen \"Ch'u-w\u00ean tu-lu-w\u00ean.\" Here Ch'u-w\u00ean is apparently, as Dr. Grube states, for the Chinese Ch'ung; and tuluc\u00ean, which means \"warm,\" is for yang. Dr. Grube calls the Ch'ung-yang the \"Drachenfeste,\" but it has nothing to do with dragons.\n\nOn p. 17, No. 322, we have the Juchen term Pai (Poh)-i written \u767e\u5937, with the Chinese equivalent written with the same characters, translated by Dr. Grube \"Die Barbaren.\" But who are the \"100 Barbarians\"? May not Poh-i here be for the term now written Pao-i and denoting the \"serfs\" of the people? The inner division of each Manchu Banner, Mr. Mayers tells us, \"is composed of the so-called pao-i (\u5305\u8863), from the Manchu bo-i, signifying a bondservant, who are especially bound to render suit and service\" (\"The Chinese Government,\" 2nd ed., p. 51).\n\nAt p. 18, No. 324, we find the native name corresponding to the Chinese \"N\u00fc-chi\" given as Chu-hsien (\u6731\u5148), that is, probably Juein. This seems to agree with the statement made by Chinese authorities that the original name of the people was Su-sh\u00ean (\u8607\u614e), and that this became corrupted to N\u00fcch\u00ean and N\u00fc-chi.\n\nThe series of texts and translations in Part V is not of much value from any point of view. On Dr. Grube's translations from the Chinese there is only one observation which need be made here. Each document ends with the words \u594f\u5f97\u8056\u7687\u5e1d\u77e5\u9053, and these the Professor translates\u2014\"Sr. Majest\u00e4t zur Kenntnissnahme unterbreitet.\" Is not the meaning rather \"The memorialist had the honour to receive the Imperial Rescript 'Noted' \"? The character \u594f is apparently a mistake for \u5949.\n\nT. W.\nInscriptions de l'Orkhon d\u00e9chiffr\u00e9es par Vilh. Thomsen, Professeur de Philologie compar\u00e9e \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 de Copenhague. (Helsingfors : Imprimerie de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Litt\u00e9rature Finnoise, 1896.)\n\nThis is the latest and in some respects the most valuable of the contributions to the literature of the Orkhon inscriptions.\n\nIn 1889 the Archaeological Society of Finland published a volume of \"Inscriptions de l'J\u00e9nissei.\" This was the first work to draw attention to the numerous specimens of some curious but unknown writing found in South Siberia. The work was the result of the researches instituted by the Finnish Archaeological Society under the direction of Mr. Aspelin.\n\nIn the years 1890\u20131 new inscriptions, also in the unknown writing, were discovered in the valley of the Orkhon in North Mongolia, near the Kooho Tsa\u00efdam Lake and not far from the sites of the ruined cities Karakorum and Kara Balgassun. These inscriptions were photographed for the Finnish expedition under Mr. Heikel and for the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg by Professor Radloff.\n\nThe key to the unknown writing from Orkhon was found in a very ingenious manner by Professor Thomsen, of Copenhagen, and in 1894 he published his short notice entitled \"D\u00e9chiffrement des Inscriptions de l'Orkhon et de l'J\u00e9nissei.\" In this notice the Professor details the process by which he arrived at a clue to the nature of the strange writing, to the values of the letters, and the decipherment and translation of the inscriptions. At the end of the pamphlet he gives his proposed transcription and transliteration of the alphabet. It was not until the present year that the Professor was able to carry out his design of giving a full and particular account of the results of his researches in the Orkhon inscriptions, and this he has done in the volume now before us.\n\nThis treatise in the first part gives us the alphabet of\nthe language, ancient Turkish, in which the inscriptions are composed, the alphabet being arranged according to vowels and consonants. The author next describes the process by which he came to give the letters their values and to treat them as he does in his translations. At the end of this part of the treatise we have some remarks on the probable origin of the alphabet and on its affinities. M. Thomsen dismisses the conjectures as to the alphabet's relations advanced by others, and states his reasons for thinking it to be allied to the Semitic Aramean alphabet.\n\nThe next part of the treatise is the introduction to the translations, and in this we have a very interesting summary of the history of the Turks known in Chinese books as the \"T'u-k\u00fce.\" The notices of this people given here are derived from Chinese originals through European translations. Then we have the transcription and translation of two of the Orkhon inscriptions. These are supplemented by notes and \"Additions et Rectifications,\" an \"Index analytique des mati\u00e8res,\" and an \"Index t\u00fcrk\" in two divisions. As an appendix, we have an English translation of the least defective of the Chinese inscriptions from Orkhon by Mr. E. H. Parker.\n\nThe two old Turkish inscriptions here transcribed and translated by M. Thomsen were found engraven on large stone monuments. Each of these monuments contains also a Chinese inscription from the T'ang Emperor Hs\u00fcan Tsung. The Turkish and Chinese writings are not in any degree related as original and translation, and they agree only in being concerned with the same Turkish heroes. The two Turkish inscriptions were apparently the work of Bilga Khan, though written out by a relative. This Khan was a son of the Kutluk Khan and elder brother of the Kul Teghin. It was to the memory of this last that one of the monuments, the Monument I of M. Thomsen, was erected and the Chinese and Turkish inscriptions on it were composed. The work was executed by Chinese artisans, and the monument was apparently set up in the year 732, the date of the Imperial epitaph for Kul Teghin.\nThe inscriptions on the Monument II of Professor Thomsen are in a much more mutilated and unsatisfactory state than those on the other monument. They were composed apparently in the year 735. In that year the Bilga Khan was assassinated (or poisoned) by a chief of the Meilu (\u6885 \u932b) horde, and he was succeeded by his son, who became T\u00eang-li (\u767b \u5229) Khan.\n\nThe two Turkish inscriptions here translated by M. Thomsen give us many interesting notices of the exploits of Bilga Khan and his illustrious brother Kul Teghin. They are valuable also for the references which they contain to the former and the existing state of the Turks under Bilga's rule. Professor Thomsen has been able to compare his renderings with those given by M. Radloff in \"Die Alt-t\u00fcrkischen Inschriften der Mongolei.\" His criticisms of the readings and renderings of M. Radloff are not the least interesting part of this valuable treatise.\n\nA few words must now be devoted to the Imperial Chinese epitaph on Monument I and its translations. Of these there are at least four, viz.: two in German by Professors Wassiljew and G. von der Gabelentz, one in French by Professor Schlegel, and one in English by Mr. Parker. It must be admitted, however, that there is still need for a new and correct translation. M. Schlegel, in his \"La St\u00e8le Fun\u00e9raire du Teghin Giogh,\" gives the Chinese text of the epitaph with his proposed restorations of some of the lost characters. In the first column he gives us the reading Pi-ch\u00fcn-chang-ch\u00ea-p\u00ean[-yin-yang-ch\u00ee]-i-ye (\u5f7c \u541b \u9577 \u8005 \u672c [\u9670 \u967d \u4e4b] \u5947 \u4e5f). The words Yin-yang-ch\u00ee are the Professor's conjecture, the original characters being lost. He, accordingly, translates\u2014\"La souverainet\u00e9 est donc en principe la descendance du (Yin et du Yang).\" Mr. Parker accepts the conjectural restoration as though it were a certainty, and translates\u2014\"These prince-elders are, in fact, the hereditary consequences of the [above-mentioned] two elements.\" But M. Schlegel's conjecture seems to make the Chinese emperor write what is neither Chinese nor sense. Professor\nWassiljew's suggestion seems to point to the correct restoration, viz. Hsia Houshi (\u590f\u540e\u6c0f). According to the Chinese, the T'u-k\u00fce were the descendants of the Hiung-nu, and the descent of the latter was traced to the great Y\u00fc, the founder of the Hsia dynasty, and hence called Hsia Hou. \"Your chiefs,\" says the Emperor, \"were originally the descendants of Hsia Hou.\" This name actually occurs in the second Chinese inscription given in Radloff's \"Alt-t\u00fcrkischen Inschriften,\" the first character being now missing. One of the names of the Emperor Y\u00fc was W\u00eanmimg, and it is not impossible perhaps that this in Turkish pronunciation became \"Bumin,\" the name of the Khan whom Bilga seems to regard as his first forefather.\n\nThe epitaph continues\u2014Shou-tsz-Chung-kuo-hsiung-fei (\u9996\u81ea\u4e2d\u570b\u96c4\u98db); and M. Schlegel translates these words by\u2014\"D'abord, elle [la souverainet\u00e9] s'est etendue victorieusement de l'Empire du Milieu.\" Mr. Parker's rendering of the words is a little better\u2014\"[Now] dating back from the time when China made her robust flight.\" But the two words hsiung-fei convey an allusion to a poem of the Kuo Feng in the Shiching which begins \u96c4\u96c9\u5e72\u98db, \"the cock-pheasants (?) as they fly.\" The wife whose husband is detained far away in the wars compares him to the brave and handsome pheasant which can fly home at will. Thus the words of the text mean\u2014\"Beginning with the frontier wars of China,\" that is, in the reigns of Wu Ti and other emperors of the Han dynasty. These wars led to the pacification of the Hiung-nu and other border tribes, and to the introduction of good government among them for a time.\n\nSeveral other passages in these translations require to be revised, but further observations must be reserved for another possible opportunity.\n\nT. W.\n1. The Imitation of \u015aankara. By Manil\u0101l N. Dvivedi. 8vo, pp. 229. (Bombay, 1895.)\n2. The M\u0101nd\u016bkya Upanishad. By the same. (Bombay Theosophical Society, 1894.)\n3.

(London Theosophical Society, 1896.)\n\nThese works, published from the point of view, not of the scholar, but of the propagandist, deserve notice, not only as an interesting sign of the times, but also as being incidentally useful to the student of Indian thought. The \"Imitation of \u015aankara\" is avowedly fashioned after Mr. Bowden's \"Imitation of Buddha,\" which is merely a birthday book with an edifying passage selected for each day of the year from Buddhist writings. So does Mr. Dvivedi select 658 sentences, not taken, indeed, from \u015aankara, but from recognized authorities on the view of life propounded by \u015aankara, and arranges them, not one for each day, but according to the subject\u2014Guru, Karma, J\u00f1\u0101na, Yoga, and so on. Each sentence or verse is given both in English and Sanskrit; and there are four capital indices\u2014of authors quoted, of the first words (in Sanskrit) of each sentence, of details of the Ved\u0101ntist view referred to in the sentences (act, being, belief, ecstasy, evil, etc.), and of Sanskrit technical terms used in the English sentences: all these are so well drawn up that the whole forms a most useful book of reference on the Advaita system.\n\nSo also the second book on the list, though it has a long introduction in which the claims of the Advaita Ved\u0101ntism to be the highest outcome of human thought are urged in an extravagant way, goes on to give a very reliable and valuable version of the Upanishad itself, and of Gaudap\u0101da's K\u0101rik\u0101 and \u015aankara's Bha\u1e63ya\u2014again a very useful work.\n\nThe \"Theosophy of the Upanishads\" is of quite a different class. Here an anonymous author gives his own view of\nthe Advaita teaching in language supposed to be intelligible to modern Western readers. He quotes authorities without chapter and verse, and has practically put together a book of Ved\u0101nta and water which is of no value to the historical or philosophical student.\n\nIn the last work on our list the student will find, for the price of sixpence (!), a translation, in several respects very interesting, of six of the early Upanishads\u2014the Is\u0101, Kena, Katha, Pra\u015bna, Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka, and M\u0101nd\u016bkya. It is a dainty volume, got up to imitate the smaller modern Sanskrit MSS. on paper; and the peculiarity of the versions is the attempt to convey in English the ruggedness and ambiguity of the original Sanskrit. There are short introductions, and a few very short notes, but no indices of any kind. Perhaps these are reserved for the next volume, which is to give six more of the early Upanishads. The translations are distinctly interesting and scholarly, though it is a pity that they follow so exclusively the Advaita interpretation of documents so much older than the completed Advaita scheme.\n\nOn the whole, these four manuals of devotion\u2014for they do not pretend to be anything more\u2014give a more favourable impression than most scholars would expect of theosophical activity.\n\nLes Lapidaires Indiens. By Louis Finot. 8vo, pp. lvi and 277. (Paris, 1896.)\n\nThis essay, published as No. 111 of the Library of the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes in Paris, has gained for its author the title of \u00e9l\u00e8ve dipl\u00f4m\u00e9 of the historical and philological section of the school. We have here eight different Sanskrit textbooks of the art of the Indian lapidary, edited from MSS., two of them translated with notes, and the whole provided with elaborate indices and a very careful and interesting introduction.\n\nThe principal is the Ratnapar\u012bk\u1e63\u0101, by Buddhabhata (spelt Buddhabhata in the colophon), which purports to be an\nabstract of the Ratnas\u0101stra. There are striking analogies between this poem of 252 stanzas and Var\u0101ha Mihira's (505\u2013587 A.D.) similar abstract of an older work; and our author draws the probably correct conclusion that both are giving the substance of that older book, the Ratnas\u0101stra, which seems also to be referred to in the K\u0101mas\u016btra, p. 32. This Ratnaparik\u1e63\u0101 has been incorporated bodily into the Garu\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47a, only the initial verse having been so altered as to conceal the fact of its author being a Buddhist.\n\nThe next in importance is the Agastimata, of 344 verses, no doubt composed in the Dekkan, not only because of the choice of the name, but also because it uses weights unknown to Buddhabhata but used in the south and in Ceylon. The date and author are entirely unknown.\n\nThese are the two texts translated. The other, shorter and evidently later and supplementary, texts are given only in the Sanskrit.\n\nThe precious stones are described in these treatises with special reference to\u2014(1) the myths as to their origin\u2014utpatti; (2) the places where they are found\u2014\u0101kara; (3) their colour or nuance of shade\u2014var\u1e47a, ch\u0101ya; (4) the class to which they belong, true or counterfeit, variety, etc.\u2014j\u0101to; (5) their value or the reverse as ornaments or bringers of luck\u2014do\u1e63a, gu\u1e47a, phala; (6) their value, weight, and volume\u2014m\u016blya. The introduction sums up the results arrived at under these heads with regard to all the principal precious stones.\n\nThis study merits attention for the light it throws on Hindu beliefs of the Middle Ages, for its usefulness as an aid to Sanskrit lexicography, and for the comparison which it renders possible with similar works of the European lapidaries of the Middle Ages, who shared many of the beliefs, erroneous and otherwise, appearing in these treatises. The work has been distinctly well done, and reflects credit, not only on the industry, but on the judgment and the training of the author, who has had to deal with MSS. in a very confused state.\nDESCRIPTION D'UN ATLAS SINO-COR\u00c9EN, MANUSCRIT DU BRITISH MUSEUM. PAR HENRI CORDIER, VICE-PRESIDENT DE LA COMMISSION CENTRALE DE LA SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 DE GEOGRAPHIE, PROFESSEUR \u00c0 L'\u00c9COLE DES LANGUES ORIENTALES VIVANTES. (PARIS, 1896.)\n\nM. Cordier's description of the Corean Atlas in the British Museum is one of the publications of the Recueil de voyages et de documents edited by MM. Schefer and Cordier. The Atlas itself is a rare and curious book, and M. Cordier has prepared his description of it in his usual thorough and careful manner. The book is also well printed on good paper, and the photographs are excellently reproduced. Of the fourteen maps of the British Museum MS., only six, however, were allowed to be photographed.\n\nThe complete Atlas is composed of fourteen maps, viz. \u2014(1) a map of Japan with the Liu-Chiu Islands on the same sheet, (2) Corea, (3 to 10) maps of the eight Provinces of Corea, (11) S\u00f6ul, the capital of Corea, (12) the environs of the capital, (13) the world as known to the maker of the Atlas, and (14) a map of China.\n\nOf these maps the Ss\u00fc-hai-tsung-t'u, or General Map of the Four Seas, that is, of the world, is very curious and interesting, though not very instructive or correct. It places many known countries in new positions relative to others, and it introduces a number of unknown or imaginary countries. The maps of the Provinces of Corea, of which, unfortunately, only two are in M. Cordier's book, are the most useful and interesting parts of the Atlas. These maps give the names of the towns, rivers, hills, the boundaries of the Provinces, and also valuable itineraries.\n\nThe transliteration which M. Cordier uses for Corean names of places seems a peculiar one, and some of the places will not be easily recognized in the forms he has given. Thus he writes \"Tjyen-ra-to\" for the Province which is called Challa do, or in Satow's transcription \"Ch\u00f6h-la do.\" So also we have \"Hpyeng-an-to\" for the\nPhy\u00f6ng-an do, and \"Kyeng-keui-to\" for Ky\u00f6ng-kwi do or King-ki-to.\n\nThere are a few slight mistakes, chiefly in copying or printing, which it may be worth while to correct. In the first line of p. 5 \"Kao-lo-li\" is for Kao-kou-li. In the same page the first syllable of the name of the Tuman river should be \u963f, not \u963f. In the last line of this page the words \"Myo-ho,\" or temple designation, should apparently come after the words \"Kong-yang Ouang.\" The personal name of this king was Yao, and he is known in history as \"Kong-yang\" Wang.\n\nM. Cordier tells us quite correctly that the Imperial Chinese envoys to the King of Corea were received officially at I-chow (Wei-ju). But the king's reception of the envoys took place at a spot on the North Road, not far north-west from S\u00f6ul. The spot is indicated by a \"triumphal arch\" bearing the inscription Ying-en-men, the Bounty-meeting Gate.\n\nT. W.\n\nA. Merx. Documents de Pal\u00e9ographie H\u00e9bra\u00efque et Arabe, publi\u00e9s avec sept planches, photo-lithographiques. 4to, pp. 57 and 7 plates. (Leyde: E. T. Brill.)\n\nHebrew pal\u00e6ography is undergoing a great change: old-dated Hebrew MSS. have up to a very recent time been exceedingly scarce. Finds in the \"Genizoth\" (i.e. the hidden place in the synagogue where fragments of Hebrew MSS. were stowed away, until the time when they were to be buried), especially those of Egypt, have brought to light many very old documents, with dates. A number of these have found their way into the Library of Oxford, and into private libraries. Mr. E. N. Adler has recently brought with him from Egypt a goodly number of such documents, and there are some in my possession. All these help us to reconstruct many a missing link in the tradition of Hebrew writing. Not a few of these documents\nprove that the character of writing hitherto assumed to have been of French origin, of the eleventh or twelfth century, was in reality Oriental and much older.\n\nThe present work of Prof. Merx is now the first attempt to utilize some of these newly recovered documents for the study of ancient Hebrew pal\u00e6ography. He publishes three documents (contracts of partnership, sale, and marriage) from 1115, 1124, and 1164, which he had obtained from a Jew of Yemen, who had probably got them in Egypt. Professor Merx publishes them in Hebrew square characters, with a French translation, and adds a few notes as well as an introduction, in which he dwells mostly on certain forms of the marriage-contract. The originals are reproduced by phototype, and a few epitaphs and documents from Worms and Spiers are added, also a fragment of an ancient Arabic text.\n\nEvery contribution of this kind, however small, must be gratefully received. But I cannot join in Professor Merx's enthusiasm over these not very perfect specimens. One can account for it by the fact that Professor Merx does not know of the vast number of more ancient and more perfect documents which the old \"Genizoth\" have furnished. If all those with dates would be published in facsimile and transcribed, they would form one of the most important contributions to Hebrew pal\u00e6ography. Texts of the tenth century (and not of the twelfth as those of Professor Merx) undreamt of only fifty years ago are now a reality, and who knows what surprises the soil of Egypt has still in store for us.\n\nThe book is magnificently printed and beautifully got up.\n\nM. G.\n\nBuddhism, Its History and Literature. By T. W. Rhys Davids, LL.D., Ph.D. (London, 1896.)\n\nThis book contains the first series of American Lectures on the History of Religions. The opening announcement\ndescribes the circumstances under which the course delivered by Prof. Rhys Davids was conceived and carried out. It is the aim of the promoters of the new enterprise to secure \"popular courses in the History of Religions\" by the best scholars of Europe and America for delivery in various cities. For this purpose it was natural to begin with Buddhism in a country where Sir Edwin Arnold's \"Light of Asia\" has been accepted \"almost as a fifth Gospel\"; and no better exponent could possibly be found than the author of the volume before us. It was perhaps a disadvantage that this distinguished scholar had already presented the same theme in a similar course of lectures some time ago on the foundation of the Hibbert Trust; but the ways of error in this difficult path of study are many, the same truths need reinforcement and fresh illustration, and much additional material has become available in the last fifteen years. Prof. Rhys Davids' style has lost none of its ease and charm, and if his opposition to the soul-theory be a little more vehement and pervasive, this does not prevent him from appreciating contrasted systems, at least on Eastern, if not always on Western soil.\n\nThe lectures, though often delivered within university precincts, were designed for general audiences. It is much to be regretted that the published volume adheres so closely to the original plan; the student would often have welcomed additional information, or fuller discussion of difficult points, such as the late Prof. W. Robertson Smith was wont to include in his notes. Criticism, therefore, takes the form chiefly of a wish that this or that topic for which space could not be found in the text, might have been expounded in an excursus. Thus, in the opening lecture the relation of Buddhism to two current forms of belief is sketched\u2014the monism afterwards formulated in the Vedanta, and the origins of the Sankhya philosophy (where Prof. Rhys Davids avails himself of the researches of Prof. Garbe). But there were other modes of speculation in the immense\nintellectual activity of the Ganges Valley, amid which Buddhism arose, some of which involved the total rejection of the doctrine of Karma (common to Buddhism and Brahmanism), and with it the whole possibility of the ethical culture which was the essence of Gotama's teaching. How did Buddhism defend itself against these? Each lecture, in turn, suggests similar questions. The second discourse deals with the Pitakas; the third describes the life of Gotama; two more are devoted to the Path and the goal of Arahatship, in which Prof. Rhys Davids finds the secret of Buddhism; and the sixth lecture offers \"some notes on the history of Buddhism.\" Among these the fourth and fifth, as they are the most important, so they are the most firmly knit. They contain a singularly clear and forcible display of the \"truths\" as expounded by the Teacher. But Buddhism, as it existed in the apprehension of the disciple, was necessarily different from its aspect to the mind of the Master. The believer received it through the Order; it was invested with all the authority of revelation, it was the gift to a sinful and perishing world from the supremely Holy and Enlightened One. The missionary power of Buddhism was largely due to the possession of this ideal. How much of the Buddha-theory was already in existence when Gotama began to preach? The materials for a decided view on this subject are not yet completely at our command; but so much has been published (due chiefly to the unwearied toil of our author himself) since the Hibbert Lecture of 1881, that a reference to his former volume is, on this topic, no longer adequate. There is a good deal of uncertainty on some questions about which Prof. Rhys Davids entertains very positive views, connected more or less directly with this central theme. For instance, there are passages in which, as Oldenberg has shown, the question of the existence after death, whether of the Buddha or of the perfected saint, is left practically open. If it may not be affirmed, it may also not be denied. So much of the terminology\nof the Buddhahood is borrowed from modes of thought in which it had a transcendental meaning, that it cannot be surprising if some shreds of such significance still lingered round it. It is at any rate in that direction that we must look for the explanation of what Prof. Rhys Davids can only regard as the corruptions of the truth, viz. the assimilation of Buddhism with theism. But at this point we approach a philosophy of the subject unsuited for discussion here. It must suffice to call attention to some of the fresh passages which are now translated from the texts for English readers, and to express the hope that the lecturer may be enabled to complete the work to which he has devoted a score of laborious years.\n\nThe book is well printed: \"conception,\" p. 124, l. 11, should of course be \"exception.\" It is not evident what is the connection of the Akkadians of Mesopotamia with Zoroastrianism (p. 7), nor can we profess the author's faith that religion is a product of the feminine mind, and that all the gods were once \"godesses\" (sic). And is anything gained by spelling Konfucius with a K? Kong-fu-tse might be endurable; but if we accept the Latinized ending of the old Jesuit missionaries, why alter the first letter?\n\nJ. E. C.\n\nS. Schechter and Rev. S. Singer. Talmudical Fragments in the Bodleian Library. Edited with Introduction (and a facsimile). 4to, pp. vi + 28. (Cambridge: University Press, 1895.)\n\nAmong the fragments which have come from Egypt, came also a portion of a Talmudic treatise (Kerithoth), dated 1123, of the Babylonian redaction, and another small fragment consisting of two leaves of the Tr. Berachoth (Palestinian recension), but without date. These two have now been published by S. Schechter and the Rev. S. Singer. But not even an attempt has been made by them to collate these fragments with the printed editions, and especially with the first editions.\nThe variations are of far greater importance than the editors, who have taken their task very lightly, seem to think. The philological side of these fragments has been completely neglected, and the whole edition falls short of the requirements of a modern critical edition. The way how to do it has been shown by W. H. Lowe, who published in 1879 \"The Fragment of Talmud Babli P'sachim, of the ninth or tenth century,\" with an exhaustive introduction, copious notes, and critical remarks, and a careful collation of his text with other editions. We miss in the new publication every reference to pal\u00e6ography, to the system of abbreviations, and to the mode how notes and marginal glosses are indicated in the text. It is but a bare reprint of the text, without any assistance from the joint (!) editors.\n\nThe first fragment was written by a certain Joseph the scribe from Mount Nefusah, for a certain R. Nissim, son of Sa'adyah. The editors identify this Nefusah with the Nefusa mountains in Tripolis. The character of the writing points more to Arabia and Egypt. From these countries an absolutely identical fragment of the Halakoth Pesuqoth has been recently obtained.\n\nThe divisions of the text are marked by the word Pisqa, which the editors omit to mention, although it is of very great importance, having been retained only in Midrashic works.\n\nAnother extremely important peculiarity, common to both fragments, is that some of the words are endowed with vowel points, and here and there biblical accents are placed upon the words. The editors explain their presence in these texts by saying: \"They were probably intended to assist the student in the task of recital, it being customary to employ a certain intonation in the study of the oral as of the written Law.\" Not a shred of evidence is vouchsawed to us to show upon what basis this assumption rests. The use of such accents in non-biblical books opens a far-reaching question, which had created bad blood as far back as the tenth century, when Sa'adyah Gaon was\nassailed for using them in his own writings. They probably served in the first place as interpunction, and had not yet anything to do with the Cantilene of the recital. Other similar fragments are in existence, in which a few biblical accents can be detected on words of a non-biblical text.\n\nM. G.\n\nLe Livre de l'Imp\u00f4t Foncier de Yahya ibn Adam, publi\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s le Ms. unique appartenant \u00e0 M. Charles Schefer, par Th. W. Juynboll. Pp. ix and 117. (Leide : E. T. Brill, 1896.)\n\nThe main importance of the publication mentioned above consists in the circumstance that it gives one of the oldest original texts on Moslim law, and contains much new information on the questions of territorial property and ground taxes. The different ways in which Muhammed increased the area of Islamism, either by conquests or by treaties, and the different methods in which the new estates were placed at the disposal of the Moslims, formed precedents for later arrangements. Some of these territories, as e.g. those of the B. an-Nadhir, had not been taken sword in hand, and the Prophet, therefore, claimed the right to hand them over to the fugitives from Medina, whilst the land of Kheibar was distributed among the warriors. These and similar incidents set the example for the conquests made in Asia and Africa after Muhammed's death. Some scholars, as Tornauw (ZDMG., xxxvi, p. 299), hold that these territories, whilst being in earlier times allotted to the Moslim community, gradually were allowed to remain in the hands of the subdued inhabitants, or even distributed among others. This view is contended by Kremer and Van Berchem in their publications on the subject, and they receive material support by the evidence furnished in Yahya b. Adam's book. And it gives also valuable information on the administration of the Moslim dominion both during Muhammed's lifetime and two centuries after his death.\nThe book itself is a compilation from traditions collected and communicated by Ibn \u0100dam to a pupil. The publication lying before us is according to the copy of Al-Bu\u1e63r\u012b received from the text of As-Sukk\u0101r\u012b 416 H. The edition is very carefully prepared after the unique MS. of Prof. Schefer in Paris, to whom and Prof. de Goeje in Leyden it is dedicated. Good indexes are annexed.\n\nH. H.\n\nE. A. WALLIS BUDGE. THE LIFE AND EXPLOITS OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT. Vol. I, Ethiopic Text; II, Translation. (London, 1896.)\n\nTo the indefatigable energy and scholarship of Dr. W. Budge we owe two of the most important contributions to the history of Alexander the Great. In 1889 he published the Syriac text of the well-known version of Pseudo-Callisthenes, and now, in 1896, in two volumes, the Ethiopic versions. In the first we get the Ethiopic texts, and an Introduction, in which the editor gives a description of the MSS. and a succinct history of the legend and of its various forms and recensions. Then follow the Oriental texts, to the number of seven, and three Appendices. All of these are taken from comparatively modern MSS.\u2014the first, Pseudo-Callisthenes, from a MS. of this century, the others from MSS. of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They are\u2014(1) Pseudo-Callisthenes; (2) The History of Alexander, by Al-M\u0101kin; (3) id., by Ab\u016b-Sh\u0101ker; (4) by Joseph ben Gorion, i.e. the Arabic version of the work which goes in the Hebrew original under the name of Josippon, or Pseudo-Josephus; (5) an anonymous history of the Death of Alexander; (6) A Christian Romance of Alexander; and (7) The History of the Blessed Men who lived in the days of Jeremiah the Prophet. As appendices follow\u2014(1) The Prophecy of Daniel concerning Alexander\u2019s Kingdom; (2) 1 Maccabees i, 1\u20136; and (3) Extract of the Chronicle of John Mudabbar.\n\nAll these texts are translated in the second volume. The\nwhole concludes with an excellent Index of proper names and subjects.\n\nThe legend of Alexander being the literary property of most of the civilized nations, every contribution to its history is at the same time a contribution to the elucidation of important literary problems. I will therefore dwell a little longer on this edition.\n\nWe have thus, first, what stands for that version which is known in the Greek as Pseudo-Callisthenes. To the Ethiopians it seems to have come from an Arabic version. It is curious, however, that hitherto no Arabic text of this legend has come to light. The Ethiopic version is, according to Dr. Budge, not a literal translation, but a remodelling and recasting in a Christian form of a Muhammadan text. The scribe, we are told, adds and omits according to his own fancy. I am not inclined to credit scribes or copyists with too much latitude or originality. It is remarkable, now, that the latest form which the legend has assumed in Greek, and which to a certain extent is the basis of the Slavonic versions, differs considerably from the text published by M\u00fcller, and approaches much more the Ethiopic version of Pseudo-Callisthenes. Many an incident, especially those of a religious character, finds its counterpart in this latest Byzantine form of the legend. Here we find also the Brahmans as \"the children of Seth,\" son of Adam. Further, \"God who dwelleth above the Cherubim and Seraphim,\" and ever so many minute details. It would therefore be advisable to compare these two texts. In this way the age of the direct source for the Ethiopian could be fixed with some precision, and the relation better determined in which it stands to the older Greek versions, from which it would be almost independent.\n\nOf no little importance is it to find an Ethiopic translation of the Alexander legend of Gorion's compilation. The Hebrew text in Gorion is an abridged interpolation into the chronicle made from an independent version of the legend, which does not figure in the ed. Pr. (by Conte, ante 1480), and may have been added, either to the more recent\nprints or to one of the MSS. utilized for these editions. The independent and more extended Hebrew version has been published by J. Levi, and an abstract of the text contained in a London MS. has been published by me in Russian, with comparative notes. The result of my investigation has been to establish the dependence of the Hebrew legend upon an Arabic, now lost, which goes back to an old Syriac (Pehlevi) version.\n\nA third text, viz., the \"Romance of Alexander,\" from which every trace of history has been successfully obliterated, commands our greatest attention. N\u00f6ldeke, in his study on the Oriental versions, has dwelt at some length on the Syriac \"Romance.\" We have here an Ethiopian counterpart, and I have discovered a Hebrew version of this \"Romance,\" of which I am preparing an English translation. In each of these \"Romances\" Alexander is treated with the same liberty with which French epical writers of the Middle Ages treated the \"Life of Alexander.\" Much is still obscure in the continual growth and change of the legend, and the \"Romance\" has thus far escaped everyone's attention. The research into the history of this special development of the ancient legend has now been much facilitated by the publication of these numerous texts, and above all through the Ethiopian version of the \"Romance.\"\n\nI cannot conclude without alluding to the sumptuous edition of this version, and to the munificence of Lady Meux, through which alone this important publication has seen the light.\n\nM. G.\n\nHenry Barnstein, Ph.D. The Targum of Onkelos to Genesis. A critical inquiry into the value of the text exhibited by Yemen MSS. compared with that of the European recension, together with some specimen chapters of the Oriental text.\n\nSince the time when Merx published his \"Chrestomathia Targumica,\" and drew the attention of scholars to the\nvocalized texts of the Targum which came from Yemen, the study of the Targum, which had lain fallow for such a long time, was again taken up with an ever-increasing interest. Although we can hardly complain of the lack of MSS. in European libraries for establishing the bare text, yet the vocalization of the Targum still remained in apparently inextricable confusion, and it appeared a hopeless task to attempt a grammar of the Targumic dialects. However, latterly, a little progress has been made in this direction. The writer of this notice has used these new sources hailing from Yemen, and has endeavoured to lay the foundation of a trustworthy Aramaic grammar; the elaboration of an Aramaic dictionary is also being taken up, and, it is hoped, will shortly be placed in the hands of those who are interested in the subject, thanks to the kind assistance given to me by Dr. Barnstein. What was still wanted was a critical comparison of the existing Targum texts with those MSS. which have since come to light, and Dr. Barnstein has attempted to carry out this comparison in the carefully-prepared essay mentioned above. After a brief survey of the origin and history of the Targum of Onkelos to the Pentateuch, we have here principally an inquiry into the differences exhibited by the Yemen MSS. compared with those texts which have hitherto been known in Europe. The peculiar system of vocalization in use in the Yemen MSS. is described with minute details, whilst the orthographical, grammatical, and exegetical variations are fully described and explained. At the end of the work the author publishes the text of Genesis xvii, xxvi, xxxi, and xli, according to the excellent MS. Codex Hebr. Gaster, No. 2, with the variant readings from Codd. Montefiore 502 and 508, the Brit. Mus. Ms. Or. 2363, and the Venice edition of 1517. The aim of the author\u2014to show how a better and more correct text of the Targum of Onkelos can be obtained by the aid of Yemen MSS.\u2014has undoubtedly been completely fulfilled, and those readers who may differ from him in some points will agree in this. The book also contains many note-\nworthy contributions to the Targumic grammar; especially instructive is the comparison between the different readings shown by the Yemen MSS. themselves. These show how far the Yemenite pronunciation and tradition were consistent and old-established, and how far differences occur. I cannot, however, subscribe to the author's important proposition that we are already now in a position to restore the original Palestinian text by means of these MSS. We shall have good cause to be thankful if we can restore the Targum of Onkelos of the Babylonian School with a certain degree of reliability, but we have not the means to reconstruct the original Palestinian Targum from these MSS. alone. We also require more proofs for the author's statement that the superlinear system of vocalization is likewise of Palestinian origin. We have not only to notice the similarities between the punctuation of the Yemen MSS. and Biblical Aramaic, but we have also to observe the differences in the two dialects. Careful and continued investigation of the sources at our disposal may probably tend to modify Dr. Barnstein's assumption, and show that he has placed a too far-reaching importance upon these MSS. These details, however, in no wise detract from the value of his researches. The Yemen MSS. remain invaluable for the study of the Targum, even if we should not assume the Palestinian origin of their text. The want of a critical edition of the Targum of Onkelos to the Pentateuch has become very pressing, especially as we so frequently have to deplore the lack of care in the texts published by Merx, and absolute reliability is indispensable in publications of this kind. I conclude with the wish that Dr. Barnstein may soon have the opportunity of publishing such a critical edition of the Targum of Onkelos.\n\nLeipzig.\n\nProf. G. Dalman.\nVI.

Deane.\n\nAs the Swat valley, and neighbourhood, which constitute the principal portion of the old province of Udy\u0101na, have hitherto been inaccessible for archaeological research, the following rough notes (made during the little time at my disposal as Chief Political Officer with the Chitral Relief Force, and lately as Political Officer for Dir and Swat) may induce others better qualified to devote some attention to this interesting neighbourhood. They are principally connected with the travels of the Chinese pilgrim Huan Tsiang, as given in Beal's \"Buddhist Records of the Western World.\"\n\nThe Pilgrim says (Beal, ii, 120) that there were 1400 old Sangh\u0101r\u0101mas on the banks of the river Su-po-fa-sutu, the present Swat river. This was probably no exaggeration, as ruins are now found all through the country. Unfortunately, however, the majority lie in Upper Swat, which is at present closed to Europeans.\n\nThe old capital of the province in the Pilgrim's time was Mungali, or Mung Kie-li. General Sir A. Cunningham, in his \"Ancient Geography of India, Buddhist Period,\"\np. 82, thought that this place could be identified with Minglaur, a large and important village lying at the foot of one of the north-western spurs of the Dosirri mountain. Dosirri and its neighbouring peak, Ilm, belong to the D\u016bma range, which here divides Swat from Boner. General Sir A. Cunningham also thought Mingaur, or Mingora of Wilford's Surveyor, to be the same place.\n\nThe identity of Minglaur with Mungali is undoubted, though the main site of the old town lay (from the reports of men I have at times despatched to Minglaur) about a mile to the east-south-east of the present village. Mingaur is a separate place, lying some five miles to the west of Minglaur. The ruins about Minglaur are described as very extensive. On cliffs not far from them deeply-cut Sanskrit inscriptions exist. Three of these, impressions of which I obtained last year, have been translated by Professor B\u00fchler, and are now being published in the *Epigraphia Indica*.\n\nThe Pilgrim states that to the north-east of Mungali, about 250 or 260 li, a great mountain range is entered, and the fountain of N\u0101ga Apal\u0101la is reached, this being the source of the Su-po-fa-sutu river. The distance and direction given by the Pilgrim bring us exactly to Kal\u0101m, the point at which the Utrot and Laspur (Ushu in our maps) streams meet. The junction of these is the present head of the Swat river.\n\nSouth, about 200 li from Mungali, the Pilgrim mentions the Mah\u0101vana Sangh\u0101r\u0101ma. This was apparently on the western, or north-western, slopes of the present Mahaban. Numerous ruins exist on the lower slopes and also on the higher portions of Mahaban. A portion of an inscription which I obtained from this hill recorded the deposit of a relic at some place on the hill, on which there must therefore have been a st\u016bpa or sangh\u0101r\u0101ma of noted sanctity.\n\nGoing west 60 or 70 li, he next describes a st\u016bpa built by A\u015boka R\u0101ja. The measurements and distance given bring us within the present borders of the Peshawar district. On\nthis side, hitherto, though many ruins and remains are found, no st\u016bpa has yet been discovered. There are ruins named Ch\u0101nai on low hills above the present village of Surkh\u0101vi, and in the Narinji valley adjoining these low hills on the south, much sculpture which denoted the previous existence of a sangh\u0101r\u0101ma; and some which may have belonged to a st\u016bpa, has at various times been found by the natives, and destroyed by them.\n\nFrom either Ch\u0101nai or the Narinji valley the Pilgrim's next measurement, 200 li north-west, leads to the Adinzai valley, entered from Swat at Chakdara. This may be identified with the Shan-ni-lo-shi valley of the Records.\n\nAbout three and a half miles north of Chakdara is a site which was plainly at one time occupied by a st\u016bpa. It has not yet, however, been excavated. Not far off, to the north of this, are the remains of a large st\u016bpa. The greatest feature of interest in this st\u016bpa is, that it is still known to some of the people by the name of S\u016bma, the name mentioned by Huan Tsiang (Beal, ii, 125). It is difficult to fix the site of the convent, but possibly it was on the spur overlooking the passage of the Swat river on which military posts are now being erected. D\u00e9bris and portions of well-built walls exist on this site to a great depth; and though there were defensive towers on the higher points, the few relics found point to former occupation of the spot for other than military purposes. These relics comprise a portion of a head of a very large figure of Buddha, a portion of a finely-carved cover of a small oblong box (in soapstone), and old ornamented \"chiraghs.\"\n\nAdjoining this site is a detached rock close to the river, on which there are remains of old walls. The broken top of a \"chaitya\" was also found here. Amid the d\u00e9bris on this rock were also found two oval stones, weighing about 5 lbs. each, which appear to have been artificially shaped, and which are suggestive of Alexander's military engines;\n\n---\n\n1 Appendix D is a plan of the foundations as far as they can be traced.\nalso the iron head of an axe\u2014the latter found at a depth of fifteen feet.\n\nAs regards the S\u016bma st\u016bpa, I will refer to the attached plan, Appendix A, which shows measurements. The height of the remains is 35 feet. The centre of the st\u016bpa has not yet been excavated, and I have been loth to open it, as if anything of value were found it would lead to wholesale destruction by the natives of other st\u016bpa remains, many of which exist in the country. The outside of this st\u016bpa was built with carefully-dressed granite, well laid and fitted; on the outside it was covered with lime-plaster, much of which still remains. The interior was carefully laid in horizontal strata. Nothing remains of the chaitya except a small portion of the interior. Possibly portions of it might be found under the large mass of rubbish lying around. To the west are the remains of a platform 90' by 190', to which apparently the steps of the st\u016bpa led down; and on it are mounds which have not been examined, but which are possibly sites of small square vih\u0101ras, or of monks' dwelling-places. The platform is slightly raised from the ground to the level of the foundation of the st\u016bpa. Such portion of it as has been preserved owes its existence to a curious custom on the part of the Pathan inhabitants of the country, whose tradition is that a notorious thug was once executed at this spot. It is incumbent on every good Muhammadan, as he passes the place, to support the execution by throwing a stone on to the mound, saying at the same time\u2014\"I swear by God he was a thug.\" The south and west faces are in the best state of preservation.\n\nThe st\u016bpa alluded to by the Pilgrim (p. 126) to the north of the valley, by the side of a steep rock, lies slightly north-east from the S\u016bma st\u016bpa, about two and a half miles distant. The mound is at present known as Badshah Dheri. It has not yet been excavated. Between this and S\u016bma another site, somewhat to the east, also exists, which appears to have been similarly occupied.\n\nThe abundant stream alluded to by the Pilgrim is, I think, to be found in a spring on the south slope of\nthe Laram to the north of Uch. There is a story current in the valley regarding this spring. After a fight with an invading Muhammadan force, the old inhabitants of the valley, being defeated, concealed the spring with a large cup-shaped stone, and covered it over with earth, completely closing it. Some years ago signs of water being found, the source of the spring was traced; its covering was found and removed, and the water now flows freely. I recovered the stone cover from a Masjid in the village of Gudia Khwar, where the Pathans had placed it. It seems to have been the cupola of a large chaitya. It has a diameter of $2' 6\\frac{1}{2}''$ and a height of $1' 14''$. There is no trace of the lake mentioned in the Records, and the stopping up of the spring for many centuries may explain its non-existence.\n\nIt is noticeable that all the fortifications in the Shan-ni-lo-shi, and in the neighbouring valley of Talash, are on the south. There is no trace of any on the Laram Hill, nor anywhere to the north, nor on the spurs of the Laram running down to the Panjkora. Near Sado, which was a post held during the Chitral Relief Expedition, there are a few ruins traceable, but these appear to be of ordinary dwellings. From the fortifications on the south, and the absence of any on the Laram range on the north, it may, perhaps, be assumed that the people of the Shan-ni-lo-shi valley were more or less connected with their neighbours to the north in the valley of the Panjkora.\n\nWhether Adinzai, or Adinazai, is connected with Udy\u0101na, I do not presume to say. Adinapur, near Jellalabad, I have seen held to be a corruption of Udy\u0101napur. Old names certainly survive in this country, and in the Adinzai valley: among the most striking are Uch and Uchana, the latter appearing to be the same as Uchanga, an old name of this country generally.\n\nThe Pilgrim now starts again from Mungali, and mentions (p. 126) a st\u016bpa 60 or 70 li to the south-east, on the east of the river; this river is, of course, the Swat. The measurement brings us to an extensive group of ruins\u2014\nBalogram, Odigram, and Panjigram, and a little lower down, Shankardar.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Odigram inscriptions exist. A little further down the river, between Ghaligai and Shankardar, the natives of the country describe the remains of a st\u016bpa as still standing; and this is undoubtedly that referred to by the Pilgrim\u2014for the Pilgrim records next (p. 127) a large rock on the bank of the great river, shaped like an elephant. This rock is a conspicuous landmark existing near the river, about twelve miles from the village of Thana, and near Ghaligai. It is well known to the inhabitants of the valley, the name of which, Hathidarra, was derived from it. The st\u016bpa is described by natives as still standing a few hundred yards distant from this rock; and, from what I can understand from the people, there is also a fine Deva temple near it.\n\nThe hill to the south of the present village of Shankardar, a spur of Ilm, is known as Velanai. Extensive ruins on this spur are connected by tradition with an old ruler, Viru, in whom we seem to have R\u0101ja Vara.\n\nNext the Pilgrim takes a measurement of 50 li or so west of Mungali, and brings us to a st\u016bpa across the river. This is close to a village now called Hazara, and natives describe the st\u016bpa as still existing. It is also said that the next one he mentions, 30 li north-east of Mungali, still exists. In this neighbourhood Sung Yun mentions the temple of Tolu to the north of the city, and says there were sixty full-length golden figures of Buddha in it. A few months ago a golden Buddha was dug up in this region. The people at first asked the fabulous sum of Rs. 4000 for it. It fell, however, into the hands of a jeweller, who found it to be as I suspected, a stone thinly plated with gold, which he has now stripped off it. The practice of plating sculpture with gold was not uncommon in the neighbouring province of Gandh\u0101ra.\n\nFrom the st\u016bpa north-east of Mungali, Huan Tsiang crosses the river, and, going west, arrives at Vih\u0101ra (p. 127). In regard to this locality I am unable to say anything at\npresent; but the point is important, as from it another line of 140 or 150 li north-west is given to the mountain Lun-po-lu, on which the Pilgrim (p. 128) describes the Dragon lake.\n\nThis measurement brings us exactly to the head of the Aushiri valley, which drains into the Panjkora near Darora. How the Pilgrim got his distance over several valleys and intervening high spurs, it is difficult to conjecture. But on the hill to which it brings us there is found a large lake, more than a mile in length. It is apparently fed by snow. Unfortunately, pressure of work in connection with the retirement of the Chitral Relief Force prevented a survey of the lake from being made.\n\nThe lake itself is now known as Saidgai, and the same name is applied to the hill; another point of the hill, not far off, being known as L\u0101lk\u014dh. There are several stories current as to the wonderful sights to be seen at this lake, the most persistent being that of \"Jins,\" who live in and near it. These Jins, with half human forms, are said to be constantly seen on the banks of the lake; and one old gentleman of the country assures me that he lately saw three sitting together, who vanished as he approached them. At other times food and rice are said to be found on the bank of the lake, placed there in some mysterious way. This story of the Jins adds strongly to the probability of the identification of this lake with that mentioned by the Pilgrim as haunted by N\u0101gas.\n\nSome of the former tribes that inhabited Udy\u0101na and neighbouring countries can be traced in the present day.\n\nKafiristan undoubtedly is populated by the descendants of those who were driven back from other tracts, mostly from the Afghanistan side: their many Hindu customs, the many Sanskritic words in their language, and their traditions, point clearly to their origin. It is to be hoped that some one with opportunities will deal with that important point, the language of the Kafirs. From the few investigations I have made, I have found many Sanskrit words in use among them.\nIn Kafiristan the custom of the women wearing horns as head ornaments, mentioned by Sung Yun as prevalent amongst the Ye-tha, still exists. One kind worn is a veritable pair of horns, made of hair and shaped like the short horns of cattle. Another kind is made of man\u0101l feathers, with a tuft at the top arranged and bound round a stick about nine inches in length.\n\nIf I remember rightly (I have not Sir G. Robertson's book on the Kafirs to refer to), Sir G. Robertson mentions a custom amongst the Kafirs of banishing a man who has committed murder to the hills; and Sung Yun describes the same custom as belonging to Udy\u0101na, whence it is reasonable to assume the custom was carried to the present Kafiristan.\n\nAnother, and distinct, remnant of the old races will undoubtedly be found in the large clan of Gujars, extending from Kunar on the west to Kashmir on the east. A very interesting point is noticeable regarding these Gujars. In the Peshawar district, and on the hills bordering on the Peshawar district, the Gujars all speak Pashtu, and in some ways are more Pathan than the Pathans themselves. In the hills across the Swat valley the Gujars understand and use at times Hindi, though they speak Pashtu. At Dir and on the high ranges beyond, the same clan of Gujars use Hindi entirely in their houses and amongst themselves. The Greek historians describe the cowherds as one of the classes inhabiting this country, and there can be little doubt the clan of Gujars represents the men they wrote about. Those about Dir and the neighbourhood were only converted to Isl\u0101m between 250 or 300 years ago, some of them even later. Conversion in Bashghar of the Kohistanis, Gurialis, and others, who are undoubtedly a remnant of the former inhabitants of Udy\u0101na, was brought about at this period, according to local history, through Mussamat Ram, daughter of one Barah, who fell in love with an Akhundzada named Salak Baba. Through her and her family, these people are said to have been brought over to Isl\u0101m.\nLastly may be mentioned the Ghori, a small clan subservient to the Pathans, on the right bank of the Panjkora river.\n\nThe extensive manner in which the Udy\u0101na is fortified on the south speaks of anything but the supposed peaceable nature of the people, or their cordial relations with their neighbours in Gandh\u0101ra, the present Peshawar district. Appendix B is a plan of the old fortifications on the Malakand Pass.\n\nBeyond the Swat, Adinzai, and Talash valleys, remains of former habitation become more indistinct. Up the valley of the Panjkora there are considerable traces of ruins as far as the Aushiri. At Barikot, near Patrak, distinct ruins are said to be found, and a st\u016bpa is said to have existed there which was overthrown by one Ilias Akhund, about two generations ago.\n\nThroughout the Panjkora valley there are remains of old terraced cultivation, entirely deserted in the present day, and declared by the Muhammadan population not to belong to the Muhammadan period. This points to a different previous condition in the valley: this condition was probably that the land along the banks of the river was during Buddhist occupation swamp, and incapable of cultivation to the same extent as now. The process of the bed of the river deepening, and swampy land being gradually reclaimed and brought under cultivation, goes on now. The people of the valley also talk of a much heavier rainfall in former days, which has doubtless been much reduced by the wholesale destruction of forests.\n\nTo the west of the Panjkora, the Jandol valley, occupied during the expedition by our troops, is too thickly populated for many traces of former occupation to remain undisturbed. An old road leads over the Binshi Pass into Asmar from the Jandol valley. The only good site noted was of a city on the hills to the west of Kanbat. Near this I obtained an inscription. I also obtained two inscriptions near Badin, between Munda and Kanbat, in the Jandol valley\u2014one from Tarawar in the Maidan Banda valley, near the\nPanjkora; and a Persian one, broken into three pieces, near Sapri Kalan, in the same valley. These have all been sent to the Lahore Museum.\n\nA former Khan of Dir almost ruined an old Deva temple at Gumbat, in the Talash valley, the stone being carried off to Dir. Portions of it, however, in excellent preservation, still remain. Ruins and inscriptions exist on the ranges from the Binshi Pass to the south-west, and near Nawagai are remains of a large city. Unfortunately these are inaccessible for examination.\n\nSuch sculptures as have been found have been obtained chiefly from the Swat valley and from Dargai, where also a Buddhist relic in a small gold casket was found. This has been made over to the Imperial Museum, Calcutta.\n\nConsiderable damage has been done in places by irresponsible digging, and especially at a place on the north slope of the Morah Pass, called Kafirkot, which must have been a place of much importance. Here there are extensive remains of a large monastery, within which stood a st\u016bpa, the base of which is still in situ. The diameter of the inner circle is 24 feet, to which may be added a projecting plinth of 10 inches. The diameter of the outer circle base is $24 + 13\\cdot10 = 37$ ft. 10 in. Some sculpture obtained from this place has been sent to the Imperial Museum. Near this place I noticed two other st\u016bpas, and in the plain below, a mound, from which Pathans not long ago obtained some gold sword-hilts and other pieces of valuable property which cannot now be traced. These st\u016bpas are all worth proper examination. The sculpture from Dargai is of the Gandh\u0101ra type, and that from the Swat valley is of the same type, but in some respects superior, and principally in that the figures are better proportioned.\n\nThe country to the south of the Malakand ridge is rich in ruins, and has not been properly worked. There is much to be done in this quarter.\n\nHitherto not many inscriptions have been found in Swat, and those found are mostly in Sanskrit. Many others undoubtedly exist which we are unable to obtain at present.\nI have lately procured one or two small ones in the same unknown character which has been found on small stones in old houses on the slopes of Mahaban. M. Emile Senart lately published several in the *Journal Asiatique*.\n\nIn this note on Udy\u0101na I have recorded only what I have been able to ascertain from cursory inquiry and research. There is a large field for anyone who can systematically prosecute research. I offer the opinion that Udy\u0101na was on the north bounded by the high range of hills above Dir and Swat, which would seem to be the Tsungling mountains mentioned by the Pilgrim (p. 119 and elsewhere). These hills now divide Swat and Dir from Gilgit and Chitral territory. On the west I do not think Udy\u0101na extended further than the line of the Panjkora; the Pilgrim\u2019s descriptions take us nowhere into Bajaur. On the south, the watershed of the hills bordering the present Peshawar district would appear from the extensive fortifications to have been the boundary. On the side of Boner the watershed would also appear to have been the boundary, as the cave temple on that border on the western watershed is described as being in Gandh\u0101ra. Further south on this line we are brought within the present limits of our British border at Surkh\u0101vi and Narinji, and thence, down to the Indus, the lower spur bordering British Yusafzai would appear to have been within Udy\u0101na limits. My opinion on this point is based on small inscriptions being found amongst ruins on these spurs which are not found in Gandh\u0101ra.\n\nThe Pilgrim, after leaving Udy\u0101na, went up the line of the Sintu or Indus river. But it is said that he went first north-west from Mungali, which would take him on to the line of the Indus via Gilgit. At Mungali he was within fairly easy range of the Indus on the east and north-east; and by going north-west, over a range of hills and through a valley, it would seem probable that he took the route via Kalam and the Laspur Pass to Drasan, from which point he would reach the Indus by the easiest line. It seems not unlikely that Sung Yun also entered Udy\u0101na by this route.\nI add here a few notes I have made from time to time regarding the adjoining province of Gandh\u0101ra, the British district of Peshawar.\n\nHuan Tsiang, in his Records (Beal, ii, 97), first describes Po-lu-sha-pa-lo, which has been identified as the present Peshawar. One of the first points he notices (p. 99) is the large pipal-tree, which is mentioned later by Baber. Peshawar having a considerable Hindu population, it is natural to look for the site of this tree amongst places still, or until lately, held by them in reverence.\n\nA mistake we are apt to be led into in such research is to disregard the fact that the site of the city itself may have been changed. On this point there is ample evidence that within quite recent times a portion of the city, which occupied the site of the present commissariat lines, near the present cantonments, was demolished, and the city perforce extended in the opposite direction. At the corner of what is now known as the Pipal Mandi, is an old pipal-tree. According to Hindu tradition, this tree is at least 500 years old. Until recent years, during which a market has grown up around it, it was the great meeting-place and resting-place for Yogis. There are other places in and near Peshawar which at the present day are regarded as more important than this\u2014notably, a tank and temple known as Panj-tirath, surrounded by large pipal-trees, to the north-east of the city\u2014but those places are all of comparatively recent date. After inquiry, which I have made during the last three years, I have come to the conclusion that the pipal-tree now standing in the Pipal Mandi is on the site of the old one mentioned in history. We may be sure that such a spot would not be lost sight of by the Hindus, though circumstances now render its former use impracticable.\n\nOf the st\u016bpas mentioned by the Pilgrim there are few traces left. The sites of five can be traced at a place about a mile south-east of the present city. The place is known as Shahji-ki-Dheri, and is below Hazar Khani, on the old road to Lahore. I obtained from this place a small figure of\na sitting Buddha, and a very interesting flint cameo\u2014a figure of a man mounted on a horse. These were obtained from a corner where cultivation is commencing to cut into the site, which has not been excavated.\n\nThe Peshawar city now covers such an extent of land, and every available piece of land near it is so highly cultivated, that it is hopeless to try and follow the Pilgrim further in his descriptions in detail.\n\nGoing north-east from Peshawar, the Pilgrim (Beal, ii, 109) takes us across a great river to Pushkalavati. This has been identified as the Penkelaotis of Arrian and the present Charsadda. It is probable that the main site lay a little lower down, where extensive mounds, wells, etc., mark the old site of a city very distinctly. This place would repay excavation.\n\nIf we follow Huan Tsiang's distances carefully from these old mounds, we come eventually to the eastern end of the mass of buried ruins known as Shahr-i-Narparsan, between the present villages of Rajar and Utmanzai. The stone from these has for years been abstracted for building purposes, and it is impossible to trace what existed. I found here portions of the top of a chaitya. Accepting the Pilgrim's measurements and directions to be correct, and assuming that the large st\u016bpas mentioned by him stood at the east end of these extensive ruins, to which point the measurements bring us exactly, we get a point from which the Pilgrim (p. 110) gives a further line to a position 50 li north-west. Here he mentions another st\u016bpa. The direction and measurement lead direct to a mound of ruins, hitherto, so far as I know, not excavated, and known as Dheri Kafran. This stands not far from the village of Sher-pao, in Hashtnagar. There can be little doubt that excavation would show this \"Infidel's mound\" to have been a st\u016bpa. Judging by the ruins, it must have been a large one.\n\nAgain, from this point north 50 li the Pilgrim (p. 111) describes another st\u016bpa. This brings us a little north-east of the present village of Gandheri, which may be connected\nwith the old name Gandh\u0101ra. The name Gandheri, however, has a meaning in Pashtu, being the \"oleander\" which grows in the ravines here. A little north of Gandheri, and not a mile from the village, the site of a st\u016bpa is traceable. A small vih\u0101ra, such as is generally found near st\u016bpas, was excavated here; the base was standing, and it has since been built up with other portions excavated near it. The sculpture is very old and good, and much of it shows traces of gilding. It has been made over to the Imperial Museum. The whole site near Gandheri is worth exploration.\n\nThese last two measurements and distances being correct, I see no reason for not locating the places mentioned near Pushkalavati by accepting the Pilgrim's measurements exactly.\n\nThe point thus fixed at Gandheri is important, for it is from here that the Pilgrim takes his direction and measurement to Po-lu-sha. This has been assumed by General Sir A. Cunningham to be Palo-dheri, a village in the Sadhum valley, mainly on account of the name. North-east of the city was Mount Dantaloka, 20 li distant. This is the Sanawar or Paja range, north-east of Palo-dheri, as identified by General Sir A. Cunningham.\n\nThe Pilgrim (p. 113) mentions a stone chamber between the crags of this mountain. This may be a small chamber or cell, which still exists, built into the rock, below the cave temple known as Kashmir Smats. This is just above the ravine in which \"the trees droop down their branches like curtains,\" and form a leafy roof over the ravine. Above this woody ravine, but not \"by the side of it,\" as described by the Pilgrim, is the rocky cave known as the Kashmir Smats. The Kashmir Smats is an immense cave piercing the hill at an angle of about 25\u00b0. It runs slightly north-west. It is of a limestone formation, and the walls and roof show fringes of stalactite, masses of which have occasionally fallen from the roof or exfoliated from the sides. The entrance to the cave is about 50 feet wide, with about an equal height. At a distance of 38 feet from the entrance, it widens to\n84 feet, with a height of about 60 feet. At this point a flight of steps 17 feet wide leads up for another 38 feet to an octagonal vault, the sides of which measure 11 feet, 4\u00bd feet, and 6 feet. Small niches exist in the walls, in which small earthen chiraghs were found. Portions of what appeared to be a sheeshum-wood coffin were some time ago found lying buried in the d\u00e9bris not far from the vault. The conclusion is, that this originally lay in the vault. The lid was highly ornamented, but was ruined by a native who carried it off to convert into a door. On the right of the chamber is a small square masonry room. In 1888, near this I obtained, buried in the guano which lies around, four carved sides of a box, two wooden plaques, and a wooden pilaster about 4 feet in length. I made these over to Dr. Burgess, Director of Archaeological Survey in India, who placed them in the British Museum. These are the only carvings in wood found hitherto in Yusafzai. They were in excellent preservation, though blackened with age.\n\nThe cave beyond this turns slightly to the west, and at a distance of 95 feet from the vault narrows to 47 feet in width. A flight of winding steps 20 feet wide, and extending for 68\u00bd feet, leads up to the centre of the second chamber. At the top of the flight of steps is a fragment of wall about 10 feet high and 24 feet long, in fair condition, which evidently belonged to some large building. The cave is here 94 feet wide, with a height of over 100 feet. At a distance of 7\u00bd feet beyond the above wall the cave narrows to 51\u00bd feet. At this point another flight of steps is reached. To the left of the foot of these steps is a water-tank, with steps at the lower end leading into it. The tank is lined with cement half an inch thick, and is in excellent preservation.\n\nThe flight of steps leading onward into the cave is well made, and in good condition. About 50 feet further a natural gallery, about 30 feet high, leads on to the left. At the entrance to this, on the right-hand side, is a small square masonry vault, in which a year or two ago treasure\nis said to have been found by some of the many Gujars, who frequently live in the cave. After 20 feet it takes a sharp turn up a flight of steps, in good order, and enters a narrower gallery, along which for a short way a man can only crawl on hands and knees. At the top of the steps, on the wall of the cave, are a few letters in P\u0101li; but these have been almost obliterated, and cannot be read.\n\nThe main cave from the entrance to the gallery winds through a long vestibule and up a winding flight of steps, protected by a balustrade, the direction being north, to the third chamber. The steps lead up to a square masonry tower, a part of which, to a height of about 10 feet, is in good repair. The measurement of the walls is 7 feet 6 inches, while the thickness of them is over 2 feet. The roof of the cave rounds away upwards to a height of about 100 feet, or may be more, and on the north-west side is a rift from 6 to 10 feet in diameter, which lets in light and air. The guano lying in this chamber is about 7 or 8 feet deep. The whole cave would probably repay careful excavation, but it would be a troublesome undertaking.\n\nAppendix E is a rough plan of the interior, but the bearings are only approximate.\n\nLooking down from the entrance to the cave, is a very fine view of what appears to have been a monastery, and of the gorge leading up to it.\n\nThere is another cave in the cliff not far from the Kashmir Smats, and perhaps more likely to be the place that an old Rishi would be credited with having as his abode. It is inaccessible to any but the best of cragmen.\n\nSung Yun\u2019s account of apparently the same cave, and its position, gives us no corroboration of the identification, except in the details that the rock-cave was south-east of the crest of the hill, and that it had two chambers, the second cave leading off from the main one possibly being the second chamber.\n\nSung Yun calls the hill Shen-shi, and places it 500 li to the south-west of the royal city of Udy\u0101na, a direction\nand distance that would take us (accepting Mungali as the royal city) into the Khattak hills on the line of the Indus, some distance below Hodi Raja. Sung Yun mentions a great square stone in front of the cave, on which a memorial tower was erected. There is no sign of any such tower. Sung Yun mentions traces of a lion's hair and claws on a stone three li to the west of the cave. About half a mile west of the cave is curious ornamentation on the rock by the side of the road. He also writes of wild asses frequenting the neighbourhood, but it seems more likely he meant monkeys, which still frequent it.\n\nIn regard to the memorial tower, it seems possible that the tower in the inner chamber of the main cave, and not far from the entrance of the smaller offshoot, may be that alluded to; but this is mere conjecture. A tower would hardly be built at this point for other than memorial purposes.\n\nIt is noticeable that Sung Yun places the rock-cave in Udy\u0101na, while Huan Tsiang describes it as being in Gandh\u0101ra.\n\nTaking the stone chamber first mentioned as the point from which to measure, and taking the Pilgrim's measurement and direction, we cross a small range and come to the range bounding Swat on the south. It brings us to the foot of the Shahkot Pass. After working this out on the map, I visited the Shahkot Pass, and a little to the west of the foot of it found the conspicuous remains of a memorial st\u016bpa. These have not yet been examined.\n\nThe Sangh\u0101r\u0101ma has not yet been found, though proper examination will probably reveal it. The whole site is much overgrown with jungle. This st\u016bpa is close to a curious old road running straight up a spur leading to a point above the Shahkot Pass, where there are remains of old forts. The road is continued down into the Swat valley. The Pathans have a tradition that the road was made especially for bringing elephants up, and they call it the Hathi-lar, but they apply this name to most of the old roads. On the opposite spur on the east is an old road\nwith a far better alignment. It appears to be older than the Hathi-lar, and leads straight over the pass and down a well-aligned road on the north side, the making of which through solid rock for considerable stretches must have entailed enormous labour. How this road, and that over the Malakand, were cut through rock too hard to break with picks, is difficult to conjecture: it may have been effected by lighting fires on the rock and pouring water in the heated rock, as I am informed is still done in some parts in Southern India. At one spot only, and that on the Shahkot Pass, have I noticed any old sign of fire. In this case, about four feet up the hill-side, the rock through which the road had been cut was calcined, and partially converted into lime.\n\nOn the top of the Shahkot Pass is a large stone having foot impressions, shown as Buddha's footmarks. They are two impressions rather of shoes at right angles to each other, with nail-marks in the heel, under the instep, and in the middle of the foot. One impression is eleven inches long and the other about ten inches. They bear no resemblance, so far as I know, to any marks which are really known as Buddha's footmarks. The origin of these marks is not known; they are said to be old, and I heard of them a long time before we came to the country.\n\nTo return to the Pilgrim's record, after search extending over a long time no trace of the figure of Bhima Devi (Beal, ii, 113) has been found. I cannot trace any rock-cut figure on the Sanawar range, though possibly such exists. Rock-cut figures exist on Ilm, and there is one on a rock to the south of the Morah; but in the former case the distance is too great when compared with the Pilgrim's measurement, and in the latter case the direction does not coincide, nor does the description of the figure.\n\nFrom the temple of Bhima, Huan Tsiang (p. 114) mentions distance and direction to U-to-kia-han-cha. This was considered by the late General Sir A. Cunningham as the present Hund. The difficulty is, that we are not certain of the site of Po-lu-sha, and cannot therefore ascertain\nwhere the Bhima temple was. The question where U-to-kia-han-cha was is accordingly open to a certain amount of doubt. The only st\u016bpa so far found near the southeast foot of the Sanawar range, which General Sir A. Cunningham fixes as Mount Danto-loka, is the small one found at Sikri and excavated six years ago, which is now in the Lahore Museum.\n\nThe description given of Mount Danto-loka, and the measurement and distance given to the st\u016bpa existing at the foot of the Shahkot Pass, go to support General Sir A. Cunningham's identification of Mount Danto-loka, and consequently that of Palo-dheri with Po-lu-sha, though there can as yet be no certainty as to the exact site of the latter. The above notes, however, tend to prove the general accuracy of the Pilgrim's distances, and one is loth, in the face of general accuracy, to assume that in one particular measurement or direction he has been incorrect.\n\nThe correct position of U-to-kia-han-cha depends much on the correct identification of Po-lu-sha. U-to-kia-han-cha was also known as Udakhanda; and if the possible remnant of an old name in a present one be taken as a guide, it might be argued that Khunda, the name (bearing no meaning in Pashtu) of a village about six miles north-west from Hund, is connected with the subject.\n\nThe line of the Indus through the Peshawar district has never been thoroughly examined. Beginning at Asgram, there are extensive ruins a little way above where the Indus leaves the hills; there are more on a low hill on the bank of the Indus near Gullai, known as Imran; many more buried near Jalbai; and, again, others near Jehangira and Alladher. None of these have ever been systematically explored.\n\nThe following brief note has reference to Aornos, which was situated either in Udy\u0101na or Gandhara.\n\nOn Mahaban, at the point known as Shahkot, are the very distinct remains of a large fort, the foundations of which, 360 yards by 180 yards, with twelve bastions on the north and south faces, five bastions on the east face\n(outside which was a ditch some 30 feet wide), and four bastions on the west face, can still be traced. The road to the fort winds up the southern face of the hill, and below it on the south is a plateau about a mile long by 600 yards wide. On the north face is a second gate, with a steep path leading to springs a little way below. Below the south-west corner is a large tank protected by three towers. Inside are remains of two temples and a tank about 60 paces in circumference. The fort is situated on a vast rock, and is reported as exceedingly difficult of access.\n\nClose to Panjtar, at the foot of Mahaban, is a group of several old towns, from which I have obtained many inscriptions. Further down, towards where the Indus debouches into the plain, are extensive ruins, to which my attention was first directed by obtaining an inscription from them. These ruins are known as Asgram, already mentioned. The Pathans give this as the name of the ruins, stating that tradition holds them to be of the same period as B\u0113gram and Naugram (Ranigat). Taking Ptolemy's map and McCrindle as a guide, we find a hitherto unidentified place, Asigramma, close to the bank of the river, bearing the same relative position to Aornos and Pentigramma, as shown on the map, as Asgram bears to Mahaban and Panjtar. Aornos was above Asigramma; and if the identification of Asgram with Asigramma be accepted, the claims of both Hodi Raja and Ranigat are disposed of, and there does not remain much, if any, doubt as to Aornos having been on Mahaban as described above. Another very strong position on Mahaban is a spur running to the Indus known as Mount Banj. A fort also exists here; and is very difficult of access. Built into the foot of the wall, near the entrance to this fort, was a short inscription, which I obtained and sent to the Lahore Museum. It has not yet been published.\n\nThe line taken by Alexander's troops from the Kabul to the Indus has as yet by no means been satisfactorily followed out. But anything further connected with that must be the subject of a separate note. I have mentioned\nthe above point as regards Aornos as being of particular interest.\n\nFor further research in Udy\u0101na, an accurate map of the country is required. When one is published, it will be easy to mark on it all the ruins which can be traced. This will show what a field for research still exists, even in the portion only of the country to which we have free access.\n\nCareful inquiry amongst the Gujars will elicit much information as to old names still known to them, but not now in general use. If this be first done, and then photographs and plans made, a useful record will be obtained, and excavation, if properly conducted, will produce much of great interest.\nPlate I.\n\nOr. 4851, fol. 38b\nART.

Description of the MS.\n\nThe MS. from which the text of the Nile Service is taken is numbered Or. 4951, and is a recent acquisition of the British Museum. It consists of 69 paper leaves, measuring about 6\u00bd ins. by 5 ins., with mostly 15 lines to a page. The quires, 7 in number, are of 10 leaves each (the last leaf being blank). The Syriac letters by which the quires are numbered are written in the middle of the lower margin, both on the last and the first page of each quire. Thus, on fol. 10b, the letter \u039b denotes the end of the first quire, and the same letter also stands on fol. 11a; the letters \u03a9, \u03a8, etc., are similarly written on foll. 20b and 21a,\nfoll. 30b and 31a, etc. The only exception is the absence of the letter o on fol. 61a. The style of writing,\u00b9 though smaller, approaches very nearly to that of pl. xx (representing fol. 34a of Add. 14,664) in vol. iii of Wright's \"Catalogue of the Syriac MSS. in the British Museum,\" which has been assigned to the twelfth or thirteenth century. The letter \"r\u00eesh\" is, with very few exceptions, written \u0161\u00b2 (with two dots instead of one), and the \"daleth\" is, as a rule, not distinguished by a dot below. There are no diacritic points below the letters, and points over the text (see the first facsimile, representing fol. 38b of the MS. chosen to exemplify some of the characteristics mentioned here) are mainly employed in the following cases: (1) one dot over the letter L to mark the aspirate;\u00b3 (2) a dot often placed over the on of both the 3rd person suffix masc. and fem. sing.; (3) the occasional distinction of the plural form by the two dots known as \"s\u0115y\u0101m\u0113\" (e.g. \u0623\u062a\u0649 in the fourth line of the first facsimile); (4) two dots over the inverted p\u0113 (\u0642), and sometimes also over the letter \u01a1.\n\n\u00b9 The earlier stages of Palestinian Syriac writing are exemplified in plates xviii and xix published in Wright's Catalogue; see also the facsimiles given in Land's \"Anecdota Syriaca,\" vol. iv, and in \"Anecdota Oroniensia,\" Semitic series, vol. i, parts v and ix.\n\n\u00b2 It is well known that there was a double pronunciation of the \"r\u00eesh\" in Palestine (see J. Derenbourg, \"Mannual du Lecteur,\" Journal Asiatique, 1870, p. 446), but one can hardly refer the occasional use of \u0161 in this MS. to a difference of pronunciation.\n\n\u00b3 Differences from the Edessene Syriac are shown in such words as \u05d9\u05d0\u05e9 (Jew.

With regard to the style of writing, it ought to be remarked that Dr. Charles Rien, now the Adams' Professor of Arabic at Cambridge, considers it to be not later than the thirteenth century. His judgment, therefore, strengthens the opinion formed with regard to the MS. as a whole.\nGreek transcribed into the Palestinian Syriac character is more common in the second series of Ordination Services than in the rest of the MS. As a photographic illustration fol. 61a is chosen, containing in ll. 5\u201313 the central formula for the ordination of priests. The barbarous nature of the Syriac transcription will be manifest by a comparison with the Greek which it represents. The use of the Greek vowel-letters \u03bf and \u03c9 is very conspicuous in other parts of the MS., and there are also slanting strokes and other signs both over and under the lines, the exact force of which will no doubt be elucidated by means of further study. Besides \u03bf and \u03c9, the vowel-letter \u03b1 is found in other places. Occasionally the Syriac letters \u0399 (see line 2 of the second facsimile) and \u03c9 are written over the line to indicate the pronunciation; and there are some other marks, both over and under the line, which an editor of those parts of the MS. will have to consider. In the present publication only the peculiarities occurring in the \"Liturgy of the Nile\" have been treated on as fully as possible.\n\nOn the last page of the MS. the invocation is written twice in yellowish ink in a very similar\u2014if not the same\u2014hand as the rest of the MS., the Arabic translation (of the same date) being in both cases written underneath the Syriac.\n\nThen follow two Arabic sentences in the same hand as the invocation:\n\n\u0633\u0650\u0644 \u0628\u0639\u0652\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0627 \u0645\u062a\u0649 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u062f | \u0648\u0627\u062c\u0628 \u0648\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u062a\u0643\u0648\u0646 (1)\n\n\u062e\u0637\u0627\u064a\u0627\u0643 \u0645\u0646\u0643 \u0628\u0639\u064a\u062f.\n\ni.e. \"One of the fathers was asked, when the feast shall be?\nHe answered and said, when thy sins will be far from thee.\" (Note the rhyme: \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u062f .. \u0628\u0639\u064a\u062f.)\n\n1 The few Greek words which occur in the Nile Service will be found re-transcribed into the Greek character in the notes on the translation.\n2 \u1f29 \u0398\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f21 \u03c4\u1f70 \u1f00\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\u1fc6 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70 \u1f10\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03b7\u03c0\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1 \u03ba.\u03c4.\u03bb.\nComp. the formula now used in the Greek Church as given in the Euchologion.\n2. Analysis of the Service.\n\nThe Service begins with a procession to the ford over the Nile, which is assigned to the Malkite community. One of the priests carries a cross, and the other objects taken are a copy of the New Testament, incense, and wax candles. They group themselves close to a basin into which water out of the Nile had been poured. After the singing of a \"troparion,\" or short hymn, one of the priests addresses the Patriarch of Alexandria, the Metropolitan, and all the priests and deacons present, declaring the object of the Service with the words\u2014\"We have come to prepare a good season and an acceptable year; risen is the well-spring of God, the Nile, and by the command of God has it mounted upwards.\" In connection with this address, which is repeated twice, the following verses from the Psalms are recited as antiphons: xxix, 3; lxv, 10a; lxv, 11; lxv, 12\u201314. Then comes another \"troparion,\" after which three lessons are read from the Old Testament, viz.: Gen. ii, 4\u201319 (containing an account of the rivers of Paradise, with one of which, namely Gihon, the Nile is identified); 2 Kings ii, 19\u201322 (in which the healing of the water by Elisha is related); Amos ix, 5\u201314a (where the Nile is expressly mentioned). Ps. xxvii, 1 is then said, followed by the reading of Acts xvi, 16\u201334 (ending with the baptism of the Philippian jailer). After this lesson vv. 10a and 11 of Ps. lxv\n\n1 Note that all references to Old Testament passages relate to the printed text of the Hebrew Bible.\nare once more recited, and subsequent to this St. Matt. xiv, 22\u201334 (containing the account of Jesus walking on the waters of the Lake of Gennesareth) is read. The chief priest then pronounces a blessing over the water that is in the basin, using the words of St. Luke ii, 14 (\"Praise be to God in the heights,\" etc.), Ps. li, 17, and lxxi, 8. The two longest prayers of the Service come next. In the first of these the water which had been put into the basin is spoken of as \"an offering\" to God \"of the firstlings of its rising,\" and as \"a type and a figure\" of the waters of the Nile.\n\nThe latter part of the Service contains the more specially characteristic ceremony connected with it. After the renewed recital of the verses from the Psalms which were sung before, the cross is dipped three times into the water of the basin, the priest saying the words\u2014\"In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever. Amen.\" All the people present then drink of the holy water, and after the repetition of a few versicles and responses by the archdeacon, the officiating priest, and the deacon, the Service is concluded with a special form of the doxology.\n\n(a) Times of the Service.\n\nThe dates between which the present Service was held do not quite agree with the period of the gradual rise of the Nile in Lower Egypt. The \"Lailat an-Nuktah,\" or the night during which a miraculous\\(^1\\) drop was believed to fall into the Nile and thus cause its increase, is that of the 17th of June, and the greatest height is reached on the 26th or 27th of September. The actual period of the gradual rise is between the summer solstice and the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) On this popular belief, as on the various dates connected with the rise of the Nile, see Lane's \"Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians,\" ii, pp. 224\u2013236; Maspero's \"Dawn of Civilization,\" pp. 20\u201324; also Sir Gardiner Wilkinson's \"Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians,\" ii, p. 428.\nautumnal equinox; but, according to the heading of the Service in the MS., the season of its celebration fell between the Sunday of the 318 Nicene fathers and the feast of St. Mark as anciently celebrated at Alexandria, that is (taking the dates of this year, 1896) between May 17 and Sept. 23. It may be argued that the very early beginning of the celebration is due to the fact that in the upper parts of the Nile the rising naturally begins much earlier. Khartum\\(^1\\) is actually reached by the swelling tide of the Blue Nile in the middle of May, and at the cataracts\\(^2\\) the rise is perceived about the end of May or the beginning of June. It is very doubtful, however, whether these facts would be taken account of by the Malkite community of Alexandria, and it certainly appears more likely that the dates of the present Service were suggested by those of the Christian festivals which occurred on those days. Their object was evidently to dissociate their worship and thanksgiving as much as possible from the customs that prevailed around them. They probably had some special reason for selecting the Sunday of the 318 Nicene fathers as the starting-point. The feast of Pentecost, which falls on the Sunday following, would be particularly suitable for the celebration connected with the blessings which are secured by the increase of the Nile; and for the conclusion of the cycle the day following the feast of St. Mark, which was held on Sept. 23, would be selected as occurring very near the actual greatest height of the Nile waters.\n\n(b) The Malkite Origin of the Service.\n\nNot much need be said to prove the Malkite\\(^3\\) origin of the Service. The structure of it is distinctly that of the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Maspero, op. cit., p. 22.\n\\(^2\\) See Sir Gardiner Wilkinson, loc. cit.\n\\(^3\\) The term Malkite answers to the Syriac word Malk\u0101y\u0101, i.e. royal. The Eastern adherents of the decrees issued by the Council of Chalcedon were so named \u201cpropters quod . . . menti imperatoris Marciani se submiserant.\u201d See Payne Smith, Thes. Syr., col. 2144.\nGreek liturgies from the beginning to the end. The \"troparia,\" the antiphons, and a term like \\(\\sigma\\omega\\phi\\lambda\\alpha,\\) are quite enough to stamp it as a service belonging to the Syriac-speaking branch of the Greek Church. The presence of a considerable amount of Greek in Syriac transcriptions is another mark of the same origin. The Ordination \"formulae\" are also distinctly those of the Greek Church, though containing many interesting variations from those in common use; and it should also be noted that the lesson from St. Matthew\\(^2\\) as indicated in the Nile Service is referred to the well-known Palestinian Syriac Lectionary of the Gospels, which is acknowledged to be Malkite. In fact, all the Palestinian Syriac MSS. hitherto discovered appear to be Malkite throughout, and there can, in any case, be no question at all as to the Greek\\(^3\\) character of the Service before us.\n\n(c) The Biblical portions of the Service.\n\nOf the four Biblical\\(^4\\) lessons contained in the Service, it is enough to say in this place that the three lessons from the Old Testament are unmistakably based on the LXX, and that the lesson from the Acts of the Apostles\\(^5\\) is clearly an adaptation of the Peshitta. The fact that these four lessons are given in full, whilst the one from the Gospel of St. Matthew is referred to the Lectionary, does not necessarily show that there was no recognized Lectionary in Palestinian Syriac of the Old Testament and of the rest of\n\n---\n\n1 The exhortation addressed to the people by the deacon: see p. 726, note 6.\n2 See p. 720.\n3 See also the note on \\(\\text{\\textit{I}}\\text{\\textit{I}}\\text{\\textit{I}}\\text{\\textit{I}}\\text{\\textit{I}},\\) p. 714.\n4 The Biblical portions contained in the Service will be published separately, in complete photographic facsimiles contained in eleven plates, and will be accompanied by full textual and philological notes.\n5 A proof of the dependence of the Pal. Syr. translation of St. Luke ii, 14 on the Philox. version will be found on p. 720.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nthe New Testament; for it may be that the four passages, with their exact number of verses, did not constitute Lectionary divisions on any other occasion besides the Service of the Nile.\n\n3. Analogies from other Rituals.\n\nThe Malkite or Syro-Greek Liturgy of the Nile, as it is now before us, is peculiarly free from any superstitious element that one may have been led to expect finding in it. If the pouring\\(^1\\) of some water out of the basin into the Nile formed part of the ceremony, one must, indeed, see in it a reference to the superstitious observance of the \"Night of the drop,\" when, as was believed, the increase of the Nile is caused by a drop falling into the Nile from Heaven; but the rest of the ceremonial is exactly what one should expect to find in a service of the Greek Church. The baptizing, or dipping,\\(^2\\) of the cross into the water of the basin is evidently a means of consecrating the water from which the worshippers were afterwards to drink. It is, in fact, tantamount to the preparation of holy water with which various Christian communities are fully acquainted. The Biblical character of the Liturgy is, as will have been noticed, fully maintained, and the prayers are also remarkably free from any unorthodox or superstitious element.\n\nIt is, however, natural to think that the Christian Nile Service must have some historical connection with the ritual of the ancient Egyptians, and that some analogies will be found for it both in the religious ceremonies of the Coptic\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See p. 722, note 10.\n\n\\(^2\\) For the possible connection of this ceremony with an older ritual see p. 698.\nChurch and the ritual observances of the Muhammedans. It is, then, in this spirit of historical comparison that we must proceed to offer some observations on the other known forms of the Nile Liturgy.\n\n(a) The Ritual of the Ancient Egyptians.\n\nThe extent of the Nile ritual among the ancient Egyptians, by whom, as may be expected, the god (H\u0101pi by name) was mystically identified with the fertilizing Nile course, may be gathered from the following lines, forming the thirteenth stanza of a Nile hymn which was composed in the reign of Merenptah, son of Rameses II, nineteenth dynasty:\n\n3 \"O inundation of Nile, offerings are made to thee;\nOxen are slain to thee;\nGreat festivals are kept for thee;\nFowls are sacrificed to thee;\nBeasts of the field are caught for thee;\nPure flames are offered to thee;\nOfferings are made to every god,\nAs they are made unto Nile.\nIncense ascends unto heaven,\nOxen, bulls, fowls are burnt.\nNile makes for himself chasms in the Thebaid.\nUnknown is his name in heaven;\nHe does not manifest his forms,\nVain are all representations.\"\n\n1 An exhaustive investigation on this subject could, of course, only be undertaken by a specialist in Egyptology.\n2 See \"Hymne au Nil,\" Maspero, Paris, 1868; \"Records of the Past,\" old series, vol. iv, pp. 105-114; Maspero, \"Dawn of Civilization,\" pp. 40-42. Comp. Renouf, \"Origin and Growth of Religion,\" etc., pp. 223-4. The text is preserved in two papyri in the British Museum.\n3 The lines are here quoted from F. C. Cook's translation in \"Records of the Past,\" loc. cit.; Maspero's French translation in \"Hymne au Nil\" is practically the same as far as this stanza is concerned. In \"Dawn of Civilization,\" pp. 40-42, the first twelve stanzas only are translated.\nEven if one allows a certain amount of poetic exaggeration to have had a share in the composition of this hymn, enough\u2014and more than enough\u2014remains to show the great extent, as well as the popularity, of the festivals in question; and the opinion\\(^1\\) that there must have existed a considerable number of similar hymns specially adapted to the annual Nile celebrations appears to be borne out by almost every indication one meets with in connection with this subject. More definite chronological data of actual Nile festivities are afforded to us by three official\\(^2\\) \"stelae\" engraved for the purpose of recording the personal\\(^3\\) participation of Rameses II, Merenptah, and Rameses III in the religious ceremonies which were observed in connection with the rising of the Nile. Two festivals are there expressly spoken of\u2014the first\\(^4\\) \"on the 15th of Epiphi, when the river was thought to come forth from his two chasms\"; and the second\\(^4\\) \"on the 15th of Thoth, when the inundation arrived at 'Khennut,' or Gebel Silsileh.\" The first of these dates\\(^5\\) fell, however, about a month after the summer solstice, and the second\\(^6\\) is evidently the celebration held in connection with the completion of the Nile increase.\n\nThe manner of celebrating the Nile festivals need not be dwelt upon in this place, nor will an opinion be hazarded here as to whether there is any truth in the statement that the ancient Egyptians were in the habit\\(^7\\) of throwing a virgin into the Nile as a sacrifice to the river-god in\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Brugsch, \"Religion und Mythologie der Alten Aegypter,\" ii, p. 640.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Maspero, \"Dawn of Civilization,\" p. 39 (note 2); \"Records of the Past,\" old series, vol. x, pp. 37-44 (Ludwig Stern). For further references see Maspero, loc. cit.\n\n\\(^3\\) L. Stern, in \"Records of the Past,\" loc. cit., does not appear to agree with Maspero as to the special reason for the engraving of these stelae (see p. 38).\n\n\\(^4\\) L. Stern, loc. cit., p. 38.\n\n\\(^5\\) Ibid., p. 39.\n\n\\(^6\\) Ibid., p. 40.\n\n\\(^7\\) See Maspero, \"Dawn of Civilization,\" p. 24.\norder to secure a plentiful inundation; but the importance which was attached to the Nile celebrations appears to be perfectly certain. \"According to a tradition transmitted from age to age,\" says Maspero,\\(^1\\) \"the prosperity or adversity of the year was dependent upon the splendour and fervour with which they were celebrated\"; and judging from the plentiful indications that are to be found on the subject, one is led to expect that some day Egyptologists will discover more actual texts and data than have hitherto come to light.\n\n(b) *The Graeco-Roman Period.*\n\nA glimpse into the Nile ceremonials of the Graeco-Roman period is obtained from the description given in Heliodorus' romance \"Aethiopica,\" and as it is believed that Heliodorus drew his facts on this point\\(^2\\) \"from the lost works of some Ptolemaic author,\" one may assume that one is here dealing with data which have a real historical foundation. In the ninth book of his romance (we quote from the English edition of 1622) is the following reference to a Nile festival celebrated at Syene about the time of the summer solstice\\(^3\\):\n\n\u2014\"For then it happened that Nyloa, the highest feast that the Egyptians have, fell, which is kept holy about Midsummer, at what time the flood increaseth, and it is honoured more than all other for this cause: The Egyptians faine Nylus to bee a god, and the greatest of all gods, equal to heaven, because he watereth their countrey without clouds, or raine that commeth out of the ayre: and thus doth he everywhere without faile, as well as if it should raine.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) Maspero, \"Dawn of Civilization,\" p. 39.\n\\(^2\\) Ibid. (note 3).\n\\(^3\\) \"Aethiopica,\" p. 286.\nWith regard to the manner of keeping the festival, the same author says:\u2014\"When the feast of Nylus was come, the inhabitants fell to killing of beasts, and to doe sacrifice; and for all that their bodies were busied with their present perils, yet their mindes, as much as they might, were godly disposed.\" The question as to whether the Niloa spoken of here corresponds to the Epiphi-day\\(^1\\) mentioned on the stele of Rameses II, need not be discussed now, but the historical continuance of the Nile celebrations into the Graeco-Roman period appears to be established without a doubt, and this is the only point which has a distinct bearing on the present investigation.\n\n(c) The Coptic Church.\n\nThe observance of Nile festivals among the Copts is sufficiently attested both by their almanac and by historical tradition. The legend of the \"Lailat an-Nuk\u1e6dah\"\\(^2\\) appears to be very closely connected with the 11th of the month Payni, which falls a few days before the summer solstice, and this more modern form of it seems to have been substituted for an older belief connected with the \"Martyr's Festival,\"\\(^3\\) which was observed down to the year 754, or 755, of the Hijrah. Other more or less certain historical data appear to show that in later times the principal Nile festivity among the Copts was connected with the official measuring of the Nile by means of the Nilometer. According to one account,\\(^4\\) this function was performed by a priest at about three o'clock in the afternoon, after\n\n\\(^1\\) L. Stern, op. cit., p. 39.\n\\(^2\\) See Lane, op. cit., p. 224; L. Stern, loc. cit., pp. 39, 40.\n\\(^3\\) See L. Stern, loc. cit., p. 39.\n\\(^4\\) Silvestre de Sacy, \"Relation de l'\u00c9gypte,\" par Abd-Allatif, p. 408.\nthe celebration of the Mass; and it is further stated that the Muhammedans, in taking over the function from the Copts, conformed, *mutatis mutandis*, to the religious usages which had been practised before. According to Makrizi,\\(^1\\) the privilege of measuring the Nile was taken away from the Copts in the year of Hijrah 247 (A.D. 861), by the Khalif al-Mutawakkil, who had also ordered the construction of a grand new Nilometer. It is just possible that the ceremony of baptizing the cross, as observed in the Malkite Liturgy before us, has some connection with the anointing of the Nilometer reported to have been practised by the Muhammedans, and presumably also by the Copts before them.\n\n(d) *Muhammedan Observances.*\n\nThe close relationship of the Muhammedan Nile festivities with those of the Copts, from whom they, in the main, borrowed them, is clear from what has just been said. The religious almanac of the Copts is, indeed, as Lane\\(^2\\) has pointed out, the foundations of many customs and beliefs which became prevalent among their Moslem conquerors. A link with some more or less authentic traditions of ancient Egypt is probably to be found in the idea\\(^3\\) that the irruption of the river into the bosom of the land was the presentation of an actual marriage. The reported drawing up\\(^4\\) of a contract by a cadi, and the confirming of its consummation by witnesses, is considered by Maspero to be connected with the story of the \"Bride of the Nile,\" by\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Silv. de Sacy, *op. cit.*, p. 404.\n\\(^2\\) *Op. cit.*, p. 222.\n\\(^3\\) See Maspero, \"Dawn of Civilization,\" p. 24.\n\\(^4\\) See the reference for this report in Maspero, *loc. cit.*\nwhich the above-mentioned legend of the sacrifice\\(^1\\) of a virgin appears to have been understood. The modern popular and semi-religious observances of the Muhammedans are so fully described in Lane's well-known work on the \"Modern Egyptians,\"\\(^2\\) that very little need be said about them in this place. It need only be pointed out that the Crier of the Nile (Mun\u0101dee-an-Neel) performs his ritual in the streets of Cairo from about the 3rd of July to the 26th or 27th of September, according to our reckoning, and that the \"cries\" consist of versicles uttered by the \"Mun\u0101dee,\" and responses made by a boy who accompanies him.\n\n\\(^1\\) Compare the term \"aroosah\" (or bride) as applied at the present day to the \"round pillar of earth, diminishing towards the top,\" which is raised at a distance of about sixty feet from the dam. See Lane, op. cit., p. 229.\n\n\\(^2\\) pp. 225\u2013236.\nII.

Translation.\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever, do we write the Order of the feast of the blessed Nile [which is observed] on the Sunday\\(^1\\) of the three hundred and eighteen fathers, [and also] from the Sunday\\(^1\\) of Pentecost [and onwards], and after the conclusion of the feast\\(^1\\) of St. Mark the Evangelist. And the priests go to the ford of the congregation, one priest carrying the venerated cross, and taking with them the holy Gospel, and incense, and wax candles; [and approaching] a basin, into which water had been put, they shall say this troparion\\(^2\\) in the sixth\\(^3\\) tone to the tune of \"Bear that which time does bring\"\u2014\n\nThe Lord has gone up to heaven, in order that He may send the comforting\\(^4\\) Spirit to the world. Heaven has been prepared for Him as a throne, and the clouds are His chariot. The angels were astonished when they saw the Son of Man rise above them. The Father beholds Him crowned\\(^5\\) who had never been separated from His bosom. The Holy Spirit commands all His angels: Lift up your gates, O ye chiefs. All the nations clapped their hands, because Christ has gone up\\(^6\\) to where He was before.\n\n---\n\n1 Of the three dates mentioned, the \"Sunday of the 318 Nicene fathers\" is the one which precedes the Sunday of Pentecost (Whitsunday), the latter coinciding this year (1896) with the Latin date of the festival (May 12 Gr. cal. = May 24 Lat. cal.), as Easter Day fell on the identical date (March 24 = April 5). The feast of St. Mark spoken of here is not April 25, which is the day now assigned to the evangelist in the Byzantine calendar, but Sept. 23, the day dedicated to St. Mark at Alexandria in ancient times (see Smith's Dictionary of Christian Biography, vol. ii, p. 1089). For further remarks on the dates of the Service see the Introduction.\n\n2 On the troparion see Neale's \"History of the Holy Eastern Church,\" General Introduction, pp. 832, 918.

But a well was rising up from the earth, and was watering the whole face of the earth.\n\nv. 7. And the Lord God formed the man Adam of the dust of the earth, and He blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man Adam became a living soul.\n\nv. 8. And the Lord God planted a paradise in Eden in front on the east side, and He placed there the man Adam whom He had formed.\n\nv. 9. And the Lord God caused again to grow every tree that is pleasing for sight and good for eating; and the tree of life in the middle of paradise, and the tree of understanding the knowledge of good and evil.\n\nv. 10. And a river was issuing from Eden that it may water the paradise, and from thence it divided [itself], and became into four heads.\n\nv. 11. The name of one is Pison: this is it which encircles the whole land of \u00d5l\u00f4t, where there is gold.\n\nv. 12.

And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: this is it which goes in the direction of the Syrians. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.\n\nv. 15. And the Lord God took the man Adam whom He had formed, and He placed him into the paradise of Eden that he should dress it and keep it.\n\nv. 16. And the Lord God commanded Adam and said unto him. Of all the trees that are in the paradise eating mayest thou eat.\n\nv. 17. But of the tree of understanding the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for on the day on which thou eatest thereof dying shalt thou die.\nv. 18.

In those same days, as the apostles were going to the house of prayer, there met them a certain young woman who had a spirit of divination, and she was bringing her masters much gain by the divination which she was divining.\n\nv. 17. And she was following Paul and us, and she was thus crying and saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, and they announce to you the way of life.\n\nv. 18. And thus was she doing many days; and Paul became angry, and said to that spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ that thou go out of her; and in that same hour did the spirit depart.\n\nv. 19. And when her masters saw that the hope of their gain had gone out from her, they seized Paul and Silas, and they dragged them and brought them to the market-place.\n\nv. 20.

And when they had scourged them much, they cast them into prison, and commanded the prison-keeper that he should keep them carefully.\n\nv. 24. He, therefore, having received such a command, brought [them in, and] bound them in the inner prison-house,\\(^1\\) and made their feet fast in the stocks.\n\nv. 25.

The lesson comprises St. Matt. xiv, 22-34, containing the account of Jesus walking on the Sea of Galilee, and thus being as appropriate to the occasion as the three lessons from the Old Testament and the one from the Acts of the Apostles. One may, perhaps, conclude that the Gospel Lectionary was the only one which was widely in use. It may, however, be held that the reason for the other lessons being given in full is to be sought in the fact (?) that the exact number of verses were not used at any other Service.\n\n\\(^5\\) See p. 711.\n\n\\(^6\\) \\(\\text{\\textbackslash}\\) = Lat. piscina, Gr. \\(\\text{\\textbackslash}\\).\n\n\\(^7\\) St. Luke, ii, 14.

The explanation of this remarkable reading must be sought in the rendering of \\(\\text{\\textbackslash}\\) by \\(\\text{\\textbackslash}\\) in the Philoxenian version (ed. White). The Palest. Lectionary then omitted \\(\\text{\\textbackslash}\\), and in the present text \\(\\text{\\textbackslash}\\) was further altered into \\(\\text{\\textbackslash}\\).

XVI. \u2014 Al-Abrik, Tephrike, the Capital of the Paulicians: a correction corrected. By Guy Le Strange.\n\nIt is, I hope, never too late to acknowledge a mistake and correct a blunder. Since the appearance of my note on the Castle of Abrik (see J.R.A.S. for October, 1895, p. 739), Professor De Goeje has called my attention to a passage in the \"Tanbih\" of Mas'udi, which negatives the identification of Abrik with the modern Arabkir, and proves incontrovertibly that Tephrike, of which there can be little doubt that Divrigi (or Divrik) is the present representative, must be the place which various Arab geographers describe under the name aforesaid of Abrik or Abr\u00fck.\n\nIn the \"Decline and Fall,\" chapter liv, Gibbon gives an interesting account of the Paulicians (so called after one Paul, their founder), a curious sect of Eastern Christians, whose Manichaean beliefs caused them to be ruthlessly persecuted by the orthodox emperors of Constantinople. In the latter part of the ninth century A.D., Carbeas, whose father had been impaled as a heretic by the Catholic inquisitors, led the revolt of the Paulicians. He founded and fortified the city of Tephrike, and, aided by the armies of the Caliph, utterly routed the Emperor Michael under the walls of Samosata. His successor, Chrysocheir, over-ran and plundered the whole of Asia Minor, but was finally defeated and slain by the troops sent against him by the Emperor Basil. \"With Chrysocheir, the glory of the Paulicians faded and withered; on the second expedition of the Emperor, the impregnable Tephrike was deserted by the heretics, who sued for mercy and escaped to the borders.\" This is the account given by Gibbon on the authority of the Byzantine Chroniclers, and, as will be seen,\nit agrees perfectly with the following passages from nearly contemporary Arab authorities\u2014Mas\u02bf\u016bdi, who wrote in 943 A.D., and \u1e32ud\u0101ma, circa 880 A.D.\n\nI should begin by stating that the name of the Paulicians occurs in the Arabic under the form of Baylak\u0101ni, which is the nearest available rendering of the Greek word \u03a0\u03b1\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 (the Arabs having no P), and that the plural of Baylak\u0101ni is Bay\u0101la\u1e33a, a form which less clearly recalls the Greek original.\n\nThe heresy of Paul of Samosata is mentioned by Shahrist\u0101n\u012b in his \"History of Sects and Philosophical Schools\" (see vol. i, pp. 262 and 266 of the translation by T. Haarbr\u00fccker); but there appears to be some confusion here between the reputed founder of the Paulicians and his namesake, the Patriarch of Antioch, a celebrated Monarchian heresiarch, who troubled the Church in more ways than one during the third century of the Christian era. This confusion, however, is unimportant to the matter now under discussion, which deals solely with the events of the ninth century after Christ, when, as a matter of historical geography, it becomes important to establish the identity between the Arab \"Abrik\" and the Greek \"Tephrik\u0113\": and this identification is proved by the following.\n\nMas\u02bf\u016bdi, in his \"Tanbih\" (p. 151), while enumerating the various Christian sects, mentions that of the Baylak\u0101ni, which \"is the sect instituted by Paulus of Shimsh\u0101\u1e6d [read Sumays\u0101\u1e6d, or Samosata], who originally had been Patriarch of Antioch.\" Mas\u02bf\u016bdi, later on in the same work (p. 183), when speaking of the various fortresses which, after having once been in Moslem hands, had now come to be reconquered by the Greeks, makes mention of Mala\u1e6diyya, Shimsh\u0101\u1e6d, Hisn-Man\u1e63\u016br, \"and the Castle of Abrik, which was the capital of the Baylak\u0101ni, where lived many of their Patriarchs [or Patricians], such as Karbiy\u0101s [Carbeas], the Client of the family of T\u0101hir-ibn-al-\u1e24usayn, also Kharsakh\u0101ris [Chrysocheir], and besides these two some others.\"\nThe same author, in his \"Golden Meadows\" (viii, 74), further relates that a certain Greek, who had by conversion become a good Moslem, gave him (Mas\u02bf\u016bdi) a full account of Constantinople, adding that there was in that city a church where were kept ten statues representing persons celebrated among the Christians for their valour and wisdom: \"of these is Karbiy\u0101s the Baylak\u0101ni, Lord of the City of Abrik, which at the present day belongs to the Greeks, and he was Patrician [or Patriarch] of these Baylak\u0101ni, his death having taken place in the year 249 [A.D. 863]. There is also here the statue of Kharsakh\u0101ris, who was the sister [the MSS. here are corrupt; we should perhaps read \"successor\"] of Karbiy\u0101s. . . . Now mention has been made elsewhere of the sect of the Baylak\u0101ni and of their beliefs, and they are a sect part Christian, part Magian, but at this present time [A.H. 332, A.D. 943] they have migrated, and now live among the nation of the Greeks.\"\n\nAnother contemporary author who mentions the Paulicians is Kud\u0101ma, who, naming the Greek provinces (\"Book on the Revenues,\" p. 254) which lie over against the territory of Malat\u0131yya (Melitene), mentions the districts of Kharshana and Khaldaya, that is the Charsianian and the Chaldian Themes. It may be noted in passing that there seems to be much confusion as to the identification of the site of Kharshana. Ibn Khurdadbih, in his \"Road Book\" (p. 108), writes: \"The Kharsiyy\u00fcn District is near the Darb [pass or high-road] of Malat\u0131yya. In this district lies the fortress of Kharshana, together with four others\"; and conformably with this, in my paper on Ibn Serapion (p. 747), I have, on the authority of Mr. Hogarth, identified Kharshana with the present village of Alaja Khan lying on the upper waters of the Kuru Tchay, the older Jarjar\u0131ya. It appears, however, from Professor Ramsay's \"Historical Geography\" (p. 249 and elsewhere) that Charsianon Castron, the original of the Arab Kharshana, is to be sought, not at the village of Alaja Khan, but at Alaja, an important road-centre to the west\nof the upper Halys, and this Alaja was the ancient Karissa or Garsi. From Alaja Khan to Alaja there is a distance, as the crow flies, of over 150 miles, and they must not therefore be confounded.\n\nTo return, however, to the Paulicians, Kud\u0101ma (already quoted) states in his \"Book on the Revenues\" (p. 254) that between Malatiyya, Kharshana, Khaldaya, and the Armenian country is \"the land which was settled by a people called the Baylak\u0101ni, who are of the Greeks, except for certain differences that exist between the two in matters of faith. These people used to give aid to the Moslems during their raids [into the Greek country], and their aid was greatly valued by the Moslems. All at once, however, they migrated away from this land, in consequence of the evil conduct of the governors of the [Moslem] frontier who had dealings with them, and of the little honour that they received at the hands of those appointed to look after their affairs [by the Caliph]. Hence the Paulicians have come to be dispersed abroad throughout the [Greek] lands, while in their place, now, the Armenians have settled.\"\n\nIn his French translation of this passage (\"Bibl. Geog. Arab.\", vi, p. 176), Professor De Goeje tentatively proposed the reading \"Naylak\u0101ni\" or \"Naykal\u0101ni,\" that is Nichol\u00e6ans, for Baylak\u0101ni, Paulicians, the MSS. being here corrupt, and the letters n and b in Arabic only differing by the position of a diacritical point. I have Professor De Goeje's authority, however, for stating that Baylak\u0101ni is without doubt the true reading.\n\nFrom the above it follows that Abrik, capital of the Paulicians, as described by Arab geographers, is undoubtedly the place which the Byzantine authors call Tephrik\u0113; and as this last is represented by the modern Divrigi, or Divrik, on the Tchalta Irmak, the Arab Castle of Abr\u012bk and the river of the same name must be respectively Divrik and the Tchalta river, and not the fortress of Arabkir, which stands on the Saritchitchev Su, many miles to the south.\n\nIt of course follows that the tributary of the Abrik\ncalled the river Zamra (or Zimara, as our MS. of Ibn Serapion also spells the name) cannot be either the Miram Tchay or the Kistek Tchay, which joins the Saritchitchek Su (see J.R.A.S. 1895, pp. 65 and 744). Zamra must have been the name of one of the tributaries of the Tchalta Irmak (Abrik river), which joined that stream below Divrigi, for Ibn Serapion writes that \"it falls into the river Abrik a little below the Castle of Abrik\" (loc. cit., p. 63). This identification is certainly favoured by the fact that at the present day a village called Zimarra still exists near here. Mr. Vincent W. Yorke, who has recently returned from a journey through this country of the upper waters of the Euphrates, informs me that the present Zimarra Su is a tributary of the Euphrates, and joins the great river a short way above the mouth of the Tchalta Irmak. The Zimarra Su does not, therefore, fit the case of the Zamra river, as described by Ibn Serapion; which last must have been one of the streams marked (but not named) in Kiepert's Map, which are left-bank tributaries of the Tchalta Irmak, flowing in from the country near Zimarra village.\n\nComing to the river Lukiya, which in note 4 to p. 57 of my paper on Ibn Serapion was wrongly identified with the Tchalta Irmak (the Tohalta being undoubtedly the Abrik river), this Lukiya most probably is one of the two important streams which join the right bank of the Euphrates a little above the junction of the Tchalta. These streams are not named in Kiepert's Map, but Mr. Yorke writes that they are both of considerable volume, being called respectively the Armidan Tchay and the Kara Budak. One of them must be the Lukiya aforesaid, and on it lay the \"single fortress\" mentioned on p. 54 of my paper.\n\nThe next right-bank tributary of the Euphrates, the Nahr Anja, I now believe to be identical with the river called the Saritchitchek Su, wrongly identified (loc. cit., p. 58)\n\n---\n\n1 Also Zimara is the name of a station mentioned in the Peutinger Tablee, the Antonine Itinerary, etc.\n2 Still called Angu Tchay near its mouth, according to Mr. Yorke.\nwith the Abr\u012bk river. In the former list of identifications, the river Anj\u0101 could only come in as either the short stream on which stands the village of Tchermuk (loc. cit., p. 58) or its neighbour, the Soyut Tchay (idem, p. 744). Neither of these, however, correspond with the description given by Ibn Serapion of the course of the Anj\u0101, which \u201crises in the mountain of Abr\u012bk, a little way above the crossing the high-road from Malatiyya\u201d (loc. cit., p. 54). The \u201chigh-road\u201d here mentioned must mean the Great Road going from Melitene westwards into the Greek Country (the ancient High-road to Constantinople); and the important stream of the Anj\u0101\u2014described as flowing down \u201cbetween mountains,\u201d exactly corresponds with the course of the river now known as the Saritchitchek Su, which rises far to the westward, and on whose banks stands the modern capital of the district, Arabkir. It may be noted in passing that Arabkir is apparently mentioned by none of the mediaeval Arab geographers. It is called Nareen in the old Turkish fiscal Archives, as is recorded by Taylor (see J. R. Geogr. Society, xxxviii, page 311).\n\nThe only point against the identification of the Anj\u0101 with the Saritchitchek Su, is the statement made in Ibn Serapion that the Anj\u0101 joined the Euphrates \u201cat a distance five leagues below the mouth of the river Arsan\u0101s\u201d (p. 54). But the Arabic MS. is here defective; \u201cArsan\u0101s\u201d is written \u201cAsn\u0101s,\u201d and I now believe this may be a clerical error for \u201cAbr\u012bk,\u201d a word with which it might easily be confounded in the Arabic writing. In the loose way in which Ibn Serapion counts distances, the Anj\u0101 (Saritchitchek Su) might well be described as flowing into the Euphrates \u201cfive leagues below the Nahr Abr\u012bk,\u201d that is to say, a little way above the junction of the Mur\u0101d Tchay or Arsan\u0101s river. If \u201cAbr\u012bk\u201d for \u201cArsan\u0101s\u201d be deemed too bold an emendation, the facts of the case will be equally suited by changing the adverb \u201cbelow\u201d into \u201cabove\u201d (and read fauck in the Arabic text of Ibn Serapion, p. 11, line 5 from below, in place of asfal), but the distance of \u201cfive leagues above the mouth of the Nahr Arsan\u0101s\u201d for the incoming of the Anj\u0101\nriver is only approximately correct for describing the mouth of the Saritchitchek Su.\n\nIn a tabular form the identifications now proposed for the right-bank (western) tributaries of the Upper Euphrates are as follows, beginning above and working down stream:\n\n| (I) Lukiya (river) | is either the Kara Budak or the Armidan Tchay, | not the Tchalta Irmak (p. 57, note 2). |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| (II) Abrik (river and town) | is the Tchalta Irmak and the town of Divrik (Tephrik\u0113), | not the Saritchitchek Su (p. 58, note 3), and not Arabkir (p. 740). |\n| (IIa) Zamra (river) | is an affluent of the Tchalta Irmak, | not the Miram Tchay (p. 65, note 2), nor the Kiztek Tchay (p. 744). |\n| (III) Anja (river) | is the Saritchitchek Su, | not the stream of the Tchermuk village (p. 58, note 3), nor the Soyut Tchay (p. 744). |\n\nAs showing that Tephrik\u0113 also among the Byzantines bore a name very like Abrik, it is to be noticed that the Greek MSS. of two of their Chronicles give, as a variant for Tephrik\u0113, the name Aphrik\u0113 (\u03a4\u03b5\u03c6\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, variant \u1f08\u03c6\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u1fc6). My attention was first called to this passage by Mr. Yorke, who has also pointed out to me that the name of the Zarn\u00fck river, a tributary of the Kub\u0101kib, which flows into the Euphrates near Malat\u012byya (Melitene), is mentioned in the Byzantine Chronicles under the forms \u0396\u03b1\u03c1\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c7 and \u1f08\u03c4\u03b6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c7, which, seeing that n and b are unlikely to be substituted for one another in the Greek letters, disposes of the alternative form, given in the MS. of Ibn Serapion, of \u201cZarb\u016bk\u201d (loc. cit., p. 743).\n\nWhat, however, may be gleaned on this and kindred subjects from the Byzantine Chronicles has recently been ably discussed in the pages of the Classical Review (for April, 1896), in a most interesting article entitled \u201cThe\nCampaign of Basil I against the Paulicians in 872 A.D.,\" by Mr. J. G. C. Anderson, of the University of Aberdeen, to whom (and Professor Ramsay) I am indebted for much valuable information. In the course of his discussion of the various Byzantine accounts of the campaign of Basil I against the Paulicians, Mr. Anderson shows that the river Kar\u0101kis, described by Ibn Serapion, is also almost certainly mentioned by the Byzantines. Readers of this Journal who take an interest in the mediaeval geography of Asia Minor, and the question of the frontier fortresses lying between the Greeks and the Saracens, may be referred to this paper, where a solution is offered of the thorny question as to the true sites of Ziba\u1e6dra and \u1e24adath.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Ziba\u1e6dra of the Moslems is identical with the fortress called either Zapetra or Sozopetra by the Byzantine Chroniclers, for the story of its capture by the Emperor Theophilus, and its recapture by the Caliph Mu'tasim during his celebrated expedition against Amorium, is narrated alike by both the Greek and the Arab annalists (compare Gibbon, \"Decline and Fall,\" vi, 413, with Weil, \"Geschichte der Chalifen,\" ii, 309). The question remains as to the situation of Ziba\u1e6dra, which neither the Greeks nor the Arabs very accurately describe. What the latter have recorded will be found in my notes to Ibn Serapion (p. 66), while the Greek authorities have now been examined by Mr. Anderson, and the results will be found in his paper above referred to.\n\nIt may be mentioned, however, as supporting the view that Ziba\u1e6dra must be sought at the present Vir\u0101n-Shahr on the Sultan Su (and this was my first identification, which Mr. Anderson confirms by what is stated in the Byzantine Chronicles) and not at Derendeh (as is one of the suggestions offered by Mr. Hogarth: see Ibn Serapion, p. 745), that Derendeh is itself mentioned, under the form Tarandah, by the contemporary Arab authorities. Bal\u0101dhuri (p. 185, and he is copied by Ibn-al-Ath\u012br and Y\u0101k\u016bt) states that Tarandah, which lay three marches distance from Malat\u012byya, deep in the Greek\ncountry, was garrisoned by the Moslems after A.H. 83 (702), but was subsequently abandoned by orders of the Caliph Omar II in A.H. 100 (719). Zibatra, therefore, cannot have been identical with Tarandah, which is another place. Mr. Anderson, also, gives us references to the Byzantine Chronicles proving that Taranta was a Paulician stronghold, and there is no reason to doubt the identification of Byzantine \"Taranta,\" Arab \"Taranda,\" and the modern Derendeh, which lies high up on the Tokhma S\u016b.\n\nFurther, in confirmation of the view adopted by Mr. Anderson and Professor Ramsay that the site of \u1e24adath must be sought at or near the modern Inekli, on the Ak-Su, may be mentioned the statement found in the Geographical Dictionary of Bakri (p. 657). In the article on 'Arbas\u016bs (Arabissos, Al-Bustan) the author describes this as a city of the Greeks lying \"over against\" or \"opposite\" \u1e24adath, thus leading us to infer that \u1e24adath (a place doubtless well known to him) was on the nearer and Moslem side of Arabissos, and to the south of that city.\n\nIn conclusion, I venture to point out that the historical geography of Asia Minor is likely to gain a yet firmer basis, if the accounts of the Byzantine annalists be systematically compared with, and a corrective applied from, the works of the contemporary Arab geographers.\nART. XVII.\u2014Notes on Akbar's S\u00fabahs, with reference to the \u00c1in-i Akbari. By John Beames, B.C.S. (ret.).\n\nNo. II.\n\nORISSA.\n\nThe ancient kingdom of Orissa (Odra-de\u015ba, whence O\u1e5be\u015b\u0101), strictly speaking, extended from the K\u00e1nsb\u00e1ns river in the north to the Ras\u00e1kuli\u00e1 river near Ganj\u00e1m in the south; and from the Bay of Bengal on the east far into the tangled mass of low hills in the west, in which latter direction its limits seem never to have been clearly defined. But the kings of Orissa were not satisfied with these boundaries. It is a common boast both in literature and on monuments that their kingdom stretched from the great to the little Ganges; that is to say, from the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed (called by Europeans the Hugli or \"Hooghly\") to the God\u00e1var\u00ed. At various times different kings made good this boast by victorious campaigns, followed by temporary occupation of territory both to the north and south.\n\nThe latest of these towards the north, starting from the Subarnarekh\u00e1, which had at that time been for a long while the northern boundary, was led by the last independent monarch, Mukund Dev, called the Telinga, who, about A.D. 1550, really touched the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed, and built at the sacred t\u012brtha of Tribeni, near S\u00e1tg\u00e1on, a stately bathing-place, the ruins of which still remain. He was attacked and defeated by the terrible K\u00e1l\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r, general of Sulaim\u00e1n Karar\u00e1n\u00ed, really king, though nominally only viceroy, of Bengal. After holding out for some time at the strong fortress of R\u00e1ibani\u00e1n on the Subarnarekh\u00e1, Mukund retreated, fighting as he went, to J\u00e1jp\u00far, where he was\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\neither killed or driven into exile\u2014for his fate is shrouded in obscurity\u2014and Orissa became a province of Bengal in A.D. 1568.\\(^1\\)\n\nIt is so treated in the Ain. The arrangement, however, proved unworkable, and Orissa was eventually made into a separate S\u00fabah by the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. The suppression of the Bengal military revolt of 1572 led to the flight of D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n, the rebel king of Bengal, into Orissa. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Todar Mal accompanied the force under Mun\u2019\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, which pursued D\u00e1\u00fad and defeated him at the battle of Tukaroi, near Jellasore, in 1574. Todar Mal advanced as far as Cuttack, and it must have been at this time that he obtained the materials for the financial arrangements which are preserved to us in the Ain. But as after the campaign D\u00e1\u00fad was left in possession of Orissa in little more than nominal submission to the Emperor, Todar Mal\u2019s arrangements did not take effect, and his lists must be regarded as little more than a sketch or project, and the local tradition which ascribes to him the settlement of the cultivated and civilized central tract known as the Moghul-band\u00ed rests on no historical foundation. The first actual Moghul settlement was made by R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Singh in A.H. 999 (A.D. 1590), and even this did not come fully into operation till the final suppression of the Afghans in the reign of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, probably, judging from Grant\u2019s \u201cAnalysis,\u201d not before 1627.\n\nTodar Mal\u2019s lists, as will be seen from the following remarks, are very imperfect, and cannot be taken as covering the whole territory of Orissa. A very large number of undoubtedly ancient and important estates are omitted, and the revenue assigned to others bears no proportion to their known extent. Stirling, indeed, who was intimately acquainted with the province in the early days of British rule, asserts that a measurement of the lands was made, and that the accounts still preserved in the offices of the Sadr K\u00e1n\u00fangos, or Keepers of the Revenue Accounts, are founded\n\n\\(^1\\) For this date see the evidence in my article on \u201cThe History of Orissa,\u201d J.A.S.B., vol. lii, p. 233, note \u2020.\non that measurement, but he could find no evidence or information as to the means by which the determination of the rents and revenue was arrived at, and it is highly probable that the measurement dragged on over many years, and the assessment of revenue was not finally made till long after Todar Mal's time.\n\nIt will be noticed that in the Ain the word \u0643\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0629 kila'ah 'a fort' occurs very frequently. It must not, however, be inferred from this that the whole of Orissa bristled with strong castles or fortresses. The kila'ah was generally a much humbler affair. It was for the most part merely the house of a zamindar with the adjacent village surrounded by an earthen rampart or breastwork, and occasionally a rude moat, the whole girdled by a thick belt of bamboo and rattan jungle, forming an impenetrable barrier to the cavalry of which the Moghul armies chiefly consisted. Several of these so-called forts are still in existence, as, for instance, at Al; but the number of stone forts is not large, and most of those which existed in the sixteenth century have since disappeared. They can, however, often be traced by the word Gar (fort) prefixed to the names of villages which still stand on their ancient sites though no longer fortified.\n\nThe materials for reconstructing this S\u00fabah are Grant's \"Analysis,\" the lists of parganahs in the appendices in vol. ii of Hunter's \"Orissa,\" Stirling's account of Orissa in the Asiatic Researches, and the two I.O. MSS. mentioned in my article on Bengal. The notes which I supplied to the late Professor Blochmann in 1870 were unfortunately lost with his other collections after his death, but I have some notes in MS. still, and having been officially connected with Orissa for nine years (1869\u20131878) and with Midnapore for five (1880\u20131885), I have been able to supply some suggestions from personal acquaintance with the localities.\n\nIn the following notes the names of the parganahs will be given in the form adopted by Colonel Jarrett; the correct names, with the necessary remarks and explanations, being given opposite each. The same abbreviations are used as\nin my article on Bengal. The Persian words are transliterated on the usual Jonesian system, with the exception of such places as are well known under English corruptions, e.g. Jellasore (Jalesar), Cuttack (Ka\u1e63\u1e6dak), Midnapore (Medn\u012bp\u016br), Balasore (B\u00e1lesar).\n\n**Sark\u00e1r Jalesar (Jellasore).**\n\nThis very large Sark\u00e1r includes the whole of the Midnapore district, with the exception of a few scattered areas on the eastern border attached to Sark\u00e1r Mad\u00e1ran in S\u00fabah Bang\u00e1lah. It also includes all northern Balasore as far as the K\u00e1nsb\u00e1ns river, together with an indefinite extent of hill and jungle to the west.\n\nB\u00e1nsanda, commonly Haftch\u00f3r. Should be \u201cB\u00e1nmund\u00ed, alias the Seven Chaura.\u201d The MSS., which have all evidently copied from the same original, blindly repeat the mistake of writing s for m. B\u00e1nmund\u00ed is still a large village on the right bank of the Subarnarekh\u00e1, opposite Jellasore. The word chaur, meaning a cleared space in a forest, is added to the names of many parganahs in this part of the country. There are fifteen of them at the present day, several of which, however, are of modern origin. The original seven are probably Bhelor\u00e1, N\u00e1p\u00fa, Kamardah, Darar\u00e1, D\u00e1ntun, Kaurdah, and K\u00e1nkar\u00e1, Chaura. They will all be found in A. of I., sheets 114 and 115, lying in a circle round Jellasore. B\u00e1nmund\u00ed, wrongly spelt Bandmundi in A. of I., sheet 115, is in Bhelor\u00e1 Chaur.\n\nThe entry \u2018castes\u2019 means the caste of the Zamind\u00e1rs. For J.\u2019s Bhej read Bhanj, a very common caste title in Orissa.\n\nBibli, read Pipli. Celebrated as the earliest English factory in Bengal, established in 1640, at the mouth of the Subarnarekh\u00e1. It has now been completely washed away, and the river flows over its site. Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n\nnamed it the \"Royal Port,\" Sh\u00e1h Bandar, and the parganah now bears that name. The zamind\u00e1r showed me, in 1872, the original farm\u00e1n of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n conferring on his ancestors the port dues and fees, on condition of their supplying provisions to the ships. In it the port is called Pipl\u00ed Sh\u00e1hbandar.\n\nB\u00e1lis\u00e1h\u00ed. Now pronounced B\u00e1ls\u00e1h\u00ed. The latter part of the word is the Oriya s\u00e1h\u00ed 'a village,' mistaken by the Imperial scribes for the more familiar sh\u00e1h\u00ed 'royal.' The word means 'village in the sand,' an appropriate name, as it lies among the sand-hills on the sea-shore.\n\nB\u00e1lkohs\u00ed. The name is written with many variants. Blochmann gives kohi and khost. I.O. 6 has kothi, and I.O. 1114 m\u00e1lkot! I have no doubt that the word meant is B\u00e1rah kost 'the twelve kos.' This was the name given to the much dreaded tract, twelve kos, or twenty-four miles long, between the Subarnarekh\u00e1 and B\u00farh\u00e1balang. The old pilgrim road to the shrine of Jagann\u00e1th passed through this country along the foot of densely wooded hills, and was infested by robbers and wild beasts. Pilgrims used to stop at Jellasore till a large crowd had assembled; then they subscribed and hired guides to take them through the dangerous part. In later times the name was extended as far south as the K\u00e1nsb\u00e1ns, and it is in this wider sense that it is used in the A\u00edn.\n\nOf the three forts, two can be identified\u2014Sokrah as the place now known as Sohroh, a town and police-station half-way between Balasore and Bhadrakh; and B\u00e1nhast\u00e1l\u00ed as Bhainsb\u00e1t\u00ed, on the K\u00e1nsb\u00e1ns, six miles south-east of Sohroh. Dadhp\u00far I cannot identify.\n\n---\n\n1 He visited the place in 1621, when, as Prince Khurram, he rebelled against his father, the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr (see my article on the \"History of Northern Orissa,\" J.A.S.B., vol. lii, p. 237). His grant to the zamind\u00e1rs was probably made in recognition of their support on that occasion.\nParbad\u00e1. This is an unlikely name for a place in Orissa. I.O. 6 has Barpad\u00e1, which is an extremely common name of villages in that province. None of the numerous Barpad\u00e1s, however, possess the features here noted. Seeing how commonly the markaz, or sloping stroke of \u0686, is omitted in MSS. of the Ain, I have no hesitation in concluding that the place meant is Garpad\u00e1. It is exactly as described\u2014a strong fort, partly on a hill, partly in jungle; though the fortifications have now almost ceased to be traceable. In the Middle Ages this place, halfway between Jellasore and Balasore, commanding the pilgrim road, the only high road into Orissa, and the residence of influential zamindars, was a position of great importance. Here a battle was fought by K\u00e1l\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r, and one of his captains who fell in it lies buried close by, and is worshipped as a martyr. (See my article on the \"History of Northern Orissa,\" J.A.S.B., vol. lii, p. 231; also my facsimile and translation of a copper-plate grant in the possession of the Bhuy\u00e1ns of Garpad\u00e1 in Indian Antiquary, vol. i, p. 355, where I have erroneously spelt the word Garh- instead of Gar-.)\n\nBhogr\u00e1\u00ed. A parganah at the mouth of the Subarnarekh\u00e1, on the north side, partly in Balasore, partly in Midnapore. I have not been able to find any traces of the \"fortress of great strength.\" Possibly the river has washed it away.\n\nBugdi, now pronounced Bogri. It is a parganah in North Midnapore, lying on both sides of the Sel\u00e1i river. The town of Garbet\u00e1 is in it.\n\nB\u00e1z\u00e1r. Now Dhenki\u00e1 b\u00e1z\u00e1r, on the Kas\u00e1i river, a little below Midnapore town.\n\nB\u00e1bbenbh\u00fam, a parganah in North Midnapore, now more correctly pronounced Br\u00e1hmanbh\u00fam (not Brahmanp\u00far, as stated by J.).\n\nTaliya, with town of Jalesar. The first word is evidently incorrect; the MSS. offer every variety of reading.\nI.O. 6 gives \u0646\u0644\u0647\u0647\u060c with no dots to the third letter. I.O. 1114 has \u0646\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0647. Mr. Beveridge has kindly examined for me six MSS. at the British Museum, all of which have \u0646\u0644\u0647\u0647 or \u062a\u0644\u0647\u0647. He suggests that the word may be \u062a\u0643\u064a\u0647 takiya 'the hermitage of a darweeh.' I do not, however, know of any takiya near Jellasore. On the other hand, Jellasore has from ancient times been divided into two parts\u2014the commercial town and the official station. The former has always been, and is still, known as Pa\u00f1na Jalesar; pa\u00f1na being, as is well known, a very common name for mercantile towns throughout India. It seems to me highly probable, indeed almost certain, that we should read pa\u00f1nah b\u0101 kasbah\u2014'the market town and citadel of Jalesar.' \u062a\u0643\u064a\u0647 might easily be misread as \u0646\u0644\u0647\u0647 if the dots over the t got mixed with it by running of the ink or a slip of the pen, and still more so if the cerebral were indicated by a superscribed \u0644\u060c as is often done. As Blochmann notices in the preface to his Persian text, the MSS. follow one another so slavishly that a mistake in the original one would be faithfully reproduced in all the copies.\n\nTanb\u00falak. Read Tamb\u00falak, \u0646 before \u0628 in Persian being always pronounced m. The place meant is the famous ancient emporium of Tamr\u00e1lipti, now Taml\u00fck, still a flourishing town on the R\u00fapnar\u00e1yan river in North-east Midnapore.\n\nTark\u00f3l. Should be Tark\u00fa\u00e1. The MSS. have apparently changed l into \u0644. It is in South Midnapore, about ten miles north-east of Jellasore.\n\nD\u00e1war Shorbh\u00fam, commonly B\u00e1rah. Read P\u00e1rah; it means the tract of saliferous land otherwise known as Shorp\u00e1rah. This expression is applied to the extensive tract on the sea-coast of Midnapore, where salt is, or till recently used to be, made, stretching from the Subarnarekh\u00e1 to the Ras\u00falp\u00far river. In Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n's settlement it is entered as Gw\u00e1lpara.\nand extended far inland. In Todar Mal's list, however, only the immediate neighbourhood of the coast is apparently intended, as the parganahs lying further inland are separately entered.\n\nRamn\u00e1. An ancient and still flourishing town, the name of which is now pronounced Remn\u00e1 or Remun\u00e1. It lies some six or seven miles north-west of Balasore town. From the mention of the Haveli it would appear to have been the headquarters of some sort of political or fiscal division under the kings of Orissa, and under Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n it again became the head of a Sark\u00e1r. There is some difficulty about the five forts, caused by the indistinctness of the MSS. In most MSS. of the Ain the details of the S\u00fabahs are given in tabular form, the page being divided by lines ruled in red ink both vertically and horizontally, forming small squares. These are often too small for the information which has to be given. To get it all in, the words are written very small and crowded together, and the dots being sprinkled carelessly about, after the manner of Persian scribes, it is often impossible to determine whether any particular dot belongs to the word above or below it. I have to thank Mr. Beveridge for a valuable note on the result of his careful inspection of the six MSS. at the British Museum. The quotations from these MSS. in the following remarks are taken from his note.\n\nThe first fort is clear enough. It is stated to be in the Haveli, and must, therefore, have been at Remn\u00e1 itself, where there are still traces of mounds and ditches.\n\nThe second fort is R\u00e1mchandrap\u00far, still a well-known village, eight miles north-east of Remn\u00e1.\n\nThe third fort is written \u0631\u0627\u0645\u06a9\u0648, in Blochmann, with no dots to the third letter. The B.M. MSS. have \u0631\u0627\u0645\u06a9\u0648, which looks like \u0631\u0627\u0645\u06af\u0627\u0648\u0646, i.e. R\u00e1mg\u00e1o\u0144, with\nthe last two letters omitted. I.O. 6 has \u0631\u0627\u0645\u06a9\u0627 as in Blochmann. I.O. 1114 has \u0631\u0627\u0631\u06a9\u0627. The local K\u00e1n\u00fango and other well-informed natives whom I consulted all insisted upon it that the place meant is Arm\u00e1l\u00e1, a large village four miles south-west of Remn\u00e1 (shown as Urmullah on the A. of I., sheet 115). This is not impossible, for the markas of the k\u00e1f is in these MSS. treated as capriciously as the dots, being often inserted where it ought not to be, and as often omitted where it ought to be. So also, \u0648 and \u0627 in Persian MSS. are often indistinguishable. Thus, \u0627\u0631\u0645 might easily be written \u0627\u0631\u0627\u0645, and by mistaking the \u0644 for \u0643 and supplying it with a markas the word would become \u0631\u0627\u0645\u06a9\u0627. As there is no R\u00e1mg\u00e1on anywhere in this neighbourhood, the local tradition is at least worthy of consideration.\n\nThe fourth fort is written \u062f\u0648\u062a in Blochmann, and D\u00fat in Jarrett. There is, however, no such place, and the reading itself is open to serious objection. One B.M. MS. has \u062f\u0648\u062a, but the dots seem to belong to the word \u0633\u06cc\u0648\u0645 in the line above; another has \u062f\u0648\u0628 with no dots. But Blochmann has omitted some important words which occur in several of the B.M. as well as the I.O. MSS. Thus\u2014\n\nB.M. 7652 Addl. has \u0686\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u062f\u0648 \u0633\u0633\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0646\u06af,\nor it may be read \u062f\u0648 \u0633\u0633\u0644\u0647.\n\nB.M. 6546 Addl. has the same; here also \u0633\u0633\u0644\u0647 is not clear.\n\nI.O. 6 \u0686\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u062f\u0648 \u0633\u0633\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0646\u06af.\nI.O. 1114 \u062f\u0648\u062a \u0633\u0646\u0645 \u0631\u0627 \u0633\u0646\u06af; but the two dots over the t are quite at the right-hand corner of the letter, not over the centre as usual, and the d and u are joined together, so that they look like \u062f\u0648.\n\nThe key to this mystery is, I think, supplied by the reading of I.O. 1114. \u0633\u0646\u0645 is apparently a mistake\nfor 'an image,' and the word has been still further corrupted by the other copyists. In my opinion the full text originally ran\u2014\n\n\u0686\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0644 \u062f\u0648 \u0635\u0646\u0645 \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0646\u06af\n\ni.e. the fourth De\u00fal (has) two statues of stone.\n\nThe place meant is the ancient stone fort of De\u00falg\u00e1on, some thirty miles north of Remn\u00e1, on the Balasore and Midnapore boundary. A description of this fort will be found in Indian Antiquary, vol. i, p. 76. In the centre of the fort are two colossal statues of men on horseback. These represent the two horsemen celebrated in Orissa legend. In A.D. 1490, as R\u00e1j\u00e1 Purushottam Dev was marching to attack K\u00e1njivaram, two beautiful youths on horseback rode at the head of the army, and, like Macaulay's Great Twin Brethren, secured victory to the R\u00e1j\u00e1. They then vanished, after revealing themselves as Krishna and Balar\u00e1ma. These must, I think, be the 'two statues of stone' alluded to in the text. In their efforts to get all this long note into the small space in the tabular form, the copyists have crushed it up into an unrecognizable muddle.\n\nThe fifth fort is given by Blochmann as \u0633\u0644\u062f\u0647, which J. renders Saldah. This is, however, apparently a mistake derived from the reading \u062f\u0648\u0633\u0627 \u0633\u0644\u062f\u0647 of some MSS. Most of the B.M. MSS. have \u067e\u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u0645 \u062c\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a 'the fifth is new.' I.O. 6 has \u067e\u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u0645 \u0635\u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a, where \u0635\u062f is a mistake for \u062c\u062f\u06cc\u062f. I.O. 1114 has \u067e\u0627\u06cc\u06a9\u0645 \u062c\u0627\u0628, with no dot to the last letter. There is a town called Sildah, but it seems too far off. It is eighty miles to the north of Remn\u00e1, in the north-west corner of Midnapore. It is of course possible that all the wild jungle country of Western Midnapore and Morbhanj may have been included under Remn\u00e1, but as the reading \u0633\u0644\u062f\u0647 is so doubtful\nit is perhaps safer to take the reading \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u060c although this leaves us in ignorance of the locality of the fifth fort. I presume, however, that the 'new fort' was Chandrarekh\u00e1 Garh, about eight miles north-west of De\u00falg\u00e1on; the parganah is called Nay\u00e1gr\u00e1m, which seems to be indicated by the \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f of the A\u00edn.\n\nRayn. The situation of this place \"on the borders of Orissa\" leaves no doubt that the correct reading is Raiban \u0631\u0627\u06cc\u0628\u0646\u060c or more strictly \u0631\u0627\u06cc\u0628\u0646. It is now called R\u00e1ibani\u00e1n. The MSS. are here again incorrect. I.O. 6 has \u0632\u06cc\u0646\u060c and I.O. 1114 \u0632\u06cc\u0646. The \"three forts\" mentioned in the text appeared to me when I visited the place to be four. (See my article on the \"Jungle Forts of Northern Orissa,\" in Indian Antiquary, vol. i, p. 33, where there is a description of R\u00e1ibani\u00e1n, with a map of the forts and several sketches.) It was at R\u00e1ibani\u00e1n, which is seven miles from Jellasore, on the opposite or western side of the Subarnarekh\u00e1, that Mukund Dev the Telinga, the last independent sovereign of Orissa, made a determined but ineffectual stand against the Musulman invaders. The memory of this fact may have caused the entry \"on the borders of Orissa,\" for the Subarnarekh\u00e1 was practically the northern boundary, though the power of Mukund had for a time extended to the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed.\n\nR\u00e1epur, a large city with a strong fortress. The only place of this name known to me is in South B\u00e1nkurah, some forty miles north-west of Midnapore. It is now a small town, but it is said to have been much larger in ancient times. I.O. 1114 has \u0627\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u067e\u0648\u0631\u060c probably to be read Udayap\u00far, which is in Chutia N\u00e1gp\u00far, 200 miles away.\n\nSabang. A parganah in Central Midnapore, some twenty miles south-east of the town.\n\nSiy\u00e1ri. A parganah on the Subarnarekh\u00e1, sixteen miles south-east of Jellasore.\nK\u00e1sijor\u00e1. A large parganah in East Midnapore.\n\nKharaks\u00far. Should be Khargp\u00far. The \"strong fort in the wooded hills\" seems to point to some other place, as there is neither fort nor hill in Khargp\u00far, which is level country on the south of the Kass\u00ed river opposite Midnapore town.\n\nKed\u00e1rkhand. A parganah in Central Midnapore.\n\nKar\u00e1i. This reading is doubtful. Many MSS. have \u06a9\u0631\u0627\u06cc. I.O. 6 and 1114 both have \u06a9\u0631\u0627\u06cc. The place meant is, I think, Kasi\u00e1ri, on the Subarnarekh\u00e1, twenty miles south-west of Midnapore, an ancient and famous place.\n\nGagn\u00e1p\u00far. Probably the parganah now called Gagneswar. I.O. 1114 has a word which may be read Gagnas\u00e1pur. I.O. 6 has Kaln\u00e1p\u00far, which is evidently incorrect. Gagneswar adjoins Kasi\u00e1ri in South-west Midnapore.\n\nKarohi. Some MSS. have \u06a9\u0631\u0648\u0647\u06cc, which should be read Kur\u00fali. This seems correct; parganah Kur\u00fal Chaur in South Midnapore, fifteen miles from Jellasore, is apparently the place intended.\n\nM\u00e1lchatt\u00e1. Should be M\u00e1ljhatt\u00e1. This is the name given to the tract on the sea-coast of Midnapore from the mouth of the Ras\u00falp\u00far river to the R\u00fapnar\u00e1yan. It included the well-known station of Hijl\u00ed (culgo Hidgellee): see Grant, 246, 527.\n\nMedn\u00edp\u00far. The large town and capital of a very extensive district, which is better known by the European corruption of Midnapore. Of the two forts, one is still partially extant. It has been enlarged and built upon to form the old district jail. This is probably the newer of the two forts mentioned in the Ain. The older one is also, I believe, still traceable, but I have not seen it.\n\nThere is a sentence attached to this entry in some MSS. which seems to have puzzled Blochmann, and is pronounced unintelligible by Jarrett. It varies considerably in different MSS., the copyists,\naccording to their custom, having written carelessly whatever they did not understand.\n\nIn Blochmann's text the passage runs\u2014\n\n\u06a9\u0647\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u062a \u0648 \u0628\u06a9\u0633\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u06cc\u0634 \u0628\u06a9\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u062f\u06cc\u0648 \u0627\u0646\u0647\n\nIn a footnote he gives the variant\u2014\n\n\u0648\u0633\u06cc\u0644\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u06cc\u0634\u062a \u062f\u06cc\u0648 \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u062f\n\nNeither of these readings is intelligible.\n\nMr. Beveridge has pointed out that the words occur in the column headed \"Zamind\u00e1r,\" which gives the caste of the landed proprietors. By omitting this distinction, both Blochmann and Jarrett have obscured the meaning of these entries throughout the lists in the Ain.\n\nOf the B.M. MSS. 7652 Addl. reads\u2014\n\n\u0627\u0632 \u0642\u0648\u0645 \u06a9\u0647\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u062a \u0648 \u062a\u0644\u0646\u06af\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u06cc\u0634 \u0645\u06a9\u0646\u062f \u062f\u06cc\u0648 \u0627\u0646\u0647\n\nMS. 16872 Addl. reads the same, substituting \u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0647 for \u062a\u0644\u0646\u06af\u0647.\n\nI.O. 6 has the same as the last but one, with this difference, that it inserts a \u0648 after \u0645\u06a9\u0646\u062f and omits the markaz of the \u06a9\u0647\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u062a. I.O. 1114 has \u0628\u0644\u0628\u0644\u0647, which is nonsense!\n\nThe difficulty seems to have been mainly caused by reading \u0645\u06a9\u0646\u062f, as if it were the Persian word mi-kunad 'he does,' and combining \u062f\u06cc\u0648 with the following word into the Persian \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647 'insane.'\n\nAs Mr. Beveridge now points out, and as I find I suggested to Prof. Blochmann years ago, what we have here is really the name of Mukund Dev, the last king of Orissa. The final word in the sentence is not \u0627\u0646\u0647, but \u0627\u0646\u062f 'they are.' The passage should therefore run\u2014\n\n\u0627\u0632 \u0642\u0648\u0645 \u06a9\u0647\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u062a \u0648 \u062a\u0644\u0646\u06af\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u06cc\u0634 \u0645\u06a9\u0646\u062f \u062f\u06cc\u0648 \u0627\u0646\u062f\n\ni.e. \"They (the Zamind\u00e1rs) are of the castes of\nKhandait and Telinga, kinsmen of Mukund Dev.\u201d Mukund Dev, as we know, was a Telinga, that is, he came from the Telinga, or Telugu, country, the land on the banks of the God\u00e1var\u00ed, which gave so many kings to Orissa, and what more natural than that he should entrust the important frontier fortress of Midnapore to his own kinsmen, on whose fidelity he could rely? The Khandaits are not, strictly speaking, a caste, in the Hindu sense of that term. The word means \u2018swordsmen\u2019 (from kha\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, Skr. khadga \u2018a sword\u2019), and they were the fyrd, landwehr, or militia of the kingdom, called out when war arose, going back to their fields in time of peace. In the present day large numbers of peasants call themselves Khandaits, either because the title is respectable or because some remote ancestor served in the fyrd, and so the word has become a quasi-caste title. Mukund Dev\u2019s Telinga kinsmen appear to be called Khandaits because of the military duties they discharged in guarding the fort.\n\nMah\u00e1k\u00e1ngh\u00e1t, alias Kutbp\u00far, a fortress of great strength. The village is now called M\u00e1nigh\u00e1ti, and the parganah Kutbp\u00far. It lies about twenty-five miles north-west of Midnapore.\n\nNar\u00e1yanp\u00far, alias Khand\u00e1r. Two separate parganahs a few miles to the south of Midnapore. One is now known as Nar\u00e1yangar\u1e25, the other as Khand\u00e1r.\n\nSark\u00e1r Bhadrak.\n\nThis Sark\u00e1r, much smaller than Jalesar, comprises in general the country between the K\u00e1nsb\u00e1ns and Baitarni rivers and a few tracts to the south of the latter river. The tracts on the sea-coast are, however, included in Sark\u00e1r Ka\u1e6dak (Cuttack).\n\nBarw\u00e1. Now called Birw\u00e1 (spelt Beerooa in A. of I., sheet 115). It is a parganah lying between the\nBr\u00e1hmin\u00ed and Khars\u00fa\u00e1 rivers in North Cuttack. The two strong forts are given as B\u00e1nk and Riskoi; for the latter, I.O. 6 has Risk\u00far\u012b, I.O. 6 \u062f\u06cc\u0626\u0631\u06cc with no dots to the fourth letter. The places meant are probably B\u00e1nks\u00e1hi on the Br\u00e1hmin\u00ed and Risp\u00far (i.e. Riship\u00fara) on the Khars\u00fa\u00e1.\n\nJaukjari. The proper name is Jogjur\u00ed. It is a large and well-known village on the southern slope of the Nilgiri hills in the tributary state of that name.\n\nHaveli Bhadrak. A town on the river S\u00e1lindi, headquarters of a subdivision. Dh\u00e1mnagar is also an important place twelve miles south of Bhadrak, or Bhadrakh, as it should be written with final kh. It is said to be from (Bala)bhadrakshetra, the field or tract sacred to Balabhadra. Dh\u00e1mnagar is noticeable as containing a considerable settlement of Muhammadans, rather a rare thing in Orissa, but explained by the note in the \u00c1\u00edn that it was the residence of a\u2014presumably Muhammadan\u2014governor.\n\nSahans\u00fa. Now called Soho, an extensive parganah on the west frontier of Balasore, fifteen miles west of Bhadrakh.\n\nK\u00e1im\u00e1n. Now divided into three parganahs called K\u00e1im\u00e1, Kismat K\u00e1im\u00e1, and Kila\u2019a K\u00e1im\u00e1 (in A. of I., Kymah), lying on both sides of the Baitarni below J\u00e1jp\u00far. The name of the last retains a remembrance of a fort, though no traces of it now remain.\n\nKadeu. A variant is Gar\u1e63\u00fa. No place with any name at all resembling either word is known to me. The names given for this Sark\u00e1r in the \u00c1\u00edn do not cover the whole area, and there are probably many omissions, as large tracts of country remain unaccounted for. I am inclined to think that part of the name has dropped out by negligence of copyists, and that the place meant is Gar Sokindah, a large tributary estate in North-west Cuttack. In Oriya, Gar is used for a fort, not Gar\u1e25.\nIndependent ta'lukd\u00e1rs. Entered as Mazk\u00far\u00edn; with three forts.\n\n1. Pachhim Donk. I.O. 6 reads \u062f\u0648\u0646\u0643. I.O. 1114 something illegible, of which the first two letters are \u062f\u0648; the others look like \u0645\u0644. I know of no Donk, but Pachhimkot, a large village in parganah Ragad\u00ed (Rugree in A. of I.) in Northwest Cuttack, near the Br\u00e1hmin\u00ed, is probably the place meant.\n\n2. Khandait. This is not the name of a place. Khanditar on the Khars\u00fa\u00e1 (not marked in A. of I.), ten miles west of J\u00e1jp\u00far, where the Orissa Trunk Road crosses it, is probably the place meant.\n\n3. Majori. Manj\u00far\u00ed, as it is now called, is a parganah on the north bank of the Baitarni, four miles above J\u00e1jp\u00far.\n\nSark\u00e1r Ka\u1e6dak (Cuttack).\n\nThe spelling Cuttack, being more familiar to Europeans than Kata\u1e45k, will be used in the following remarks. The Sark\u00e1r includes the whole of the Cuttack and Puri districts, with the exception of the tracts already mentioned under Bhadrakh. But here also many important places, which are known to have been in existence in Todar Mal's time, are omitted, proving that his lists must have been incomplete. Nearly all the places mentioned are easily recognizable.\n\n\u0100l (A. of I. Aul; the town is shown as Rajbari). A well-known town and parganah on the Khars\u00fa\u00e1 in Northeast Cuttack. The ancient fort and palace is the residence of a Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 who is lineally descended from the kings of Orissa.\n\n\u0100sakah. Ask\u00e1, a town in the Ganj\u00e1m district on the Ras\u00e1kuli\u00e1 river, the extreme southern boundary of Orissa proper.\nAthgarh. One of the tributary estates, on the north bank of the Mah\u00e1nadi, about ten miles above Cuttack.\n\nP\u00farb Dikh. The latter word is evidently for Dig = 'quarter,' 'region,' which is the reading of I.O. 1114. The four forts on the eastern side of Orissa lying along the sea-coast are Kanik\u00e1, Kujang, Harishp\u00far, and Mirichp\u00far. They lie in the above order from north to south, and the territory attached to each is extensive, as will be seen from the A. of I., sheet 115.\n\nPachchhim Dikh. 'Western quarter.' The list of forts on the western frontier of the Cuttack district is not given, but it must be meant to include the kila'as of Darpan, Madhup\u00far (A. of I., Mudpoor!), Balr\u00e1mp\u00far, and Chausathp\u00e1ra between the Br\u00e1hmin\u00ed and Mah\u00e1nadi, and probably also Domp\u00e1r\u00e1 and Pati\u00e1, south of the latter river.\n\nBah\u00e1r. There is no place of this name in Cuttack. B.M. 7652 Addl. has jLq Bah\u00e1z, so has I.O. 6, but this also is an unknown name. Mr. Beveridge points out a passage in Grant 528 in which he includes in the province of Orissa \"a mountainous, unproductive region on the western frontier, making part of the wilds of Jharkund, or jungly country, towards the velayt of Behar.\" The Muhammadans seem to have thought in their ignorance of the geography of these hitherto unconquered provinces that Orissa stretched back through the hills and jungles till it touched the southern frontier of Bih\u00e1r; and Grant repeats this mistake. Probably by the entry Bah\u00e1r, with its large revenue of fifty-one lakhs, Todar Mal meant to designate all the extensive tract of country now known as the Tributary Mahals, administered by a number of semi-independent R\u00e1j\u00e1s who pay a small tribute to the British Government. But their country does not reach as far west as Bih\u00e1r by a long way.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nBas\u00e1\u00ed D\u00edwarm\u00e1r. The copyists have got into great confusion over this name. Blochmann gives the variants \u0628\u0633\u0627\u0626\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06cc and \u0628\u0633\u0627\u0626\u06cc \u067e\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u0627. The B.M. MSS. have \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06cc and \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0632; I.O. 6 has \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0632; and I.O. 1114 apparently \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0632, though the letters are so jumbled together that it is difficult to decide in which order to take them. I conjecture that these variants are an attempt to represent the name B\u00e1sudebp\u00far \u00c1rang, i.e. the salterns of B\u00e1sudebp\u00far. This place was for long, and is still, one of the chief seats of the salt-making industry. The Oriya word for a saltern, or place where salt is made, is \u00c1rang.\n\nIn crushing up the letters to get them into the small space allowed for them in the table, some have been omitted and others transposed. B\u00e1sudebp\u00far is in the Balasore district, about fourteen miles north-east of Bhadrakh, near the sea, in parganah Ankur\u00e1.\n\nB\u00e1rang. No place of this name is known to me. But the description of the \u201cnine forts in hill and jungle\u201d corresponds precisely to the celebrated fortress of S\u00e1rang Gar, which, with its nine (or even more) subordinate forts, guards the entrance to Khurdh\u00e1, the mountain fastness where the kings of Orissa sought refuge on the overthrow of their independence, and where they maintained themselves down to modern times. S\u00e1rang Gar lies some four miles south-west of the city of Cuttack, across the K\u00e1tj\u00f3r\u00ed river. The Engineers of the Public Works Department\u2014with their usual good taste and reverence for things ancient\u2014have driven a road right through it, and pounded the stones to metal the road. The same enlightened officials sold me some exquisitely carved images of Buddha and some of Krishna as \u201cstone ballast\u201d at \u201cone rupee the running foot\u201d! S\u00e1rang was too important a place to be omitted from the A\u00edn, but unless this is it, it nowhere occurs. It is not shown in the A. of I., but a number of\nvillages with the prefix Gar (A. of I., Gurr)\u2014Gar D\u00e1rut\u00e1ng, Gar Andhar\u00fa\u00e1, and others\u2014represent the nine forts of the A\u00edn.\n\nBh\u00edjnagar. Should be Bhanjnagar, which is the reading both of I.O. 6 and I.O. 1114, the old name of Gumsur, the capital of a state the semi-independent R\u00e1j\u00e1s of which were of the Bhanj caste. Upendro Bhanj, one of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of this place, is the most celebrated of the poets of Orissa.\u00b9 Gumsur is in the Ganj\u00e1m District, some twenty miles north of Ask\u00e1.\n\nBanj\u00fa. I.O. 1114 has \u0628\u0627\u0646\u062c. This must, I think, be meant for Banch\u00e1s in Central Puri. There is no other place, as far as I know, having any name resembling this.\n\nParsottam. Should be Purushottam; the full name of the town of Puri, where the celebrated temple of Jagann\u00e1th is situated, is Purushottama Kshetra, \u2018the field or tract sacred to Vishnu, the Purushottama or Highest Being.\u2019\u00b2 The note attached to this entry, which J. renders \u2018detailed in each Sark\u00e1r,\u2019 means that the revenue recorded against it is made up of lands lying in all parts of the province. Even in the present day there is hardly a single parganah, perhaps not even one, in which there are not revenue-free lands belonging to the great temple of Jagann\u00e1th.\n\nChaubiskot, now called Chaubisk\u00fad, a large parganah lying between the town of Puri and the Chilk\u00e1 lake. The four forts of great strength are now no longer traceable.\n\nJash, commonly called T\u00e1jp\u00far. The last word is a misprint for J\u00e1jp\u00far, which is distinctly the reading both in Blochmann\u2019s text and in all the MSS. The ancient, celebrated, and sacred city of J\u00e1jp\u00far on the\n\n\u00b9 A long list of his poems will be found in Hunter\u2019s \u201cOrissa,\u201d vol. ii, p. 208. He lived in the sixteenth century.\n\u00b2 The word should therefore be written with short u and i; not P\u00far\u00ed \u2018city,\u2019 as it is often erroneously written by Europeans.\nBaitarni has been a noted place of pilgrimage from remote antiquity. I.O. 1114 reads Jashp\u00far 'urf J\u00e1j. The form Jash should, I think, be read Jashn, and appears to be an attempt to reproduce the word Jajna, of the Sanskrit \u092f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u092a\u0941\u0930 yaj\u00f1ap\u016bra 'city of sacrifice,' the original name of this city.\n\nDakhan Dikh. For dikh we should read dig. The four forts of the southern region are P\u00e1rik\u00fad, M\u00e1l\u00fad, Bajrakot, and Andh\u00e1ri, all of which lie between the Chilk\u00e1 lake and the sea, and are shown in the A. of I.\n\nSir\u00e1n. Should be Sir\u00e1\u00edn, a parganah in Central Puri, on the north-east shore of the Chilk\u00e1 lake.\n\nShergarh. A large parganah in the north-west corner of the Cuttack district.\n\nKo\u1e6ddes. A large parganah in the northern and central part of Puri. The entry against this parganah regarding the forts varies in the different MsS. I.O. 6 has inserted (erroneously, I think) before \u0627\u0635\u0644. I.O. 1114 has \u062a\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0645\u064f \u0627\u0635\u0652\u0644\u064e. The meaning apparently is that the original fort is a kasbah or town. The variant \u062a\u064e\u0635\u0652\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0629 kusaibah means a small town. The ko\u1e6d or fort, from which the parganah received its name of Ko\u1e6ddes, or the 'country of the fort,' was, in fact, a fortified town, and not, as most of the Orissa forts were, merely a castle or fortified house.\n\nKa\u1e6dak Ban\u00e1ras. The city of Cuttack, capital of the ancient kingdom and of the modern province. The name Ban\u00e1ras, so persistently attached to it by Mu\u1e25ammadan writers, has nothing to do with the famous sacred city on the Ganges, but is a mispronunciation of Bir\u00e1n\u00e1s\u00ed (Bir\u00e1=a kind of millet, and n\u00e1s\u00ed=a headland), the name of a village a mile from the fort on a point jutting out into the river K\u00e1tjor\u00ed. The \"stone fort of great strength,\" or so much of it as the Public Works Department has not sold at \"one\nrupee the running foot,\" still stands to the north of the city. When yet uninjured, it must have been an imposing edifice, and covers a large area, surrounded by a broad moat with strong stone walls. Nothing but a huge mound remains of the palace of Mukund Dev.\n\nKhatra. I.O. 6 reads \u0643\u064e\u0647\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e, I.O. 1114 \u0643\u064e\u0647\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e, but the most probable reading is that given in a note by Blochmann, \u0643\u064e\u0647\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e. The real word is, I think, Khetra, meaning the sacred area round the city of Puri, the revenues of which were devoted to the service of the temple of Jagann\u00e1th.\n\nM\u00e1nikpatan. M\u00e1nikpatan is at the point where the Chilk\u00e1 lake opens into the Bay of Bengal. There are still numerous salt-making stations round about it.\n\nSark\u00e1r Kaling Dandp\u00e1t.\nSark\u00e1r R\u00e1jmahindra.\n\nThese two names cover the whole tract of country from the Ras\u00e1kuli\u00e1 to the God\u00e1var\u00ed. Though occasionally for short periods subject to the kings of Orissa, this country never really formed part of their kingdom, and was never at any time subject to the rule of Akbar or his successors. No details are given concerning it, and the entries regarding revenue and contingents of troops are purely imaginary.\n\nThis concludes the notice in the \u00c1\u00edn concerning Orissa. It is worthy of note, as showing the incompleteness of the lists compiled by Todar Mal, that although many places both on the eastern and western frontiers are mentioned, hardly a single name of any of the wide and fertile territories in the central plain of Cuttack occurs. This plain, the heart of the Mughalbandi, in the delta of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed and Br\u00e1hmin\u00ed rivers, is the richest, most cultivated, and most populous part of the whole of Orissa.\nYet Asureswar, Kal\u00e1m\u00e1t\u00ed\u00e1, P\u00e1ind\u00e1, Tis\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1, Hariharpur, Deog\u00e1on, Sailo, Saib\u00edr, and a dozen other large and productive parganahs are omitted from the list, and there is no one of the names in the list which can be stretched so as to cover them. The same remark applies to the Puri District, where Limbai, Kotr\u00e1ng, Antar\u00fad, and many other populous and well-cultivated areas, are entirely omitted. Ko\u1e6ddes, Chaubiskot, and Sir\u00e1\u00edn can hardly have been so much larger than they are at present as to include all this territory.\n\nIt is true that under the head of P\u00farb Dig or eastern quarter a revenue of 22,881,580 d\u00e1ms (=Rs. 572,014) is recorded, which is far more than can ever have been realized from the four jungly tracts on the sea-coast\u2014Kanik\u00e1, Kujang, and the two other kila\u2019as. So also the territory of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1s of \u00c1l is known to have been more extensive formerly than now, and the Dakhan Dig or southern quarter is recorded as assessed at 22,065,770 d\u00e1ms (=Rs. 526,644), which is much in excess of anything that can possibly have been levied from the four poor little kila\u2019as between the Chilk\u00e1 and the sea. But even after making allowances for the area covered by these names extending over a far larger tract than at present, there must remain a great extent of country in the Cuttack and Puri Districts unaccounted for. The truth seems to be that Todar Mal\u2019s inquiries into the land revenue of Orissa were of a very superficial nature, and the province was not really surveyed, divided into parganahs, and assessed till the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n.\n\nNo. III. S\u00fabah Bih\u00e1r.\n\nAs I have already published my reconstruction of this S\u00fabah in J.A.S.B., vol. liv, p. 162, it will suffice to refer to that article for the identification of the parganahs, all but a very few of which are still extant under the same names as those given in the \u00c1\u00edn, and are shown, more or less disguised by incorrect spelling, in the Atlas of India.\nIt is not therefore necessary to collate and compare MSS., as in those S\u00fabahs (such as Bengal) where the old parganah names have fallen out of use and memory. The corrections necessary in Colonel Jarrett's spelling may be ascertained by reference to my article and the Atlas of India. It is not, on the whole, difficult to restore the spelling, by which that monumental work, the Atlas, is so often disfigured, to a scientific system.\n\nWith regard to the note 1 to Pand\u00e1g (read Pund\u00e1g) at p. 154 of J., my identification of the mysterious word \u062c\u0628\u0631\u0647 as Cheroh, the name of the widespread and powerful aboriginal tribe of Cheros, who for centuries held all that large area of hill-country bounding Bih\u00e1r on the south, is supported by Blochmann's article in J.A.S.B., vol. xl, p. 111, which seems not to have been consulted by J.\n\nFor Jai Chanpa, in the same Sark\u00e1r, should be read Ch\u00e1i Champ\u00e1, now two separate parganahs. I.O. 6 reads \u062c\u064a \u062c\u0646\u0628\u0627. As both Ch\u00e1i and Champ\u00e1 are still in existence, there can be no doubt as to the spelling.\n\nOther corrections may be made from the article referred to above, and the situation of all the parganahs will be seen from the map accompanying it.\n\nErratum.\u2014Page 757, line 3: for the second 'I.O. 6' substitute 'I.O. 1114.'\nART. XVIII.\u2014An Apocryphal Inscription in Khor\u0101s\u0101n. By\nNEY ELIAS, M.R.A.S.\n\nWhile travelling in Khor\u0101s\u0101n, in 1874, Colonel (then Captain) the Honourable G. Napier reported having passed an inscription cut upon a rock near the village of Panj-Mana, seven or eight miles north of K\u0101rdeh, on the road leading from Meshed to Kel\u0101t-i-N\u0101diri. The rock was described as a block of crystalline limestone fallen from an overhanging cliff, while the writing it bore was said to be the record of a victory gained by \"Muhammad Shaib\u0101ni, the Usbeg conqueror of Bokh\u0101r\u0101, over the unbelievers.\" The languages in which it was cut were Arabic and Persian, and the date 916 of the Hijra, or 1510 A.D.\n\nThis was all that was known of the inscription, but pointing, as it did, to an interesting historical period, it seemed to merit further investigation. Being unable to visit the spot myself last summer, an exact copy of the writing on the stone was made, at my request, by an accomplished calligraphist named Mirza Abdulla, of Kandah\u0101r. The English translation that accompanies it was kindly made for me by Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur Maula Bakhsh, the Indian Government Attach\u00e9 at the Meshed Consulate General.\n\nAt first sight, this record of the Usbeg chief would appear to contain nothing of greater interest than a memoir of one of his many victories; for his career had been one of almost uniform success since about 1505. By the year 1509 he had conquered Transoxiana, a great part of Turkist\u0101n, Fergh\u0101na, and Khiva, as well as some of the districts of Khor\u0101s\u0101n. He had defeated some of the best military leaders of the times among the Timuris, the\nMoghuls, and others; and if one more victory had been added to his score, no surprise would have been felt by readers of the history of his life. The curiosity, however, of this boastful inscription lies in the fact that the event it perpetuates the memory of was not a victory, but a defeat\u2014the first of a series which, within a few months of its date, brought Shaib\u0101ni\u2019s empire and life to an end. But as a statement of this kind, which impugns the veracity of a great historical character, may appear rather a bold one to make, it is necessary to go briefly into the occurrences of the times in order to show that no misconception has taken place; and also that the inscription may just as probably have been set up with Shaib\u0101ni\u2019s sanction, and while he was present on the spot, as by any partisan or successor.\n\nIn the first place, as to the lines themselves. Although Shaib\u0101ni Kh\u0101n is known to have been a writer of verses (his enemy B\u0101ber calls them tasteless verses), the composition is perhaps unlikely to have been dictated by him. Most probably it is that of a courtier whose chief object was to flatter the vanity of his master, for its obscure and pompous style is that usually adopted by Oriental panegyrists. The only historical information that it is intended to convey is contained in the Persian sentences forming the middle section, but even these are made the vehicle for rhetorical extravagances, so that the writer has been unable to descend to such commonplace detail as always to call the towns he mentions by their right names, or to give his hero\u2019s movements in explicit language. Plainly put, he tells us that, on a certain date, Shaib\u0101ni Kh\u0101n marched from Marv-i-Sh\u0101hij\u0101n,\u00b9 and that at a place called Kindilik (Kinderlik), in the Ulugh Hills of the Dasht-i-Qipch\u0101k, he gained a great victory over certain infidels whose tribe, or nationality, it is not thought worth while to name. Further, that the captives taken on the occasion were sent off to the capital of Isl\u0101m, and there\n\n\u00b9 Nowadays frequently, though incorrectly, written \u201cMarv-i-Sh\u0101h-Jah\u0101n.\u201d\nconverted; while Shaib\u0101ni himself on a certain subsequent date arrived at a town styled \"the Memorial of the Kh\u0101n,\" which he himself had built. For the erection of the inscription no date is given.\n\nIf a complete history of Shaib\u0101ni Kh\u0101n were in existence, it might be feasible to trace his operations during the period in question, and to show what the writer of the inscription really meant to set forth. But we have no complete account of the Usbeg leader's life, though portions of it are noticed in many Oriental histories\u2014some original, some mere abstracts of others. The only book which professes to contain the story of his reign and deeds is the Turki epic poem called the \"Shaib\u0101ni N\u0101ma,\" translated by Professor Vamb\u00e9ry into German under the title of \"Scheibaniade.\" This is a panegyric in the usual florid style\u2014a few grains of historical fact scattered among tons of fulsome adulation\u2014and it carries us down only to the year 911 of the Hijra, or some four years previous to the events alluded to on the stone at Panj-Mana, closing abruptly with the account of Shaib\u0101ni's return from his conquest of Khiva.\n\nMore light is to be derived from Khw\u0101ndam\u012br's general history known as the \"Habib-us-Siyar\" (vol. iii), where the period including the events in question is summed up as follows:\n\n\"After conquering the province of Jurj\u0101n (Gurg\u0101n) and its dependencies, Muhammad Kh\u0101n Shaib\u0101ni used to pitch his summer camp at the Ulang of R\u0101dk\u0101n, and used to pass the winter in M\u0101vara-un-Nahr. Sometimes he led expeditions to the Dasht-i-Qipch\u0101k for the purpose of attacking the Kaz\u0101ks; and at the end of the year 915 he was defeated by Q\u0101sim Sult\u0101n, who was the most powerful chief in Dasht-i-Qipch\u0101k at that time. During the battle a large number of the leaders of the Kh\u0101n's troops were killed. Muhammad Kh\u0101n returned in distress to Khor\u0101s\u0101n, in the spring, and led an expedition against the Haz\u0101ra\n\n---\n\n1 Dating about 927-35 Hijra, or 1521-9.\n2 This was in 914 Hijra.\nand Nikud\u0101r, who were in the Kohist\u0101n of Zamind\u0101war. As the sun of his fortune was setting, he could accomplish nothing in that expedition either.\"\n\nThe only other original author I am able to consult here, who gives an account of Shaib\u0101ni's transactions about this time, is Mirza Haidar Dughl\u0101t, the historian of the Moghuls. He was, in part, a contemporary of Shaib\u0101ni Kh\u0101n, and, in his \"T\u0101rikh-i-Rash\u012bdi,\" relates at some length several episodes of the Usbeg campaigns; thus, in regard to the expedition against the Kaz\u0101ks, to which our inscription evidently refers, he writes as follows (p. 230 of translation):\n\n\"In the year 915, he [Shaib\u0101ni] proceeded against the Kaz\u0101ks. At that time, although Baranduk was Kh\u0101n, yet all the business of government was conducted by Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n. In spite of his great power, Sh\u0101hi Beg\u00b9 Kh\u0101n had not force enough to withstand Q\u0101sim Beg. At that period the number of his army exceeded 20,000. In winter-time everyone stayed in some place where there was fodder for the cattle.\u00b2 In the middle of the winter Sh\u0101hi Beg Kh\u0101n was engaged in plundering on every side, but he soon returned, his object being not to remain too far from his own country. About the time above mentioned he made his last expedition, but the strength of his horses and soldiers was quite exhausted; he himself remained in the district of Kuk K\u0101sh\u0101na, and having detached a force whose horses had some strength left, sent them forward. This party fell in with a few men whom they despoiled and made prisoners.\n\n\"One day they had halted for the sake of feeding their horses, when news came that Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n was close at hand. This news alarmed them. Buyun P\u012br Hasan, one of Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n's Amirs, having heard of the invasion of the Shaib\u0101n, advanced against them with his own followers;\n\n\u00b9 So Mirza Haidar, and some other writers, always style Shaib\u0101ni Kh\u0101n; while others, again, write of him as \"Shaibak Kh\u0101n,\" or \"Sh\u0101h-bakht.\"\n\u00b2 Meaning, probably, that they were scattered as the necessity for fodder dictated.\nhe spread the report that Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n was approaching, and that he had let himself be seen in the distance. Sh\u0101hi Beg Kh\u0101n\u2019s people, being fully persuaded that Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n\u2019s men were really upon them, abandoned all they had seized\u2014nay, even all they had brought with them\u2014and retreated, in the utmost disorder and confusion, to Sh\u0101hi Beg Kh\u0101n, bearing the news of Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n\u2019s approach. Sh\u0101hi Beg Kh\u0101n at once ordered them to sound the drum of departure, without paying attention to anything [but getting away]. Those who liked, stayed; those who wished to go, went. Broken and in disorder, they reached Samarkand at the end of winter. Sh\u0101hi Beg Kh\u0101n himself went on to Khor\u0101s\u0101n, where he spent the spring.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning of autumn [tir*m\u0101h] he led an army against the Hazara . . . . . . . .\u201d\n\nHere, then, is the testimony of two altogether independent, and nearly contemporary, authorities that the expedition alluded to in the inscription was against the Kaz\u0101ks, under their chief Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n (or Q\u0101sim Sult\u0101n), and that the result was not a victory, as there recorded, but a defeat\u2014perhaps rather a rout\u2014of the Usbeg troops.\n\nBut in order to verify, as far as possible, Shaib\u0101ni\u2019s movements, and to trace him to the spot where the inscribed rock stands, it is necessary to compare the brief and obscure indications there vouchsafed by his memorialist with the plainer accounts of the historians. The first four place-names mentioned on the stone offer no difficulty. In the Dasht-i-Qipch\u0101k, or the locality now known as the \u201cKirghiz Steppe,\u201d the Kaz\u0101ks flourished in the sixteenth century, as they do now, though they have acquired, among the Russians, the name of \u201cKirghiz.\u201d The range of hills called Ulugh T\u0101gh (or \u201cgreat mountains\u201d) occupies a position towards the centre of the steppe, while there are two or more spots marked \u201cKinderlik\u201d on our maps, to\n\n1 The word may also mean \u201csummer,\u201d or \u201cearly summer,\u201d according to common usage.\n2 Tir is the Persian month nearly corresponding to June.\u2014H. B.\nthe south-east of the hills, and between them and the lower course of the river Ch\u016b. There may also be others in the same region, for it is a common name in Central Asia. Thus Shaib\u0101ni would appear, from the inscription, to have fought a battle a short distance to the south-east of the Ulugh T\u0101gh, and thence to have sent his prisoners to Khiva, for this I take to be the place meant by D\u0101r-ul-Isl\u0101m or \"the capital of Isl\u0101m.\" It is possible that other cities in or about M\u0101vara-un-Nahr, and very likely Samarkand itself, may also have been called, occasionally, by this title, but Khiva was certainly honoured with it very generally during the later Middle Ages; and no better evidence of this is needed than the coinage of the Kh\u0101ns of Khiva during the latter part of the thirteenth century.\u00b9\n\nAfter disposing of his prisoners, Shaib\u0101ni himself is said to have gone on to the suburbs of the town of Y\u0101dg\u0101r-i-Kh\u0101ni. What town is intended to be represented by this title, rather than name, it is not easy to determine. No book accessible to me here shows that any place was so styled during Shaib\u0101ni\u2019s or, indeed, any other period; and I have met with no inhabitant of these regions, possessing local knowledge (though I have questioned many), who has been able to recognize the term. The place where the inscription stands cannot be indicated, for it can never have been a town with suburbs at any time so recent as the sixteenth century, while I know of nothing to point to any existing town in the near neighbourhood, such as R\u0101dk\u0101n for instance,\u00b2 ever having borne such a name, or of having been built or rebuilt by Shaib\u0101ni Kh\u0101n.\n\nAccording to the inscription, it would appear that Shaib\u0101ni\u2019s \u201carrival\u201d at Y\u0101dg\u0101r-i-Kh\u0101ni is intended to be connected with his final \u201creturn\u201d from the expedition, mentioned in the succeeding sentence. If this be the case, and the return is meant to be to the point whence he set\n\n\u00b9 \u201cCatalogue of Oriental Coins in British Museum,\u201d Additions to vols. v\u2013viii, pp. 175\u20136.\n\u00b2 Meshed is, for many reasons, out of the question.\nout, it would be in Marv that we should seek for an identification of Y\u0101dg\u0101r-i-Kh\u0101ni. The city which has borne the name of Marv for many centuries has several times been destroyed, during the Musulman era, and each time restored on a different site, while on each occasion the new town has received a fresh name, by which it has been known to the inhabitants of the region, if not to strangers. Yet, in no account that I am acquainted with does Y\u0101dg\u0101r-i-Kh\u0101ni occur as one of them; nor, indeed, has any name been handed down which would connect the city of any period with Shaib\u0101ni Kh\u0101n. Mr. O'Donovan, it is true, mentions\u00b9 the existence of an ancient mound called Marma Kh\u0101n Tepe, some five miles to the north-east of the present Marv (Konshid Kh\u0101n Kala), where the local Turkomans told him that \"a town of large dimensions\" had once existed, but they gave, apparently, no indication of a date. I cannot find (from Turkomans in Meshed) that these remains are in any way connected with Muhammad Shaib\u0101ni, but the name Marma is said to be a Turkoman corruption of Muhammad; so that there is just an odd chance that it is after Muhammad Shaib\u0101ni Kh\u0101n that they are called. This, however, is mere conjecture; but it may be remarked that it would be considered good style, by the writer of an inscription, to indicate a town named after his hero by some pseudonym or flattering figure of speech rather than by his personal name. Thus, Y\u0101dg\u0101r-i-Kh\u0101ni, or \"Memorial of the Kh\u0101n,\" would be regarded as more graceful than (in this instance) Muhammad\u0101b\u0101d, or Qala-i-Muhammad Kh\u0101n, etc.\u2014its obscurity notwithstanding.\n\nMirza Haidar is distinct in telling us that Shaib\u0101ni's force returned from the place where they were routed to Samarkand, and I take the statement to mean that Shaib\u0101ni retired with them to the capital, and thence went on to Khor\u0101s\u0101n. It is, however, just possible to read that he himself went on to Khor\u0101s\u0101n, while his men fled to\n\n\u00b9 \"The Merv Oasis,\" vol. ii, p. 237.\nSamarkand. I prefer the former reading: and in that case Y\u0101dg\u0101r-i-Kh\u0101ni should either be some local or temporary designation for Samarkand, or it might represent some suburb of it, or some group of buildings which Shaib\u0101ni, during his few years of power, had caused to be erected, or had become identified with.\\(^1\\) From here it is quite probable that he may have gone on to the hills near Panj-Mana. As against this view, all we have is the record of the inscription that on returning from Ulugh T\u0101gh, its hero marched his captives to some capital which may have been Khiva, and afterwards \"arrived at the suburbs of Y\u0101dg\u0101r-i-Kh\u0101ni.\" It is most unlikely that he should have travelled first to Khiva and afterwards to Samarkand, but it is quite permissible to read that he \"caused his prisoners to be marched\"\\(^2\\) to D\u0101r-ul-Isl\u0101m, while he may not have accompanied them. Still, as we know that, being in full flight before his enemy, he could have had no prisoners, and that the whole tenour of the story in the inscription is misleading, it seems scarcely necessary to give much heed to any particular statement it contains, unless perhaps the mere movements and dates. The plain story of the Moghul author is, it seems to me, far more likely to be correct.\n\nKhw\u0101ndam\u012br's brief account affords no help in identifying Y\u0101dg\u0101r-i-Kh\u0101ni. It points only to Shaib\u0101ni having returned, after his disastrous expedition against Q\u0101sim Sult\u0101n, to some place in Khor\u0101s\u0101n. But Khor\u0101s\u0101n in those days extended much farther eastward than its present limits, and included Herat (which was the capital) and Marv, besides the hill ranges among which R\u0101dk\u0101n and Panj-Mana are situated. Nothing is said as to whether he returned direct to Khor\u0101s\u0101n or not.\n\nNeither does Mirza Haidar give any indication of the particular locality in Khor\u0101s\u0101n to which Shaib\u0101ni betook himself after passing on from Samarkand. He is, however,\n\n\\(^1\\) If this were so, the \"Shaib\u0101ni N\u0101ma\" might be supposed to contain the name, but it does not.\n\n\\(^2\\) The verb used is k\u016bch\u0101nidan.\nsomewhat more explicit in another way than the author of the \u1e24abib-us-Siyar, for he records certain dates which may be usefully compared with those in the inscription. He tells us that when the Usbegs went forward to invade the Kaz\u0101k territory, Shaib\u0101ni himself remained at a spot called Kuk Kash\u0101na, not far from which the rout of his troops would seem to have occurred, but it is a place which, unfortunately, I can find no means of identifying. The name would mean, in Turki, \u201cBlue house\u201d or \u201cBlue palace,\u201d and it must, to judge from the context, have lain somewhere between the southern extremity of the Ulugh T\u0101gh and Samarkand. He also relates, as we have seen, that Shaib\u0101ni passed on from the latter place to Khor\u0101s\u0101n, where he spent the spring or summer. From this last indication, and from Khw\u0101ndam\u012br\u2019s statement that the Usbeg chief was in the habit of passing the spring in the pastures near R\u0101dk\u0101n, it seems probable that he retired after his defeat to the Ulang, or \u201chill grazing ground,\u201d near the spot where the inscription was cut, and that its date would then be the spring, or early summer, of 1510. The small town of R\u0101dk\u0101n is some forty miles from the site of the inscription, but it is the nearest place of any importance, while the grazing grounds for many miles around might easily be alluded to by a general historian, like Khw\u0101ndam\u012br, under the name of the nearest known town.\n\nFor the rest, we may infer from the dates that the movements here ascribed to the Usbeg chief are possible ones, and it may be imagined with reason that during his leisure in his hill retreat he sought to obliterate the memory of his defeat by erecting a monument which should hand down the event to posterity in the light of a victory. The dates in the inscription are the one thing contained in it that have the appearance of accuracy, and they agree fairly with Mirza Haidar\u2019s indications of seasons. The day of departure, 2 Shaww\u0101l 915, fell on the 12th January, 1510, and the date of return, 22 Safar 916, occurred on the 30th May, 1510; while the Mirza tells us that Shaib\u0101ni started\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nfor the Kaz\u0101k country in the winter, that the retreat to Samarkand took place at the end of the winter, and that the chief himself then went on to Khor\u0101s\u0101n to spend the spring (or summer) before setting out anew against the Haz\u0101ras. As movements were carried out in those days, there would have been ample time to execute those assumed between the dates mentioned; and the late spring would naturally be the season when an inhabitant of Central Asia would seek the hills\u2014both for his own sake and for that of his cattle.\n\nIt is perhaps strange that no very definite tradition is current among the inhabitants of Panj-Mana and the neighbouring villages to account for the inscribed rock, which must have been familiar to them and their ancestors for generations past. No one round about seems to be acquainted with the purport of the inscription, and the only legend they are in the habit of attaching to it is that an unknown king, on advancing to fight the \"infidels,\" while a certain star was facing him, sustained a defeat, and returned to this spot, where he caused the inscription to be cut as a warning to others not to start on any expedition with this particular star in front.\n\nP.S.\u2014Since the above was in type Mr. Ney Elias has sent a photograph of the hill-side where the inscription was found, with the following note:\n\n\"It is taken by Dr. A. L. Duke. The stone itself is too far off and too high up from the camera to show the inscription properly, but it can be vaguely made out on the face of the stone. The block, Duke tells me, is about seven feet high, nearly as broad, and very thick; in fact, quite immovable without appliances.

XIX.\u2014Note on the Panjmana Inscription sent by Mr. Ney Elias. By H. Beveridge, M.R.A.S.\n\nThe inscription is an interesting one, and well deserves publication in our Journal. It records a march by Shaib\u0101n\u012b to the Kirghiz Steppe, and a victory which he gained over the inhabitants at Kindilik in the Ulugh T\u0101gh country. He began his march from Merv-Shahij\u0101n on 2 Shaww\u0101l, 915 (13 January, 1510), and returned after four months and twenty days on 22 \u1e62afar, 916 (1 June, 1510). Mr. Elias considers that the inscription is false and that the so-called victory was a defeat, and he quotes in support of this view the \u1e24ab\u012bb-as-Siyar and the T\u0101rikh-i-Rash\u012bd\u012b. But surely a contemporary inscription is better authority than two books\u2014one by a compiler and the other by an enemy\u2014and, moreover, the latter are not, I think, absolutely contradictory of the inscription. Shaib\u0101n\u012b was apparently at first successful over the people of the Dasht-i-Kipch\u0101k, though he, or at least his son, was eventually defeated by them, and I take the inscription to refer to the initial victory. That some such victory did occur, seems to be admitted by Haidar Mirza. At p. 230 (Ross\u2019s translation) we read: \u201cIn the middle of the winter, Sh\u0101hi Beg Khan was engaged in plundering on every side, but he soon returned, his object being not to remain too far from his own country.\u201d I think this must be the expedition commemorated in the inscription. That begun in the middle of winter (13 January, 1510), and was characterized by wondrous rapidity of movement, as the inscription tells us. It was thus soon over, as Haidar tells us, and had the natural effect of knocking up Shaib\u0101n\u012b\u2019s men and horses, and so leading to the\nsubsequent crushing defeat. It must be remembered that Haidar Mirza was an enemy of Shaib\u0101n\u012b, who put his father to death and sent orders for the killing of Haidar, though the latter was but a boy\u2014\"had only just passed the half of my childhood\" (p. 210). It is natural, therefore, that Haidar should represent all Shaib\u0101n\u012b's acts in the worst light. Moreover, though Haidar was a contemporary, he was far away from Shaib\u0101n\u012b and Dasht-i-Kipch\u0101k at the time, being with his cousin Babar in Kabul. Accounts of Shaib\u0101n\u012b may be read in Erskine's \"Babar,\" p. 238, and Kh\u0101fi Khan, \"Brit. Ind.,\" ed. i, 39. In his \"History of India,\" i, 296, Erskine follows the T\u0101rikh-i-Rashidi and gives the passage quoted by Mr. Elias. But the best account that I have seen of Shaib\u0101n\u012b is in Vamb\u00e9ry's \"History of Bokhara.\" He mentions the defeat described in the \u1e24ab\u012bb-as-Siyar and T\u0101rikh-i-Rashidi, but he puts it later than they do, making it contemporary with Shah Ismail of Persia's advance on Meshed. At p. 268 he says: \"Shaib\u0101n\u012b was prevented from continuing his march southwards by the revolt of the Firozkuhi, a people haunting the peaks of steep rocks, and was making vain efforts to subdue them, when he received the intelligence that Shah Ismail was actually advancing on Meshed with a large army. To his great disgust and alarm news arrived at the same time from Transoxiana that his son, Muhammad Timur, had been surprised on his march against the Kirghiz on the Yaxartes by Buyunsoz Hasan, and terribly defeated. Thus the brave arm and searching eye of Shaib\u0101n\u012b were needed in three places at once. In addition to this, his own troops were exhausted and worn out by long marches.\" If this be correct, the defeat of Shaib\u0101n\u012b's troops by the Kirghiz was in October or November, 1510, and so several months after the expedition referred to in the Panjmana inscription; for Shah Ismail's march upon Merv and his defeat of Shaib\u0101n\u012b occurred in Shab\u0101n and Ramz\u0101n, 916, or November-December, 1510. This appears from the continuation of the passage from the \u1e24ab\u012bb-as-Siyar quoted by Mr. Ney Elias. After saying that Shaib\u0101n\u012b could do nothing against\nthe Haz\u0101ras, the \u1e24ab\u012bb goes on to say that Shaib\u0101n\u012b went to Herat in the beginning of Shab\u0101n (about 4th November), and was recruiting himself from his fatigues in the gardens there when he heard of Shah Ismail\u2019s approach. And at p. 234 of Mr. Denison Ross\u2019s translation of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Rash\u012bd\u012b we learn that it was in the following month of Ramz\u0101n that Shaib\u0101n\u012b marched out to encounter Shah-Ismail. The exact date of his defeat and death is not given by Vamb\u00e9ry, but he says the day was a Friday; being in Ramz\u0101n, the month must have been December.\n\nIt will be noticed that the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Rash\u012bd\u012b does not speak of Shaib\u0101n\u012b having been personally defeated by the Kirghizes. This agrees with Vamb\u00e9ry\u2019s statement that it was Shaib\u0101n\u012b\u2019s son, and not Shaib\u0101n\u012b himself, who was defeated, and also differentiates the affair from the expedition recorded in the Panjmana inscription. I submit, too, that Vamb\u00e9ry\u2019s account agrees much better with probabilities than do the two statements quoted by Mr. Elias. If Shaib\u0101n\u012b were really defeated and routed by the Kirghizes in the spring of 915, it is not likely that he would have inclination or strength immediately to set about another expedition, viz. that against the Haz\u0101ras or Firuzkuhis.\n\nAs regards the Y\u0101dg\u0101r Kh\u0101n\u012b mentioned in the inscription, it was perhaps some palace or pleasure-house erected by Shaib\u0101n\u012b, rather than a town, though called a shahr in the inscription. It may, as Mr. Elias suggests, be a synonym for some such town as Mu\u1e25ammad\u0101bad, which Shaib\u0101n\u012b may have founded. In Reclus\u2019s Map of Western Asia, \u201cGeog.,\u201d vol. ix, we find a Mu\u1e25ammad\u0101bad north of R\u0101dk\u0101n, but according to Colonel Napier (Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society for 1876, p. 166) the proper name of it is Mu\u1e25ammadb\u0101gh. This title agrees better with the idea of a pleasure-house, and\n\n---\n\n1 The passage may be seen in two MSS. in the British Museum, Add. 17,925, p. 463b, and Add. 16,679, p. 366b; also in the Teheran lithograph of 1271 A.H., vol. iii, p. 316, near top, and in lithograph of Raugat-as-Safa, vol. vii, p. 96.\n\n2 Erskine gives 2 December as the date.\u2014\u201cHistory,\u201d i, 306. See also T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Rash\u012bd\u012b, p. 226.\nit is just possible that the word *shahr* may not refer to Y\u0101dg\u0101r Kh\u0101n\u012b, and that the preposition *ba* has slipped out before the latter word. We might then read that Shaib\u0101n\u012b arrived at the environs of the city (R\u0101dk\u0101n?) at the Y\u0101dg\u0101r Kh\u0101n\u012b, which had been constructed by the genius of his architect. It may thus be that Y\u0101dg\u0101r Kh\u0101n\u012b is a synonym for the Kuk K\u0101sh\u0101na of Haidar Mirza. This does not appear to be a town, and Mr. Elias suggests that it may mean Blue Palace (or Heavenly Palace). One of the B.M. MSS. has Kuruk K\u0101sh\u0101na, and Mr. Erskine has read it so, and translated it as \"winter-quarters\" (*vide* B.M. MS. Add. 26,612, p. 208). This, no doubt, may be one of the meanings of K\u0101sh\u0101na, but etymologically it means, according to Vullers, a house furnished with mirrors. That the place Shaib\u0101n\u012b returned to from his expedition was R\u0101dk\u0101n, or Raik\u0101n, and not Merv, seems suggested by the site of the inscription, and also by the statement in the Hab\u012bb-as-Siyar that Shaib\u0101n\u012b used to make R\u0101dk\u0101n his summer-quarters. This is corroborated by the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Rash\u012bd\u012b, which states, p. 162, that in 914 (1509) Shaib\u0101n\u012b was at Ulung-R\u0101dk\u0101n, i.e. the pasturage grounds of R\u0101dk\u0101n. (Mr. Ross has written this name as Ulung-Z\u0101dag\u0101n, in accordance, apparently, with B.M. MS. Or. 157, p. 114; but in 24,090, p. 100b, it is clearly Ulung-R\u0101dk\u0101n, and there can be little doubt this is the correct reading.)\n\nIt is, however, quite possible that the place meant is Merv, as suggested by Mr. Elias, and certainly the epithet Shahr, or city, is more appropriate to Merv than to a small town like R\u0101dk\u0101n, which, moreover, is forty miles from the site of the inscription. We know that there was a Muhammad\u0101bad near Merv, for it was there that Shaib\u0101n\u012b was defeated and killed (Erskine's History, i, 303). Another possibility is that Y\u0101dg\u0101r Kh\u0101n\u012b may be a synonym for\n\n---\n\n1 While on the subject of readings, I may note that the number of Shaib\u0101n\u012b's soldiers given at p. 230 of Ross's translation as 20,000 is 200,000 in all the MSS., and has been so stated by Erskine. The expedition, then, was on a very large scale.\nHerat, or be some place in its neighbourhood. There was a Y\u0101dg\u0101r Khan or Mirza, a great-grandson of Shahr\u016bkh, who killed Abu Sa'id, and used to live in great luxury at the B\u0101gh-i-Z\u0101gh\u0101n, or Raven's Garden at Herat, and was put to death there in August, 1470. Herat, or some place in its neighbourhood, may have been styled Y\u0101dg\u0101r Kh\u0101n\u012b in compliment to him. We know also from the T\u0101rikh-i-Rashidi, p. 231, and the \u1e24abib-as-Siyar, that it was to Herat that Shaib\u0101n\u012b retired after the Haz\u0101ra expedition, but was obliged to leave it soon afterwards on account of the approach of Shah Ismail.\n\nI think that we are all much indebted to Colonel Napier for the discovery of this important inscription, and to Mr. Ney Elias for his obtaining a copy of it and sending it to us, and also for his valuable and interesting note. I do not think, however, that we need take the extreme view of supposing that Shaib\u0101n\u012b was so false as to represent a defeat as a victory. It is not likely that after his son had been defeated by the Kirghizes he would be in the mood for engraving inscriptions. My point is that there were two campaigns in 915-6 against the Kirghizes\u2014one in the winter or spring, and another at the end of autumn. In the first Shaib\u0101n\u012b was successful. He had a large army of 200,000 men, and he marched with great rapidity. In the second, his son was in command and was defeated. Muhammad Haidar has, I think, to some extent mixed up these two campaigns in his narration. Even his own account shows that Shaib\u0101n\u012b was at first victorious, and that on the second occasion, too, there was some plunder obtained and some prisoners taken. These may be the prisoners referred to in the inscription.\n\nThe following extract from Curzon's \"Persia\" will be found interesting:\u2014\"On the way we pass a mighty lump of sheer rock, perched upon the top of a thousand-feet slope, and known as the Kuh-i-Panjmana or Five-man (=about 32lb.) Mountain, from a story about a facetious monarch who invited one of his courtiers to weigh the airy trifle. A little further, on the left hand, is an Arabic and Persian\ninscription upon the smoothed surface of a big limestone block, some twenty feet above the path, which records a victory of Shai'b\u0101n\u012b Mohammed Khan, the Usbeg conqueror of Bokhara, over the Persian unbelievers in the year of the Hejra 916. We then came to a little village, the name of which was pronounced to me as Hark (or Whark), where I found an agreeable shade in an orchard sloping down to the stream.\" (Vol. i, 141.)\n\nCurzon was then marching to K\u0101rdeh, on his way back from Kel\u0101t-i-Nadiri to Meshed. The stone is on the way from Vardeh to K\u0101rdeh, which two places are seven farsakhs, or about twenty-six miles, apart. Curzon saw the inscription on 20th October, 1889.\nART. XX.\u2014An Inscription of Madanap\u0101ladeva of Kanauj.\n\nBy C. Bendall.\n\nA copper-plate, closely similar to one existing at Calcutta, and successively published by Dr. F. Hall (J.A.S.B., xxvii, 220) and Prof. Kielhorn (Ind. Ant., xviii, 9), has recently come under my notice. It measures 1' 4\" high by 1' 6\" broad, and has a hole for a ring at the top and the raised rim described by Dr. Kielhorn, l.c. The plate is at present at Messrs. Terry and Co.'s, of 29, Glasshouse Street, London, W. It is for sale, and I understand from them that it has previously been in the hands of a family in the South of England for about a century.\n\nThe language of the grant follows closely that of the above-mentioned grant. The date is thus expressed (l. 12):\n\nTri-\u015ba\u1e63\u1e6dy-adhika\u015bataikada\u015ba-samvatsare pau\u1e63e m\u0101si k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pak\u1e63e am\u0101v\u0101sy\u0101\u1e41 somadine s\u016bryagraha\u1e47e.\n\nThis eclipse will not work out correctly, and Prof. Kielhorn, to whom the difficulty was referred by Mr. Sewell (who had received it from me), writes\u2014\n\n\"There can be no doubt whatever that 1163 is a mistake for 1164, and the date regularly corresponds to Monday, 16 Dec., A.D. 1107, with a sol. eclipse, visible at Kanauj; greatest phase 11 digits.\"\n\nThe person who performed the ceremonial bathing was the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u00f1\u012b \u015ar\u012b Prithvi\u015br\u012bk\u0101 at \u0100dikesava-gha\u1e6d\u1e6da, Benares.

For the curious \u0101... h\u016bhuk\u0101ntam y\u0101ra\u00b0 of the Calcutta plate (l. 15), our inscription reads simply \u0101candr\u0101rrkam y\u0101ra\u00b0. After the end of the imprecatious the subscription, likhitam kara\u1e47ika\u00b0, immediately follows. The grant is therefore one of Madanap\u0101la himself (presumably after his father's death), executed through his queen.\nArt. XXI.\u2014On a system of Letter-numerals used in South India. By Cecil Bendall.\n\nI trust that English readers will have before them ere long a full account of the very important \"Encyclopaedia of Indian Research\" (Grundriss der Indo-Arischen Philologie), at present in course of publication by K. Tr\u00fcbner of Strassburg, under the editorship of Dr. B\u00fchler. A copy of the editor's own extremely weighty contribution on \"Indische Palaeographie\" has, together with its accompanying set of excellent plates, reached me by the author's kindness. At his request I now draw attention to an omission in his chapter on the denotation of numerals (VI. Zahlenbezeichnung, pp. 73\u201383).\n\nOne of the systems for numeration in India is syllabic (ak\u1e63arapalli), as contrasted with the ordinary decimal system (a\u1e45kapalli). The main features of these systems have been often explained (Ind. Ant., vi, pp. 42, 143; Burnell, \"South Indian Palaeography,\" ed. ii, p. 65; and an article by the late Sir E. C. Bayley in our own Journal, n.s., vols. xiv, xv), but the origin of the syllabic notation still remains obscure, as Dr. B\u00fchler (who has changed his views on the general subject) admits (op. cit., p. 78). He traces it (p. 74) down to the sixteenth century only. This being so, it is well worth pointing out that in Malabar, a part of India already identified with curious survivals of ancient usage, the syllabic system has been used within the present century, and possibly is still known.\n\nThe silence of the writers of Malayalam grammars for Europeans, from R. Drummond (1799) to L. J. Frohnmeyer (1889), need not surprise us. They are mere practical manuals, the last-named writer (pref., p. v) expressly disclaiming any provision for the needs of\n\"students of Comparative Philology.\" What is curious is, that Burnell knew nothing of the system; for in his great work already cited, after discussing the syllabic system, he observes (p. 67) that he has not met with any examples in South India later than the fifth century A.D. In the \"Grammar of the Malayalam Language,\" however, by H. Gundert (2nd ed., Mangalore, 1868), written for native students in Malayalam, with section-headings only in English, the following list is given (\u00a7 148a, pp. 41-2):\n\n|   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 3 | na |\n| 2 | 3 | nna |\n| 3 | 3 | nya |\n| 4 | 3 | skra |\n| 5 | 3 | jhra |\n| 6 | 3 | (MS.) h\u0101 (ha) |\n| 7 | 3 | gra |\n| 8 | 3 | pra |\n| 9 | 3 | dre (?) |\n\n|   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|\n| 10 | 3 | ma |\n| 20 | 3 | tha |\n| 30 | 3 | la |\n| 40 | 3 | pta |\n| 50 | 3 | ba |\n| 60 | 3 | tra |\n| 70 | 3 | (MS.) r\u016b (tru) |\n| 80 | 3 | ca |\n| 90 | 3 | \u1e47a. |\n\nThe British Museum (Add. 7,134) possesses a Sanskrit MS. (of the drama Anarghar\u0101ghava) written in Malayalam character, and bearing leaf-numbering on the above system. It is undated, but from its appearance it may well have been written shortly before the year it was presented to the Museum, 1829.\n\nThe forms for 1\u20133 (na, nna, nya) are peculiar to this system. They are not, however, borrowed from the ordinary decimal figures.\n\n4 is not \u1e47ka, but skra. Compare Bhagavanl\u0101l in Ind. Ant., vi, p. 44, col. 9, and p. 46 (ska). There is perhaps an r-sign in B\u00fchler's Tafel ix, col. 9, No. 4.\nFor $5=jhra$, a curious combination, it is not so easy to find a parallel, owing to the rarity of $jha$ even as a simple letter. The resemblance, however, between some of the K\u1e63atrapa forms of 5 and the contemporary forms of $jha$ (B\u00fchler, Tafel iii, line 14) is enough to account for the confusion or misreading.\n\nFor $6=ha$ (Gundert) our MS. has simply $ha$. Both are doubtless derived from a form $pha$, the characters of these letters being very similar in Malayalam ($\\alpha \\phi \\alpha ha$).\n\n$7=gra$; agrees with the results given by B\u00fchler, p. 75.\n\n$8=pra$. Here $\\epsilon$ is doubtless a misreading for $hra$ $\\epsilon$. In many of the early alphabets the resemblance between $pa$ and $ha$ is considerable.\n\n9. I take this to be an old form of $o$, though at present it looks like $dre$. I am not sure that some of the Nepalese forms of 9 given in my Cambridge Catalogue (\"Table of Letter-numerals\") do not show an analogous corruption.\n\n$10=ma$ is somewhat difficult to explain. B\u00fchler explains the earlier forms as $=th\u016b$. The modern Mal. forms of $thu$ $th\u016b$ ($\\Omega \\Omega$) are not specially like $ma$ $\\alpha$. Is it possible that the $ma$ arose from an identification of the early forms $\\Omega$, etc., with an $m$ ($\\delta \\times$, etc.) laid on its side?\n\n$20 tha$, $30 la$, $40 pta$ present no difficulty.\n\n$50=ba$. I cannot suggest an explanation.\n\n$60 tra$ and $70 tru$ (MS. form) are also obscure. They may rest on a misreading of some of the earlier cursive signs (B\u00fchler, Tafel ix, cols. 3-11). Compare also some of the K\u1e63atrapa symbols (Bhagavanl\u0101l in Ind. Ant., l.c.), in which the mutual relation of the two signs is much like that of the two before us. Gundert's $\\epsilon r\u016b$ is doubtless a secondary confusion from the form in the MS.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nThe signs for 80 (ca) and 90 (na) could probably be explained if we knew how the pandits of Malabar write Upadhmaniya (the labial sibilant disused in literature, but often found in inscriptions). It will be interesting to note whether any reader in the \"Benighted\" Presidency takes enough interest in the matter to obtain for us this information. It may be noted that signs for ca, not only in Mal. (26), but also in some of the earlier Grantha alphabets (Burnell, \"South Indian Palaeography,\" plates xiii, xiv), bear some resemblance to the \"80\" of B\u00fchler's Table, cols. 17, 18.\n\n100 = na. The character \u03c3\u03bd\u03b1 somewhat resembles \u03c3\u03bd\u03bf \u0391.\n\nI may note in conclusion that the ordinary leaf-numbering of MSS. from Malabar is in accordance with a system also unknown to Burnell as regards that country, but described by him (\"South Indian Palaeography,\" p. 68) for Tamil documents only. As he notes, the system is interesting as forming a middle stage between the ak\u1e63ara-palli and the ordinary decimal notation. Gundert (supra cit.) gives all three systems. J. Peet, in his grammar written in 1860, gives the two last, stating (p. 95) that the decimal system was \"introduced by Europeans\"; but in the \"Outlines of Grammar,\" published by F. Spring in 1839, only the decimal system is given.\n\nThe Sinhalese, as my friend Vikramasimha reminds me, have also an ak\u1e63ara-system. This might, no doubt, be easily worked out from the earlier Sinhalese epigraphy. I note, in passing, the forms of 4, 7, and 30, which appear to correspond to forms of nika, gra, and la respectively.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. \"Shah Daulah's Rats.\"\n\nRugby,\nJuly 24, 1896.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014\"Shah Daulah's Rats\" are alluded to in North Indian Notes and Queries, v, \u00a7311. \"Shah Daulah cures barrenness. . . .

Rouse.\n\n2. \"Antiquity of Eastern Falconry.\"\n\nSir,\u2014I should be much obliged to any member or correspondent who can inform me of any Oriental authority for the use of trained falcons in the East before the first century A.D. The modern falconers are apparently inclined\nto claim a great antiquity for that diversion; and certainly\nthe stage of civilization favourable to falconry is very\nancient; and there is no \"antecedent improbability\" in\nthe matter. But the positive evidence seems to be poor.\n\nThat most commonly quoted is a very doubtful note\nof the late Sir Austen Layard's, in \"Nineveh and Babylon\"\n(p. 483, note, ed. 1853). It is not repeated in the\nabridgment of 1882, and he does not seem to have attached\nmuch importance to it, though an amateur of falconry\nhimself, and holding it as \"probably of the highest\nantiquity\" (loc. cit.). He says, \"A falconer bearing a hawk\non his wrist appeared to be represented in a bas-relief which\nI saw at Khorsabad.\" Bonomi (\"Nineveh and its Palaces,\"\n3rd edition, p. 202) has an equally doubtful identification\nof a falcon on the wing, in a hunting scene from the same\nplace. But there seems to be no reference to falconry in\nthat region in any ancient writer, though one would expect\nit, if practised, to have been mentioned by the Hebrews\nof the Captivity, by Herodotus, Xenophon (himself a\nsportsman), Aristotle, or some of the subsequent Greek\nand Roman writers\u2014people whose nations knew more of\nMesopotamia than our grandfathers did of the Panjab\nand Sind.\n\nAristotle, indeed, mentions wild hawks (or what he\nsupposed to be such) as assisting fowlers in Thrace\n(\"History of Animals,\" book ix, chap. xxiv). And this\nstory is borrowed from him in the first century A.D. by\nPliny (\"Nat. Hist.,\" x, 8), and from one or both of them\nby Aelian in the second (\"De Nat. Animal,\" ii, 42), who\nalso mentions tame sacred hawks in a temple \"of Apollo\nin Egypt.\" Neither speaks on his own authority. But,\nafter Pliny and before Aelian, Martial undoubtedly\nmentions the use of a hawk, which had been caught wild,\nin the 216th Epigram of the fourteenth book, which was\nwritten\u2014or, at least, published\u2014in Spain, very early in the\nsecond century A.D. He must have observed the practice\nin Spain, for he travelled only to Italy, where it could\nnot have escaped Pliny and Aelian.\nThe next notice is said to be in the writings of Julius Firmicus (fourth century A.D.), which are not available to me.\n\nIn the sixth verse of the fifth Sura of the Kur\u0101n, \"The Table,\" there is a passage authorizing, as it is read by Musalmans to-day, the use of prey taken by \"wild creatures ('jawarih')\"\u00b9 which ye have trained like dogs, teaching them as God hath taught you.\" A Musalman scholar whom I have consulted assures me that the inclusion of falconry in this permission is universally admitted to be based on a tradition of the Prophet himself, which brings it back, in Arabia, to the early years of the Hijra (the fifth Sura was revealed at Medina), and by implication to the end of the sixth century, as the practice must have been general and well known to require notice.\u00b2\n\n\"E. D. R.,\" writing in the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" (1879), speaks of falconry as recorded by \"very ancient Egyptian carvings and paintings,\" as \"known in China some 2,000 years B.C.\"; and in high favour in the days of \"Wen Wang, who reigned over a province of that country in 689 B.C.\" This writer is known as a past master in modern falconry, but hardly as an authority on Egyptian or Chinese archaeology, and I beg for a reference from any of our members skilled in those branches of history. Search in the Assyrian rooms at the British Museum has brought nothing to light, though I was favoured by the courteous assistance of Mr. Wallis Budge. I need only add that positive evidence would be as welcome to me as negative.\n\n\u00b9 Rodwell translates \"wild beasts\"; Sale, and my friend, \"animals of prey.\" My friend adds that chitae are also classed, on the same authority, under the passage quoted, and that the Shah Nama contains many references to falconry. Firdusi, however, is not an admissible witness for days much older than his own, any more than Shakspere for firearms in Hamlet's Denmark and Macbeth's Scotland.\n\n\u00b2 Since the above was written, one of our own members has favoured me with some references to mention of Falconry (gyain\u0101mp\u0101ta) by P\u0101\u1e47ini (vi. s. 71), and later Sanskrit authority; and a distinguished Hindu scholar with a quotation from Manu. The true date of the Dharma-shastra has been so much disputed that I do not feel entitled to rely on it in this case. But I suppose one is pretty safe in taking P\u0101\u1e47ini for older authority than Aristotle; if not than \"Wen Wang's\" historian.\nI have not a thesis to prove, and there is no reason why any race of men who had learnt to train the horse and hound, and to use metals, should not have learnt falconry next (the condition of modern savages seems to show that these are earlier stages in civilization).

We hope to review this in our next number.\n\nThe Abb\u00e9 Dubois.\u2014Mr. Henry K. Beauchamp, of Madras, will see through the Press his complete translation of the historical writings of the Abb\u00e9 Dubois, whose condensed works, though bristling with faults, have enjoyed a great popularity among English students of Hinduism. Dubois was a French missionary, who laboured for upwards of thirty years in Southern India. On reaching India shortly before the close of the last century, he was attached to the Pondicherry Mission; and for the first few years he seems to have laboured in Mysore, and in what are now the southern districts of the Madras Presidency. He must have quickly made for himself a name, for on the fall of Seringapatam he was specially invited, on the recommendation, it is said, of Colonel Wellesley, afterwards Duke of Wellington, to come to the capital of Mysore to reconvert and reorganize the Christian community, who had been forcibly perverted to Mahomedanism by Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n. So enthusiastic was he in his work that he lived in close\nand familiar intercourse with persons of every caste and condition of life. What they said he noted down, and when he placed his writings in the hands of a representative of the Government of Fort St. George it was pronounced to be the most correct, comprehensive, and minute account extant in any European language of the customs and manners of the Hindus. Sixteen years later the Abb\u00e9 wrote a second edition of his work, but notwithstanding its immeasurable superiority to the first it had lain among the records in Fort St. George for three-quarters of a century, until three years ago Mr. Beauchamp, when looking through the French MSS. in the Madras Government records, discovered it. According to Mr. Beauchamp, when the first MS. was revised in 1815 the Abb\u00e9 put into it all the corrections and additions suggested by additional study and investigation; and when he returned the work to the Government of Madras it was, practically speaking, a different work altogether. On receipt of the revised MS., the Government of Madras decided that the only course open to them was to send it to the Court of Directors in England, as the original MS. had been. Unfortunately, however, before the revised MS. could reach England the original MS. had been translated and published; and it is this edition which has been sold ever since, and upon which the Abb\u00e9\u2019s reputation has rested. If the faulty edition has been so widely consulted and so frequently extolled, how infinitely more valuable, remarks Mr. Beauchamp, a correct edition would be. And this desideratum he set himself to supply. As a result of much patient labour, Mr. Beauchamp has it now ready for publication.\n\nDerivation of Sabbath.\u2014In the April number of the Journal, p. 353, Dr. Hirschfeld said that Professor Ed. K\u00f6nig, in the \u201cLehrgeb\u00e4ude der Hebr\u00e4ischen Sprache,\u201d Bd. ii, 1895, p. 180 sq., derived the word \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea from \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9 \u0161ibbat-t. But Professor Ed. K\u00f6nig draws our attention to the fact that he, like Kim\u1e25i and Olshausen, has derived the word \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea from \u0161abbat-t.\nBuddhist Theory of the Nid\u0101nas.\u2014M. \u00c9mile Senart has devoted an article in the \"M\u00e9langes Charles de Harlez,\" pp. 281\u201397, to the discussion of this question, wherein he makes special reference to the article in our Journal for 1894. The discussion is characterized by the author's well-known acumen, and arrives at the conclusions that the theory of the Wheel of Life, though ancient, does not belong, in its present form, to the original Buddhism; that throughout, in Buddhism, philosophy is only secondary to ethics, and that this so-called chain of causes grew up gradually, not as the outcome of well thought-out speculation, but by the confused re-grouping of terms originally ethical; that it is borrowed in part from other classifications, now only to be traced in the S\u0101\u1e45khya and Yoga systems; and that the phraseology in which we now have it has also suffered confusion from the various dialects in which the technical terms have been handed down. But it is impossible, without quoting the whole article, to do justice to the arguments by which these conclusions are reached. Members interested in Dr. Waddell's 1894 article should consult this very suggestive brochure by our distinguished Honorary Member.\n\nMuhammadan Religion.\u2014Under the title of \"The Preaching of Islam,\" Mr. T. W. Arnold will publish immediately a work on the history of the spread of this religion by missionary methods. The book is intended as a contribution to this neglected department of Muhammadan religious history, and ranges over the whole field of Muhammadan history so far as the missionary activity of Islam is concerned, in all the countries into which this faith has penetrated.\n\nRosaries in Ceylon.\u2014The Ceylon Observer of August 10 reprints Dr. Waddell's article on this subject from our last number, and adds the following note:\n\n\"The chronicler of Spilbergen's visit to Ceylon in 1602, in describing the town of Vintane (Bintenna or Alutnawara), says:\n\n\"'There are yet other pagodes, and also a monastery,'\nwherein are monks clad in yellow cloths, who go along the streets with great sombareros; some have slaves with them who carry the sombareros and serve them. They are clean-shaven in the manner of the monks in this country, only that one sees no corona there. They also go with paternosters in the hand muttering or reading.'\n\n\"Baldaeus, in his work on Ceylon, has taken over Spilbergen's chronicler's description; and the English translator of Baldaeus renders paternosters by 'beads.' The veracious Captain Robert Knox, writing some eighty years later, says, in his 'Historical Relation' (p. 86), in describing the religious practices of the Sinhalese:\u2014'They carry beads in their hands on strings, and say so many prayers as they go, which custom in all probability they borrowed of the Portuguese.'\u2014D. F.\" The inference is, of course, erroneous, as shown by the statements in Dr. Waddell's letter.\n\nProfessor Deussen, of Kiel, having published two years ago the first volume of his \"Allgemeine Geschichte der Philosophie\" (containing the General Introduction and the Philosophy of the Veda to the Upanishads), will, in a month or two, issue his \"Translation of the Upanishads,\" each chapter of which will be preceded by a short introduction and accompanied by explanatory notes. The work will contain all the Upanishads of the three older Vedas, and all those of the Atharva Upanishads, which appear regularly in the chief collections and lists of the Upanishads, and thus seem entitled to a certain canonical authority. The volume will contain, in all, sixty Upanishads. The introductions aim, for the first time, at giving for each Upanishad, or part of it, a short critical analysis, showing the tendency of the author, the growth of his ideas from preceding, and their influence on succeeding, texts. Many passages which hitherto seemed paradoxical, or even unintelligible, appearing now in their natural light, become quite clear, and show at once their connection with, and their place in, the general development of Vedantic thought.\nOn the other hand, these analyses raise a great number of problems hitherto unnoticed and needing further discussion, so that a wide field of attractive and fruitful labour will be open to those interested in the growth of the religious and philosophical ideas of India.\n\nPHILOLOGY NOTES FOR 1896.\n\nA. Asiatic Languages.\nB. African Languages.\nC. Oceanic Languages.\n\nA. Asiatic.\n\nI. \"Vedische Beitr\u00e4ge\": Journal of Akademie der Wissenschaften in Berlin, 1896, xiii. Prof. Albrecht Weber in his old age has made this contribution to our knowledge of the Veda, and dedicated it to his life friend, Dr. Reinhold Rost, whose loss is deplored by us all. The treatise is highly scientific, and beyond the understanding of the ordinary reader, but to those, who study the Veda, it will prove of great value.\n\nII. On the occasion of his assuming the office of Rector of the University of Leipzig, Prof. Windisch delivered a luminous oration on \"The Importance of the Study of Ancient India.\" He passed under review the results of the study in late years of Indian Literature and Archaeology, not only from the point of view of its own intrinsic value, but also of its influence on the culture of the Human Race. It is a contribution of unsurpassed value.\n\nIII. A very full Vocabulary of the Colloquial Arabic, as spoken in Egypt, from the pen of S. Spiro, has lately appeared at Cairo: it comprises official and technical expressions, idioms, and common phrases of the lower classes.\n\nIV. At Leipzig has appeared a seventh fascicule of the valuable work of Prof. Radloff, of St. Petersburg, \"Versuch eines W\u00f6rterbuches der Turki Dialecte.\"\nV. The Rev. A. J. Maclean, who has been for several years employed in a Mission of the Anglican Church to the members of the Eastern Syrian Church at Ur\u00fbm\u00eea, has published a valuable Grammar of the modern Dialects of Syriac, as spoken in Kurdestan, N.W. Persia, and in the basin of the Euphrates at Mosul.\n\nVI. The second volume has appeared of the \"Grundriss der Iranischen Philologie,\" to which the two leading scholars of that branch of Linguistic Science, Prof. N\u00f6ldeke and Mr. West, have contributed: the former discusses the Persian Shahnamah, and the latter has written an essay analyzing Pahlavi texts. Dr. Weisebach, of Leipzig, contributes a full list of old Persian Inscriptions, with notes, and an account of their decipherment and interpretation.\n\nVII. Mr. Browne, of the Asiatic Society, has published a Catalogue of the Persian MSS. in the Cambridge University Library. In the course of his methodical arrangement he has come on a commentary of the Koran, of about the fifth century after the Hijrah, and other papers of interest.\n\nVIII. The Clarendon Press has issued vol. xxxviii of the \"Sacred Books of the East,\" the concluding moiety of Dr. Thibaut's translation of the Vedanta-Sutra and Sankara's Commentary: the usefulness of this book is increased by careful indices prepared by Dr. Winternitz.\n\nIX. The Rev. Anton Tien has published a Grammar of the Osmanli-Turki Language, commonly called Turkish. In the appendix are Dialogues, and a list of professional and technical terms.\n\nX. The second volume of \"The Sources of Sanskrit Lexicography\" consists of the Un\u0101digana-sutra of Hemachandra, edited by Prof. Kirste, of Graz. There are nine hundred words not included in the Sanskrit Dictionary of St. Petersburg.\n\nXI. Dr. Hultzsch has published his result of a search for Sanskrit MSS. in the Nellore District of the Madras Presidency: upwards of 700 MSS. are described. Six MSS. are in the Grantha written character; the remainder in the Telugu written character.\nXII. Mr. Sturdy has published a translation of the N\u0101rada-sutra, a short treatise on the subject of Bhakti, or Faith, with an original Commentary.\n\nXIII. At length a third edition of the Arabic Grammar by the late Professor W. Wright, of Cambridge, has appeared. The first portion was edited by the lamented Professor Robertson Smith, and the remainder by Professor De Goeje, of Leiden, and Professor Bevan, of Cambridge. The latest results obtained from recent study have been incorporated. It is unnecessary to add a word to the high praise to which this book is entitled.\n\nXIV. A Jesuit Father, J. B. Belot, has published a \"Cours pratique de langue Arabe\": he has noticed the peculiarities of the Dialect spoken in Egypt, and has added a list of the technical terms of native Grammarians.\n\nB. African.\n\nI. Mr. Crabtree, Missionary, has published an elementary Vocabulary of the Soga Language, and a few verses of the New Testament: hitherto we had no knowledge of this Language, which is spoken by a Bantu population in the Region North of the Victoria Nyanza in Eastern Equatorial Africa.\n\nII. Mr. Caldwell, the Secretary of the Zambesi Industrial Mission, has published a simplified Grammar of the Nyanja Language spoken in the Region South of the Nyasa Lake, of the Bantu Family.\n\nIII. The French Missionary Jacotet has published a volume of \"Contes Populaires des Ba-Suto\" in the Suto Language of the Bantu Family in South Africa.\n\nIn the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Afrikanische und Oceanische Sprachen, vol. ii, Nos. 1 and 2, we have several interesting notices:\n\nIV.

Ray, Esq. Read before the Royal Society of New South Wales, September, 1894.\n\nThe deceased author was a Missionary of the American Congregational Foreign Missions in the Caroline and Marshall Islands. Ponap\u00e9 is an important island in Mikronesia, one of the four sub-regions of Oceania; its word-store is the fullest, and the grammar most developed, of the sister-languages spoken in the different Islands. Hawaii is the vernacular name of the Sandwich Islands. A comparative study is most important. Mr. Sidney Ray has added to its value by his notes.\n\nNew Translations of the Old Testament in Non-European Languages, actually published or in the Press.\n\nA. (6) Asia: Japan.

Roman Character.\n\nIn all there are translations made on the spot, and tested by immediate use, in fourteen previously unknown languages, and the Roman Character is made use of, because the very\nconception of a written Character was previously unknown. And this is but the average out-turn of a single year, and the difference of Grammatical structure is so great, that the idea of a common seedplot cannot be entertained; and the fact that vast tribes have flourished for centuries without any written Character, renders it necessary to inquire very carefully how it happened that some tribes acquired that art Centuries ago.\n\nR. N. C.\n\nIII. Notices of Books.\n\nSome Assamese Proverbs. Compiled and annotated by Captain P. R. Gurdon, I.S.C., Deputy Commissioner, Goalpara. (Published at Assam Secretariat Press: Shillong, 1896.)\n\nThe local Government of the Assam Province in British India has this year published a very interesting little volume with the above title, compiled by one of the district officers of the Province, and collected from the lips of a population in a low state of culture, but settled there in a corner of the world for many centuries, and speaking a Language of their own. The volume does not pretend to be exhaustive of the whole Province, but contains only a gleaming from the subdivisions of Sibs\u00e1gar, Nowgong, and Gauk\u00e1ti. In transliterating the words from the N\u00e1gari alphabet to the Roman the compiler has been guided by Sir W. Hunter's \"Practical Guide to Transliteration.\" \"The Proverbs have been classified according to objects, not subjects, this being thought the best method after consideration.\"\n\nThe Government of Assam deserves our best thanks for this publication, thus encouraging the literary industry of its subordinates in out-of-the-way regions, and contributing a valuable addition to knowledge of Language, Folklore, and Religious Conceptions.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nA Proverb picked up from the mouth of an old woman in an out-of-the-way corner of Great Britain is not to be despised. It is beyond the power of the clever fabricator of conundrums to make a Proverb: Solomon is credited with the honour of collecting Proverbs 1000 B.C.: it is not suggested that he invented them, for they are not the production of the learned: they existed long before the earliest period of writing, and were transmitted orally. Wit is said to be the thoughts of many, but the words of one. A Proverb may be described as a condensed parable, or wisdom boiled down into an essence, and presented to the public in the form of a lozenge, so as to be carried about in every pocket and laid on every tongue: no one can say who was the original inventor. They have floated down on the lips of men like literary waifs, clinging to rural districts and isolated corners, while trodden down in the busy town and frequented market-place. There is little doubt that the idea of an ancient Proverb is put into a new dress after its import in a distinct environment of customs: the Proverbs of \"carrying coals to Newcastle\" and \"taking the breeks off an Highlander\" are merely reinstating with a new impression of old metal. Some Proverbs are disgustingly coarse, and, as in all human affairs, there is a current of evil running parallel to a current of evil.\n\nCaptain Gurdon divides his collection into six classes, with full details of subclasses:\n\n1. Relating to human failings, foibles, and vices.\n2. Relating to worldly wisdom and maxims, expediency and cunning, warnings and advice.\n3. Relating to peculiarities and traits characteristic of certain castes and classes.\n4. Relating to social and moral subjects, religious customs, and popular superstitions.\n5. Agriculture and seasons.\n6. Cattle, animals, and insects.\n\nThere is great truth in some Proverbs taken at random, showing that they are drawn from the common fount\nof human conception, and that in very deed all men are brothers. I have only space for a few:\n\nI. Love of false display.\n\n(a) There are many rosaries, the beads of which are not told in devotion.\n\n(b) A turban on his head, and with nothing on the lower parts of the body.\n\nII. Ingratitude.\n\nWhen in distress a man calls on his god.\n\nIII. The mother-in-law.\n\nIf the mother-in-law gets a chance, she comes three times a day to her daughter's house.\n\nIV. The contrary wife.\n\nIf I ask for chutney, she gives me salt: who can stand a wife who is so contrary?\n\nand so on.\n\nThe compilation is a very creditable one, and a positive contribution to knowledge. I wish that other district officers would follow the example.\n\nR. N. Cust,\nHon. Sec. to R.A.S.\n\nJune 14, 1896.\n\nThe Indian Calendar, with Tables for the conversion of Hindu and Muhammadan into A.D. dates, and vice versa.\n\nBy R. Sewell and \u0160. B. D\u012bksh\u012bt. With Tables of eclipses visible in India, by Dr. R. Schram. (London: Swan Sonnenschein and Co., Limited, 1896.)\n\nAlthough during the last ten years several excellent essays have been published on the subject,\u00b9 the verification of Hindu dates is often still considered a task of great intricacy, to be approached only by people who possess an intimate knowledge of Indian astronomy. If those who\n\n\u00b9 I allude to Prof. Jacobi's \"Methods and Tables for Verifying Hindu Dates,\" in Ind. Ant., vol. xvii, p. 145 ff., and especially to the same scholar's \"Computation of Hindu Dates in Inscriptions,\" etc., in Ep. Ind., vol. i, p. 403 ff., and vol. ii, p. 487 ff. Very good tables for the approximate conversion of Hindu dates have been published by Dr. Schram in Ind. Ant., vol. xviii, p. 290 ff.\nhold such an opinion will devote a few hours' study to the work which we now owe to the painstaking industry of Mr. Sewell and Mr. Dikshit, they will see how greatly they are mistaken, or will, at any rate, admit that the two authors have removed whatever difficulty hitherto has seemed to surround the matter of which the work treats.\n\nThis new work naturally divides itself into two parts. The first part gives a clear account of the Hindu and Muhammadan calendars, and of the various eras and cycles which have been, or are still, used in different parts of India, interspersed with some valuable remarks on the astronomical writings of the Hindus. The second, more extensive part contains 136 pages of tables for the conversion of Hindu and Muhammadan dates into the corresponding European dates, and vice versa, and for the calculation of the nak\u1e63atras, yogas, and other items, sometimes quoted in Indian dates. It also fully explains the construction of the tables, and gives examples to show the working of them. In an appendix the well-known astronomer, Dr. R. Schram, of Vienna, besides, furnishes a list of the solar eclipses likely to have been visible in India during the period to which the work refers (i.e. from A.D. 300 to A.D. 1900), with tables by which it is extremely easy to ascertain whether (the greatest phase of) a solar eclipse was visible at a given place in India, and at what time of the day it took place there. The additions and corrections, among other things, contain Mr. Dikshit's rules and tables for calculating Jupiter's apparent (or true) place, the necessity for which has probably been suggested by a number of South Indian dates, lately published.\n\nThat this work is the outcome of an immense amount of patient labour, is self-evident; and, judging from the tests which I have applied, it may well be trusted for the accuracy of its statements. To convey to the reader some idea of the great ease with which the object for which it is designed is really attained by it, I shall show the practical working of its rules and tables by using them for the verification of two or three dates of Indian inscriptions.\nBut to make my calculations generally intelligible, I must premise some trite remarks on the Hindu calendar, and say a few words about the tables of our authors.\n\nThe first month of the ordinary Hindu solar year theoretically commences at the instant of the sun\u2019s entrance into the sign Aries, i.e. at the Me\u1e63a-samkr\u0101nti, and each succeeding samkr\u0101nti (or entrance of the sun into a sign of the zodiac) marks the theoretical beginning of a new solar month. The civil beginning of a solar month, i.e. whether in every-day life the month commences on the day of the samkr\u0101nti or on the following (or third) day, depends on the exact time of the day when the samkr\u0101nti takes place, and is regulated by rules which differ in different parts of India. The first month of the luni-solar year, on the other hand, commonly commences at the new moon which immediately precedes the commencement of the solar year, and each succeeding new moon forms the commencement of a new lunar month. The year ordinarily contains 12 such months, but to keep the luni-solar year in accord with the solar year another lunar month (homonymous with one of the 12 ordinary months) is added every third or, more rarely, every second year; and sometimes we have two homonymous lunar months in a year, while at the same time the name of another month is expunged. Each lunar month has two halves (pak\u1e63a)\u2014the bright half from new moon to full moon, and the dark half from full moon to new moon. Either pak\u1e63a, again, contains 15 tithis which (since a tithi is the variable time occupied by the moon in increasing her distance from the sun by 12 degrees) are of variable length, and the calculation of the exact length of which is of the utmost importance, because a civil day receives the number of the tithi which ends in it or is wholly occupied by it. Thus, \u201cthe 1st of the bright half of Caitra\u201d (Caitra-sudi 1) would ordinarily denote that civil day on which ends the first tithi of the bright half of Caitra (the first lunar month of the luni-solar year); and \u201cthe 11th of the dark half of Ph\u0101lguna,\u201d that civil day on which ends the 11th tithi of the dark half (i.e., counting from new moon, the 26th tithi)\nof Ph\u0101lguna. In general, 60 tithis (the collective number of tithis of two lunar months) are approximately equivalent to 59 civil days. Subject to the modification that a civil day is reckoned from sunrise to sunrise, the weekdays of the Hindus agree with our own; and the most ordinary (though not always sufficient) way of testing the correctness of the date of an Indian inscription, is to ascertain whether the tithi of the date did really end on the weekday which is joined with it in the original record, or whether a given solar day really fell on the given weekday.\n\nNow our authors have furnished us with tables for both the approximate and the accurate conversion of Hindu solar and luni-solar dates. To the tables for the approximate conversion of dates\u2014they are two \"eye-tables,\" constructed on methods invented by two native scholars of Madras\u2014they themselves apparently do not attach any very great importance, and in my opinion these tables should never be used for the verification of dates.\\(^1\\) The tables for the accurate conversion of Hindu dates are to a considerable extent based on, and some of them are identical or nearly identical with, the tables published by Prof. Jacobi in the *Indian Antiquary*. But the principal Table I, which comprises no less than one hundred pages, contains a great amount of independent work, inasmuch as it furnishes ready to hand, for each of the 1601 years from Kaliyuga 3402 current\\(^2\\) to Kaliyuga 5002 current (*i.e.* A.D. 300 to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Regarding the approximate method, the authors, on p. 65, say: \"Results found by this method may be inaccurate by as much as two days, but not more. If the era and bases of calculation of the given Hindu date are clearly known, and if the given date mentions a weekday, the day found by the tables may be altered to suit it.\" But \"the bases of calculation\" of a given date can never be known until a date has been accurately verified; and that one should alter the day found by the tables so as to suit a given weekday, I consider rather dangerous advice.\n\n\\(^2\\) Although the dates which employ the principal Hindu eras commonly give expired years\u2014dates of the Vikrama era do so nearly always, and for every S'aka date with a current year we have about four S'aka dates with expired years\u2014the authors in their tables throughout have given current years. How, from a practical point of view, they may justify this, I do not know; but I am the more surprised at their procedure because, judging from the notes on pp. 40 and 42, they are inclined to look on the Vikrama years of the dates and on the \"so-called expired S'aka years\" as current years (*not* the current years of their tables).\n1900), a number of important data which a person engaged in the examination of Hindu dates formerly in many cases had to calculate for himself, often at no small expense of time and labour. Thus, Table I gives us for each year not merely the concurrent Jovian year according to both the northern and southern systems, but also the added lunar month (both mean\\(^1\\) and true) and the suppressed month when there is one, the moment of the Me\u1e63a-sa\u1e41kr\u0101nti according to the \u0100rya- and S\u016brya-siddh\u0101ntas, and the European equivalent of the first civil day of the luni-solar year, with certain sets of figures from which the end of the first tithi (Caitra-sudi 1) on that day may be ascertained, etc. These data in Table I form the basis of all calculations; and the conversion or verification of a date, as I shall now show, consists in the simple addition to them of the interval in time between the commencement of the year and the given date, which is found by the help of one of the minor tables.\n\n(1) In Ind. Ant., vol. xix, p. 25, No. 12, I have shown that the date \"Tuesday, the 3rd of the bright half of Pau\u1e63a of Vikrama 1280 expired, at the Uttar\u0101ya\u1e47a-sa\u1e41kr\u0101nti,\" correctly corresponds to Tuesday, the 26th December, A.D. 1223 (when, by Prof. Jacobi's tables, the 3rd tithi of the bright half ended approximately 14 h. 6 m. after mean sunrise), and that the Uttar\u0101ya\u1e47a-sa\u1e41kr\u0101nti did take place on that day. By the work under notice the calculation would be made thus:\n\nFrom Table I we see that Vikrama (1280 expired =) 1281 current corresponds to A.D. 1223\u20134, and that Bh\u0101drapada (the 6th month of the year), was repeated in that year. Pau\u1e63a, ordinarily the 10th month of the luni-solar year (Table III), therefore, was here the 11th month, and the number of tithis from (but exclusive of) the first tithi of the year (the equivalent of which is given in\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Our authors on p. 27 say that the change from the mean to the true system of intercalation took place about A.D. 1040. But my examination of dates has shown to me that in practice the change had taken place already in the beginning of the 10th century A.D.\nTable I) to the 3rd *tithi* of the bright half of Pau\u1e63a was $30 \\times 10 = 300 + 3 = 303 - 1$ (for the first *tithi* of the year) = 302, approximately equivalent, according to what has been said above, to 297 civil days. All we have to do now is to take from columns 19, 20, and 23-25 of Table I (p. lix) the figures given for the commencement of the luni-solar year Vikrama 1281 current, and to add from Table IV (p. cx) the increase for 297 civil days, thus:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\nd & w & a & b & c \\\\\nT. I. & (63) & 0 & 9916 & 549 & 221 \\\\\n+ T. IV. & (297) & 3 & 574 & 779 & 813 \\\\\n(360) & 3 & 490 & 328 & 34 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nEquation for 328 by T. VI. 264\n\n,, ,, 34 by T. VII. 47\n\n$t=801$\n\nNow, one complete *tithi* ($t$) being equal to 333, the result, $t=801$ (which is between 667 and 1000), shows (Table VIII) that on the 360th day of A.D. 1223-4, which by Table IX was the 26th December, A.D. 1223, and which was 3=Tuesday, the 3rd *tithi* of the bright half was current at mean sunrise; and the difference between 801 and 1000 (the end of the 3rd *tithi*)=199 by Table X shows further that that 3rd *tithi* ended approximately 14h. 6m. after mean sunrise, exactly as found by Prof. Jacobi\u2019s tables.\n\nSimilarly, to find the exact moment of the Uttar\u0101ya\u1e47a- (or Makara-) sa\u1e41kr\u0101nti, we only have to take from columns 13-17a of Table I (p. lix) the time of the M\u0113\u1e63a-sa\u1e41kr\u0101nti for the year of the date, and to add from columns 6-9 of Table III (p. cvii) the increase for the Makara-sa\u1e41kr\u0101nti. Proceeding thus, according to the S\u016brya-siddh\u0101nta, we find\u2014\n\n---\n\n1 The number 63 under $d$ denotes the 63rd day of A.D. 1223; the 0 under $w$ denotes the weekday Saturday (Sunday being counted as 1, Monday as 2, etc., and Saturday as 7 or 0). The figures under $a$, $b$, and $c$ give certain quantities from which the condition of the *tithi* at sunrise is ascertained, $a$ being corrected by the equations for $b$ and $c$, taken from Tables VI and VII. In adding up the numbers under $b$ and $c$, thousands are omitted; in adding up those under $a$, ten-thousands.\nwhich means that the Uttar\u0101yana-sa\u1e41kr\u0101nti took place on the same day which above we have found for the tithi of the date, by the S\u016brya-siddh\u0101nta 1 h. 54 m. after mean sunrise. The original date is therefore shown to be correct in every particular.\n\n(2) In Ind. Ant., vol. xxiii, p. 129, No. 99, I have stated that the date \"Thursday, the 11th of the dark half of Ph\u0101lguna of \u015aaka 1042 current, the year Vik\u0101rin,\" regularly corresponds to Thursday, the 26th February, A.D. 1120.\n\nFrom Table I (p. lii) we see that \u015aaka 1042 current = A.D. 1119\u201320 by the southern luni-solar cycle was the year Vik\u0101rin, and that there was no added month in that year. Ph\u0101lguna, therefore (by Table III), was the 12th lunar month, and the 11th tithi of the dark half being the 15+11=26th tithi of the month, we have $30 \\times 11 = 330 + 26 = 356 - 1 = 355$ tithis, approximately = 349 civil days. Accordingly we have\u2014\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nT. I & \\quad (73) \\quad 6 \\quad 30 \\quad 340 \\quad 251 \\\\\n+ T.

VII. 2\n\n$t = 8360.$\n\n$T = 8360,$ being between 8333 and 8667 (Table VIII), the result is that the 11th tithi of the dark half was current at mean sunrise$^2$ of 5=Thursday, the day 422 of\n\n---\n\n$^1$ These figures for $a$, $b$, and $c$, again, are exactly the same as those found by Prof. Jacobi's tables for the 26th February, A.D. 1120.\n\n$^2$ The exact time of the end of the tithi, calculated according to the new tables, was 19 h. 56 m. after mean sunrise, but for ordinary purposes it is unnecessary to calculate this, because $t = 8360$ sufficiently shows that the 26th February, A.D. 1120, under any circumstances was the 11th of the dark half.\nA.D. 1119-20, which by Table IX (p. cxvii) was the 26th February, A.D. 1120.\n\n(3) In Ind. Ant., vol. xxiii, p. 132, No. 113, we have a date which gives us \"Wednesday, the 3rd of the month of Pa\u00f1guni of \u015aaka 1347 expired, the year Vi\u015bv\u0101vasu.\"\n\nFrom Table II, Part II (p. cv), we see that Pa\u00f1guni is the solar month of M\u012bna, the commencement of which is marked by the M\u012bna-sa\u1e41kr\u0101nti. We therefore must find the time of that sa\u1e41kr\u0101nti for \u015aaka 1347 expired=1348 current, which by Table I (p. lxxii), according to the southern luni-solar cycle, was the Jovian year Vi\u015bv\u0101vasu, and which corresponds to A.D. 1425-6. Using the figures for the \u0100rya-siddh\u0101nta, we find from columns 13, 14, and 17 of\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nT. I \\text{ (p. lxxiii).} & \\quad (85) \\quad 2 \\quad 15 \\text{ h. } 22 \\text{ m.} \\\\\n+ T.

And since the sa\u1e41kr\u0101nti took place here more than 12 hours after mean sunrise, the month of M\u012bna or Pa\u00f1guni commenced (p. 12) on the following day, Monday the 25th February, and the 3rd of Pa\u00f1guni was the 27th February, A.D. 1426, which was a Wednesday.\n\nThe great advantage of the addition of Dr. Schram's tables for solar eclipses I would exemplify by the date of an inscription at Saundatti (Ind. Ant., vol. xxiii, p. 130, No. 103), which mentions a total eclipse of the sun on Monday, the new-moon tithi of \u0100\u1e63\u0101\u1e0dha of \u015aaka 1151 current, the year Sarvadh\u0101rin. By the tables of Mr. Sewell and Mr. Dikshit the date is found to correspond regularly to Monday, the 3rd July, A.D. 1228, and we know that on that\nday there was a solar eclipse. The question is whether the eclipse was visible at Saundatti, and if so, whether for that place it was a total eclipse.\n\nThe latitude, $\\phi$, of Saundatti is $15^\\circ 46'$ N.$=16^\\circ$, and its longitude, $\\lambda$, is $75^\\circ 10'$ E.$=75^\\circ$.\n\nDr. Schram's Table A for A.D. 1228, VII, 3, gives\u2014\n\n$$L=508 \\quad \\mu=269^\\circ \\quad s'=54\\cdot85$$\n\nSaundatti has $\\lambda=75^\\circ$\n\n$\\lambda+\\mu=344^\\circ$\n\nWith $\\phi=16^\\circ$ and $\\lambda+\\mu=344^\\circ$\u2014\n\nTable B, $L=500$ gives $s''=1\\cdot15$\n\nand Table B, $L=510$ gives $s''=1\\cdot17$\n\ntherefore $L=508 \\quad \\ldots \\quad s''=1\\cdot17$\n\n$s'+s''=56\\cdot02$\n\nNow Table C, with $s'+s''=56\\cdot00$ gives total, and with $s'+s''=56\\cdot04$ eleven digits; with $s'+s''=56\\cdot02$; therefore, the eclipse at Saundatti was one of $11\\cdot5$ digits or an almost total eclipse.\n\nProceeding in the same simple manner by Table D, we further find that the moment of the greatest phase of the eclipse at Saundatti was $11\\cdot7$ gha\u1e6dik\u0101s or $4$ h. $41$ m. after true sunrise.\n\nAs I merely wish to indicate the way in which the new tables are used, I have given here only dates which at once work out quite satisfactorily. The cases we meet with are not always so simple, and in practice we have to consider various possibilities. A tithi sometimes may or must be joined with the civil day on which it commences. A lunar month, instead of commencing with the new moon, often commences with the full moon. A luni-solar year, instead of beginning with the month Caitra, may commence with K\u0101rttika or other months, and a solar year, e.g., with the \u015ai\u1e41ha- instead of the Me\u1e63a-samkr\u0101nti. Besides, we rarely know beforehand whether the year of a date is current\nor expired, and sometimes only regnal or Jovian years are given to us. But the manner of calculation is the same everywhere, and the work before us contains ample information as to how most of these difficulties should be dealt with.\n\nIn a note on p. 109 Mr. Sewell informs us that in a second edition he proposes to add a list of the lunar eclipses visible in India. A list of lunar eclipses is indeed necessary, but in my opinion the lists of both solar and lunar eclipses should give all eclipses for the period of which the work treats, because in the verification of dates we also meet with eclipses that were not visible in India. In a new edition a few paragraphs might also be added about the calculation of the lagna, sometimes quoted in dates, and of the aharga\u1e47a for a given day; and lists should be given of the deities of the tithis, nak\u1e63atras, etc., so as to explain such expressions as \"the tithi of Madana\" and \"the Maitra nak\u1e63atra.\" I would also suggest the addition of a list of the words used to express numbers, and an explanation of the so-called ku\u1e6dapay\u0101di method of denoting numbers.\n\nOur authors have acknowledged their indebtedness to Prof. Jacobi, and, for the solution of some problems, have referred us to that scholar's Special Tables, published in Ep. Ind., vol. i, p. 450 ff. Highly as I appreciate the new work of Mr. Sewell and Mr. Dikshit, I should be wanting in gratitude if, on my part, I did not acknowledge here the great benefit which I myself have derived from Prof. Jacobi's unpretending General Tables, ibid., pp. 443\u2013445, the design of which has always appeared to me a marvel of ingenuity.\n\nG\u00f6ttingen. F. Kielhorn.\n\nThe Babylonian Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nProfessor Hilprecht, of Pennsylvania, has just given to the world the second part of vol. i of the work he is\nissuing under the above title, and every student of the ancient East will appreciate it as one of the most notable additions to our knowledge. The work consists of 68 pages of descriptive letterpress (including the list of contents) and 50 lithographed plates, consisting of inscriptions, mostly from Niffer, some votive tablets with incised designs (in limestone), bas-reliefs, views of the excavations at Niffer, etc.\n\nProf. Hilprecht brings further arguments that \u0160argani, or \u0160argani-\u0161ar-\u0101li, is identical with Sargon of Agade\u2014arguments almost amounting to absolute proof, and especially gratifying to the writer of the present notice. He publishes also (pl. xxii) an inscribed bas-relief of his son, Naram-sin, from Diarbekir. The date of \u0160argani-\u0161ar-\u0101li, it will be remembered, is given, upon the basis of Nabonidos\u2019 statement, as being 3800 B.C.; but Mr. Haynes\u2019 excavations at Niffer prove that he was not by any means the earliest ruler in Babylonia, for both Dr. J. P. Peters and Prof. Hilprecht estimate that the foundations of the city go back to 6000 or 7000 B.C. Somewhere in this gap Hilprecht puts (1) En-\u0161agsag-ana, \u201cLord of Kengi\u201d (Babylonia); (2) Enne-umun, king of K\u0113\u0161; (3) Ur-\u0160ulpauddu, also king of K\u0113\u0161; (4) Lugal-zag-gi-si, king of Erech, son of Uku\u0161. Lugal-zag-gi-si was a great conqueror, but, notwithstanding this, \u201chis very name had been forgotten by later generations.\u201d Somewhat later than the foregoing the author places (5) Lugal-kigub-nidudu, and (6) Lugal-si-kisal, of the first dynasty of Ur, and he has been able to give a number of historical details concerning these rulers.\n\n1 The existence of records of earlier rulers was to be expected from the royal lists found at Nineveh.\n2 Prof. Hilprecht doubtless has some good reason for transcribing the name thus. I have always regarded the second component part as being Dun-sig-\u0113.\nEspecially important are the tablets giving events of the regnal years of Ine-Sin, Bur-Sin, and Gimil-Sin, which were compiled on account of the system of dating contracts in Babylonia. The discovery of other tablets in that country may be looked forward to to place the early chronology and history of the country on a really firm basis.\n\nT. G. P.\n\nAssyrisches Handw\u00f6rterbuch. By Fr. Delitzsch.\n(Leipzig: Hinrichs. London: Luzac.)\n\nAt last we have a complete Assyrian dictionary, that is, complete as far as the material available to the author went\u2014and even that is a great boon. It is, naturally, a great advance upon the dictionary of Norris, the last volume of which was published in 1872 (letter N), and which the learned and talented author did not live to finish. Delitzsch's work contains 730 pages, and has one disadvantage which Norris's does not possess, namely the absence of cuneiform characters, except in the cases of certain ideographs quoted. The work, nevertheless, is excellent, and, in fact, indispensable to all Assyriologists. One sometimes wonders, it is true, if certain roots are not split up too much, like \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9, I. \"to do away with\"; II. ?; III. \"to cover with pitch\"; but this is a defect which will doubtless be remedied in a future edition. We miss, here and there, certain well-known and many rare words, such as kindatu\u1d50 (or kinditu\u1d50), apparently meaning \"dues\" (Strassmaier, \"Inschr. von Nabonidus,\" No. 9, l. 9; Sir Henry Peek's Tablets, No. 16, l. 10), sak\u0101tu, in Puul (=II. 1), \"to be silent\" (tablet 82\u20133\u201323, 925, l. 15), etc. Every scholar will, nevertheless, appreciate the completion of this long-promised work, and the industry of the scholar\u2014now to be classed among the veterans\u2014who has produced it; and the Assyriological world will doubtless look forward with great interest to such supplements as the author of this first complete Assyrian dictionary will doubtless from time to time publish.\n\nT. G. P.\nKEILINSCHRIFTLICHE BIBLIOTHEK. (Berlin: Reuther and Reichard, 1896.)\n\nThis publication is still continued under the able editorship of Professor Schrader, the last volume issued (the fourth) being devoted to Juridical and Business documents, translated by Dr. Peiser. It is very complete, the texts given ranging from the time of the second dynasty of Ur to the dynasty of the Arsacidae, a period of over 2000 years, and covering every class of document. Dr. Peiser gives many corrections of tablets published before his work appeared, but in some cases the old Babylonian texts might have been improved by revision. In his transcription of names Dr. Peiser gives rightly nunu instead of ili (e.g. Ki\u0161anunu for Ki\u0161ili), du-gu-ul for du-gu-mi (?) (in Sin-l-dugul), etc. Improvements can be made here and there, as in the case of p. 34, II, 15-17, where I read \"Year (when) Ammi-satana named D\u00fbr-Iskun-Marduk on the bank of the river (or canal) Amzilakku.\" (MU Ammi-satana LUGAL-E MU D\u00fbr-Is-ku-un-Marduk GI TIG IDA Am-si-la-ku.) The work of Dr. Peiser is very good, however, and well worthy of the attention of students. Nine Cappadocian tablets are included in the number translated.\n\nT. G. P.\n\nOne or two articles in periodicals worthy of notice may be here mentioned. The interest in the important inscription published by the Rev. P. Scheil will probably continue for some time longer, there being considerable difference of opinion as to who or what the words i-ri-ba tuk-te-e, may be. As they are followed by the phrase \u0161ar Umman-manda, \"king of the barbarians\" or \"the Medes,\" iriba-tukte seems to be the name of the Median king, and Dr. Lehmann identifies it with Arbaces. Others, however, maintain that iriba\n\n1 Not Bel, as Strassmaier gives.\ntukte are two words, part of the remainder of the sentence. It is noteworthy that, as Scheil now recognizes, the name of Assyria is written with the characters Su-edina (ki), a fact that throws new light on the geography of that region.\n\nA tablet containing a record of two transactions referring to the same property, published by Dr. Peiser in his \"Keilinschriftliche Aktenst\u00fccke,\" and again in his book above referred to, p. 94, has attracted the attention of Prof. Oppert, who gives a translation of it in the M\u00e9langes Charles de Harlez, with a very interesting commentary in which the words and measures are discussed, and remarks made upon the deities Lagamal, Adad (Addu), and Ramman(u) (= Laomer, Hadad, and Rimmon). Prof. Oppert places the city \u2014 (generally read Dilbat) on the western bank of the Euphrates. Whilst in Babylonia, Mr. Hormuzd Rassam excavated at a site called Dailem, which, from the dates of the contracts found there, I at once identified with the \u2014 of the inscriptions. This city, Mr. Rassam tells me, lies on the western bank of the Euphrates, as conjectured by Prof. Oppert. With regard to the name, the late Geo. Bertin told me many years ago that he had found the form Dilmu (better read, perhaps, D\u0113lmu), which would agree with the present Arabic name exactly. This is a geographical identification which is worthy of notice, and the question naturally arises whether Dilmu (or D\u0113lmu) has, after all, anything to do with the name of the planet Dilbat (better Delebat) = Venus, especially as the god of the city, according to the inscriptions, seems to have been Ura\u0161.\n\nT. G. P.\n\n1 This form really does exist, however, and will be found in the British Museum, tablet K 2866, line 19 (S. A. Smith, Miscellaneous Texts, pl. xvii).\nAbhandlungen zur Arabischen Philologie, von Ignaz Goldziher. Erster Theil. (Leiden, Brill, 1896.)\n\nThe three essays contained in this volume deal with the origins of Arabic poetry, the development of taste among the Mohammedan critics, and the uses of the loan-word sakinhah. Arabic scholars are accustomed to find in Dr. Goldziher's writings an acquaintance with Arabic literature that is unsurpassed for width and depth, a rare talent for combination, and an attractive style. The new volume falls short of none of its predecessors in these qualities, and the skill with which the author utilizes passages of no obvious significance makes the book a discipline in careful reading.\n\nPart of the first essay was communicated to the Congress of Orientalists that met at Geneva in 1894. It traces the idea which meets us in Mohammedan authors, that the poetic afflatus is due to the inspiration of the Jinn, to a period when that superstition referred not to the poet's art, but to the mystical powers he possessed; and according to the author the Arabic words for poet and poetry, which literally mean 'knower' and 'knowledge,' are to be compared with words like 'wizard'; in Hebrew yid'oni from yada' 'to know,' where the knowledge signified is also of a mysterious nature. The poet's supernatural gift was of use to his tribe in many ways; but chiefly because he could abuse the tribes with which his own was at war; and of this war of words, which developed into the classical hija, or satire, we have an early illustration in the oracles of Balaam, an illustration which, it may be observed, had already been noticed by M. Renan in his \"Histoire du peuple Israel.\" Dr. Goldziher collects notices of various superstitious practices connected with the hija, and ingeniously shows that their abolition was the real object of several of the enactments about dress introduced by Islam. The form of the hija was originally, like that of other oracular utterances, rhymed prose, and not the least valuable part of the essay is the demonstration that the employment of\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nthis form of composition as the natural vehicle of oratory was comparatively late, not having been generally adopted till the time of the Buyids. From rhymed prose satire was advanced to *rejes*, a sort of intermediate style between prose and verse, and afterwards to the regular metres.\n\nIn the second essay the reaction from the taste of the earliest critics, who would admire none but pre-Islamic poetry, is traced historically, and acute suggestions are made about its causes. European taste, with which no Arabic poetry has ever found much favour, probably agrees with that of native critics in assigning the palm to Mutanabbi, whose claim to have surpassed the poets of pagan times would, it seems, have been regarded as outrageous a century before his time, but has been justified by the honour paid him in succeeding ages; of the two poets who are ordinarily coupled with him, Abu Tammam and Al-Buhturi, most readers will agree with Dr. Goldziher in regarding the second as greatly overrated. When Dr. Goldziher says (p. 145) that the great poets of the Abbasid period \"burst the bonds in which tradition had bound Arabic poetry,\" is not this putting the matter rather too strongly? Mutanabbi does, indeed, ridicule the practice of commencing every encomium with erotic verses, but how often does he regard it as safe to abandon it? And how many of his night journeys and other heroic exploits bear any relation to facts?\n\nThe third essay is an interesting and ingenious analysis of the uses of the word *sakinah*, in which the author traces three elements\u2014one got from the Jews, a second from the commentators on the Koran, and a third from Pagan reminiscences.\n\nThere are some important excursuses appended to the text, especially on fancies connected with the Jinn.\n\nD.

(New York, 1895.)\n\nThe subject chosen by Mr. Berg for his dissertation is one of great interest, and it may be hoped that this, like so many dissertations, may be the forerunner of a more exhaustive treatise. In its present form the amount of Mr. Berg's work which is concerned with its ostensible subject is very disproportionate to the whole; for while the dissertation consists of 160 pages, we cannot find more than six that deal with the influence of the LXX on the Peshitto Psalter; the remainder being occupied with general questions connected with both versions, with a table of variants of MSS. and editions from the text of Lee, and with a list of various interpretations collected from the Greek, Syriac, and Chaldee versions of the Psalms. In the first of these sections the statement that \"unlike the Peshitto the LXX is guilty of no errors which may be ascribed to ignorance\" astounds us. The purpose of these general discussions is to establish an *a priori* probability that the Syriac translators would have consulted the Greek version; but the grounds on which Mr. Berg adopts the view that the Peshitto emanated from Jewish Christians seem so very slight that the chain of evidence would support no great weight. More important, therefore, is the internal evidence of imitation obtained from a study of the version itself; and we could wish that Mr. Berg had collected this fully and arranged it under heads, instead of restricting himself to occasional observations appended to this table of variants; which, it may be observed, is far less useful than Nestle's *Psalterium Tetraglotton*. However, it must be confessed that the dissertation gives evidence of many scholarly qualities, and\nsince such works should be judged rather by their promise than their performance, this new collaborateur will be welcomed by all those whose studies bring them into contact with the Peshitto.\n\nD. S. MARGOLIOUTH.\n\nThe Zand-i Jav\u00eet-sh\u00ead\u00e2-d\u00e2d; or, Pahlavi Version of the Avesta Vendidad. Edited by Darab Dastur Peshotan Sanjana. (Harrassowitz: Leipzig.)\n\nThis new edition of two-thirds of the Pahlavi Vendidad (Fargards i\u2013ix and xix) is specially intended for the use of Pahlavi students in the University of Bombay, where this portion of the text is prescribed for the Parsi B.A. and M.A. examinations.\n\nThe Pahlavi version of the Vendidad, the Levitical law of the Parsis, was first edited by Spiegel in 1853, and two of the MSS. he used, which were written in 1323\u20134, are still the chief authorities for so much of the text as they contain; but he had to rely upon much more modern MSS. for nearly one-third of the text. The present editor has trusted to Spiegel for the readings of the Copenhagen MS. of 1324, and has used collations of two copies of that MS. which were written three centuries ago; he has also consulted a collation of the London MS. of 1323, and has constantly referred to a MS. in his father's library, which was written in 1788, and is a descendant of that London MS. These five MSS. are the best authorities for the Vendidad text, when judiciously used. The two old MSS. of 1323\u20134 were copied from the same original, written in 1269; that was transcribed from another written in 1205, and that from a third whose writer's name is recorded.\n\nSo far as yet ascertained, all Pahlavi Vendidads in India belong to this family of MSS.; but whether any such MSS. of independent descent exist in Persia appears to be still doubtful. Darab certainly states (p. xxxv) that \"it has now been ascertained that the Zoroastrians in Persia possess\nno older copies of the Pahlavi Vendidad,\" but this is not\nthe whole of the question. We should no doubt be glad\nto have collations of older MSS., but if these do not exist\nwe still want to know whence their more modern MSS.\nare descended. If they are not of Indian descent, they\nmust form an independent family of MSS., branching off\nsomewhere from the Iranian ancestors of the Indian\nfamily; and a collation of any such MS. would be valuable.\nThe Parsi Punchayat in Bombay might do much to settle\nthis question, if they would obtain copies of the colophons\nof several Pahlavi Vendidads in Persia which have not\nbeen copied from Indian MSS., and then submit the\ncopies to some competent scholar for report.\n\nThe colophons of four old MSS. of 1323\u20134, two Vendidads\nand two Yasnas, state that they were written by the same\ncopyist, Mihrb\u00e2n Kai-Khusro (a Parsi priest who had\nrecently come from Persia), as a good work done at the\nexpense of a Parsi layman of Cambay, named Ch\u00e2hil\nSangan, of whom no other record than such colophons\nis known to survive. He must have been a wealthy man,\nand his genealogy is given for four or five generations\nback. In two Sanskrit colophons both his name and that\nof his father, Sangan, are preceded by an epithet which\nhas been read thava, but which Ervad Tehmuras proposes\nto read vyava, as an abbreviation of vyavagata in the sense\nof \"deceased.\" If this be correct, as seems very likely,\nit would imply that Ch\u00e2hil was already dead, and that the\ngood work of providing these MSS. was done on his behalf\nby means of funds bequeathed by him for that purpose.\n\nThe editor of this edition is son of the high priest of the\nSh\u00e2hansh\u00e2h\u00ee Parsis of Bombay, and is well acquainted with\nParsi tradition as well as with the views of European\nscholarship. His collation of the MSS. has been carefully\nmade, and the various readings given in footnotes will be\nvery useful to scholars, as soon as they fully understand\nthe relative value of the MSS. in various parts of the text.\nThis can be ascertained from the detailed description of the\nMSS. given in the introduction, from which it will be seen\nthat nearly all of them have lost many of their original folios, and the modern folios which often replace them are of little critical value. Besides his account of the MSS., the editor has included in his introduction a short summary of the contents of the twenty-one Nasks, or sacred books of the Parsis, abridged from the Dinkard, with a full translation of its analysis of the portion of the Vendidad he has edited. And the Pahlavi text of the passages he has translated from the Dinkard is given at the end of the book; the translations themselves being his revisions of some of those contained in \"The Sacred Books of the East,\" vol. xxxvii.\n\nIf no independent MSS. of the Pahlavi Vendidad be hereafter found in Persia, this edition may be considered very nearly equivalent to a critical edition of the text as it stood in the thirteenth century.\n\nFrom the Academy of August 15.\n\nE.

In May, 1890, a Committee was formed, on the motion of Professor Sir M. Monier-Williams, K.C.I.E., to prepare a scheme, in conjunction with other learned societies, to be brought before the International Congress of Orientalists.\n\nAfter long deliberation and careful consideration of the scheme propounded by Professor the Right Hon. F. Max M\u00fcller, and accepted by the Oxford University Press, of the scheme adopted by the Government of India, on the recommendation of Sir W. W. Hunter, K.C.S.I., of the papers contributed by Sir M. Monier-Williams, K.C.I.E., to this Society's Journal in 1890, and to the proceedings of the Berlin Congress, and of the schemes adopted by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique, the Deutsche Morgenl\u00e4ndische Gesellschaft, the Bengal Asiatic Society, and the P\u0101li Text Society, this Committee presented their Report to the Council held on the 8th of May, 1894. That report was adopted by the Council, and published in the Society's Journal for July, 1894.\n\nIn the autumn of that year the Tenth Oriental Congress was held at Geneva; and, on the motion of Lord Reay on behalf of the Society, a representative Commission was appointed to consider the subject. The Report of this Commission was presented to the Congress before it separated, and was adopted by the Congress. The scheme prepared by the Commission (containing two systems\u2014one for Sanskrit and the other for Arabic) was ordered to be incorporated in the Proceedings of the Congress, and was recommended for adoption by all Orientalists. A translation of this scheme was published, with the Report, in the Society's Journal for October, 1895.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nThis Report states that\u2014\"The Commission took as a basis for its work the Report of the Royal Asiatic Society's Special Committee, and the systems of transliteration usually adopted in France, in Germany, and by the Bengal Asiatic Society. The Commission does not pretend to have discovered a perfectly scientific system.\"\n\nThe Council is of opinion that it is advisable to take this opportunity of recommending the system thus placed before the world. Much care and pains have been taken over the subject, and there does not seem any probability of further steps being taken, at all events for some years to come. It has come to the decision, therefore, to recommend those Oriental scholars over whom it has influence to endeavour to adopt the system proposed by the Oriental Congress at Geneva. It observes, however, that there are some slight diversities between the scheme for Sanskrit and that for Arabic, and a few emendations have been suggested to bring them more fully into harmony. The Council, therefore, now republishes, together with its own resolution on the subject, the two systems suggested by the Geneva Congress; and adds a few suggestions (chiefly by way of harmonizing them), together with specimens of transliteration in various languages, so that all Oriental scholars may clearly understand what is recommended.\n\nThe following is the resolution that has consequently been passed:\u2014\"Resolved that the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society, having given the most careful consideration to the Report on Transliteration prepared by the representative Commission appointed by the Oriental Congress at Geneva, while not entirely agreeing in all the details, gives the entire scheme its general approval; and earnestly recommends all connected with this country who are engaged in Oriental studies to set aside their own individual feelings and predilections, and, as far as possible, to employ this method of transliteration, in order that the very great benefit of a uniform system may be gradually adopted, and Oriental studies may thereby be facilitated.\"\nTABLE I.\n\nTRANSLITERATION OF THE SANSKRIT AND ALLIED ALPHABETS ADOPTED BY THE GENEVA CONGRESS.\n\n| Sanskrit | Latin |\n|----------|-------|\n| \u0905        | a     |\n| \u0906        | \u0101     |\n| \u0907        | i     |\n| \u0908        | \u012b     |\n| \u0909        | u     |\n| \u090a        | \u016b     |\n| \u0930        | r     |\n| \u0932        | l     |\n| \u0935        | v     |\n| \u0936        | \u015b     |\n| \u0937        | \u1e63     |\n| \u0939        | h     |\n| \u090f        | e     |\n| \u0910        | ai    |\n| \u0913        | o     |\n| \u0914        | au    |\n| \u0915        | k     |\n| \u0916        | kh    |\n| \u0917        | g     |\n| \u0918        | gh    |\n| \u0919        | \u1e45     |\n| \u091a        | ch    |\n| \u091b        | ch    |\n| \u091c        | j     |\n| \u091d        | jh    |\n| \u091e        | \u1e47     |\n| \u091f        | t     |\n| \u0920        | \u1e6d     |\n| \u0921        | d     |\n| \u0922        | dh    |\n| \u0923        | n     |\n| \u0924        | t     |\n| \u0925        | th    |\n| \u0926        | d     |\n| \u0927        | dh    |\n| \u0928        | n     |\n| \u092a        | p     |\n| \u092b        | ph    |\n| \u092c        | b     |\n| \u092d        | bh    |\n| \u092e        | m     |\n| \u092f        | y     |\n| \u0930        | r     |\n| \u0932        | l     |\n| \u0935 | v | : (Visarga) . . . . . h |\n| \u092e | \u015b | \u00d7 (Jihv\u0101m\u016bl\u012bya) . . . h |\n| \u092a | \u1e63 | \u00d7 (Upadhm\u0101n\u012bya) . . . h |\n| \u092f | s | s (Avagraha) . . . \u093d |\n| \u0939 | h | Udatta . . . . . \u093d |\n| \u0915\u0947 (in Pali l-) | l | Svarita . . . . . \u25b3 |\n| \u094d (Anusv\u0101ra, Niggahita) | m | Anudatta . . . . . \u25b3 |\n| \u0935\u094d (Anund\u0101sika) | \u1e41 |\nTABLE II.\n\nTRANSLITERATION OF THE ARABIC ALPHABET ADOPTED BY THE GENEVA CONGRESS.\n\n[Notes in square brackets refer to pp. 6, 7.]\n\n| at beginning of word | \u063a g permissible gh |\n|----------------------|--------------------|\n| omit; hamza elsewhere | \u0641 f                |\n| \u0640 [\u2018 or \u00ba, Note 8]   | \u0642 q                |\n| \u0628 b                  | \u0643 k                |\n| \u062a t                  | \u0644 l                |\n| \u0629 \u0626 permissible th    | \u0645 m                |\n| \u0621 \u0621 permissible dj    | \u0646 n                |\n| \u062d h                  | \u0648 w [or v, Note 5] |\n| \u062e \u0647 permissible kh    | \u0647 h                |\n| \u062f d                  | \u064a y                |\n| \u0630 \u0638 permissible dh    | vowels \u0640 a, \u0640 i, \u0640 u |\n| \u0631 r                  | lengthened \u0640 a, \u0640 i, \u0640 u |\n| \u0632 z                  | diphthongs \u0640 ay and \u0640 aw |\n| \u0633 s                  | [ai and au, Note 4] |\n| \u0634 \u0621 permissible sh    | e and o may be used in place |\n| \u0635 \u0621 [see Note 1]     | of i and u         |\n| \u0636 \u0621 [d, Note 2]      | also \u0119 and \u00f6 in Indian dialects, |\n| \u0637 \u0626 or \u0626 [only t, Note 3] | \u00fc and \u00f6 in Turkish |\n| \u0638 \u0626 or \u0626             | \u0644 of article \u0627\u0644 to be always l. |\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nADDITIONAL IN PERSIAN, HINDI, AND PAKSHTU.\n\n\u067e p\n\n\u067e permissible ch\n\n\u0698 permissible zh\n\n\u06af g\n\nTURKISH LETTERS.\n\n\u06a9 when pronounced as y,\n\u06a9 is permitted.\n\n\u0646 n\n\nHINDI AND PAKSHTU.\n\n\u062b or \u062a t\n\n\u0633 or \u062f d\n\n\u0647 or \u0631 r\n\nPAKSHTU LETTERS.\n\n\u062e ts\n\n\u0631 q\n\n\u0646 n\n\n\u0634 ksh\n\nAlso in India will be recognized s for \u062b, z for \u0698, and z for \u0636.\n\nThe above scheme contains, it will be seen, two schemes\u2014one for the transliteration of Sanskrit, P\u0101li, and the allied alphabets, and one for the transliteration of Arabic and the allied alphabets. These two tables are inconsistent with one another on several points. In applying the Congress scheme, therefore, to the transliteration of Hind\u012b (which is written both with Sanskrit and Arabic letters) the same word would have to be transliterated differently according to the alphabet before the transliterator. These points are as follows:\n\n(1) The sound represented in English by sh is represented in the first table by s, and in the second by \u0698 (sh being permissible). On the other hand, the s is used in the first table for the Sanskrit \u0936 (sh) and in the second for \u0635 (z). The practical difficulties arising from this discrepancy are, however, so small that the Council would merely point out the discrepancy.\n\n(2) The sign \u062f is used in the Sanskrit table for \u0926 (the cerebral d), and in the Arabic table for \u062f (dad). This discrepancy could be avoided by selecting \u062f for the dad.\n(3) The alternative transliteration \\( t \\) allowed for \\( b \\) in the second table clashes with the use of the same sign in the first table. This alternative transliteration might be dropped out of Table II.\n\n(4) The diphthongs \\( ai \\) and \\( au \\) in the first table are replaced by \\( ay \\) and \\( aw \\) in the second. It would be better to adhere to the first table.\n\n(5) The transliteration \\( w \\) for the \\( j \\) in the Arabic table clashes with that proposed for the \\( q \\) in the Sanskrit table. Both \\( v \\) and \\( w \\) might be allowed for each of these letters.\n\n(6) The sound represented by \\( ch \\) in the English orthography is transliterated \\( c \\) in the Sanskrit table, and \\( \u00e7 \\) (\\( ch \\) being permissible) in the second table. It would be more consistent to adopt \\( c \\) throughout.\n\nThere are also one or two other matters which are worthy of notice.\n\n(7) The signs \\( s \\) and \\( z \\), and \\( d \\) and \\( f \\) are each of them used in Table II as the transliteration of two different letters.\n\n(8) No sign has been suggested in the Arabic table for the transliteration of the wasla. The comma above the line \\( ' \\) used in the table to represent the hamsa might be used for the wasla, and either a stroke or a circle above the line (\u2018 or \u00ba) might be used for the hamsa.\n\n(9) No sign has been suggested in the Arabic table for the silent \\( t \\). The sign \\( h \\) might be used to represent this letter.\n\n(10) A stroke beneath the line (thus \\( h \\) or \\( m \\)) might be suggested to signify that a letter written in any alphabet to be transliterated is not to be pronounced.\nSubject to the suggestions above made, which will, the Council hopes, meet with the approval of Continental scholars, the following passages would illustrate the scheme as adopted by the Congress.\n\nSANSKRIT.\n\n\u1e5ag Veda: opening lines\u2014\n\nAgnim \u012ble pur\u00f3hitam yaj\u00f1\u00e1sya dev\u00e1m \u1e5btv\u00edjam h\u00f3t\u0101ram ratnadh\u00e1tamam.\nagnih p\u00farvebhir \u015bhabhir \u012b\u1e0dyo n\u00fatanair \u00fata s\u00e1 dev\u00e1m \u00e9h\u00e1 vak\u1e63ati.\n\nNalop\u0101khy\u0101na: opening lines\u2014\n\n\u0100sid r\u0101j\u0101 Nalo n\u0101ma Virasenasuto bali upapanno gunair i\u1e63\u1e6dair r\u016bpav\u0101n a\u015bvakovidah ati\u1e63\u1e6dhan manujendr\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 m\u016brdhni devapatir yath\u0101 uparyupari sarves\u0101\u1e41 \u0101ditya iva tejas\u0101.\nP\u0100LI.\n\nDigha: opening words\u2014\n\nEvam me sut\u0101n.

RHYS DAVIDS, 22, Albemarle Street, London, W.\n(With power to add workers to their number.)\n\nHon. Sec. and Treas. for America\u2014Prof. Lanman, Harvard College, Cambridge, Mass.\n\nHon. Sec. and Treas. for Ceylon\u2014E. R. Gooneratne, Esq., Atapattu Mudaliyar, Galle.\n\nThis Society has been started in order to render accessible to students the rich stores of the earliest Buddhist literature now lying unedited and practically unused in the various MSS. scattered throughout the University and other Public Libraries of Europe.\n\nThe historical importance of these Texts can scarcely be exaggerated, either in respect of their value for the history of folk-lore, or of religion, or of language. It is already certain that they were all put into their present form within a very limited period, probably extending to less than a century and a half (about B.C. 400\u2013250). For that period they have preserved for us a record, quite uncontaminated by filtration through any European mind, of the every-day beliefs and customs of a people nearly related to ourselves, just as they were passing through the first stages of civilization. They are our best authorities for the early history of that interesting system of religion so nearly allied to some of the latest speculations among ourselves, and which has influenced so powerfully, and for so long a time, so great a portion of the human race\u2014the system of religion which we now call Buddhism. The sacred books of the early Buddhists have preserved to us the sole record of the only religious\nmovement in the world's history which bears any close resemblance to early Christianity. In the history of speech they contain unimpeachable evidence of a stage in language midway between the Vedic Sanskrit and the various modern forms of speech in India. In the history of Indian literature there is nothing older than these works, excepting only the Vedic writings; and all the later classical Sanskrit literature has been profoundly influenced by the intellectual struggle of which they afford the only direct evidence. It is not, therefore, too much to say that the publication of this unique literature will be no less important for the study of history\u2014whether anthropological, philological, literary, or religious\u2014than the publication of the Vedas has already been.\n\nThe whole will occupy about nine or ten thousand pages 8vo. Of these 7200 pages have already appeared. The accession of about fifty new members would make it possible to issue 1000 pages every year.\n\nThe Subscription to the Society is only One Guinea a year, or Five Guineas for six years, payable in advance. Each subscriber receives, post free, the publications of the Society, which cost a good deal more than a guinea to produce.\n\nIt is hoped that persons who are desirous to aid the publication of these important historical texts, but who do not themselves read P\u0101li, will give Donations to be spread if necessary over a term of years. Nearly \u00a3400 has already been thus given to the Society by public-spirited friends of historical research.\n\n* * * Subscriptions for 1896 are now due, and it is earnestly requested that subscribers will send in their payments without putting the Chairman to the expense and trouble of personally asking for them. All who can conveniently do so should send the Five Guineas for six years, to their own benefit and that of the Society also.\n\nThe Society keeps no books, and its publications cannot in any case be sent to subscribers who have not already paid their subscriptions for the year.\n\nCheques and Post Office Orders should be made payable to the \"P\u0101li Text Society.\" (Address: 22, Albemarle Street, London, W.)\nLIST OF THE MEMBERS\n\nOF THE\n\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY\n\nOF\n\nGREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND:\n\nFOUNDED, March, 1823.\n\nCORRECTED TO 1st JANUARY, 1896.\n\n22, ALBEMARLE STREET,\nLONDON.\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nPATRON:\nHER MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY THE QUEEN.\n\nVICE-PATRONS:\nHIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES.\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.\n\nPRESIDENT:\nTHE RIGHT HON.
