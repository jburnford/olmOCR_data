Nor has it been thought necessary to mark vowels as long in cases where mistakes in pronunciation were not likely to be made.\n\nConsonants\n\nMost Indian languages have different forms for a number of consonants, such as d, t, r, &c., marked in scientific works by the use of dots or italics. As the European ear distinguishes these with difficulty in ordinary pronunciation, it has been considered undesirable to embarrass the reader with them; and only two notes are required. In the first place, the Arabic k, a strong guttural, has been represented by k instead of q, which is often used. Secondly, it should be remarked that aspirated consonants are common; and, in particular, dh and th (except in Burma) never have the sound of th in 'this' or 'thin,' but should be pronounced as in 'woodhouse' and 'boathook.'\nBurmese Words\n\nBurmese and some of the languages on the frontier of China have the following special sounds:\n\n- aw has the vowel sound in 'law.'\n- \u00f6 and \u00fc are pronounced as in German.\n- gy is pronounced almost like j in 'jewel.'\n- ky is pronounced almost like ch in 'church.'\n- th is pronounced in some cases as in 'this,' in some cases as in 'thin.'\n- w after a consonant has the force of we. Thus, ywea and pwe are disyllables, pronounced as if written ywea and pwe.\n\nIt should also be noted that, whereas in Indian words the accent or stress is distributed almost equally on each syllable, in Burmese there is a tendency to throw special stress on the last syllable.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe names of some places e.g. Calcutta, Bombay, Lucknow, Cawnpore\u2014have obtained a popular fixity of spelling, while special forms have been officially prescribed for others. Names of persons are often spelt and pronounced differently in different parts of India; but the variations have been made as few as possible by assimilating forms almost alike, especially where a particular spelling has been generally adopted in English books.\n\nNotes on Money, Prices, Weights and Measures\n\nAs the currency of India is based upon the rupee, all statements with regard to money throughout the Gazetteer have necessarily been expressed in rupees, nor has it been found possible to add generally a conversion into sterling. Down to about 1873 the gold value of the rupee (containing 165 grains of pure silver) was approximately equal to 2s., or one-tenth of a \u00a3; and for that period it is easy to convert rupees into sterling by striking off the final cipher (Rs. 1,000 = \u00a3100). But after 1873, owing to the depreciation of silver as compared with gold throughout the world, there came a serious and progressive fall in the exchange, until at one time the gold value of the rupee dropped as low as 1s. In order to provide a remedy for the heavy loss caused to the Government of India in respect of its gold payments to be made in England, and also to relieve foreign trade and finance from the inconvenience due to constant and unforeseen fluctuations in exchange, it was resolved in 1893 to close the mints to the free coinage of silver, and thus force up the value of the rupee by restricting the circulation. The intention was to raise\nthe exchange value of the rupee to 1s. 4d., and then introduce a gold standard (though not necessarily a gold currency) at the rate of Rs. 15 = \u00a31. This policy has been completely successful. From 1899 onwards the value of the rupee has been maintained, with insignificant fluctuations, at the proposed rate of 1s. 4d.; and consequently since that date three rupees have been equivalent to two rupees before 1873.\n\nFor the intermediate period, between 1873 and 1899, it is manifestly impossible to adopt any fixed sterling value for a constantly changing rupee. But since 1899, if it is desired to convert rupees into sterling, not only must the final cipher be struck off (as before 1873), but also one-third must be subtracted from the result. Thus Rs. 1,000 = \u00a3100 - $\\frac{1}{3}$ = (about) \u00a367.\n\nAnother matter in connexion with the expression of money statements in terms of rupees requires to be explained. The method of numerical notation in India differs from that which prevails throughout Europe. Large numbers are not punctuated in hundreds of thousands and millions, but in lakhs and crores. A lakh is one hundred thousand (written out as 1,00,000), and a crore is one hundred lakhs or ten millions (written out as 1,00,00,000). Consequently, according to the exchange value of the rupee, a lakh of rupees (Rs. 1,00,000) may be read as the equivalent of \u00a310,000 before 1873, and as the equivalent of (about) \u00a36,667 after 1899; while a crore of rupees (Rs. 1,00,00,000) may similarly be read as the equivalent of \u00a31,00,00,000 before 1873, and as the equivalent of (about) \u00a3666,667 after 1899.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that the rupee is divided into 16 annas, a fraction commonly used for many purposes by both natives and Europeans. The anna was formerly reckoned as 1$\\frac{1}{2}$d.; it may now be considered as exactly corresponding to 1d. The anna is again subdivided into 12 pies.\n\nThe various systems of weights used in India combine uniformity of scale with immense variations in the weight of units. The scale used generally throughout Northern India, and less commonly in Madras and Bombay, may be thus expressed: one maund = 40 seers, one seer = 16 chittaks or 80 tolas. The actual weight of a seer varies greatly from District to District, and even from village to village; but in the standard system the tola is 180 grains Troy (the exact weight of the rupee), and the seer thus weighs 2.057 lb., and the maund 82.28 lb. This standard is used in official reports and throughout the Gazetteer.\n\nFor calculating retail prices, the universal custom in India is to express them in terms of seers to the rupee. Thus, when prices change, what varies is not the amount of money to be paid for the\nsame quantity, but the quantity to be obtained for the same amount of money. In other words, prices in India are quantity prices, not money prices. When the figure of quantity goes up, this of course means that the price has gone down, which is at first sight perplexing to an English reader. It may, however, be mentioned that quantity prices are not altogether unknown in England, especially at small shops, where pennyworths of many groceries can be bought. Eggs, likewise, are commonly sold at a varying number for the shilling.\n\nIf it be desired to convert quantity prices from Indian into English denominations without having recourse to money prices (which would often be misleading), the following scale may be adopted\u2014based upon the assumptions that a seer is exactly 2 lb., and that the value of the rupee remains constant at 1s. 4d.: 1 seer per rupee = (about) 3 lb. for 2s.; 2 seers per rupee = (about) 6 lb. for 2s.; and so on.\n\nThe name of the unit for square measurement in India generally is the bigha, which varies greatly in different parts of the country. But areas have always been expressed throughout the Gazetteer either in square miles or in acres.\nEinme (Thigwin).\u2014North-west township of Myaungmya District, Lower Burma, lying between $16^\\circ 34'$ and $16^\\circ 55'$ N. and $94^\\circ 52'$ and $95^\\circ 18'$ E., with an area of 315 square miles. The population was 41,979 in 1891 and 59,367 in 1901, distributed in 122 villages. The head-quarters are at Einme (population, 2,050), on a waterway connecting the Dag\u0101 and Myaungmya rivers. The township is level, well watered, and fertile throughout. More than one-third of the population is Karen, and the proportion of Christians is large. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 170 square miles, paying Rs. 2,51,000 land revenue.\n\nEksambe.\u2014Village in the Chikodi taluka of Belgaum District, Bombay, situated in $16^\\circ 32'$ N. and $74^\\circ 40'$ E. Population (1901), 5,970. The village is purely agricultural, and contains one boys' school with 90 pupils.\n\nEksar.\u2014Alienated village of 701 acres in the Salsette taluka of Th\u0101na District, Bombay, situated in $19^\\circ 13'$ N. and $72^\\circ 59'$ E., about a mile north-west of Borivli station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. Population (1901), 1,906. In a mango orchard, on the west bank of a fine pond, is a row of six slabs of trap, four of them about 10 feet high by 3 broad, the fifth about 3 feet high by 3 broad, and the sixth about 4 feet high by 1 broad. All, except one which is broken, have their tops carved into funereal urns, with heavy ears and hanging bows of ribbon, and floating figures above bringing chaplets and wreaths. The faces of the slabs are richly cut in from two to eight level belts of carving, the figures in bold relief chiselled with much skill. They are Hindu p\u0101liy\u0101s or memorial stones, and seem to have been set up in front of a temple which stood on the top of the pond bank, a site afterwards occupied by a Portuguese granary. Each stone records the prowess of some warrior either by land or sea.\n\n[For a full description of these stones, which possess features of unusual interest, see Bombay Gazetteer, vol. xiv, pp. 57-9.]\n\nElephanta (or Gharapuri).\u2014Island included in the Panvel taluka\nof Kolaba District, Bombay, situated in $18^\\circ 58' N.$ and $73^\\circ E.$, in Bombay harbour, about 6 miles from Bombay City and 4 from the shore of the mainland. The island measures from 4 to $4\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in circumference, and consists of two long hills separated by a narrow valley; the superficial area varies from 6 to 4 square miles according as the tide is at ebb or flow. On the west side it furnishes building stone of medium quality, which is at present being extensively quarried by the contractors to the Bombay Port Trust for use in the new docks. The island was named Elephanta by the Portuguese, from a large stone elephant which stood near the old landing-place on the south side of the island. This elephant was 13 feet 2 inches in length, and about 7 feet 4 inches high; but its head and neck dropped off in 1814, and subsequently the body sank down into a shapeless mass of stones, which were removed in 1864 to the Victoria Gardens in Bombay.\n\nNear the point where the two hills approach each other, and not far to the south-east of the Great Cave, once stood the stone statue of a horse, described by an early writer as being \u2018so lively, with such a colour and carriage, and the shape finisht with that Exactness that many have rather fancied it, at a distance, a living Animal, than only a bare Representation.\u2019 This statue has disappeared. Except on the north-east and east the hill-sides are covered with brushwood; in the hollows under the hill are clusters of mango, tamarind, and karanja trees. A broken line of palms stands out against the sky along the crest of the hill. Below is a belt of rice land. The foreshore is of sand and mud, bare and black, with a fringe of mangrove bushes. At one period, from the third to perhaps the tenth century, the island is supposed to have been the site of a city, and a place of religious resort. Some archaeologists would place here the Maurya city of Puri. The caves are the chief objects of interest; but in the rice-fields to the east of the northern or Shet landing-place brick and stone foundations, broken pillars, fallen statues of Siva, and other traces of an ancient city have been found. The landing-place is now on the north-west of the island.\n\nThe famous rock-caves are the resort of many visitors. Of these wonderful excavations, four are complete or nearly so; a fifth is a large cave now much filled up, with only rough masses of stone left to support the roof; and a sixth is merely the beginning of the front of what seems to have been intended for a very small excavation\u2014possibly two or three cells for recluses. The most important and most frequently visited of these Br\u00e4hmanic rock-temples is the Great Cave, which is situated in the western or larger of the two hills of the island at an elevation of about 250 feet above high-water level. The entrance is reached by a winding path about three-quarters of a mile in length from the landing-place. The cave faces the north, and is entirely hewn out of a hard compact variety of trap rock. From the front entrance to the back it\nmeasures about 130 feet, and its length from the east to the west entrance is the same. It does not, however, occupy the entire square of this area. What may be called the porticoes, or the three open sides, are only about 54 feet long and 16\u00bd feet deep. Omitting these and the back aisle, immediately in front of three of the principal sculptured compartments, which is of about the same dimensions as each portico, the body of the cave may be considered as a square of about 91 feet each way, supported by six rows of columns, with six columns in each row, except at the corners, where the uniformity is broken on the west side to make room for the shrine, which occupies a space equal to that enclosed by four of the columns. There were originally 26 columns, with 16 half-columns; but 8 of the separate pillars have been destroyed, and others are much injured. As neither the floor nor the roof is perfectly horizontal, they vary in height from 15 to 17 feet. The most striking of the sculptures is the famous colossal three-faced bust, or trimurti, at the back of the cave, facing the entrance. This is a representation of Siva in his threefold character of Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer; and all the other sculptures relate to the same god, the cave being, like every other Hindu rock-temple of Western India, a Saiva one. The trimurti is 17 feet 10 inches in height; and a line drawn round the three heads at the level of the eyes measures 22 feet 9 inches in length. The length of the middle face (Brahma\u2019s) is 4 feet 4 inches; those of the others (Vishnu and Rudra) 4 feet 1 inch and about 5 feet. In 1865 this unique bust was mutilated by some \u2018barbarian clothed in the garb of civilization,\u2019 who broke off a portion of the noses of two of the faces; and since then some of the other sculptures in the temple have been similarly treated, so that it has been found necessary to place a sergeant and two native policemen to protect the cave. The trimurti is guarded by two gigantic dvarapalas or \u2018doorkeepers\u2019 of rock, respectively 12 feet 9 inches and 13 feet 6 inches high; both figures are much defaced. The lingam chapel, on the right-hand side of the temple on entering, contains several dvarapalas and other figures; and two compartments on either side of the trimurti are also ornamented with numerous sculptured groups. There are several other compartments in the Great Cave, all containing interesting sculptures. Further details will be found in the exhaustive account of Dr. Burgess (The Rock Temples of Elephanta or Gharapuri, Bombay, 1871), from which this article is chiefly condensed.\n\n\u2018The impression on the mind,\u2019 writes Dr. Burgess, \u2018may be imagined rather than described, when one enters the portico [of the Great Cave], passing from the glare and heat of tropical sunshine to the dim light and cool air of the temple, and realizes that he is under a vast roof of solid rock, that seems to be supported only by the ranges of massive columns that recede in the vistas on every side, some of which appear to have\nsplit or fallen under the tremendous superincumbent weight. And the feeling of strange uncertain awe that creeps over the mind is only prolonged when in the obscure light we began to contemplate the gigantic stony figures ranged along the walls from which they seem to start, and from the living rock of which they are hewn.'\n\nDe Conto describes the stone of the mountain where the temples have been carved as of a grey colour. The same traveller, writing at the beginning of the seventeenth century, continues:\n\n'But the whole body inside, the pillars, the figures, and everything else, was formerly covered with a coat of lime mixed with bitumen and other compositions, that made the temple bright and very beautiful, the features and workmanship showing very distinct, so that neither in silver nor in wax could such figures be engraved with greater nicety, fineness, or perfection.'\n\nAt the present time there is no trace of this coating.\n\nThe Second Cave, which is situated a short distance to the southeast of the Great Cave, faces east-north-east, and is 109\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet in length, including the chapel at the north end. The fa\u00e7ade, which was nearly 80 feet in length, is completely destroyed, and the cave is so full of debris and so ruined by water that no proper estimate can now be formed of the appearance it originally represented. It contains at present only one sculptured group. At the south end of the portico of this cave is a large block of rock not hewn away, above which is a hole through a thin partition of rock into one of the cells of the Third Cave. The proper entrance, however, is a little to the south. This cave is in an even more dilapidated condition than the second.\n\nThe Fourth Cave, now known to the natives as 'Sit\u0101 Bai's Devala,' is situated on the other hill of the island, and about 100 feet above the level of the Great Cave. It is in better preservation than those last mentioned, and had formerly a beautiful gate with a marble porch of exquisite workmanship; but these have now disappeared.\n\nSufficient data do not exist to enable us to fix with precision the date of the Elephanta caves. Tradition attributes them variously to the P\u0101ndavas, to a king of Kanara named B\u0101n\u0101s\u016br, and to Alexander the Great; and many not less unreasonable conjectures have been hazarded regarding them. Mr. Fergusson concludes (for reasons for which the reader is referred to his Rock-cut Temples of India) that the Great Cave was excavated in the tenth century A.D.; but Dr. Burgess, while admitting that there are grounds for this conclusion, is inclined to attribute them to the latter part of the eighth or to the ninth century. No inscription is now to be found in the caves. It is hoped, however, that the date and name of the excavator may yet be learned from a stone, taken to Europe about 1540 by the Portuguese Viceroy Dom Jo\u00e3o de Castro, which may one day be rediscovered and deciphered.\nThe Great Cave is still used on Saiva festivals, and especially by Hindus of the Bani\u0101 caste; and at the Sivar\u0101tri, the greatest of the Saiva festivals, just before the first new moon falling after the middle of February, a religious fair is held here. The view from the front of the Great Cave is very beautiful; and from the site of an old bungalow, not far from the porch, a fine prospect is commanded of Bombay harbour, with Butcher Island in the foreground. The island had a population of 480 in 1901.\n\nElgandal District\u00b9.\u2014Former District in the Warangal Division, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, lying between Adil\u0101b\u0101d and Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d on the north and north-west, Medak on the west, and Warangal on the south, while on the east the rivers Pr\u0101nhita and God\u0101vari separated it from Ch\u0101nda District and Bastar State of the Central Provinces. It had an area of 7,203 square miles, including j\u0101g\u012br lands, and lay between 17\u00b0 14' and 19\u00b0 15' N. and 78\u00b0 30' and 80\u00b0 25' E. The area of the State and Sarf-i-kh\u0101s or crown lands was 5,898 square miles. Changes made in 1905 will be referred to below. A range of hills, commencing at Gurrapalli, runs in a north-easterly direction as far as Jagtial, whence it proceeds to Vemalkurti near the God\u0101vari river. A second range, known as the Sunigram range, proceeds from Sunigram and Mallang\u016br parallel to the former range, at a distance of about 32 miles. The villages of Kuncherla, Minola, and Marmulagutta on this range are between 2,200 and 2,300 feet above the sea. A third range starts in the south-west corner of the District from the valley of the M\u0101ner river, and runs in a north-easterly direction. Intersecting the Sunigram range, it passes beyond R\u0101ng\u016br, where it is about 1,600 feet above the sea. This range ends near the river God\u0101vari. The most important river is the God\u0101vari, which enters the north-west corner of the District and flows for a distance of 176 miles within its limits, dividing it from Ch\u0101nda and Bastar in the Central Provinces. Another important river is the M\u0101ner, which traverses the District from west to east as far as K\u0101rla-gunta, whence it flows due north till it falls into the God\u0101vari in the Mah\u0101deopur t\u0101luk. Its length in the District is about 145 miles. The Pranhit\u0101, another tributary of the God\u0101vari, joins it in the Chinn\u016br t\u0101luk. The Peddav\u0101gu, 50 miles long, and the Chelluv\u0101gu, 12 miles long, are also tributaries of the God\u0101vari, which they join on the southern or right bank.\n\nThe geological formations are the Archaean gneiss, the Cuddapah, Sullavai, and Gondw\u0101na series, the latter including the T\u0101lcher, Bar\u0101kar, K\u0101mptee, Kota-M\u0101leri, and Chikil\u0101 formations. The\n\n\u00b9 Elgandal ceased to exist in its present form in 1905. The new District called Kar\u012bmnagar is briefly described in the paragraph on Population. See also Kar\u012bmnagar District.\nArchaean series occupies most of the District, the remaining formations occurring at its eastern end.\n\nAmong the trees of the District may be mentioned teak, mango, ebony, custard apple, tamarind, black-wood, tarvar (Cassia auriculata), jatam (Acacia arabica), oppa (Hardwickia binata), and nallamaddi (Terminalia tomentosa).\n\nAll kinds of large game abound, including tigers, bears, leopards, wolves, hyenas, simbar, spotted deer, &c., while peafowl, jungle-fowl, partridges, and quails are also found. In the vicinity of tanks and rivers water-fowl, duck, teal, &c., are abundant.\n\nThe portions of the District near the Godavari are malarious; but the remaining taluks are healthy. The temperature in Karimnagar and Jamikunta rises in May to $110^\\circ$, while in the rest of the taluks the maximum varies between $100^\\circ$ and $105^\\circ$. During December it falls to $60^\\circ$.\n\nThe annual rainfall for the twenty-one years ending 1901 averaged 33 inches, but considerable fluctuations are recorded. Thus in 1881 and 1900 only 15 inches, or less than half the average, was received.\n\nNothing is known of the early history of the District; but it certainly formed part of the Warangal territory, and after the conquest of Telengana by the Musalmans, and the fall of Warangal, it was included successively in the Bahmani and the Kuth Shahi kingdoms. Upon the conquest of Golconda, it was annexed to the empire of Delhi by Aurangzeb, but was again separated from it on the foundation of the Hyderab\u0101d State, early in the eighteenth century, by Asaf Jah.\n\nPlaces of archaeological interest comprise a number of forts, temples, and mosques. The fort at Elgandal is an ancient structure, and contains a mosque built by Zafar-ud-daula about 1754, with a minaret which oscillates if shaken. In the Jamikunta taluk are the two forts of B\u0101jg\u016br and Malang\u016br, said to have been built respectively 700 and 1,000 years ago, and the two temples of Gursh\u0101l and Katk\u016br, the former built about 1229, during the reign of R\u0101j\u0101 Prat\u0101p Rudra of Warangal. Though now in ruins, its exquisite stone carving is still in a good state of preservation. A pillar outside the temple has an inscription in Oriya. The fort of Jagtial was built for Zafar-ud-daula in 1747, by French engineers. In the same taluk is an old temple at Dharampuri on the right bank of the Godavari. The old fort of Anantagiri in the Sirsilla taluk, now in ruins, is built on a hill. Two mosques in the Mah\u0101deopur taluk, one at K\u0101lesar and the other at Sonipet, were built by Aurangzeb, as was the mosque at R\u0101jgop\u0101lpet in the Siddipet taluk. Prat\u0101pgiri fort, in the Mah\u0101deopur taluk, is said to have been built by R\u0101j\u0101 Prat\u0101p Rudra.\n\n---\n\n1 W. King, Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. xviii, part iii.\nThe number of towns and villages in the District is 1,523. The population at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 939,539, (1891) 1,094,601, and (1901) 1,035,582. The decrease during the last decade was due to cholera and distress during the famine of 1900. The important towns are JAGTIAL, KORATLA, MANTHANI, KAKIMNAGAR, the District head-quarters, and VEMALWAD\u0100. About 96 per cent. of the population are Hindus. Telugu is spoken by 90 per cent. and Urdu by 6 per cent.

In its present form the District, henceforth to be known as Karimnagar, comprises the seven taluks of Karimnagar, Sultanabad, Mahadeopur, Jamikunta, Park\u0101l, Sirsilla, and Jagtial.\n\nThe purely agricultural castes number 164,000, or about 16 per cent. of the total, the most important being Kunbis (80,000), Mitaiwars (28,000), and Velmas (21,000). The Br\u0101hmans muster strong, being 221,000, or over 21 per cent. The Dhangars or shepherds number 80,000, excluding Hatkars (64,400) and Kurmas (21,800). The S\u0101las, or weaver caste, number 80,400; the M\u0101las, or village menials, 67,300; the Komatis, or traders, 39,600; and the Ausalas, or smith caste, 30,000. More than 35 per cent. of the population are engaged in agriculture.\n\nA Wesleyan mission was started in 1884 at Karimnagar, with a European missionary and a staff of native catechists, and has branches at Kottapali and M\u0101nakondur. The mission supports several schools and a dispensary. The Wesleyan mission at Siddipet, established in 1886, maintains nine schools. The Census of 1901 showed the Christian population as 214, of whom 212 were natives.\nThe soils consist of chalka, masab, and regar. The regar is utilized for rabi crops, the masab partly for garden crops and partly for rabi, while the kharif crops are raised on chalka lands, which occupy about three-fifths of the entire cultivated area. The existence of numerous tanks is a marked feature. The alluvial soils of the river valleys are very fertile.\n\nThe tenure of lands is mainly ryotwari. Khalsa and crown lands occupy 5,808 square miles, of which 1,244 were cultivated in 1901; cultivable waste and fallows covered 778 square miles, 3,018 were forest, and 858 were not available for cultivation. The staple food-crop is jowar, grown on 570 square miles, or 45 per cent. of the net area cropped. Next to it is rice with 169 square miles. The areas occupied by gram, cotton, pulses, and oilseeds were 11, 58, 225, and 197 square miles respectively.\n\nNo breed of cattle is characteristic of the District; those found are small, but are well suited for light ploughing in the chalka lands. Ponies of very inferior class are bred. The sheep and goats are of the ordinary kind.\n\nThe irrigated lands cover an area of 183 square miles. The principal sources of irrigation are 5,694 tanks, large and small, and 16,693 masonry and 6,323 unbricked wells, all in good repair. A staff of irrigation engineers is engaged in preparing estimates for the tanks in disrepair, which number over 1,750.\n\nThe District contains large tracts of forest, especially in the taluks of Chinnur, Mahadeopur, Lakhsetipet, and in parts of Jagtial and Sirsilla, all under the Forest department. The total area of forests is 3,018 square miles, of which 816 square miles are \u2018reserved,\u2019 and 2,202 square miles protected and unprotected forests. The trees include teak, ebony, rosewood, satinwood, somi (Soymida febrifuga), tirman (Anogeissus latifolia), sandra (Acacia Catechu), kodsha (Cleistanthus collinus), eppa (Hardwickia binata), nallamaddi (Terminalia tomentosa), and chinnangi (Lagerstroemia parviflora), all of which produce good timber.\n\nIronstone of very good quality is found almost everywhere, and is smelted by a primitive process for making ploughshares and other implements of husbandry. The Konasamudram and Ibrahimpatan steel is famous for the fine watered sword-blades that were formerly made from it. Steatite and talc are found in the vicinity of the iron mines throughout the District.\n\nSilk saris and scarfs are made in the Siddipet and Jagtial taluks and exported to Hyderabad. Coarse cotton cloth of every description is made in all parts and is extensively used by the people. The Salas or Khatris, who number over 80,000, are engaged in weaving silk and cotton cloth. Coarse paper is manufactured at Koratla in the Jagtial taluk,\nand used by the *patw\u0101ris* for their village account-books. In Chinn\u016br, silk cloth is made from *tasar* cocoons, which is strong and durable. Silver filigree work of superior quality is turned out by the goldsmiths of Karimnagar and M\u0101nakond\u016br. Fine brass vessels are also made. There is a tannery at Karimnagar, established in 1869: it employs 30 workmen and turns out leather to the value of Rs. 73,000 annually, which is exported to Madras.\n\nThe chief exports consist of rice, *jow\u0101r*, sesamum, mustard, castor-seed, tobacco, silk cloth, cotton, chillies, sheep, hides and leather, bones and horns, and brass vessels, which are sent to Warangal and Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. The principal imports are cotton and woollen cloth of European manufacture, glass-ware, refined sugar, jaggery, silver and gold, salt, opium, kerosene oil, and brass and copper sheets. The chief centres of trade are Siddipet, Peddapalli, Kam\u0101npur, Jagtial, Ghambiraopet, and Karimnagar. The Komatis are the chief trading caste.\n\nNo railway passes through the District. There are 202 miles of road, of which 168 are gravelled, the rest being merely fair-weather roads. The principal route is the Karimnagar-K\u0101zipet road. The other roads connect the District and *t\u0101luk* head-quarters with one another.\n\nElgandal has generally been immune from famine, owing to its numerous tanks and wells and large forest tracts. In 1897, though the rainfall was about 28 inches, it fell at such inopportune periods and in such small quantities that the majority of the crops failed. Relief works were opened to alleviate the distress. The effects of the famine had not passed away when cholera supervened, and carried off a large number of people, as is evidenced by the decline of population at the Census of 1901. The great famine of 1900 did not affect this District very seriously.\n\nThe District, as now constituted, is divided into four subdivisions for administrative purposes. The first consists of the *t\u0101luks* of Jamikunta and Park\u0101l; the second of Sult\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d and Mah\u0101-deopur; the third of Jagtial and Sirsilla; and the fourth of Karimnagar. Each of the first two is under a Second T\u0101lukd\u0101r, and each of the other two under a Third T\u0101lukd\u0101r. The First T\u0101lukd\u0101r exercises a general supervision over all his subordinates. Each *t\u0101luk* is under a *tahsild\u0101r*.\n\nThe First T\u0101lukd\u0101r is the Chief Magistrate, as well as the Civil Judge of the District, and has a Judicial Assistant. The *tahsild\u0101rs* preside in the subordinate civil courts. The Judicial Assistant is a joint-magistrate. The Second and Third T\u0101lukd\u0101rs and the *tahsild\u0101rs* exercise magisterial powers of the second and third class within their respective jurisdictions.\n\nUp to 1866, villages and *t\u0101luks* were leased out to revenue farmers, and in some instances collections were made from individual ryots, but\nthe State due was received in kind on a summary estimate. After the formation of the District, the ryotwari system was adopted, and the lands were roughly measured, the assessment being fixed on the average of the previous ten years. The District has not yet been completely surveyed, and the old rates are still in force. The average assessment on 'dry' land is Rs. 1-0-0 (maximum Rs. 5-0-0, minimum Rs. 0-2-0), and on 'wet' land Rs. 12-0-0 (maximum Rs. 36-0-0, minimum Rs. 4-0-0). The land revenue and total revenue for a series of years are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1903 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Land revenue   | 13.79| 22.60| 24.39| 18.28|\n| Total revenue  | 24.13| 31.41| 36.80| 28.86|\n\nOwing to the changes in area made in 1905, the revenue demand is now about 22.6 lakhs.\n\nThe one-anna cess has been levied since 1903. Taluk boards have been established at all taluk head-quarters, except Karimnagar, where there is a District board, which supervises the work of the taluk boards as well as that of the Karimnagar and other municipalities. Small municipal establishments are maintained at all the taluk head-quarters.\n\nThe First Talukdar is the head of the police administration of the District, with a Superintendent (Mohtamim) as his executive deputy. Under the latter are 10 inspectors, 75 subordinate officers, 608 constables and 25 mounted police, distributed among 36 thanas and 35 outposts. The District jail is at Karimnagar, but prisoners whose terms exceed six months are sent to the Central jail at Warangal.\n\nThe District occupies a low position as regards the literacy of its population, of whom only 1.8 per cent. (3.3 males and 0.08 females) were able to read and write in 1901. The total number of pupils under instruction in State schools in 1881, 1891, 1901, and 1903 was 527, 2,948, 2,732, and 2,870 respectively. In 1903 there were 40 primary and 2 middle schools, with 27 girls under instruction in that year. The total expenditure on education in 1901 was Rs. 18,600, of which Rs. 1,836 was allotted to aided schools. The fee receipts amounted to Rs. 1,012 in the State schools and Rs. 227 in the aided schools.\n\nThere were five dispensaries in the District in 1901, with accommodation for 19 in-patients. The total number of out-patients treated was 39,514 and of in-patients 113, and the number of operations performed was 649. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 15,400. The number of persons vaccinated in the same year was 3,597, or 3.47 per 1,000 of the population.\n\nEllichpur District (Ellichpur).\u2014District of Berar, lying between 20\u00b0 50' and 21\u00b0 47' N. and 76\u00b0 40' and 77\u00b0 54' E., with an area of\n2,605 square miles, which in 1905 was added to Amraoti District. It was bounded on the north-west and north by the Tapti river and the Betul District of the Central Provinces; on the east by Amraoti; on the south by the Purna river and the Akot and Jalgaon taluks; and on the west by the Nimar District of the Central Provinces. The area contains two entirely distinct natural divisions: the Melghat taluk, situated in the Gawilgarh hill ranges, and the taluks of Ellichpur and Daryapur, situated in the Payanghat, or central valley of Berar. The scenery of these two tracts is described generally in the article on Berar. That portion of the District which lies in the plains is generally better wooded than the rest of the Payanghat; and at the base of the hills the soil is stony, and the country is cut up by streams and small rivers which are liable to freshes in the rainy season. The blue range of hills relieves the scenery from the monotony which characterizes the landscape in other parts of the Payanghat.\n\nThe river system consists of streams which rise in the Gawilgarh hills, and flow either northwards into the Tapti or southwards into the Purna, which is itself a tributary of the Tapti and drains the central valley of Berar. Towards the hot season all these streams dry up, save in parts where dohos hold a supply of water which lasts throughout the dry months of the year. These dohos, which are natural cavities worn out of the solid rock by the rush of water from above, are found chiefly in the hills. Lower down the water lies in large sheets.\n\nThe geology of that portion of the District which lies in the Payanghat is described in the article on Berar. Here the Deccan trap is covered with a layer of alluvial black loam, which is everywhere, except at the base of the hills, of considerable depth. The Gawilgarh hills are formed chiefly of compact basalt, very much resembling that of the Giant\u2019s Causeway. It is found columnar in many places; and at Gawilgarh it appears stratified, the summits of several hills presenting a continued stratum of many thousand yards in length. The basalt frequently and suddenly changes into a wacke, of all degrees of induration, and of every variety of composition usually found among trap rock.\n\nThe forest vegetation of the Melghat taluk will be noticed under the head of Forests. In the plains and at the foot of the hills, the commonest trees are the tamarind, the mahua, the mango, the babul, and the hivur. The weedy vegetation of cultivated lands resembles that of Central India and the Deccan. In the Melghat orchids are fairly common; and, owing to the heavier rainfall, the ground vegetation is more luxuriant and more varied in colour than that of the plains. Wild balsams and other flowering plants are common.\n\nThe hill forests contain tigers, leopards, bears, bison, sambar, barking-\ndeer, and spotted deer. Peafowl abound, and the grey jungle-fowl (*Gallus sonneratii*) and spur-fowl are common. The plains are now so covered with cultivation that game is scarce. Hog, *nilgai*, *chinkara*, and antelope are, however, found. Of monkeys there are two kinds: the *langur*, found in both the plains and the hills; and the small red monkey, found only in the hills.\n\nThe climate of the two *t\u0101lukas* in the plains resembles that of the rest of the Ber\u0101r valley; but the country immediately under the hills is, as is usual in such tracts in India, malarious and unhealthy. The same may be said of the valleys of the Melgh\u0101t. On the higher plateaux of the G\u0101wilgarh hills the climate is pleasant and temperate throughout the year, the mean temperature at the sanitarium of Chikalda in May, July, and December being $85.5^\\circ$, $74.5^\\circ$, and $65^\\circ$.\n\nThe Melgh\u0101t receives more rain than any tract in the Province. The average for the six years ending 1901, which included two years of deficient rainfall, was 65 inches. The rainfall in the plains does not vary from that recorded elsewhere in the Ber\u0101r valley. The rainfall at Ellichpur in 1901, which may be taken as a normal year, was just short of 26 inches. The District has been fortunate in escaping serious natural calamities other than famine.\n\nThe history of the District centres in that of Ellichpur, the chief town, and the old fortress of G\u0101wilgarh. Until the Assignment in 1853, when Amraoti became the administrative head-quarters of the province, Ellichpur was always regarded as the capital of Ber\u0101r, although during Akbar's wars with Ahmadnagar, in the latter part of the sixteenth century, B\u0101lapur, in Akola District, became, on account of its position, the head-quarters of the imperial army of the Deccan.\n\nEllichpur was included, immediately after the Assignment, in the District of East Ber\u0101r, the head-quarters of which were at Amraoti; but in 1867 it was separated from Amraoti and became a District under the charge of a Deputy-Commissioner. Ellichpur at first included the *t\u0101luk* of Morsi, which was, however, after a short time, retransferred to Amraoti.\n\nThe District contains some of the most interesting archaeological remains in Ber\u0101r, which are described in the articles on Ellichpur Town and G\u0101wilgarh. They consist of the G\u0101wilgarh fort with its buildings, especially the large mosque (1425), the Pir Fath, or south-western gate (1488), and the bastion of Bahr\u0101m (1577). The shrine at Ellichpur, which bears the name of the mythical hero, Sh\u0101h Abdur Rahm\u0101n, is probably the tomb of F\u012broz Sh\u0101h Bahmani's general, who was slain at Kherla in 1400. There is an old building at Ellichpur, locally known as Barkul. It is believed that it dates from the time of the Khilji Sult\u0101ns of Delhi, and its name is said to be a corruption of *b\u0101rg\u0101h-i-kull*, or 'hall of public audience.'\nThe number of towns and villages in the District is 794. The population at each of the last enumerations has been: (1867) 278,629, (1881) 313,412, (1891) 315,616, (1901) 297,403. Population. The decline in 1901, which was due to the famine of 1899\u20131900, does not entirely represent actual diminution of population, but is partly accounted for by the northward emigration of Kork\u016bs from the Melgh\u0101t into the Central Provinces. The District was divided into the three taluks of Ellichpur, Dary\u0101pur, and Melgh\u0101t. The headquarters of the first two are at the places from which they take their names, and of the last at Chikalda. The six towns are Ellichpur Town, Paratw\u0101da (the civil station), Anjangaon, Karasgaon, Sirasgaon, and Ch\u0101nd\u016br Bazar.\n\nThe following table gives, for each taluk, particulars of area, towns and villages, and population in 1901:\n\n| Taluk     | Area in square miles | Number of | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1861 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-----------|----------------------|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Ellichpur | 469                  | 5         | 214                       | 146,935                                                  | 311                                    | 9,958                                  |\n| Dary\u0101pur  | 505                  | 1         | 244                       | 114,998                                                  | 227                                    | 5,723                                  |\n| Melgh\u0101t   | 1,631                | ...       | 330                       | 36,670                                                   | 22                                     | 580                                    |\n| District total | 2,605              | 6         | 788                       | 297,403                                                  | 114                                    | 16,261                                 |\n\nEllichpur is the most densely, and Melgh\u0101t, with a population of no more than 22 to the square mile, the most sparsely populated taluk in Ber\u0101r. More than 78 per cent. of the population are Hindus. The vernacular of the District is Mar\u0101th\u012b, but Urdu is more commonly spoken than in other Districts, owing to the influence of the Muhammadan town of Ellichpur. The Kork\u016bs of the hills have their own language, which is a Mund\u0101 dialect; and the small and rapidly disappearing tribe of Nih\u0101ls formerly spoke a language of their own which is believed, though on insufficient authority, to have exhibited Dravidian affinities. They now speak Kork\u016b, and the Nih\u0101li language is probably completely lost.\n\nKumb\u012bs (68,000) are by far the most numerous caste in the District. Next to them in numbers come Mah\u0101rs (36,000) Musalm\u0101ns (30,000), Kork\u016bs (25,000), and M\u0101lis (25,000). Br\u0101hmans number no more than 7,700. Ethnologically the Kork\u016bs and the Nih\u0101ls (1,800) are the most interesting tribes in the District. The G\u0101wilgarh hills are the home of both. The former are a tribe of hill and forest men speaking a Mund\u0101 dialect; and the latter are a rapidly disappearing tribe, who seem to have held, in comparatively recent times, the position of helots among the Kork\u016bs, though it may be doubted whether they were always\nsubordinate to them. Ellichpur is mainly an agricultural District; but the proportion (67 per cent.) of those who live by agriculture to the whole population is lower than in any other District in the province, and the percentage of those who live by industries (16) is higher.\n\nThere are two Christian missions: one of the Roman Church, under the management of the Order of St. Francis of Sales, and the Kork\u016b and Central Indian Hill Mission, which is a Protestant mission. Both missions did excellent work in the two recent famines in the Melgh\u0101t. The Roman Catholic mission owns a small village, Mariampur, near Chikalda. Of the 363 Christians enumerated in 1901, 285 were natives, of whom 215 were Roman Catholics.\n\nThe Melgh\u0101t differs as much from the rest of the District in agricultural conditions as it does in climate and altitude. Agricultural conditions in the plains are similar to those prevailing throughout the Ber\u0101r valley. Here the soil is a rich black loam of considerable depth, except in the tract at the base of the hills, which is principally forest land. In the hills the soil, except in the valleys, is poorer and shallower than that in the plains, and the country is chiefly covered with forests; but where cultivation is found, the heavier rainfall compensates in some measure for the comparative poverty of the soil.\n\nThe tenures are almost entirely ryotw\u0101ri. J\u0101gir, ij\u0101ra, and in\u0101m lands, which are found chiefly in the Melgh\u0101t, cover only 124\u00bd square miles out of 2,617. The chief agricultural statistics in 1903-4 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste | Forest |\n|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|--------|\n| 2,617 | 1,085\u00bd     | 5         | 46               | 1,389  |\n\nThe staple food-grain is jow\u0101r or great millet, varied in the hills by kodo (Paspalum frumentaceum) and r\u0101l (Panicum sativum). The area under jow\u0101r was 286 square miles, and 'other cereals,' including kodo and r\u0101l, occupied 264\u00bd square miles in the hills. Rice and wheat were formerly grown in the Melgh\u0101t more extensively than at present; in 1903-4 they occupied only 32 and 7 square miles. The latter covered 77 square miles in the plains. The areas under cotton, pulses, and oilseeds were 496, 85, and 45 square miles. These crops, except pulses, which occupy nearly equal areas in the hills and the plains, are grown chiefly in the plains. It has been said that the tea plant thrives on the higher plateaux of the Melgh\u0101t, but it is not grown there now. Excellent coffee is grown in private gardens at Chikalda, but its cultivation on a large scale has not been attempted.\n\nThe extension of the area of holdings has only amounted to 4.6 per cent. in the last thirty-three years. There is, however, no room for\nextension in the plains, where practically the whole of the arable land is already occupied. In the hills a considerable area has gone out of cultivation since the famine of 1899\u20131900. It is not likely that cultivation will ever be much extended in this tract, more than 85 per cent. of which is forest. Little or nothing has been done towards the improvement of agricultural products. On the contrary, the fine, long-stapled cotton for which Ber\u0101r was formerly famous has practically disappeared, its place being taken by a coarser, short-stapled variety which is more prolific and demands less attention than the old variety. The ryots have availed themselves less freely of the Loans Acts than those of any District in Ber\u0101r, except Wun, where famine has been less severe than elsewhere. In the three years following the famine of 1899\u20131900 only Rs. 72,000 was disbursed, and it is only since that year that the people have applied for advances.\n\nThe Umarda, or smaller variety of the Ber\u0101ri breed of cattle, was formerly the principal breed in the District; but since recent years of scarcity and famine large numbers of animals of the Nim\u0101ri, Hoshang\u0101b\u0101di, and M\u0101lwi breeds have been imported. Buffaloes are principally of the N\u0101gpuri breed, but a few of the M\u0101lwi breed have been imported. Ponies bred locally are weedy animals of little value; and sheep and goats are poor, except in the larger towns, where good milch goats of the Gujar\u0101ti breed are kept.\n\nThe area of land irrigated in 1903\u20134 was less than 5 miles, of which nearly all was watered from wells and was situated in the taluks in the plains. Irrigation is almost entirely confined to chillies, garden produce, and tobacco. Leathern buckets drawn with a rope and pulley by cattle working down an inclined plane are universally used for lifting the water.\n\nForests cover 56 per cent. of the whole District, and their area is about twice as great as in any other District of Ber\u0101r. About half the area is real forest land, as distinguished from rannas and grazing lands with patches of scrub and small trees which usually make up the greater part of the technical forest area. All the forests, except 38 square miles of grazing land and 95 acres of ramna, are confined to the Melgh\u0101t. They contain the usual trees of Central India, the commonest being *Boswellia*, teak, *Ougeinia*, *Adina*, *Stephegyne*, *Schrebera*, and various species of *Terminalia*. The woody climbers met with are species of *Bauhinia*, *Combretum*, and *Millettia*. In ravines and valleys a bamboo (*Dendrocalamus strictus*) occurs.\n\nArts and manufactures are unimportant, as in other Districts of Ber\u0101r. Cotton and silk fabrics are woven and dyed, principally at Anjangaon, and cotton carpets are woven at Ellichpur. The largest industry is the preparation of cotton for the market, and the District contains ten ginning factories and one press, all worked by steam.\nThe chief imports are grain and pulse, salt, and sugar; and the chief exports are raw cotton, grain and pulse, oilseeds, and forest produce. The cotton, grain and pulse, and oilseeds are exported from Ellichpur by road to Amraoti or Badnera, whence they are dispatched by rail to Bombay; and exports from Daryapur go by road to Murtazapur on the railway.\n\nThere is no railway in the District. The total length of metalled roads is 73 miles, and of unmetalled roads 40 miles. The former are in charge of the Public Works department and the latter of the District board. The principal road is the Chikalda-Amraoti road, which passes through Ellichpur town, and has a length in the District of 49 miles. An important road from Ellichpur to Daryapur via Anjangauon is under construction.\n\nThe two taluks in the plains are neither more nor less fortunate than the rest of Berar in respect of their liability to famine, and they have suffered from all famines which have fallen upon the province. A famine orphan school was established at Ellichpur by the fifth Sultan of the Bahmani dynasty, Muhammad (sometimes, but erroneously, called Mahmud) Shah, who reigned from 1378 to 1397, and in whose reign a severe famine occurred. The emperor Shah Jah\u0101n also, in the fourth year of his reign, established a poorhouse at Ellichpur, where food was distributed to the famine-stricken. Sir William Sleeman, in his *Rambles and Recollections*\u00b9, mentions that Ellichpur suffered from the famine of 1837\u20138. The Melgh\u0101t is, owing to the comparative poverty of its soil and the thriftlessness of the Kork\u016b cultivator, far more liable to famine. In 1896\u20137, when the greater part of Berar suffered only from scarcity, famine conditions prevailed here, and in the famine of 1899\u20131900 the taluk suffered very severely. At the height of the distress, in July, 1900, 25,216 persons were on relief works and 33,194 in receipt of gratuitous relief in the District, and it is estimated that 60 per cent. of the cattle died. In both famines the Forest department rendered signal service.\n\nThe District is divided into the three taluks of Ellichpur, Daryapur, and Melgh\u0101t, at the head-quarters of each of which there is a tahsild\u0101r, and since 1905 Ellichpur and Melgh\u0101t have formed a subdivision of Amraoti. The superior staff of the District consists of the usual officers.\n\nIn Ellichpur, as in other Districts of Berar, the Deputy-Commissioner was the District Judge; but here he was District Judge in more than name, for he exercised, and was not empowered to delegate, the ordinary original civil powers of a District Judge in the Melgh\u0101t, where the tahsild\u0101r exercises the powers of a subordinate civil judge. The existing machinery for the administration of justice is described in the article on Amraoti District. Serious crime is not common, but dacoit\n\n\u00b9 Vol. i, p. 190 (ed. 1893).\nties, cattle-thefts, and burglaries fluctuate considerably in numbers with the state of the season. The Kork\u016bs, though behind other classes of the population in education, and somewhat addicted to strong drink, exhibit no marked criminal propensities.\n\nAccording to the *Ain-i-Akbari*, the land revenue demand in the *parganas* which till lately formed Ellichpur District amounted to 13\u00b72 lakhs; and at the time of the Assignment in 1853 the demand in the same area had fallen to 5\u00b76 lakhs, owing to wars, maladministration, and famines. In 1903\u20134 the assessment on all land available for cultivation amounted to 12\u00b74 lakhs, or rather less than Akbar's assessment, though it is certain that cultivation is more extended now than it was in the sixteenth century. The two *t\u0101luk*s in the plains were first surveyed and assessed, after the Assignment, between the years 1868 and 1873, the settlement being made in each case for thirty years. Before its expiration revised assessment lists were prepared, but the new rates were not introduced until 1903\u20134. The assessment per acre varies from Rs. 2-11-0 to 2 annas, with an average of Rs. 1-11-3. Rice land is assessed at a maximum rate of Rs. 6 per acre, and land irrigated from streams and tanks, of which the area is only 23 acres, at a maximum combined land and water rate of Rs. 8 per acre. Land irrigated from wells sunk before the original settlement is assessed at the maximum 'dry' rate for land in the same village; but where wells have been made subsequently the cultivator is allowed the full advantage of the improvement, and the land is treated in all respects as 'dry' land. The average extent of a holding in the plains is 14\u00be acres. The Melgh\u0101t has never been regularly surveyed, and a system of assessment is in force based on the number of yokes (pairs of bullocks) employed. The maximum, minimum, and average rates per yoke are Rs. 8, Rs. 3, and Rs. 5. As a measure of relief, following on the famine of 1899-1900, one-half of the land revenue was remitted for a period of three years in this *t\u0101luk*.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1. | 1890-1. | 1900-1. | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 9,16    | 9,19    | 10,42   | 11,38  |\n| Total revenue  | 12,50   | 13,37   | 14,16   | 15,66  |\n\nBeyond the two municipal areas of Ellichpur town and civil station, the local affairs of that portion of the District which lies in the plains are administered by the District board, with the two *t\u0101luk* boards subordinate to it. The expenditure of these boards in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 87,000, of which Rs. 14,000 was spent on education, and Rs. 41,000 on public works, chiefly roads and buildings. The chief\nsources of income were Provincial rates, the bazar cess, and assessed taxes. The local affairs of the Melgh\u0101t are managed by the Deputy-Commissioner and the tahsild\u0101r.\n\nThe District Superintendent has control over the police under the Deputy-Commissioner. The number of police stations is 15, and there are four outposts. The police force numbers 367, under three inspectors, one for each t\u0101luk. The only jail in the District is that at Ellichpur, which contained in 1903 a daily average of 27 prisoners.\n\nEllichpur stands first among the six Districts of Ber\u0101r in regard to the literacy of its population, of whom 5\u00b74 per cent. (10\u00b74 males and 0\u00b73 females) were able to read and write in 1891.\n\nEducation. Its superiority would be still more marked but for the Melgh\u0101t, which in point of education is more backward than any other part of the province. In 1903\u20134 the District contained 79 public, 65 aided, 5 unaided, and 4 private schools, with a total of 7,738 pupils, of whom 5,950 attended public schools and 334 were girls.\n\nOne of the secondary and nine of the primary schools were Hindust\u0101ni schools for Muhammadan boys, five were girls\u2019 schools\u2014three for Hindu and two for Muhammadan girls\u2014and two were schools for children of aboriginal tribes in the Melgh\u0101t. All schools, except nine, were aided from public funds. The great majority of pupils under instruction were only in primary classes, and no girls had advanced beyond that stage. Of the male population of school-going age 13 per cent. were in the primary stage of instruction, and of the female population of the same age 0\u00b775 per cent. Among Musalm\u0101ns the percentage of pupils of each sex to the male and female population of school-going age was 24 and 2\u00b76. At the special schools in the Melgh\u0101t, 34 aborigines were under instruction. The total expenditure on education in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 57,268, of which Rs. 5,575 was provided from Local and municipal funds.\n\nThe District possesses 3 hospitals and 4 dispensaries, containing accommodation for 79 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 47,000, of whom 603 were in-patients, and 1,533 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 15,000, the greater part of which was met from Provincial revenues.\n\nVaccination has made much progress, and the people generally seem to be aware of its usefulness. In 1903\u20134 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 31\u00b77 per 1,000, the mean for the province being 36\u00b76. Vaccination is compulsory only in the two municipalities.\n\nIn August, 1905, when the six Districts of Ber\u0101r were reconstituted, Ellichpur ceased to exist as a separate District and was incorporated in Amrao\u016b, of which District it now forms the Ellichpur subdivision.\n\n[T\u0101luk Settlement Reports: Major R.

Bagshaw, Melgh\u0101t (1899).]\nEllichpur Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of Amraoti District, Ber\u0101r, consisting of the Ellichpur and Melgh\u0101t taluks.\n\nEllichpur Taluk.\u2014Formerly the head-quarters taluk of Ellichpur District, but since August, 1905, a taluk of Amraoti District, Ber\u0101r, lying between 21\u00b0 9' and 21\u00b0 24' N. and 77\u00b0 23' and 77\u00b0 53' E., with an area of 469 square miles. The population fell from 146,215 in 1891 to 146,035 in 1901, but its density, 311 persons per square mile, is higher than in any other taluk in Ber\u0101r. The taluk contains 214 villages and five towns: Ellichpur (population, 26,082), the head-quarters, Paratw\u0101da (10,410), Karasgaon (7,456), Sirasgaon (6,537), and Chandur Bazar (5,208). The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 5,17,000, and for cesses Rs. 41,000. The taluk lies in the P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t, and is bounded on the north by the G\u0101wilgarh hills.\n\nEllichpur Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the Ellichpur taluk of Amraoti District, Ber\u0101r, situated in 21\u00b0 16' N. and 77\u00b0 33' E. The population in 1901 numbered 26,082, of whom 18,440 were Hindus, 7,244 Musalmans, 231 Jains, and 136 Animists. Until August, 1905, Ellichpur was the head-quarters of a District of the same name.\n\nThe town of Ellichpur has an interesting history. Local legend ascribes its foundation to the eponymous R\u0101j\u0101 II, said to have been a Jain who came from the village in Ellichpur District now known as Kh\u0101n Zam\u0101nnagar, in Samvat 1115, corresponding to A.D. 1058. The legend represents him as a powerful independent R\u0101j\u0101; but from all that is known of the history of Ber\u0101r at this period it seems that the province formed part of the kingdom of Somesvara I, of the restored Ch\u0101lukya dynasty. The absurdities of the legend of the war of R\u0101j\u0101 II with Sh\u0101h Abdur-Rahm\u0101n Gh\u0101zi, a hero of the 'headless horseman' type, said to be, like S\u0101l\u0101r Masud of Bahraich, a nephew of Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni, are sufficient to cast a doubt on the very existence of R\u0101j\u0101 II; and it is not improbable that the whole story is a corruption of the Pachpiriya legends of Northern India.\n\nThe first mention of Ellichpur in authentic history is made by Barani, who describes it as being, towards the end of the thirteenth century A.D., 'one of the famous cities of the Deccan.' The city, and the district of which it was the capital, were assigned to Al\u0101-ud-din after his first expedition to Deogiri in 1294, but still remained under Hindu administration, the revenues being remitted to Delhi. On the final fall of Deogiri in 1318, the city, with the rest of Ber\u0101r, came under the direct administration of the Muhammadan conquerors. During the rule of the Bahmani Sult\u0101ns of the Deccan it was the capital of the taraf or province of Ber\u0101r. Muhammad Sh\u0101h (1378-97), the fifth king of that dynasty, established here an orphanage after the famine which occurred during his reign. F\u012broz Sh\u0101h, the eighth king, halted at Ellichpur in 1400 while his generals undertook a successful expedition\nagainst the Gond kingdom of Kherla; and Ahmad Sh\u0101h Wali, the brother and successor of Firoz, halted with his army at the provincial capital, while the forts of G\u0101wilgarh and Narn\u0101l\u0101 were being built and repaired between 1425 and 1428. From 1490 to 1572 Ellichpur was the capital of Ber\u0101r under the kings of the Im\u0101d Sh\u0101hi dynasty\\(^1\\). On the overthrow of that dynasty by Murtaz\u0101 Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101h of Ahmadnagar in the latter year, the town again became a provincial capital. In the early days of the Mughal occupation of Ber\u0101r its importance declined, owing to the selection of B\u0101l\u0101pur as the seat of the provincial governor; but it soon regained its position as the capital of the imperial S\u016bbah of Ber\u0101r. It again lost most of its local prestige when Asaf J\u0101h, the first Niz\u0101m, in 1724 became virtually the independent ruler of the Deccan, and the city was placed under a governor subordinate to the viceroy. The first governor appointed was Iwaz Kh\u0101n, who ruled for five years (1724-8), and was succeeded by Shuj\u0101at Kh\u0101n (1729-40), who quarrelled with the Mar\u0101th\u0101, Raghuji Bhonsla, fought with him near Bhugaon, and was killed in the battle. The victor plundered the Ellichpur treasury. Sharif Kh\u0101n next succeeded and held office from 1751 to 1762. He claimed equality with the Niz\u0101m, who consequently deposed him. The Niz\u0101m\u2019s son, Ali J\u0101h Bah\u0101dur, was then appointed governor; but he administered by his deputy, Ismail Kh\u0101n, the Afgh\u0101n, the first of a succession of Afgh\u0101n governors. The next in succession was Sal\u0101bat Kh\u0101n, who, though he remained only two years at Ellichpur, did much to improve the city. He enlarged the palace, made a public garden, and extended the ancient water-channels. He was a brave soldier, and, on war breaking out between the Niz\u0101m and Tipu Sult\u0101n, he was ordered to join the army, and distinguished himself in the field. He also saw service at the battle of Kardla, and was with General Wellesley\u2019s army in 1803. His son, N\u0101md\u0101r Kh\u0101n, received, besides his father\u2019s j\u0101g\u012br of two lakhs, another of like value at Ellichpur, and succeeded his father as governor of Ber\u0101r, with the title of Naw\u0101b, holding the governorship till his death in 1843. He is said to have been placed by his father under the special protection of General Wellesley; and he received a separate j\u0101g\u012br for the payment of the Ellichpur Brigade. After some years he fell into arrears and gave up the greater part of his j\u0101g\u012br, retaining only a rental of \u00a33,500. He was succeeded by his nephew, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n, who lived until 1846, when his widow\u2019s father, Ghul\u0101m Hasan, was allowed to inherit the estate and the title of Naw\u0101b on payment of a nazar\u0101na of 7 lakhs.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The kings of this dynasty were:\n\n1.

The family is now extinct.\n\nThere is at Ellichpur a well-known darg\u0101h or burial shrine, which bears the name of the mythical warrior, Abdur-Rahm\u0101n, already mentioned. Though the shrine is certainly not the resting-place of a nephew of Mahm\u016bd of Ghazn\u012b, it is by no means modern. It is said to have been built by one of the Bahmani Sult\u0101ns more than four hundred years ago, and may thus have been erected by Ahmad Sh\u0101h Wali during his visit to Ellichpur, in the belief that Mahm\u016bd's nephew actually perished here; but as the legend of Dulh\u0101 Rahm\u0101n, as the saint is popularly known, connects this shrine with another at Kherla, where the hero's head is said to be buried, the more probable supposition is that it was erected by Firoz Sh\u0101h to the memory of one of his captains slain at Kherla in 1400. The \u1e63a\u1e25r or anniversary ceremony of the mythical Abdur-Rahm\u0101n is celebrated annually by a fair on the 10th of Rabi-ul-awal. The old palace of the Naw\u0101bs is a building of little historical interest, but some of the tombs are handsome.\n\nThe municipality of Ellichpur was created in 1869, and the receipts and expenditure for the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 19,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 14,669, mainly derived from taxes; and the expenditure was Rs. 24,171, the principal heads being conservancy and public works. The municipality has not undertaken any new works of importance, but it maintains the old system of water-supply. The trade in cotton is considerable, the commodity being conveyed to Amraoti by road (32 miles). Cotton carpets are woven locally. There are excellent metalled roads connecting Ellichpur with Amraoti and with Chikalda via Ghatang (30 miles). Considerable quantities of forest produce are brought from the Melgh\u0101t for sale in the weekly market. The more important public buildings are at the civil station of Paratw\u0101da, 2 miles distant. In the town are several relics of the Naw\u0101bs, such as gardens, wells, mosques, &c., besides several ginning factories.\n\nEllora (I'er\u016bl).\u2014Village in the District and taluk of Aurang\u0101b\u0101d, Hyder\u0101bad State, situated in 20\u00b0 21' N. and 75\u00b0 10' E., about 15 miles north-west of Aurang\u0101b\u0101d city. Population (1901), 1,095. Near the village is a handsome temple of red stone erected by Ahaly\u0101 Bai, the R\u0101ni of Indore (1767\u201395), which is considered a good specimen of modern Hindu architecture (Burgess). Ellora is famous for its rock-temples and caves, which extend along the face of a hill for a mile and a quarter, and are divided into three distinct series\u2014Buddhist, Br\u0101hmanical, and Jain\u2014and are arranged chronologically. They are excavated in the scarp of a large plateau, and run nearly north and south for about a mile and a quarter, the scarp at each end of this\ninterval throwing out a horn towards the west. The Buddhist caves, twelve in number, are situated at the south end; the Indra Sabha or Jain group, consisting of five caves, lies at the other extremity of the series; the Br\u0101hmanical caves, which number seventeen, are between the other two series. In age the caves vary from about the fifth to the ninth or tenth century, and important inscriptions have been found in them. Among the most interesting objects at Ellora is the Kail\u0101s temple, one of the most wonderful and interesting specimens of architectural art in India.\n\n'Unlike any of the preceding cave-temples,' says Dr. Burgess, 'Kail\u0101s is a great monolithic temple, isolated from surrounding rock, and carved outside as well as in. It stands in a great court averaging 154 feet wide by 276 feet long at the level of the base, entirely cut out of the solid rock, and with a scarp 197 feet high at the back. In front of this court a curtain has been left, carved on the outside with the monstrous forms of Siva and Vishnu and their congeners, and with rooms inside it. It is pierced in the centre by an entrance passage, with rooms on each side. Passing this, the visitor is met by a large sculpture of Lakshmi over the lotuses, with her attendant elephant. There are some letters and a date on the leaves of the lotus on which she sits, but illegible, and probably belonging to the fifteenth century. On the bases of the pilasters on each side have been inscriptions in characters of the eighth century. As we enter, to right and left is the front portion of the court, which is a few feet lower than the rest, and at the north and south ends of which stand two gigantic elephants\u2014that on the south much mutilated. Turning again to the east and ascending a few steps, we enter the great court occupied by the temple, whose base measures 164 feet from east to west, by 109 feet where widest from north to south. In front of it, and connected by a bridge, is a mandapa for the Nandi, and on each side of this mandapa stands a pillar or dvajdand\u2014\"ensign staff\"\u201445 feet high, or with what remains of a trisula of Siva on the top, a total height of about 49 feet.'\n\nThis temple was built by Krishna I, the R\u0101shtrak\u016bta king of Malkhed (760\u201383).\n\n[Archaeological Survey Reports of Western India, vol. v.]\n\nEllore Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of Kistna District, Madras, consisting of the Ellore and Yernagudem taluks.\n\nEllore Taluk.\u2014Taluk on the northern border of Kistna District, Madras, lying between 16\u00b0 34' and 17\u00b0 13' N. and 80\u00b0 53' and 81\u00b0 24' E., with an area of 778 square miles. The population in 1901 was 181,035, compared with 171,985 in 1891. It contains one town, Ellore (population, 33,521), the head-quarters; and 206 villages. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 4,69,000. The taluk is sparsely populated; for, although the southern part of it lies within the influence of the irrigation systems of the Kistna and God\u0101vari rivers, the northern and\ngreater portion is covered with hills and jungle. On the south the taluk borders the Colair Lake. Two small streams, the Tammileru and Ramileru, run through it, and are used to a certain extent for irrigation.\n\nEllore Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision and taluk of the same name in Kistna District, Madras, situated in $16^\\circ 43' N.$ and $81^\\circ 7' E.$, on the East Coast Railway, 304 miles from Madras, and at the junction of canals from the God\u0101vari and Kistna rivers. The population in 1901 was 33,521, of whom Hindus numbered 29,098, Muhammadans 3,977, and Christians 443.\n\nAbout 8 miles north of Ellore, at Pedda Vegi, are extensive remains which are supposed to mark the site of the capital of the Buddhist kingdom of Vengi. After overrunning the country in 1470, the Muhammadans drew upon the ruins of the old city for materials for their fort at Ellore. The town was afterwards taken from the Gajapati kings of Orissa by Krishna Deva of Vijayanagar in 1515, but was recovered by the Kutb Sh\u0101hi Sult\u0101n of Golconda. His lieutenant then withstood a prolonged siege by the Hindu chieftains from north of the God\u0101vari. With the fall of R\u0101jahmundry in 1572 Ellore became the capital of the Sarkar of the same name; and its history is thenceforward uneventful. It was for some time a cantonment for the Company\u2019s troops, but was early abandoned.\n\nEllore is situated on the border of the swamps round the Colair Lake, and its climate is excessively hot. It is the chief market for the surrounding country, and has a large trade in grain. There are two tanneries near the town and a rice factory. Saltpetre, manufactured on a small scale in the neighbouring villages, is refined here. In the suburb of Tangellam\u016bdi, separated from Ellore by a stream called the Tammileru, the noted Ellore carpets are made. This industry, a very old one, is carried on solely by Muhammadans. Although it is now principally confined to cheap carpets of foreign design for export, well-woven carpets of old patterns can still be obtained. Both wool and dyes are prepared locally.\n\nEllore was constituted a municipality in 1866. During the ten years ending 1902\u20133 the municipal receipts and expenditure averaged Rs. 33,000 and Rs. 36,000 respectively. The income in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 48,000, derived principally from the taxes on houses and lands (Rs. 15,000) and tolls (Rs. 11,000); the expenditure was Rs. 49,000, of which the main items were conservancy (Rs. 11,000) and roads (Rs. 12,000). A municipal hospital is maintained, in which there are 24 beds for in-patients. The principal educational institution is the Church of England Mission\u2019s high school, founded in 1854 on the model of that at Masulipatam, to which a primary class is attached. The two together have an attendance of about 490. There is also a branch of the Church of England Zan\u0101na Mission.\nEmin\u0101b\u0101d. Town in the District and tahsil of Gujranw\u0101la, Punjab, situated in $32^\\circ 2' N.$ and $74^\\circ 16' E.$, 8 miles south-east of Gujranw\u0101la town, on the North-Western Railway and the direct road to Amritsar. Population (1901), 6,494. The original town is said to have been founded by S\u0101liv\u0101han, R\u0101ja of Si\u0101lkot, and was once called Saiyidpur. Sher Sh\u0101h destroyed it in the tenth century and built Shergarh, which was itself destroyed and its Afgh\u0101n garrison expelled under Akbar by Muhammad Am\u012bn, after whom the new town was called. The Mughal emperors made Emin\u0101b\u0101d the capital of a mah\u0101l in the Lahore S\u016bbah. They were dispossessed in 1760 by Sard\u0101r Charat Singh. Ranjit Singh gave the town in j\u0101g\u012br to R\u0101ja Dhy\u0101n Singh of Jammu, and it has never lost its connexion with that State, several of whose prime ministers have been natives of Emin\u0101b\u0101d. A Sikh temple, the Rohri S\u0101hib, commemorates the penance of B\u0101ba N\u0101nak, when he made his bed on a heap of stones (rohri). The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 3,500, and the expenditure Rs. 3,300. The income in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 3,000, chiefly from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 3,200. The town possesses an unaided Anglo-Sanskrit high school and also a Government dispensary. It is of no commercial importance.\n\nEnam\u0101kkal Lake.\u2014A shallow lake in the Ponn\u0101ni taluk of Malabar District, Madras, lying between $10^\\circ 26' N.$ and $10^\\circ 36' N.$ and $76^\\circ 1' E.$ and $76^\\circ 14' E.$ It covers about 25 square miles, the major portion of which lies within the limits of Native Cochin, and is remarkable for the peculiar rice cultivation carried on in its bed. On the western side the lake is protected by a masonry dam from tidal influences. As soon as the dry season has set in, artificial dams of bamboo and mud are raised to a height of 4 or 5 feet all over the lake, and the water is baled out of each partition by means of Persian wheels and steam pumps into channels, which form waterways high above the cultivation on either side. The soil of the lake is a very fine silt, and excellent rice crops are raised.\n\nEnglish B\u0101z\u0101r.\u2014Head-quarters of M\u0101lda District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, consisting of a series of trading villages lining the right bank of the Mah\u0101nand\u0101, situated in $25^\\circ 0' N.$ and $88^\\circ 9' E.$ Population (1901), 13,667. Being an open elevated site on the river bank in a mulberry-growing country, it was chosen in 1676 as the site of one of the Company\u2019s silk factories. The Dutch and the French also had settlements here, and the residence of the Civil Surgeon was formerly a Dutch convent. The East India Company\u2019s factory was of considerable importance during the last quarter of the seventeenth century, and its \u2018Diaries and Consultations\u2019 from 1685 to 1693 are preserved in the India Office under the title of \u2018Maulda and Englesavade.\u2019 The town\nis still known as Angrez\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1770 English B\u0101z\u0101r was fixed upon for a Commercial Residency, and retained its importance until the discontinuance of the Company's private trade. An extensive trade in grain is now carried on. English B\u0101z\u0101r was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 16,000, and the expenditure Rs. 15,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 19,000, of which Rs. 5,000 was derived from a tax on persons (or property tax), and Rs. 4,000 from a conservancy rate; and the expenditure was Rs. 16,000. The largest building is the public kach\u00e9ri or courthouse, the former Commercial Residency, which is regularly fortified, and within its walls are all the public offices. The District jail has accommodation for 110 prisoners. A small embankment protects it from the inundations of the Mah\u0101nand\u0101.\n\nEnnore.\u2014Village in the Ponneri taluk of Chingleput District, Madras, situated in 13\u00b0 13' N. and 80\u00b0 19' E., on the shore of the Bay of Bengal and on the Madras Railway. Population (1901), 3,192. Its proper name is Kattivakkam. It was once a favourite resort for Europeans from Madras, and contains several bungalows, built on the strip of land between the sea and the backwater, in which they used to stay; but it has ceased to have any attractions, owing to the prevalence in recent years of virulent malarial fever. Ennore is now only a fishing village and a centre of salt manufacture. The sand-dunes along the coast at this point, which cover an area of about 20,000 acres, have been almost all taken up by private persons and converted into casuarina plantations. This tree yields rapid returns, attaining, in favourable localities, its full growth in about fifteen years; and as there is a large and increasing demand for firewood in Madras, the enterprise has reached such proportions as to change materially the physical aspect of long stretches of the coast in this neighbourhood.\n\nEran.\u2014Village in the Khurai tahsil of Saugor District, Central Provinces, situated in 24\u00b0 6' N. and 78\u00b0 11' E., at the junction of the Bina and Reut\u0101 rivers, 6 miles from B\u0101mora station on the Indian Midland section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 171. A most interesting collection of archaeological remains is to be seen on some high ground near the village. There were at one time several small Vaishnava temples, but these are now in ruins. The principal statue is a colossal Var\u0101ha, or figure of the boar-incarnation of Vishnu, 10 feet high and 15 feet long. A garland of small human figures is sculptured on a band round the neck, and the figure bears an inscription of the White Hun king Toram\u0101na. From a record of Samudra Gupta on a stone close by, it is inferred that this is one of the oldest Br\u0101hmanical statues in India, and the coins found here show that the place was inhabited before the Christian era. Another remarkable object is a great stone column, 47 feet high, standing before the temples,\nwhich bears an inscription of Budha Gupta, dated in A.D. 484-5. Another inscription, on a pillar now turned into a lingam, records perhaps the earliest known sati immolation in India.\n\n[J. F. Fleet, *Gupta Inscriptions* (1888), pp. 18, 88, 91, and 158.]\n\n**Erandol Taluka.**\u2014Taluka of East Kh\u0101ndesh District, Bombay, lying between 26\u00b0 44' and 21\u00b0 9' N. and 75\u00b0 9' and 75\u00b0 31' E., with an area of 458 square miles. There are three towns, Erandol (population, 11,885) and Dharangaon (14,172) being the largest; and 195 villages. The population in 1901 was 105,840, compared with 105,808 in 1891. The density, 231 persons per square mile, is above the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 3 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 20,000. The soil is part of the fertile T\u0101pti valley. Mango groves are scattered all through the taluka. Besides water-supply from the rivers, there were 2,213 wells used for irrigation in 1902-3. The annual rainfall averages nearly 29 inches.\n\n**Erandol Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in East Kh\u0101ndesh District, Bombay, situated in 20\u00b0 55' N. and 75\u00b0 20' E., on the Anj\u0101ni river, 36 miles east of Dh\u016blia. Population (1901), 11,885. Erandol is connected by metalled roads with the towns of Dh\u016blia and Dharangaon (7 miles north-west), and the railway station of Mhasv\u0101d (9 miles south-east). It is a place of some antiquity, and was formerly celebrated for its manufacture of coarse native paper, an industry which still survives to a limited extent. There is a considerable trade in cotton, indigo, and grain, the chief market being Jalgaon, a station 27 miles north-east. The town has one cotton-ginning factory. A fine stone quadrangle in the town, known as P\u0101ndav's v\u0101da, contains the remains of a strongly built enclosed mosque, richly carved, and constructed of old Hindu materials. About 5 miles south-east of the town on the top of a hill is the beautiful tank of Padm\u0101lya, near which is a temple of Ganpati. The municipality dates from 1866. The municipal income during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 9,100. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 9,600. The town contains a Subordinate Judge's court, a dispensary, and five schools with 743 pupils, of which one, with 60 pupils, is for girls.\n\n**Erinpura.**\u2014Cantonment in the north-east of the State of Sirohi, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 25\u00b0 9' N. and 73\u00b0 4' E., on the left bank of the Jawai river, about 6 miles from Erinpura Road station on the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. Population (1901), 3,206. Erinpura is the head-quarters of the 43rd (Erinpura) Regiment, which has detachments at Abu, Bikaner, and Pachbad\u0101r. By the treaty of 1818 the M\u0101rw\u0101r Darb\u0101r was bound to furnish a contingent of 1,500 horse for the service of the British Government when required; but the force thus supplied by it in 1832 proved so useless that the obligation was commuted in 1835 to an annual payment of 1.2 lakhs towards the maintenance of\na corps, which was raised in 1836 and styled the Jodhpur Legion. It was located on the site of the present cantonment, which Captain Downing, the commandant, named Erinpura after the island of his birth. The Legion consisted of three troops of cavalry and eight companies of infantry, with two 9-pounder guns; and three companies of Bhils were added in 1841. With the exception of the latter the corps mutinied in 1857; and shortly after the Erinpura Irregular Force was raised, with the Bhil companies as a nucleus. This force was composed of a squadron of cavalry, mainly Sikhs, numbering 164 of all ranks, and eight companies of infantry, numbering 712. Bhils and Min\u0101s were mostly enlisted in the infantry, the object being to afford occupation to the local tribes and thus wean them from their lawless habits. From the end of 1870 to 1881 the commandant was in political charge of Sirohi, and detachments were on several occasions sent out to assist the police in patrolling the disturbed tracts and arresting dacoits. In 1895 the strength of the squadron was reduced from 164 to 100 of all ranks; in 1897 the force, which had till then been under the Foreign Department of the Government of India, was placed under the Commander-in-Chief, and in 1903 it was renamed the 43rd (Erinpura) Regiment. At the present time the squadron consists of Sikhs and Musalm\u0101ns from the Punjab, while the infantry are mainly composed of R\u0101jputs, Min\u0101s, Mers, and Musalm\u0101ns.\n\nErn\u0101d.\u2014T\u0101luk in Malabar District, Madras, adjoining the Nilgiris, and lying between 10\u00b0 57' and 11\u00b0 32' N. and 75\u00b0 49' and 76\u00b0 33' E. with an area of 979 square miles. It contains 54 amsams, or parishes. The population increased from 343,775 in 1891 to 357,142 in 1901. The land revenue demand in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 3,40,000. The only places of importance besides the head-quarters (Manjeri) are the military station of Malappuram, and the villages of Ferokh, Nilamb\u016br, and Tir\u016brang\u0101di. The t\u0101luk is made up of hills clothed with forest. The eastern portion includes the valley of Nilamb\u016br, which produces the finest teak and other timber in the District. The centre contains several smaller ranges separating more level valleys. The coast portion is more gently undulating, and is intersected in all directions by low ground in which rice is extensively cultivated.\n\nErnag\u016bdem.\u2014T\u0101luk of Kistna District, Madras. See Vernag\u016bdem.\n\nErn\u0101kulam.\u2014Capital of Cochin State, Madras, situated in 9\u00b0 59' N. and 76\u00b0 17' E., on a backwater, 2 miles east of, and opposite to, British Cochin and the bar. Area, 5 square miles; population (1901), 21,901, consisting of 11,197 Hindus, 9,357 Christians, 935 Musalm\u0101ns, and 412 Jews. Ern\u0101kulam is the terminus of the Cochin State Railway and is rapidly growing in population and importance. The chief public buildings and institutions are the Darb\u0101r Hall, where the British Resident pays his state visits to the R\u0101j\u0101, the office of the Diw\u0101n and\nthe Chief Court, the R\u0101j\u0101's College, containing more than 700 students, the General Hospital with 68 beds, the Central jail with accommodation for 200 prisoners, the St. Albert's high school managed by the Verapoli Mission, the St. Teresa's Convent with an orphanage and girls' school attached to it, the palace of the Romo-Syrian Bishop, and the Carmelite monastery. There are also four Catholic churches in the town. Its trade, which is not very considerable, is chiefly in the hands of the Konkanis and the Jews. The Residency is picturesquely situated on an island close to Ernakulam. It was originally a Dutch factory, built in 1774, but several additions and improvements have since been made to it.\n\n**Erode Subdivision (Ir\u012bdu).**\u2014Subdivision of Coimbatore District, Madras, consisting of the taluks of Erode, Bhav\u0101ni, Dharapuram, and Kar\u016br.\n\n**Erode Taluk.**\u2014Eastern taluk of Coimbatore District, Madras, lying between 11\u00b0 2' and 11\u00b0 27' N. and 77\u00b0 22' and 77\u00b0 55' E., with an area of 598 square miles. The population in 1901 was 275,460, compared with 247,008 in 1891. There are 198 villages, and only one town, Erode (population, 15,529), the head-quarters. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 5,07,000, a higher figure than in any other taluk. Erode is a gently undulating plain with no hills of importance and but little forest, sloping gradually to the Cauvery river, which bounds it on the east. It is rather bare of trees, and in the valley of the Cauvery the climate is hot and close. The irrigated land is of a good class, much of it being fed by the Kalinga-r\u0101yan channel from the Bhav\u0101ni river. Wells are also unusually plentiful. The rainfall averages 27 inches at Erode, but it is variable and partial. Cambu is the chief cereal, and much cotton is raised.\n\n**Erode Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name on the eastern border of Coimbatore District, Madras, situated in 11\u00b0 21' N. and 77\u00b0 43' E., 243 miles from Madras at a junction of the Madras and South Indian Railways, and close to the bank of the Cauvery. Population (1901), 15,529. It seems to have been long an important place. Early in the seventeenth century the Jesuit Fathers established a station here. In Haidar's time it is said to have contained 3,000 houses, which would be equal to a population of 15,000 souls; but in consequence of successive Mar\u0101th\u0101, Mysore, and British invasions the town became almost utterly deserted. It was taken from Madura by Mysore troops in 1667, and from Haidar by the British in 1768, only to fall into his hands again at the end of the same year. It was retaken in General Medows's expedition of 1790, but was abandoned on Tip\u016b's advance. It does not appear to have been a place of any real strength. As soon as the peace was signed in 1792 the people returned, and within a year it had 400 houses and a population of over 2,000. It was\ngarrisoned by the Company at first; but the troops were withdrawn in 1807, and in 1877 the old fort was levelled as a famine-relief work.\n\nErode is a well-built town and is the head-quarters of the divisional officer, the Assistant Superintendent of police, a District Munsif, a stationary sub-magistrate, a tahsildar, and the Public Works department subdivisional officer. It was constituted a municipality in 1871. The municipal receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1903 averaged Rs. 18,000. In 1903-4 they were Rs. 23,000, most of the income being derived from the house and land taxes. Surveys and levels for a drainage scheme have been taken. A water-supply scheme has been investigated, but has not been begun owing to want of funds. The antiquities of the town include two ancient temples which contain inscriptions in Tamil and Grantha characters. Its chief industries are a cotton-press and the making of carts. It is also the trade centre of this corner of the District.\n\nEtah District (Eta).\u2014District in the Agra Division of the United Provinces, lying between $27^\\circ 18'$ and $28^\\circ 2'$ N. and $78^\\circ 11'$ and $79^\\circ 17'$ E., with an area of 1,737 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the river Ganges, separating it from Budaun; on the west by Aligarh, Muttra, and Agra; on the south by Agra and Mainpuri; and on the east by Farrukhabad. Bordering on the Ganges lies a broad stretch of alluvial land, known as the tarai, reaching to the old high bank of the river. Below this is the stream called the B\u00fcrhigang\u0101, or old bed of the Ganges, which had become blocked in places by spits of sand, but has been deepened and straightened by the Irrigation department, and now carries off drainage. The rest of the District is situated in the upland plain of the Do\u0101b, and its physical features depend chiefly on the rivers which cross it from north-west to south-east. The largest of these is the K\u0101li N\u0101d\u012b (East), or K\u0101lindri, as it is generally and more correctly called in this District. It has a deep and well-defined channel, but occasionally brings down disastrous floods. The other rivers are the Isan, Arind, and Sengar (also called the Isan here), which are dry in the hot season. The central tract contains a few marshes or jhils.\n\nThe District consists entirely of Gangetic alluvium; and kankar or calcareous limestone, and saline efflorescences on the soil, are the only minerals found.\n\nThe flora presents no peculiarities. Trees and groves are comparatively scarce: the mango, nim (Melia Azadirachta), tamarind, and jamun (Eugenia Jambolana) are perhaps the commonest trees. The only jungle is composed of dh\u0101k (Butea frondosa) or bah\u016bl (Acacia arabica). The reeds found in the tarai are used extensively for thatching and for making rope.\n\nEtah was formerly noted for sport, and hog and antelope are still\nfairly common. Wild cattle have now become very rare, and the improvements to the B\u016brhigang\u0101 have lessened the attractions for wild-fowl. Wolves are occasionally seen, and jackals, though occurring in many parts, are comparatively rare.\n\nThe absence of large marshes and the common occurrence of barren areas and sandy soil, together with the facilities for drainage, make the climate of Etah, except south of the K\u0101l\u012b Nadi, dry and healthy; but dust-storms are frequent in the hot season. In winter the cold is sometimes intense, though frost is rare. The annual rainfall for the District averages 29 inches, varying from 25 in the Jalesar tahsil in the west, to 34 in the Al\u012bganj tahsil in the east.\n\nThe early history of the District is altogether uncertain. Ancient mounds along the K\u0101l\u012b Nadi point to the presence of important towns early in the Christian era. Tradition says that Ahirs and Bhars were followed by R\u0101jputs, and the District must have formed part of the kingdom of Kanauj. When that kingdom was conquered by Muhammadans, Etah came under Muslim rule, and was governed from Koil, Bi\u0101n\u0101, or Kanauj. Pati\u0101li, in the north of the District, was the principal town; and it was visited by Ghiy\u0101s-ud-din Balban about 1270, who chastised the lawless peasantry in the neighbourhood, and left a garrison to keep open the roads and protect caravans and merchants. Constant expeditions were required in later years, and in the fifteenth century the District suffered from the struggle between Delhi and Jaunpur, being taken and retaken by the rival armies. Bahlol Lodi died at Sak\u012bt in 1489 from wounds received in a battle with the R\u0101jputs. Under Akbar, raids against the refractory Hindus continued, and in the eighteenth century the District fell into the hands of the Bangash Naw\u0101bs of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d; but even these never obtained a firm hold. Later it was shared between the Naw\u0101b of Oudh and the Naw\u0101b of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, and was acquired by the British in 1801\u20132, when the present area was distributed among the surrounding Districts. After many territorial changes a subdivision was formed in 1845, on account of the lawlessness of the outlying portions, which included most of the present District; and Etah became a separate charge in 1856.\n\nThe succeeding year saw the outbreak at Meerut which quickly developed into the Mutiny of 1857. As soon as the troops in garrison at Etah received intelligence of the revolt at Al\u012bgarh, the whole body left the station without any disturbance. As there was no place of strength in the town and no force with which to defend it, the Magistrate found it necessary to withdraw until the mutineers from Mainpuri and Etawah had passed through. After a gallant but unsuccessful attempt to hold K\u0101sganj, the whole District was abandoned on June 7, and the officers reached Agra in safety. Damar Singh, R\u0101j\u0101 of Etah, then set\nhimself up as an independent ruler in the south of the District. As usual, however, rival claimants appeared in various quarters; and towards the end of July the rebel Naw\u0101b of Farrukh\u0101bad practically took possession of the country for some months. On the approach of General Greathead's column from Delhi, the rebels retired, and Mr. Cocks was appointed Special Commissioner for Etah and Aligarh. The force at his disposal, however, was quite insufficient to restore order, and the rebels still continued to hold K\u0101sganj. It was not till December 15 that Colonel Seaton's column attacked the rebels at Ganguri in Aligarh District, and after totally routing them, occupied K\u0101sganj. By the middle of 1858 order was completely restored, and peace has not since been disturbed.\n\nThe District contains several ancient sites, though these have not been fully explored. Atranji Khera and Bilsar have at different times been identified with the Pilo-shan-na visited by Hiuen Tsiang in the seventh century\\(^1\\). At Bilsar were found two pillars with inscriptions of Kum\u0101ra Gupta, dated in A.D. 415\u20136\\(^2\\). The village of N\u016bh Khera has extensive mounds containing relics of the Buddhist period, and it is still regarded by several of the gipsy tribes as their head quarters. Pati\u0101li, Sarai Aghat, and Soron are other places of great antiquity, while the chief Muhammadan buildings are found at M\u0101rahra and Sakit.\n\nThere are 18 towns and 1,466 villages in the District. Population has fluctuated considerably during the last thirty years. The number at the last four enumerations was as follows: (1872) 829,118, (1881) 756,523, (1891) 701,679, and (1901) 863,948. The great decrease between 1872 and 1891 was due to the deterioration of the land owing to flooding about 1884; but there is some reason to believe that the figure for 1872 was over-estimated, and it is probable that the population did not alter much between 1872 and 1881. There are four tahsils\u2014Etah, K\u0101sganj, Al\u012bganj, and Jalesar\u2014the head-quarters of each being at a place of the same name. The principal towns are the municipalities of K\u0101sganj, Jalesar, Soron, and Etah, the District head-quarters, and the 'notified area' of M\u0101rahra. The table on the next page gives the chief statistics of population in 1901.\n\nHindus form 88 per cent. of the total and Musalm\u0101ns nearly 11 per cent. The density of population is about the same as that of the surrounding Districts, but the rate of increase between 1891 and 1901 was the highest in the United Provinces. This was due to recovery after previous bad seasons due to flooding. Western Hindi is spoken by almost the entire population, the prevailing dialect being Braj.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A. Cunningham, Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. i, p. 269, and vol. xi, p. 13.\n\n\\(^2\\) J. F. Fleet, Gupta Inscriptions, p. 42.\nThe most numerous castes among Hindus are: Cham\u0101rs (leather-workers and labourers), 114,000; Ah\u012brs (graziers and cultivators), 88,000; Lodhas (cultivators), 88,000; R\u0101jputs, 80,000; Br\u0101hmans, 63,000; and K\u0101chhis (cultivators), 62,000. The District contains several gangs of wandering tribes, such as H\u0101bur\u0101s and Nats. Among Muhammadans are found Shaikhs, 15,000; Path\u0101ns, 12,000; Fak\u012brs, 7,000; and R\u0101jputs, 6,000. The agricultural population forms nearly 69 per cent. of the total\u2014a high proportion. R\u0101jputs, Br\u0101hmans, and K\u0101yasths are the principal landholders, while R\u0101jputs, Br\u0101hmans, Lodhas, Ah\u012brs, and K\u0101chhis are the chief cultivators.\n\nOf the 4,268 native Christians in 1901, more than 3,700 were Methodists. The American Methodist Mission, to which these belong, is controlled from Agra, each tahsil forming a circuit. The American Presbyterian Church commenced work in the District in 1843, but has only recently appointed a minister here. There are also branches of the Church Missionary Society at Soron and K\u0101sganj.\n\nThe District comprises three natural tracts. The tarai, lying between the Ganges and its old high bank, south of the B\u016brhigang\u0101, contains rich fertile soil in its lower parts, while the higher ridges are bare sand. It is especially liable to injury from floods or from waterlogging. Between the B\u016brhigang\u0101 and the K\u0101li Nadi lies an area which consists of a light sandy soil, flanked by strips of high sandy uplands near the rivers, but changing near the centre to loam and barren \u016bsar. This tract also has suffered much in the past from waterlogging, and, where cultivation is relaxed, from the growth of the grass called k\u0101ns (Saccharum spontaneum). Along the south bank of the K\u0101li Nadi stretches another line of high sandy soil, beyond which is a rich plain of fertile loam interspersed with \u016bsar plains.\n\nThe tenures are those usually found in the United Provinces. Out of 2,500 mah\u0101ls, about 1,500 are zamind\u0101ri and 1,000 pattid\u0101ri or bhaiy\u0101ch\u0101r\u0101, the last class being very few in number. The main agricultural statistics for 1898\u201391 are given in the following table, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villagers | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Etah   | 492                 | 4              | 463      | 259,773    | 528                       | + 14\u00b74                                           | 6,160                                  |\n| K\u0101sganj| 492                 | 6              | 498      | 265,216    | 539                       | + 38\u00b74                                           | 6,016                                  |\n| Aliganj| 526                 | 6              | 379      | 205,560    | 391                       | + 26\u00b79                                           | 2,900                                  |\n| Jalesar| 227                 | 2              | 156      | 133,399    | 588                       | + 10\u00b72                                           | 3,567                                  |\n| District total | 1,737               | 18             | 1,466    | 863,948    | 497                       | + 23\u00b71                                           | 18,643                                 |\n\n1 Later figures are not available, owing to settlement operations.\nThe areas in square miles under the principal food-crops in the same year were: wheat (332), barley (147), bajra (140), jowar (123), maize (113), and gram (99). Cotton occupied 48 square miles, sugar-cane 27, indigo 23, and poppy 12.\n\nThere has been some improvement in agricultural methods during the last thirty years. This has chiefly taken the form of an increase in the double-cropped area. Wheat has largely taken the place of barley, and maize is more extensively grown. The cultivation of indigo largely extended at one time, but is now practically non-existent. A most important change has been the opening of the Fatehgarh branch of the Upper Ganges Canal, accompanied by the improvement of drainage throughout the District. The cultivators take advances readily under the Agriculturists' Loans Act in adverse seasons, whether wet or dry: more than 1\u00bd lakhs was lent between 1891 and 1904. The amount lent under the Land Improvement Act was only Rs. 90,000, more than half of which was advanced in 1896-7.\n\nThe breed of cattle is of the ordinary inferior type found throughout the Do\u0101b; but in the Jalesar t\u0101s\u012b the animals are a little better. An attempt has been made to improve the breed of horses and ponies, and since 1894 a Government stallion has been kept. Private persons also maintain two good stallions. The sheep and goats are inferior.\n\nIn the tarai irrigation is usually unnecessary, though wells can be readily made when required. The rest of the District is served by the Fatehgarh and Bewar branches of the Lower Ganges Canal, and by the Cawnpore and Et\u0101wah branches of the Upper Ganges Canal. The main channel of the Lower Ganges Canal crosses the K\u0101h Nadi at Nadrai, near K\u0101sganj, by a magnificent aqueduct which was carried away by a flood in 1885, but has been rebuilt. Wells can be made in the whole of this tract, except in the high sandy ridges near the rivers, but are often of little use where the subsoil is sandy. In 1902-3 the total area irrigated was 461 square miles, of which wells supplied 254, canals 176, tanks or jhils 18, and rivers 13. In dry years the rivers are used more extensively.\n\nBlock kankar or calcareous limestone is found in the uplands, and the nodular form occurs in all parts of the District. Saltpetre, salt, and sulphate-of soda are found in saline efflorescences.\nThe chief industries carried on are cotton-weaving, sugar-refining, glass-making, and the preparation of saltpetre and sulphate of soda.\n\nTrade and communications. Cotton is woven as a hand industry all over the District. Sugar refineries conducted by native methods are found chiefly in the towns near the tarai, where sugar-cane is largely grown. About 250 factories prepare crude saltpetre, the average out-turn at each being approximately 100 maunds. There are also eight refineries, which produce an annual out-turn of nearly 8,000 maunds of refined saltpetre. Sulphate of soda is made at about 80 factories, each producing 200 maunds annually. In 1903 a cotton-press employed 128 hands, and three cotton-gins 795 hands. Five other factories have been opened since.\n\nEtah has a considerable export trade in agricultural produce. Cotton, wheat, barley, pulses, millet, opium, and sugar are the chief items; but saltpetre and country glass are also exported. The imports include piece-goods, metals, and salt. Most of the foreign traffic is carried by the railway, but a great deal passes by road to and from the adjacent Districts. There is a little traffic on the canal with Aligarh, Mainpuri, and Cawnpore. K\u0101sganj and Jalesar are the chief trading centres, and Soron is noted as a place of pilgrimage.\n\nThe Cawnpore-Achhner\u0101 Railway crosses the District from east to west. A branch line, connecting K\u0101sganj with Soron on the B\u016brhi-gang\u0101, meets at the latter place a branch of the Rohilkhand and Kumaun Railway, which passes across the Ganges to Budaun and Bareilly. The East Indian Railway runs close to the western border of the Jalesar tahsil. The total length of metalled roads is 140 miles, and of unmetalled roads 488 miles. The metalled roads are all in charge of the Public Works department; but the cost of maintaining 87 miles is charged to the District board, which is also in charge of the unmetalled roads. Avenues of trees are maintained on 165 miles. The grand trunk road runs through the District from south-east to north-west, and other metalled roads lead to Agra, Muttra, Mainpuri, and to the Ganges.\n\nThe memory of the famines of 1783\u20134 and of 1803 long survived in this District. In 1837\u20138 famine was again severe, and many deaths occurred in spite of relief measures, while the prices of all grain doubled. The next great famine occurred in 1860\u20131, and was known to the peasantry by the graphic title of \u2018seven seer famine,\u2019 as the cheapest food sold at the rate of seven seers per rupee. In 1868\u20139 the District escaped from famine, though visited by drought and scarcity; and in 1877\u20138 canal-irrigation saved a large area of the crops, but distress was felt among the crowds of immigrants who poured in from the tracts south of the Jumna. Before the next famine of 1896\u20137 canal-irrigation had been largely extended,\nand, though relief works were opened, the numbers who came to them were small.\n\nThe Collector is assisted by a member of the Indian Civil Service (when available) and by four Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. A tahsildar is stationed at the head-quarters of each tahsil.\n\nThere are three Munsifs, and the whole District is included in the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the Judge of Aligarh, sessions cases being usually tried by the Additional Judge. Crime is very heavy in Etah, and murders, dacoities, and cattle-thefts are common, besides the more ordinary offences. Cases under the Opium and Excise Acts are also frequent. Female infanticide was formerly rife, but no portion of the population is now under surveillance.\n\nThe nucleus of the District was formed out of the surrounding Districts in 1845, and its early fiscal history belongs to Farrukhabad, Budaun, Aligarh, and Mainpuri. The earliest settlements after acquisition by the British were for short terms, and were based merely on a consideration of the previous demands and a rough estimate of the condition of villages. The first regular settlement under Regulation IX of 1833 was carried out in the Districts named above before Etah became a separate unit, and the revenue assessed was about 7.2 lakhs, excluding the Jalesar tahsil, which was added later. A subsequent revision was made at first by various Collectors, in addition to their ordinary District work, and later by Settlement officers, between 1863 and 1873. The methods adopted varied, but agreed in selecting rates of rent for each class of soil, and valuing the 'assets' at those rates, modified by the circumstances of individual villages. The demand so fixed amounted to 9.3 lakhs. In 1879 the Jalesar tahsil was transferred from Agra to this District, the revenue on which amounted to 2.9 lakhs. After heavy rainfall in 1884-6 there was great deterioration in the tarai and central tract, and a large area fell out of cultivation and became overgrown with kans (Saccharum spontaneum). By 1893 the revenue had been reduced by Rs. 57,000. The latest revision was made between 1902 and 1905. Although the revenue was slightly raised to 12.4 lakhs, much relief has been afforded by a redistribution of the demand, which now amounts to 48 per cent. of the net 'assets.'\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and total revenue have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 10,87  | 9,90   | 11,33  | 10,03  |\n| Total revenue  | 14,32  | 13,85  | 16,39  | 16,67  |\n\nThere are four municipalities\u2014Kasganj, Jalesar, Soron, and\nEtah\u2014and one 'notified area,' Marahra, besides thirteen towns administered under Act XX of 1856. Beyond the limits of these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which had an income of Rs. 96,000 in 1903-4, chiefly from rates. The expenditure on roads and buildings was Rs. 51,000.\n\nThere are 17 police stations; and the District Superintendent of police commands a force of 4 inspectors, 83 subordinate officers, and 322 men, besides 200 municipal and town police, and more than 1,500 rural and road police. The District jail contained a daily average of 267 prisoners in 1903.\n\nEtah takes a low place as regards literacy, and in 1901 only 2.2 per cent. of the population (3.8 males and 0.2 females) could read and write. The number of public schools fell from 155 in 1880-1 to 139 in 1900-1; but the number of pupils increased from 4,306 to 4,585. In 1903-4 there were 229 public schools with 7,179 pupils, of whom 620 were girls, besides 129 private schools with 1,314 pupils. Most of the schools are primary; three are managed by Government, and 136 by the District or municipal boards. Out of a total expenditure on education of Rs. 34,000 in 1903-4, Local funds contributed Rs. 28,000 and fees Rs. 2,500.\n\nThere are 10 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 90 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 76,000, of whom 800 were in-patients, and 2,600 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 11,000, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nAbout 30,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, representing a proportion of 35 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipalities.\n\n[S. O. B. Ridsdale, Settlement Report (1874); District Gazetteer (1876, under revision).]\n\nEtah Tahsil.\u2014Central tahsil of Etah District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Etah-Sakit, Sonhar, and Marahra, and lying between 27\u00b0 20' and 27\u00b0 47' N. and 78\u00b0 25' and 78\u00b0 56' E., with an area of 492 square miles. Population increased from 227,030 in 1891 to 259,773 in 1901. There are 463 villages and four towns, the largest of which are Etah (population, 8,796), the District and tahsil head-quarters, and Marahra (8,622). The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 4,06,000, and for cesses Rs. 66,000. The density of population, 528 persons per square mile, is above the District average. This tahsil is bounded on the north and east by the Kali Nadi, while the Isan flows across the southern portion. A small alluvial tract lies on the bank of the Kali Nadi, from which a gentle slope leads to the upland area. The edge of the slope is sandy, but most of the tahsil is a fertile area which, however, tends to become sandy in the east and is interspersed with stretches of usar land.\nAmple irrigation is afforded by the main channel of the Lower Ganges Canal and its Bewar branch, and by the Cawnpore and Etawah branches of the Upper Ganges Canal. The Irrigation department has done much to improve the drainage. In 1898\u20139 the area under cultivation was 274 square miles, of which 171 were irrigated. Wells supply more than double the area served by canals.\n\n**Etah Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of the same name, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 34' N. and 78\u00b0 41' E., on the grand trunk road, 19 miles from K\u0101sganj station on the Cawnpore-Achhner\u0101 Railway. Population (1901), 8,796. The town is said to have been founded in the fourteenth century by Sangram Singh, a Chauh\u0101n R\u0101jput descended from Prithwi R\u0101j of Delhi. His descendants occupied the surrounding territory until the Mutiny, when R\u0101ja Damar Singh rebelled. Etah derives its importance chiefly from the presence of the civil station, removed here from Pati\u0101li in 1856 on account of its more central position. The principal market-place, Mayneganj, which has been recently improved and enlarged and is the property of the municipality, perpetuates the name of Mr. F. O. Mayne, C.B., a former Collector. Westward lies the new town with the principal public buildings, a fine temple, school, municipal hall, tahs\u012bl, dispensary and hospital, and the District offices. The site is low and was formerly subject to floods; but a cutting to the Isan river, effected by Mr. Mayne, partially remedied this evil, and an effective drainage scheme has been undertaken by the municipality, through the Canal department. The American Methodist and Presbyterian Missions are both represented. Etah has been a municipality since 1865. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 12,500. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 21,000, chiefly from octroi (Rs. 14,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 23,000. There is a good deal of road traffic through the town, and eight commodious sarais provide for this. The tahs\u012bl school has about 200 pupils, and the municipality maintains one school and aids nine others with 340 pupils.\n\n**Etaiy\u0101puram.**\u2014Zam\u012bnd\u0101ri estate and town in Tinnevelly District, Madras. See ETAIY\u0100PURAM.\n\n**Etawah District** (It\u0101w\u0101 or It\u0101wa).\u2014District in the Agra Division of the United Provinces, lying between 26\u00b0 22' and 27\u00b0 1' N. and 78\u00b0 45' and 79\u00b0 45' E., with an area of 1,691 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Mainpuri and Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d; on the east by Cawnpore; on the south by J\u0101laun; and on the west by the State of Gwalior and Agra District. Etawah lies entirely in the Gangetic plain, but its physical features vary considerably and are determined by the rivers which cross it. Chief of these is the Junna, which forms part of the western boundary,\nand then flows across the western portion of the District to the southern boundary, where it separates Etawah from Jalaun. The area north-east of the Jumna is a level tract of extremely fertile soil, intersected by small rivers, the Pandu, the Arind, with its tributaries the Ahneya and Puraha, and the more important Sengar, with its tributary the Sirsa. In this area the stretch of rich cultivation is interrupted by patches of barren soil called usar, and by swamps or jhils. The banks of both the Sengar (in the lower reaches) and the Jumna are high and fissured by deep ravines, increasing in wildness and extent as the rivers flow eastward. West of the Jumna the character of the country changes completely. The river Chambal forms part of the western boundary of the District, and after a winding course across part of it falls into the Jumna near the southern boundary, and south-west of it the Kuari also divides Etawah from the State of Gwalior. The area between the Jumna and Chambal presents, for the most part, a scene of wild desolation, which can hardly be equalled in the plains of India. In the central tract a small area of level upland is found; but in the north-west and south-east the network of ravines which borders both the rivers meets in an inextricable maze. The finest view of this desolate wilderness is obtained from the fort at Bhareh, which stands near the junction of the Chambal and Jumna, and within a few miles of the junction of the Kuari, Sind, and Pahuj. South-west of the Chambal lies a tract as inhospitable as that just described, but with ravines of a less precipitous nature.\n\nThe District consists entirely of Gangetic alluvium, and the chief mineral product is kankar or limestone. This occurs in both nodular and block form, especially in the ravines. Reefs of kankar obstructing the navigation of the Jumna were removed many years ago, when some interesting mammalian remains were discovered\u00b9.\n\nThe flora is that of the plains generally. A large jungle once existed in the north-east, but has been largely cut down and cultivated, and only patches of dhak (Butea frondosa) remain. The chief trees growing wild are varieties of acacia, especially the babul (Acacia arabica), and the District is fairly well wooded. Near the town of Etawah a portion of the Jumna ravines was enclosed as a fuel and fodder reserve, but this has been leased to a Cawnpore tannery as a babul plantation. Elsewhere the ravines are generally covered merely with grass and thorny brushwood, or are entirely bare.\n\nLeopards are occasionally seen in the wild tract south of the Jumna, and a tiger was shot in the Reserve in the Fisher Forest in 1902. Wolves are becoming rare, and hog are commonest near the ravines and in the jungle near the north of the District. The antelope and nilgai are found in the Doab, and 'ravine deer' (gazelle) near the rivers.\n\n\u00b9 Journal, Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. ii, p. 622.\nDuck, teal, and snipe abound in the cold season. The larger rivers contain turtles, crocodiles, and the Gangetic porpoise, besides a great variety of fish.\n\nThe climate is that of the Do\u0101b generally. From April to the break of the monsoon hot west winds are usual, but the District is regarded as healthy. The annual rainfall averages 32 inches. Only slight variations occur in different parts, but the north-east receives a little more than the west. Considerable fluctuations are recorded from year to year. In 1868-9 the fall was less than 15 inches, while a year earlier it was nearly 50.\n\nNumerous mounds still show the ancient sites of prehistoric forts throughout the District, which long formed a main stronghold of the Meos, the Ishmaelites of the Upper Do\u0101b. In their hands it doubtless remained until after the earliest Muhammadan invasion, as none of the tribes now inhabiting its borders has any traditions which stretch back beyond the twelfth century of our era. Et\u0101wah was probably traversed both by Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni and by Kutb-ud-din on their successful expeditions against the native dynasties; but the memorials of these events are indistinct on all local details. It is clear, however, that the Hindus of Et\u0101wah succeeded on the whole in maintaining their independence against the Musalm\u0101n aggressors; for while some of the neighbouring Districts have a number of influential Muhammadan colonies, only a thin sprinkling of Shaikhs or Saiyids can be found among the territorial families of Et\u0101wah. The R\u0101jputs seem to have occupied the District during the twelfth century. Et\u0101wah town lies on one of the old routes through Northern India, and became the seat of a Muhammadan governor; but the histories teem with notices of raids conducted with varying success by the Saiyid generals against the 'accursed infidels' of Et\u0101wah. The Hindu chiefs were generally able to defend their country from the invaders, though they made peace after each raid by the payment of a precarious tribute. Early in the sixteenth century B\u0101bar conquered the District, together with the rest of the Do\u0101b; and it remained in the power of the Mughals until the expulsion of Hum\u0101y\u016bn. His Afgh\u0101n rival, Sher Sh\u0101h, found this portion of his dominions difficult to manage, and stationed 12,000 horsemen in and near the neighbouring pargana of Hatk\u0101nt (now the B\u0101h tahsil in Agra District), who dealt out such rude measures of justice as suited the circumstances of the place and the people. Akbar included parts of Et\u0101wah in his sark\u0101rs of Agra, Kanauj, K\u0101lpi, and Erachh. But even that great administrator failed to incorporate Et\u0101wah thoroughly with the dominions of the Delhi court. Neither as proselytizers nor as settlers have the Musalm\u0101ns impressed their mark so deeply here as in other Districts of the Do\u0101b. During the decline of the Mughal power, Et\u0101wah fell at first into the hands of the\nMar\u0101th\u0101s. The battle of P\u0101npat dispossessed them for a while, and the District became an apanage of the J\u0101t garrison at Agra. In 1770 the Mar\u0101th\u0101s returned, and for three years they occupied the Do\u0101b afresh. But when, in 1773, Najaf Kh\u0101n drove the intruders southward, the Naw\u0101b Waz\u012br of Oudh crossed the Ganges, and laid claim to his share of the spoil. During the anarchic struggle which closed the century, Et\u0101wah fell sometimes into the hands of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and sometimes into those of the Waz\u012br; but at last the power of Oudh became firmly established, and was not questioned until the cession to the East India Company in 1801. Even after the British took possession many of the local chiefs maintained a position of independence, or at least of insubordination; and it was some time before the revenue officers ventured to approach them with a demand for the Government dues. Gradually, however, the turbulent landowners were reduced to obedience, and industrial organization took the place of the old predatory r\u00e9gime. The murderous practice of thagi had been common before the cession, but was firmly repressed by the new power. In spite of a devastating famine in 1837, which revolutionized the proprietary system by dismembering the great talukas or fiscal farms, the District steadily improved for many years under the influence of settled government. The Mutiny of 1857 interrupted for some months this progress.\n\nNews of the outbreak at Meerut reached Et\u0101wah two days after its occurrence. Within the week, a small body of mutineers passed through the District and fired upon the authorities, upon which they were surrounded and cut down. Shortly after, another body occupied Jaswantnagar, and, although a gallant attack was made upon them by the local officials, they succeeded in holding the place. On May 22 it was thought desirable to withdraw from Et\u0101wah town; but the troops mutinied on their march, and it was with difficulty that the officers and ladies reached Barhpura. There they were joined by the first Gwalior Regiment, which, however, itself proved insubordinate on June 17. It then became necessary to abandon the District and retire to Agra. The Jh\u0101nsi mutineers immediately occupied Et\u0101wah, and soon passed on to Mainpuri. Meanwhile many of the native officials proved themselves steady friends of order, and communicated whenever it was possible with the Magistrate at Agra. Bands of rebels from different quarters passed through between July and December, until on Christmas Day Brigadier Walpole's column re-entered the District. Et\u0101wah station was recovered on January 6, 1858; but the rebels still held the Shergarh gh\u0101\u1e6d, on the main road to Bundelkhand, and the whole southwest of the District remained in their hands. During the early months of 1858 several endeavours were made to dislodge them step by step: but the local force was not sufficient to allow of any extensive operations. Indeed, it was only by very slow degrees that order was\nrestored; and as late as December 7 a body of plunderers from Oudh, under Firoz Shah, entered the District, burning and killing indiscriminately wherever they went. They were attacked and defeated at Harchandpur, and by the end of 1858 tranquillity was completely restored. Throughout the whole of this trying period the loyalty exhibited by the people of Etawah themselves was very noticeable. Though mutineers were constantly marching through the District, almost all the native officials remained faithful; and many continued to guard the treasure, and even to collect revenue, in the midst of anarchy and rebellion. The principal zamindars also were loyal almost to a man.\n\nThe District is rich in ancient mounds, though none has been explored. Munj and Asai Khera in the Etawah tahsil have been identified with places visited by Mahmud of Ghazni, but with doubtful accuracy (see Zafarabad). At the latter place a number of Jain sculptures, dated between the ninth and twelfth centuries, have been discovered. Several copperplate grants of Gobind Chand of Kanauj, dated early in the twelfth century, have been found at different places. The most striking building in the District is the Jama Masjid at Etawah town, built by altering an ancient Hindu or Buddhist structure.\n\nThere are 6 towns and 1,474 villages. Population has increased considerably during the last thirty years. The number of inhabitants at the last four enumerations was as follows: (1872) 668,641, (1881) 722,371, (1891) 727,629, and (1901) 806,798. The District is divided into four tahsils\u2014Etawah, Bharthana, Bidhuna, and Auraiya\u2014the head-quarters of each being at a place of the same name. The principal town is the municipality of Etawah, the administrative head-quarters of the District. The following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil   | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Percentage of increase in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|----------|----------------------|----------------|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Etawah   | 426                  | 2              | 353      | 216,142    | + 9.1                                           | 8,055                                  |\n| Bharthana| 416                  | 2              | 300      | 101,141    | + 12.4                                          | 5,101                                  |\n| Bidhuna  | 433                  |                | 413      | 266,182    | + 9.9                                           | 5,310                                  |\n| Auraiya  | 416                  | 2              | 408      | 193,333    | + 12.3                                          | 5,829                                  |\n| District total | 1,691               | 6              | 1,474    | 806,798    | + 10.9                                          | 24,295                                 |\n\nAbout 94 per cent. of the total are Hindus and less than 6 per cent. Musalmans, the latter proportion being the lowest in any District of the Doab. The absence of large towns and the barren area in the south\nwest cause a low density. The increase between 1891 and 1901 was large, as the District escaped from serious famine, and the number was augmented by immigration. Almost the whole population speak Western Hindi, the prevailing dialect being Kanaujia.\n\nAmong Hindus the most numerous castes are Cham\u0101rs (leather-workers and labourers), 107,000; Ahirs (graziers and cultivators), 103,000; Br\u0101hmans, 97,000; R\u0101jputs, 69,000; K\u0101chhis (cultivators), 51,000; Lodhas (cultivators), 48,000; Bani\u0101s, 29,000; and Koris (weavers), 27,000. It has already been stated that Muhammadans form a very small part of the total. The principal tribes are Pathans, 11,000, and Shaikhs (many of whom are descended from converted Hindus), 16,000. The agricultural population forms 70 per cent. of the total, while 7 per cent. are supported by general labour and 6 per cent. by personal services. Br\u0101hmans and R\u0101jputs each hold about one-third of the land in proprietary right. Br\u0101hmans, R\u0101jputs, and Ahirs occupy the largest areas as tenants; but K\u0101chhis and Lodhas are the best cultivators. Ahirs are the founders of many new hamlets, as they prefer to have waste land as pasturage for their cattle, and are more ready to migrate than most castes.\n\nThere were 198 native Christians in 1901, of whom 62 were Presbyterians. The American Presbyterian Church has had a mission here since 1863, with two out-stations.\n\nThe District contains four natural divisions affecting cultivation. The tract north-east of the Sengar is known as the pachir. The soil is a rich loam, interspersed with large tracts of \u016bsar and marshes or jhils, and produces fine crops of wheat and sugar-cane. South-west of the Sengar, and reaching to the high ground in which the Jumna ravines begin, lies an area known as the ghar, the soil of which is a red sandy loam. Water is at a great depth, and there are no \u016bsar plains and no jhils. The extension of canal-irrigation has made this the most fertile tract in the District, and there is now little difference between it and the pachir. The uplands and ravines of the Jumna are called the karkha. The uplands are similar to the ghar, but the ravines are barren. Along the Jumna rich alluvial land is found in places where the river does not approach the high bank. The area between the Jumna and Chambal and southwest of the Chambal, called p\u0101r, is largely uncultivated. Where the ravines do not meet, the table-land is composed of good loam. The Chambal alluvium is black soil resembling the m\u0101r of Bundelkhand, and is fertile; but there is little of it. Where the ravines contain good soil, this is protected by terraces and embankments, as in the Kumaun hills.\n\nThe tenures are those usually found in the United Provinces. Out of 4,282 mahals, 2,030 are held zamindari and 1,252 pattidari or\nbut the last class of tenure is very rare. The main agricultural statistics in 1903\u20134 are given below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Etawah | 426   | 221        | 96        | 99              |\n| Bharthana | 416   | 213        | 103       | 96              |\n| Bidhuna | 433   | 294        | 116       | 61              |\n| Auraiya | 416   | 238        | 82        | 105             |\n| **Total** | **1,691** | **876**    | **397**   | **361**         |\n\nThe chief food-crops, with their area in square miles, in the same year were: wheat (179), gram (144), jowar (93), barley (135), and bajra (150). Cotton covered 68 square miles and poppy 34.\n\nThere has been no extension of the cultivated area in the last thirty years. The area twice cropped has, however, nearly doubled, and is now about a fifth of the cultivated area. The cultivation of cotton and sugar has decreased, but on the other hand the area under maize and rice is higher than in 1872. In the west of the District drainage was obstructed by the railway and by the Bhognipur branch of the canal, but has been improved. Advances under the Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Act have been taken freely in adverse seasons. Thus in the wet years, 1890\u20132, Rs. 61,000 was advanced, and in the scarcity of 1896\u20137 Rs. 22,000. In ordinary years the advances are usually less than Rs. 1,000. About Rs. 47,000 was advanced in 1896\u20137 under the Land Improvement Loans Act; but in favourable seasons very few applications are received.\n\nThe District has no particular breed of cattle or horses. No attempts have been made to improve the indigenous strains, and the best cattle are imported. The buffaloes are, however, noted for milch purposes. Sheep and goats are reared in considerable numbers between the Jumna and Chambal, and have a considerable reputation in the Doab. The goats, in particular, are purchased and kept to give milk.\n\nThe pach\u0101r or tract north-east of the Sengar is irrigated by the Etawah branch of the Lower Ganges Canal, and the gh\u016br or red-soil area between the Sengar and the Jumna by the Bhognipur branch of the same canal. In 1903\u20134 canals irrigated 276 square miles, wells 105, and tanks and other sources 16. Wells are most common in the pach\u0101r, and are hardly used for irrigation in the karkha or the p\u0101r area.\n\nCalcareous limestone or kankar is found in many parts of the District, both in nodules and in block form. The hardest variety is obtained from the ravines, where it has been washed free from earth.\nThere are very few manufactures in the District. A little cotton cloth is woven in many villages, and finer kinds were formerly made at Etawah town. Crude glass is made at a few places, and Jaswantnagar is noted for brass-work.\n\nTrade and communications. Indigo is still made in 35 factories, employing about 1,700 hands; and 8 cotton-gins, 3 of which contain presses, employ about 1,000. There is also a small sandal-oil factory at Sarai Mahajnau.\n\nCotton, gh\u012b, gram, and oilseeds form the principal exports. Much of the gh\u012b comes from the State of Gwalior, and is sent to Calcutta and Bombay, while cotton is exported to Cawnpore, Bombay, and Calcutta. The imports are chiefly piece-goods, metals, drugs, and spices. There was formerly considerable traffic on the Jumna, but this has now ceased. Many fairs and markets are held in the District.\n\nThe East Indian Railway passes through the centre of the District from south-east to north-west, and extensions to tap the trade of the rich gh\u0101r tract are under consideration. There are 89 miles of metalled and 443 miles of unmetalled roads, all of which are maintained at the cost of Local funds, though the former are managed by the Public Works department. The old imperial road from Agra to Allahabad runs through the District, but very little of it has been metalled. The chief trade route is the road from Farrukhabad to Gwalior, which is metalled, and good feeder-roads have been made to the principal railway stations. Avenues of trees are maintained on 305 miles.\n\nThe District has suffered repeatedly from famine. Immediately after the commencement of British rule, drought and hailstorms caused much distress in 1803\u20134. Minor famines occurred in 1813\u20134, 1819, and 1825\u20136. The great famine of 1837\u20138 was most severely felt, and led to the breaking up of many large estates. In 1860\u20131 and in 1868\u20139 Etawah escaped as compared with other Districts. In 1877\u20138, though the rains failed almost completely, the canal commanded a large area and saved the harvest. Prices were high and relief works were opened, but famine was not severe. The famine of 1896\u20137 was felt in the kharka and p\u0101r tracts. Relief works were necessary, and the daily number on them rose to nearly 18,000 in February, 1897. Revenue was remitted to the extent of Rs. 59,000.\n\nThe ordinary District staff consists of a Collector, a Joint Magistrate belonging to the Indian Civil Service, and three Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. There is a tahsildar at the headquarters of each tahsil. Two Executive Engineers in charge of divisions of the Lower Ganges Canal and an officer of the Opium department are stationed at Etawah town.\nThere are two regular District Munsifs: but Etawah is included in the Civil and Sessions Judgeship of Mainpuri. On the whole, crime is lighter than in other Districts of the Agra Division; dacoities and cattle-theft are, however, common. Female infanticide was formerly rife, but is rarely suspected now.\n\nA District of Etawah was formed at the cession in 1801; but it included large areas now in adjoining Districts, and was administered from Mainpuri. Many changes took place, and in 1824 four subdivisions were formed. In 1840 the District took its present shape. The first settlement of 1801\u20132 was based on the accounts of the celebrated Almas Ali Khan, an officer of the Oudh government, and it was followed by other short-term settlements lasting three to five years. The demand at each of these was based on the previous demand, and on general considerations, such as the area under cultivation and the ease or difficulty with which collections were made. A large part of the District was held on talukdari tenures; but many of the talukdars gave much trouble to the administration, and some of them were forcibly ejected after open rebellion. The early settlements were oppressive, and cultivation decreased and tenants emigrated. The famine of 1837\u20138 completed the ruin of the talukdars, whose estates were settled with the resident cultivators. Operations were commenced on a more systematic principle under Regulation VII of 1822; but progress was extremely slow, and when the first regular settlement was begun in 1833 by Mr. (afterwards Lord) John Lawrence under Regulation IX of 1833, 100 villages had not been settled. The demand fixed in 1841 amounted to 13.1 lakhs, and was a reduction of over 10 per cent. on the previous demand. The next revision was made between 1868 and 1874. The land of each village was classified according to its soil, and suitable rent rates for each class of soil were assumed. These rates were selected from rents actually paid, and the 'assets' of each village were calculated from them. The recorded 'assets' were rejected, partly as being incorrect, and partly because rents had not been enhanced as much as it was thought they might have been. The new revenue was fixed at 13.3 lakhs, which represented 50 per cent. of the assumed 'assets.' At present the demand falls at an incidence of Rs. 1-7-0 per acre, varying from Rs. 1-6-0 to Rs. 1-9-0 in different parts of the District. It was expected that the actual 'assets' would rise to the assumed 'assets' within fifteen years. The question of a revision was considered in 1900, when it was decided that the settlement should be extended for a further ten years, as no increase of revenue was expected, and the existing demand was not so unequal as to require redistribution.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and total revenue are given in the table on the next page, in thousands of rupees.\nThe only municipality is that of Etawah, but five smaller towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. Outside these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which had an expenditure of 1.4 lakhs in 1903-4, of which Rs. 64,000 was spent on roads and buildings.\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 13.28  | 13.34  | 13.30  | 13.23  |\n| Total revenue  | 14.66  | 18.24  | 19.08  | 19.18  |\n\nThe District Superintendent of police has a force of 4 inspectors, 85 subordinate officers, and 344 men, besides 135 municipal and town police, and 1,500 village and road police. There are 19 police stations. The District jail contained a daily average of 231 prisoners in 1903.\n\nEducation is not very advanced. Only 3 per cent. of the population (5 males and 0.3 females) could read and write in 1901. The number of public schools fell from 147 in 1880-1 to 119 in 1900-1; but the number of pupils rose from 3,809 to 5,096. In 1903-4 there were 160 public schools with 6,447 pupils, of whom 294 were girls, besides 114 private schools with 1,214 pupils. Of the public schools, 3 are managed by Government and 107 by the District and municipal boards, the rest being under private management. The total expenditure on education was Rs. 45,000, of which Rs. 31,000 was derived from Local funds and Rs. 9,000 from fees.\n\nThere are 8 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 75 in-patients. The number of cases treated in 1903 was 45,000, of whom 602 were in-patients, and 2,700 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 11,000, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nAbout 25,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, representing a proportion of 31 per 1,000 of the population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipality.\n\n[C. H. T. Crosthwaite and W. E. Neale, Settlement Report (1875); District Gazetteer (1876, under revision).]\n\n**Etawah Tahsil.**\u2014North-western tahsil of Etawah District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between 26\u00b0 38' and 27\u00b0 1' N. and 78\u00b0 45' and 79\u00b0 13' E., with an area of 426 square miles. Population increased from 128,023 in 1891 to 216,142 in 1901. There are 353 villages and two towns: ETAWAH (population, 42,570), the tahsil head-quarters, and JASWANTNAGAR (5,405). The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,18,000, and for cesses Rs. 51,000. The density of population, 507 persons per square mile, is a little above the District average. The tahsil contains portions of the four natural tracts found in the District. North-east of the Sengar river lies the pach\u0101r, a fertile loam tract which, however,\ncontains marshes and patches of barren land or *usar*. A tract called *gh\u0101r* lies south of the Sengar, with a soil which, though lighter, is very fertile when irrigated. The Jumna ravines, known as *karkha*, and the area between the Jumna and Chambal, called *p\u0101r*, are generally barren and there is little alluvial land. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 221 square miles, of which 96 were irrigated. The Etawah and Bhognipur branches of the Lower Ganges Canal supply more than half the irrigated area, and wells most of the remainder.\n\n**Etawah Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the District and *tahsil* of the same name in the United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 46' N. and 79\u00b0 1' E., on the East Indian Railway, at the junction of the road from Farrukhab\u0101d to Gwalior with the old imperial road from Agra to Allah\u0101b\u0101d. Population (1901), 42,570, of whom 28,544 are Hindus and 12,742 Musalm\u0101ns. The city dates back to a period before the Musalm\u0101n conquest, but nothing is known of its early history. It became the seat of a Muhammadan governor, and was repeatedly attacked and plundered in the troublous times after the death of F\u012broz Sh\u0101h Tughlak, when its Hindu chief raised the standard of revolt. Under Akbar it was the chief town of a *pargana*, and is mentioned in the *Ain-i-Akbar\u012b* as possessing a brick fort. A century later Etawah was famous as a banking and commercial centre; but in the eighteenth century it suffered much from Rohilla and afterwards from Mar\u0101th\u0101 raids. For its later history and events of the Mutiny, see **Etawah District**. The J\u0101ma Masjid is a fine building constructed from a Hindu temple, with a massive front or propylon resembling those of the great mosques at Jaunpur. There are also some fine Hindu temples and bathing *gh\u0101ts*, and a great mound with a ruined fort. The town is situated among the ravines of the Jumna, to the banks of which the suburbs extend. Humeganj, a handsome square, called after a former Collector, Mr. A. O. Hume, C.B., contains the public buildings and forms the centre of the city. It includes a market-place, *tahsil\u012b*, mission-house, police station, and male and female hospitals. The Hume high school, built chiefly by private subscriptions, and one of the first to be founded in the United Provinces, is a handsome building. The north and south sides of the square form the principal grain and cotton markets. The civil station lies about half a mile north of the town. Besides the ordinary District staff, two Executive Engineers and an officer of the Opium department have their head-quarters here. Etawah is also the chief station of the American Presbyterian Mission in the District. The municipality was constituted in 1864. During the ten years ending 1901, the income averaged Rs. 37,000 and the expenditure Rs. 36,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 55,000, chiefly from octroi (Rs. 41,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 59,000. There are no important manufactures, but cotton cloth is woven, and the town\nis noted for a special sweetmeat. In 1903 seven cotton gins and presses employed 805 hands. Trade consists largely in the export of gh\u012b, gram, cotton, and oilseeds. The municipality maintains four schools and aids eight others, with a total attendance of 814 pupils in 1904.\n\nEt\u0101wa.\u2014Town in the Khurai tahsil of Saugor District, Central Provinces, situated in 24\u00b0 12' N. and 78\u00b0 14' E., 2 miles from Bina railway junction. Population (1901), 6,418. Et\u0101wa is not a municipality, but a town fund is raised for sanitary purposes. The opening of the branch line from Bina to Katni has greatly increased the importance of Et\u0101wa, and it is a thriving place. It contains vernacular middle and girls' schools, as well as schools and a dispensary supported from missionary funds.\n\nEttaiy\u0101puram Estate.\u2014A zamind\u0101ri in Tinnevelly District, Madras, situated in the Ottappid\u0101ram t\u0101luk in the north-east of the District. Its area is nearly 570 square miles, and it comprises 374 villages with a population (1901) of 154,000. The principal castes are all Telugus by race. The ancestors of the zamind\u0101r originally came from Chandragiri in North Arcot District. Kum\u0101ramuttu Naik, the fourteenth in descent, migrated to Madura owing to the disturbances in the north consequent on the invasion of Al\u0101-ud-din Khilji. The exile was kindly received by the P\u0101ndyan king, who granted him extensive lands. Later on Kum\u0101ramuttu was sent down to quell disturbances in Tinnevelly. He accordingly proceeded to S\u0101tt\u016br and built a fort there, the remains of which can be seen at the present day on the south bank of the S\u0101tt\u016br river. The present town of Ettaiy\u0101puram (population, 8,788), the head-quarters of the zamind\u0101ri, is said to have been founded in 1567. Muttu Jaga V\u012bra R\u0101ma Naik, the thirty-first zamind\u0101r, had a standing army of 6,000 men and rendered help to the British Government during the Polig\u0101r wars of 1799\u20131801, receiving, in recognition of his services, four out of the six divisions into which the forfeited estates of the vanquished polig\u0101rs were divided. The estate consists mainly of black cotton soil. Out of a cultivable area of 6,000 acres of 'wet,' and 250,000 acres of 'dry' land, nearly 5,000 acres and 240,000 acres respectively are under cultivation, the 'wet' land being watered by more than 90 tanks. The rainfall averages 33 inches. About 10,000 acres are set aside as game preserves, in which antelope, hares, and partridges abound. Jaggery (coarse sugar) is made from the palmyra palm in large quantities, and half the cotton grown in Tinnevelly District comes from this estate.\n\nThe estate is held under permanent zamind\u0101ri tenure, and yields an income of more than 3\u00bd lakhs, while the annual peshkash, or permanent assessment paid to Government, amounts to Rs. 1,16,000. About 100 miles of road are maintained by the estate, and it contributes Rs. 1,000\nannually towards the upkeep of two Local fund hospitals at Ettaiy\u0101puram and N\u0101gal\u0101puram. There is a high school for boys and a girls' school at Ettaiy\u0101puram town.\n\n**Ettaiy\u0101puram Town.**\u2014Chief place in the zam\u012bndari of the same name in the Ottappid\u0101ram taluk of Tinnevelly District, Madras, situated in 9\u00b0 9' N. and 78\u00b0 E., 10 miles from Koilpatti station on the South Indian Railway. Population (1901), 8,788. Local affairs are managed by a Union panchay\u0101t. There is a hospital and a high school, and it also contains the residence of the zam\u012bnd\u0101r.\n\n**Everest, Mount.**\u2014The highest known point on the earth's surface, situated in the Nep\u0101l Him\u0101layas (27\u00b0 59' N., 86\u00b0 56' E.). Its altitude is 29,002 feet above sea-level; and the name of Everest was assigned to it by Sir Andrew Waugh in 1856, in honour of Sir George Everest, his predecessor as Surveyor-General of India, no native name for the peak being traceable. The question of the identity of Everest with the peaks known as Gaur\u012b Sankar has been constantly discussed, and at length satisfactorily disposed of by the observations recently taken in the neighbourhood of K\u0101tm\u0101ndu by Captain Wood, R.E. He has conclusively proved that the name Gaur\u012b Sankar is applied to the two highest peaks of the only conspicuous mountain group visible from K\u0101tm\u0101ndu city, and that these are no less than 36 miles west of Everest, which is not visible from the valley of K\u0101tm\u0101ndu and is in no way conspicuous from the hills surrounding the valley.\n\n**Faiz\u0101b\u0101d (1).**\u2014Capital of Badakhsh\u0101n, in Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, situated in 37\u00b0 8' N., 69\u00b0 47' E.; 3,920 feet above the sea. It stands on the right bank of the Kokcha stream, which flows in a rocky, trench-like bed, successive ridges of hills rising behind the town to a height of at least 2,000 feet. Utterly destroyed by Mur\u0101d Beg in 1829, it was still in ruins when visited by Captain Wood in 1837. It was restored by Faiz Muhammad Kh\u0101n, when governor of Badakhsh\u0101n in 1865. Ney Elias, who was there in 1866, writes:\n\n'The town of Faiz\u0101b\u0101d is one of the most uninteresting spots to be found even in Central Asia. It contains probably some 4,000 inhabitants, chiefly T\u0101jiks. A bazar is held twice a week, and on these occasions a fairly large gathering of people from the neighbouring districts takes place; but during the remainder of the week the place lies torpid, the majority of the shops being shut. The chief trade is probably with Kol\u0101b, whence Russian cotton manufactures, sugar, cutlery, crockery, candles, &c., and Bokh\u0101ra silks are brought; and these are the wares that, in addition to country produce, chiefly fill the shops. English manufactures are rare, but still they are to be seen\u2014chiefly cotton prints and muslins\u2014together with Indian-made h\u016bg\u012bs or turbans and common kamkhw\u0101b, all of which come from Pesh\u0101war by way of either K\u0101bul or Chitr\u0101l. Sanitary arrangements there are none; and this, combined with severe heat in summer, great cold in winter,\nand usually a deadly stillness in the atmosphere, seems to produce conditions that render outbreaks of epidemics of frequent occurrence.\n\nIt is hardly surprising that, in a town which has been rebuilt within the last forty years, no remarkable buildings exist.\n\n**Faiz\u0101b\u0101d (2).**\u2014Division, District, *tahs\u012bl*, and city in the United Provinces. See Fyz\u0101b\u0101d.\n\n**Faizpur.**\u2014Town in the Yaval *t\u0101huka* of East Kh\u0101ndesh District, Bombay, situated in $21^\\circ 10'$ N. and $75^\\circ 52'$ E., 72 miles north-east of Dh\u016blia. Population (1901), 10,181. Faizpur is famous for its cotton prints and its dark blue and red dyes. About 250 families dye thread, turbans, and other pieces of cloth, and print cloth of all sorts. A weekly timber market is held, and it is also one of the chief cotton marts in Kh\u0101ndesh. The municipality, established in 1889, had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 6,500. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 7,100. The town contains five schools, with 564 pupils, of which one, with 57 pupils, is for girls.\n\n**F\u0101l\u0101k\u0101ta.**\u2014Village in the Alipur subdivision of Jalpaiguri District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $26^\\circ 31'$ N. and $89^\\circ 13'$ E., on the east bank of the Mujnai river within a mile of the Cooch Beh\u0101r boundary. Population (1901), 287. F\u0101l\u0101k\u0101ta is an important market, at which some of the best jute, tobacco, and mustard grown in the Du\u0101rs are sold. It lies on the main road between Jalpaiguri and Alipur, and the river is navigable to this point by boats of 2 tons throughout the year. An annual fair lasting for a month is held in February. Agricultural produce and stock are exhibited for prizes, and the fair is visited by a large number of Bhoti\u0101s and by merchants from all parts.\n\n**Falam Subdivision.**\u2014Central subdivision of the Chin Hills, Burma, bounded on the north by the Tiddim and on the south by the Haka subdivision. The population in 1901 was 36,858, largely Tashon Chins, inhabiting 173 villages, of which Falam, containing 625 houses, is the largest and most important.\n\n**Falam.**\u2014Head-quarters of the Chin Hills, Burma, situated in $22^\\circ 56'$ N. and $93^\\circ 44'$ E., on a spur above the Manipur river, 5,300 feet above sea-level, and distant 108 miles from Kalewa, and 72 from Kalemyo on the Myittha, with which it is connected by a good mule road. In the early days of the occupation of the Chin Hills, Falam post was built on a spur overlooking the Tashon village of Falam. Owing to the unhealthiness of the site, however, the station was moved to where it now stands, 5 miles to the west of Falam village. Roads have been made in the station and trees planted. The water supply is obtained from springs west of the station, and at present reaches the different buildings through open wooden ducts, soon to be replaced by iron pipes. The bazar lies to the east of the residential quarter. The\nregular inhabitants numbered 911 in 1901, besides a large floating population.\n\n**False Point.**\u2014Cape, harbour, and lighthouse in the Kendrap\u0101ra subdivision of Cuttack District, Bengal, situated in $20^\\circ 20' N.$ and $86^\\circ 47' E.$, on the north of the Mah\u0101nadi estuary. It takes its name from the circumstance that it was often mistaken by ships for Point Palmyras one degree farther north. Ships have to anchor in a comparatively exposed roadway, and loading and unloading can only be carried on in moderately fair weather. A considerable export of rice, however, still takes place to Mauritius and Ceylon chiefly in sailing ships, valued in 1903\u20134 at 19\u00b765 lakhs, while the export to the Madras Presidency amounted to over a lakh. The lighthouse stands in $20^\\circ 19' 50'' N.$ and $86^\\circ 47' 30'' E.$\n\n**Falt\u0101.**\u2014Village in the Diamond Harbour subdivision of the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 17' N.$ and $88^\\circ 7' E.$, on the left bank of the Hooghly river, nearly opposite to its junction with the D\u0101modar. Falt\u0101 is the site of an old Dutch factory, and it was to this place that the English retreated after the capture of Calcutta by Siraj-ud-daula in 1756. A fort is situated here, which mounts heavy guns. The steamers plying between Calcutta and Taml\u016bk in the Midnapore District call at Falt\u0101.\n\n**Far\u0101sd\u0101nga.**\u2014A French settlement or *loge* on the outskirts of Balasore Town, Bengal. The settlement was established towards the close of the seventeenth century, but much of the land comprised within it has been washed away, and its total area is now only 38 acres. This plot of land is under the authority of the Administrator of Chandernagore, and is leased out annually by public auction.\n\n**Far\u012bdab\u0101d.**\u2014Town in the Ballabgarh *tehsil* of Delhi District, Punjab, situated in $28^\\circ 25' N.$ and $77^\\circ 20' E.$, 16 miles from Delhi, near the Delhi-Muttra road and on the Delhi-Agra branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 5,310. The town was founded in 1607 by Shaikh Farid, Jah\u0101ng\u012br's treasurer, to protect the high road from Delhi to Agra. It is of no commercial importance. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 5,900, and the expenditure Rs. 5,800. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 6,800, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 6,400. The chief educational institutions are the Victoria Anglo-veracular middle school (unaided), a vernacular middle school maintained by the municipality, and the English station school (middle). There is a Government dispensary.\n\n**Far\u012bdkot State.**\u2014Native State in the Punjab, under the political control of the Commissioner of the Jullundur Division, lying between $30^\\circ 13'$ and $30^\\circ 50' N.$ and $74^\\circ 31'$ and $75^\\circ 5' E.$, in the south of Ferozepore District, with an area of 6,42 square miles. Population (1901),\nIt contains two towns, Far\u012bdkot (population, 10,405), the capital, and Kot Kap\u016bra (9,519); and 167 villages. The country is a dead level, sandy in the west, but more fertile to the east, where the Sirhind Canal irrigates a large area.\n\nThe ruling family belongs to the Sidh\u016b-Bar\u0101r clan of the Jats, and are descended from the same stock as the Ph\u016blk\u012b\u0101n houses. Their occupation of Far\u012bdkot and Kot Kap\u016bra dates from the time of Akbar, though quarrels with the surrounding Sikh States and internal dissensions have greatly reduced the patrimony. Throughout the Sikh Wars R\u0101j\u0101 Pah\u0101r Singh loyally assisted the British, and was rewarded by a grant of half the territory confiscated in 1846 from the R\u0101j\u0101 of N\u0101bha, while his ancestral possession of Kot Kap\u016bra, which had been wrested from Far\u012bdkot in 1808, was restored to him. During the Mutiny, his son Waz\u012br Singh, who succeeded in 1849, rendered active assistance to the British and was suitably rewarded. The present R\u0101j\u0101, Brij Indar Singh, is a minor, and the administration is carried on by a council under the presidency of an Extra-Assistant Commissioner, whose services have been lent to the State for the purpose. The council is, during the minority of the R\u0101j\u0101, the final court of appeal, but sentences of death require confirmation by the Commissioner. The R\u0101j\u0101 is entitled to a salute of 11 guns. The State receives, at a reduced duty of Rs. 280 per chest, an allotment of 18 chests of M\u0101lwa opium annually, each chest containing 1.25 cwt. The duty so paid is refunded, with the object of securing the co-operation of the State officials in the suppression of smuggling. The Imperial Service troops consist of one company of Sappers; and the local troops number 41 cavalry, 127 infantry, and 20 artillerymen, with 6 serviceable guns. The State maintains a high school at Far\u012bdkot town and a charitable dispensary. The total revenue amounted in 1905\u20136 to 3.6 lakhs.\n\nFar\u012bdkot Town.\u2014Capital of the Far\u012bdkot State, Punjab, lying in 30\u00b0 40' N. and 74\u00b0 49' E., 20 miles south of Ferozepore, on the Ferozepore-Bhatinda branch of the North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 10,405. The fort was built about 700 years ago by R\u0101j\u0101 Mokulsi, a Manj R\u0101jput, in the time of B\u0101wa Far\u012bd, who gave it his name. The town contains the residence of the R\u0101j\u0101 of Far\u012bdkot and the public offices of the State. It has a considerable trade in grain, and possesses a high school and a charitable dispensary.\n\nFar\u012bdnagar.\u2014Town in the Gh\u0101zi\u0101b\u0101d tahs\u012bl of Meerut District, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 46' N. and 77\u00b0 41' E., 16 miles southwest of Meerut city. Population (1901), 5,620. It was founded by Far\u012bd-ud-d\u012bn Kh\u0101n in the reign of Akbar. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,600, and contains a primary school.\n\nFar\u012bdpur District.\u2014District in the Dacca Division of Eastern\nBengal and Assam, lying between $22^\\circ 51'$ and $23^\\circ 55'$ N., and $89^\\circ 19'$ and $90^\\circ 37'$ E., with an area of 2,281 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Padm\u0101 or main stream of the Ganges; on the east by the Meghn\u0101; on the west by the Garai river, with its continuation the Madhumati and its branch the B\u0101r\u0101sia, which separate it from the Districts of Nadi\u0101 and Jessore; and on the south by Baekergunge.\n\nThis District is essentially a fluvial creation, and exhibits the later stages in the formation of the Gangetic delta. In the north and east the land is comparatively well raised, and is high and dry except during the rains; but the level sinks towards the south, and, on the confines of Backergunge, the whole country is one vast marsh intersected by strips of high land, the deposits of the rivers that have at different times flowed through the tract. The marshes are slowly but steadily silting up, and are being reclaimed for cultivation. The inhabitants build their houses on the higher land of the river banks or on mounds from 12 to 20 feet high laboriously thrown up during the dry months, and in the rains these homesteads alone rise above the waste of waters topped with grass or rice.\n\nWith the exception of the Meghn\u0101, the river system is that of the Padm\u0101, one branch of which in the lower reaches is called the Kirtin\u0101s\u0101 or 'destroyer of antiquities,' owing to the ravages it has wrought among the palaces, temples, and monuments of R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101j Ballabh of R\u0101jnagar, one of the old capitals of Eastern Bengal. This and the Madhumat\u012b, the Garai, and the Ari\u0101l Kh\u0101n are large rivers, navigable throughout the year by trading boats of 4 tons burden; but there are numerous minor ramifications, the principal of which are the Chandn\u0101, the Bhubaneswar, the Mar\u0101 (or 'dead') Padm\u0101 or P\u0101lang, and the Nay\u0101 Bh\u0101ngni (or 'new cut'). The interior is drained by a network of small waterways, such as the Kum\u0101r, the Sit\u0101lakhya, another Mar\u0101 Padm\u0101, and the Jakhl\u0101, all of which flow ultimately into the Ari\u0101l Kh\u0101n. The southern marshes, known as the Nasibsh\u0101hi, the At\u0101d\u0101nga, and the K\u0101j\u0101li\u0101 swamps, are drained by the Gh\u0101gar or Sildaha river, which falls into the Madhumati.\n\nThe District consists of recent alluvium, composed of sandy clay and sand along the course of the rivers and fine silt consolidating into clay in other parts of the river plain, while in the marshes beds of impure peat commonly occur.\n\nAlmost all the trees and plants common to Lower Bengal grow here. Marsh plants and weeds are found in great variety and luxuriance, and in the south the surface of the marshes either shows huge stretches of inundated rice, or is covered with matted floating islets of sedges and grasses and various water-lilies, the most striking of these being the makana (Euryale ferox). The artificial mounds on which habitations\nare situated are, where not occupied by gardens, densely covered with a scrub jungle of semi-spontaneous species, with a few taller trees, among which the commonest is the jival (Odina Wodier), and the most conspicuous the red cotton-tree (Bombax malabaricum). Palms are common, the chief species being the date-palm (Phoenix acantls) in the north, and the betel-nut (Areca Catechu) in the south. Mangoes of an inferior quality abound and plantains are grown round every house, both on the mainland and the river flats, while dense clusters of bamboos surround and overshadow every village. Tall casuarinas (Casuarina muricata) mark the sites of old indigo factories and line the roads.\n\nLeopards still lurk in the jungles in the north and west of the District, and occasionally a tiger breaks cover from the Sundarbans and takes refuge in the southern marshes. Wild hog devastate the crops, especially in the Faridpur, Bhushan\u0101, and Ainpur th\u0101nas. Crocodiles, both of the man-eating and fish-eating varieties, swarm in the large rivers, which teem with fish, the hilsa being an important article of export to Calcutta.\n\nHumidity ranges high from April to October. The mean temperature remains at $83^\\circ$ from April to September, but falls during the cold season to $66^\\circ$, the mean minimum being lowest ($53^\\circ$) in January. Rainfall commences early in the hot season; the average is $8.5$ inches in May, $12.2$ in June, $11.8$ in July, $11.5$ in August, and $8.1$ in September, the total for the year being $66$ inches. The District is always inundated when the rivers rise in the rainy season, but the floods seldom cause more than local damage: and they are in fact beneficial, as they cover the country with a rich alluvial deposit, which is gradually raising the level of the swamps.\n\nVery little is known of the earlier history of Faridpur. The eastern subdivision of M\u0101daripur was once an apanage of Bikrampur, and the District was subsequently included in the ancient kingdom of Banga (called Samatata by Hiuen Tsiang) which has given its name to the modern Province of Bengal. Its people are described in the Raghubansa as living in boats, and they were clearly the ancestors of the Chand\u0101ls, who are still very numerous in this part of the country. Faridpur passed under Muhammadan rule with the rest of Eastern Bengal at the beginning of the fourteenth century, and in $1582$, at the time of Todar Mal's settlement, it appears to have been included within the sark\u0101r of Muhammad\u0101b\u0101d or Bh\u016bshan\u0101. In the reign of Jah\u0101ng\u012br a number of chiefs, most of whom were Hindus, known to local tradition as the B\u0101ra ('twelve') Bhuiy\u0101s, established independent principalities in East Bengal: and among them two brothers, Ch\u0101nd Rai and Ked\u0101r Rai, extended their sway from R\u0101j\u0101b\u0101ri in the District of Dacca to Ked\u0101rb\u0101ri, now in the P\u0101lang th\u0101na of Faridpur,\nwhere a deep ditch and the remains of a road known as K\u0101chkigur\u0101 Road mark the site of their residence or fort. The remains of a fort of R\u0101j\u0101 S\u012bt\u0101 R\u0101m Rai, another of the Bhuiy\u0101s, can still be seen at Kil\u0101b\u0101ri in the Bh\u016bshan\u0101 th\u0101na; he was overthrown by the Mughals in a pitched battle at a place still known as Fatchpur (\"town of victory\"). For two centuries after the Muhammadan advent, the country was overrun by the Maghs or Arakanese, and their depredations drove the people into the inaccessible marshes, where protective moats are still to be seen at Uj\u0101ni in Maks\u016bdpur and at Kotw\u0101lp\u0101ra. Up to 1790 the present District was included in the tract known as Dacca Jal\u0101lpur, with the exception of the present th\u0101na of Bh\u016bshan\u0101 and part of Maks\u016bdpur which were included in Jessore, and the Gopin\u0101thpur j\u0101rgana which belonged to Backergunge. The separate existence of the District dates from 1811, when courts were built at Faridpur, and the tract east of the Chandn\u0101 was transferred from Jessore. Subsequently, when the territory east of the Padm\u0101 was given up to Dacca, the District became known as Faridpur. About this time Gopin\u0101thpur was received from Backergunge, and there were various subsequent changes of jurisdiction, the M\u0101daripur subdivision being transferred from Backergunge in 1874, and the Krok\u012bchar outpost from Dacca in 1895. The river Padm\u0101 has of late years been steadily encroaching towards Dacca and receding from this District, which has thus received a large accession of area.\n\nThe population increased from 1,530,288 in 1872 to 1,660,037 in 1881, to 1,823,715 in 1891, and to 1,937,646 in 1901. Malarial fever is prevalent, especially in the north and west of the District, and the decrease in the rate of progress in the last decade was due to the growing unhealthiness of this tract.\n\nThe chief statistics of the Census of 1901 are shown below:\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Number of Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between (1891 and 1901) | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Faridpur    | 860                 | 1              | 2,299             | 712,226    | 828                       | + 6.8                                           | 36,604                                 |\n| Goalundo    | 428                 | ...            | 1,178             | 310,285    | 746                       | - 9.2                                           | 16,995                                 |\n| M\u0101daripur   | 993                 | 1              | 1,806             | 906,135    | 913                       | + 12.5                                          | 46,207                                 |\n| District total | 2,281               | 2              | 5,283             | 1,937,646  | 849                       | + 6.2                                           | 99,866                                 |\n\nThe two towns are Faridpur, the head-quarters, and M\u0101daripur. The density of population is greater than in any other part of East Bengal, except Dacca District; the most crowded areas lie in the M\u0101daripur subdivision. The whole of the Goalundo subdivision and\nthe Bh\u016bshan\u0101 th\u0101na in the head-quarters subdivision belong to a decadent tract, where the population is diminishing; and there is an equally unhealthy area in the P\u0101lang th\u0101na to the east of the M\u0101d\u0101ripur subdivision, which, however, has received extensive alluvial accretions. Several other th\u0101nas, such as Sibchar and Bh\u0101nga, have grown in the same way, and possess an area considerably in excess of that with which they are credited in the records of the Survey department, and on which the Census calculations of density were based. A number of immigrants from Dacca, whose houses on the north bank of the Padm\u0101 have been destroyed by the erosion of the river, have crossed to the Far\u012bdpur side, and there is an annual influx of earth-workers, p\u0101lk\u012b-bearers, and other unskilled labourers from Bih\u0101r and the United Provinces. A similar exodus takes place from Far\u012bdpur to Backergunge. The vernacular spoken consists of the dialects known as Eastern or Musalm\u0101ni, and East-Central, Bengali. Nearly 62 per cent. of the inhabitants are Muhammadans and, as elsewhere, the proportion is steadily increasing: they now number 1,199,351, and Hindus 733,555.\n\nThe vast majority of the Muhammadans are Shaikhs (1,113,000), though Jol\u0101h\u0101s (58,000) are also numerous, doubtless in the main the descendants of converted Chand\u0101ls or Namas\u016bdras, who are still so numerous that they include more than three-sevenths of the whole Hindu population. These people, who are chiefly found in the M\u0101d\u0101ripur subdivision and in the southern marshes, are among the hardiest and most healthy of the Hindus, and are struggling hard to improve their social status, which is at present a very low one. Br\u0101hmans (51,000) and K\u0101yasths (85,000) are most numerous in the M\u0101d\u0101ripur and P\u0101lang th\u0101nas, formerly part of the Bikrampur pargana; the men of these castes emigrate in large numbers in search of clerical employment. S\u0101h\u0101s (36,000), the great mercantile caste, are also numerous. Nearly 1\u00bd millions, or 77 per cent. of the District population, are dependent upon agriculture for their livelihood, 12 per cent. on industry, 1 per cent. on commerce, 2 per cent. on the professions, and 3 per cent. on unskilled labour.\n\nThe Australian Baptist Mission works at Far\u012bdpur, the Baptist Mission at M\u0101d\u0101ripur, and the Evangelistic Mission at Gop\u0101lganj; and their converts, who are mainly Chand\u0101ls, have increased during the last decade from 3,500 to 4,600. The activity of these missions, however, is not to be gauged simply by the number of their converts, for they have also done a great deal in the cause of education.\n\nThe soil is generally a rich loam, with a deposit of vegetable mould in the marshy area. The comparatively high lands in the north-west and centre are well-wooded; here, except in a few depressions where winter rice is grown, two crops are usually obtained, rice or jute being harvested in July or August, and\noilseeds, pulses, wheat, or barley in February. In recently reclaimed alluvial lands the alternation of crops is similar; but low lands which are flooded early yield only spring rice, which is reaped in May or June. In the southern marshes early and late rice are sown together in April. The plants grow with the rise of the flood, and the early crop ripens in August and is reaped from boats. The late rice ripens in October or November, and so much of the stalks as is then above the water is cut; the rest rots, and is burnt and ploughed in when the water has subsided.\n\nThe chief agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Subdivision | Total | Cultivated | Cultivable waste |\n|-------------|-------|------------|------------------|\n| Faridpur    | 860   | 660        | 37               |\n| Goalundo    | 428   | 329        | 18               |\n| Madaripur   | 993   | 703        | 42               |\n| **Total**   | **2,281** | **1,752** | **97**           |\n\nRice occupies five-sixths of the cultivated area, the winter crop accounting for three-fifths of the whole. After rice, jute is the crop most extensively grown; its cultivation has increased very rapidly of late years, and it now occupies 148 square miles. Pulses are an important cold-season crop, especially miskalai (*Phaseolus radiatus*); some of this is consumed or exported, but the greater part is grazed by cattle. Rape and mustard and sugar-cane are also largely grown.\n\nLittle cultivable land remains untilled; the marshes are ploughed as soon as they silt up sufficiently, and newly formed alluvial lands are cultivated the moment they become fit to bear crops. In Government estates attempts have been made to introduce new cereals and vegetables, and seeds have been freely distributed, but without much result. There is generally little need for Government loans, as the land is very fertile, yielding rich harvests with very little toil, and wealth is evenly distributed; but Rs. 23,000 was advanced in 1893-4 and Rs. 14,000 in 1897-8 under the Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Act.\n\nThe indigenous breed of cattle is very poor, and very little has been done to improve it, though the richer farmers occasionally introduce better animals from Bhagalpur. The only fair of any importance is that held at Faridpur in January and February in connexion with an Agricultural Exhibition, at which prizes are given for agricultural produce, implements, and cattle, and also to weavers and other handcraftsmen.\n\nHand-weaving supports 53,000 persons, a larger number than in\nany other District of Bengal. The industry is carried on chiefly by the Muhammadan Jol\u0101h\u0101s, who, in addition to coarse cotton cloths for local use, manufacture a large quantity of a cotton check, known as ch\u0101rkh\u0101na, which finds a ready sale in Calcutta. A fine variety of sit\u0101lp\u0101\u1e6di (Phrynium dichotomum) mats is made in the Bh\u016bshana th\u0101na, and the Namas\u016bdras weave coarse mats of bamboos, canes, and reeds; gunny-bags are also manufactured, chiefly by the Kap\u0101li caste. A good deal of gold and silver jewellery, brass, copper and ironwork, and pottery is made for local use; and boat-building is an important industry. There are no factories, but a few jute hand-presses have recently been introduced.\n\nThe bulk of the trade is with Calcutta. Jute forms the principal export, rice, pulses, oilseeds, and fish being the articles of next importance. The chief imports are European cotton piece-goods, salt, kerosene oil, corrugated iron, molasses and sugar, coal and coke from Burdw\u0101n, M\u0101nbh\u016bm, and Assam, common rice from Bogra and Dinajpur, and fine rice and timber from Baris\u0101l. The Calcutta trade is carried by the Eastern Bengal State Railway, by country boats via Khuln\u0101, or by the steamer services. Goalundo, the terminus of the railway and of several important steamer routes, is a focus through which an enormous volume of trade passes, and M\u0101d\u0101r\u012bpur is growing in importance. Other important trade centres are Far\u012bdpur, P\u0101ngsa, Belg\u0101chi, R\u0101jb\u0101ri, and P\u0101churi\u0101 on the railway; Sadarpur on the banks of the Bhubaneswar; Jam\u0101lpur, Madhukh\u0101li, and K\u0101m\u0101rkh\u0101li on the Chandn\u0101; Saiyidpur and Boalm\u0101ri on the Jessore road; K\u0101naipur, Jaynagar, and Bh\u0101nga on the Kum\u0101r; Gop\u0101lganj, Bh\u0101ti\u0101p\u0101ra, and P\u0101tgh\u0101ti on the Madhumati; P\u0101lang on the P\u0101lang river; and Mulfatganj inland. The middlemen who purchase agricultural produce from the cultivators are usually Muhammadans or Namas\u016bdras. Agents of European firms in Calcutta are employed to buy jute, and S\u0101h\u0101s and M\u0101rw\u0101ris also do wholesale business. In the drier parts of the District bullock-carts and pack-ponies are occasionally used, but boats are the almost universal means of carriage; during the rains every village is accessible by water and boat traffic is very brisk, stocks being purchased at that season for the whole year's consumption.\n\nThe Eastern Bengal State Railway (broad gauge) enters the District near M\u0101chp\u0101ra and crosses the north-west corner to its terminus at Goalundo on the Padm\u0101; from P\u0101churi\u0101 a branch line runs to the head-quarters station. The principal roads are those from Far\u012bdpur to Jessore, R\u0101jb\u0101ri, and Bh\u0101nga, and from K\u0101naipur to P\u0101ngsa. Exclusive of village and municipal roads, the District contains only 182 miles of road, of which 10 miles are metalled. As already stated, most of the traffic is carried by water.\nThe steamer services from Goalundo down the Padma touch at various places within the District, and a branch line plies to M\u0101d\u0101ripur. An important route, known as the Kum\u0101r-Madhumati-Bil route, carries most of the jute from the south of the District to Khuln\u0101. A connecting canal, estimated to cost 20 lakhs, is under construction, but as yet it can only be used by steamers during the rainy season (see Calcutta and Eastern Canals).\n\nFor administrative purposes the District is divided into three subdivisions, with head-quarters at Far\u012bdpur, R\u0101jbari (Goalundo), and M\u0101d\u0101ripur. Under the District Magistrate-Collector the staff for criminal and revenue work consists of six Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors, of whom four are stationed at head-quarters, and two are in charge of the Goalundo and M\u0101d\u0101ripur subdivisions respectively; a Sub-Deputy-Collector is stationed at Faridpur and another at M\u0101d\u0101ripur.\n\nFor civil work the courts subordinate to the District and Sessions Judge are those of a Sub-Judge and two Munsifs at Faridpur, two Munsifs each at Goalundo, M\u0101d\u0101ripur, and Chikandi, and four Munsifs at Bh\u0101nga. The criminal courts include those of the District and Sessions Judge, the District Magistrate, and the above-mentioned Deputy-Magistrates. Land disputes give rise to a large number of civil and criminal cases, and not infrequently lead to riots attended with bloodshed and loss of life; such disputes are especially numerous and bitter on the alluvial formations in the great rivers.\n\nAt the time of the Permanent Settlement, Faridpur was included in the province of Dacca; owing to the large amount of waste land at that time, the assessment was very small, and the incidence is consequently very low, being only R. 0-8-8 per cultivated acre or a quarter of the average rental. Of 5,998 estates, only five pay a revenue of over Rs. 10,000, and estates are being rapidly disintegrated under the working of the partition law. In 1903-4 the total current demand was 6.09 lakhs, of which 4.30 lakhs was due from 5,598 permanently settled estates, Rs. 38,000 from 147 estates temporarily settled with proprietors and middlemen, and the remainder from 234 estates directly managed by the Collector. The land revenue is liable to constant fluctuations, owing to alluvion and diluvion. The average rent paid for rice lands is Rs. 3 per acre, but for inferior sandy soil it is sometimes as low as 6 annas. For raised homestead and sugar-cane lands the rates range ordinarily between Rs. 4-8 and Rs. 7-8, but rise in some places to Rs. 9 or even more.\n\nThe table on the next page shows the collections of land revenue and of total revenue (principal heads only), in thousands of rupees.\n\nOutside the municipalities of Far\u012bdpur and M\u0101d\u0101ripur, local affairs are managed by the District board, with subordinate local\nboards in the three subdivisions. In 1903-4, its income was Rs. 1,29,000, of which Rs. 63,000 was obtained from rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 1,45,000, including Rs. 61,000 spent on public works and Rs. 47,000 on education.\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 5.63   | 5.93   | 6.14   | 6.20   |\n| Total revenue  | 10.16  | 11.82  | 14.51  | 14.71  |\n\nThe District contains 13 police stations or th\u0101nas, and 6 outposts. In 1903 the force under the District Superintendent of police consisted of 4 inspectors, 44 sub-inspectors, 29 head constables, and 355 constables, maintained at a total cost of Rs. 1,15,000; there was one policeman to 8.2 square miles, and to 7,945 of the population. There was, in addition, a rural police of 446 daffad\u0101rs and 4,392 chaukid\u0101rs. The District jail at Faridpur has accommodation for 321 prisoners, and subsidiary jails at M\u0101d\u0101ripur and R\u0101jb\u0101ri for 58.\n\nEducation made great strides between 1881 and 1901. In the latter year 5.1 per cent. of the population (9.7 males and 0.6 females) could read and write. The total number of pupils under instruction increased from about 14,500 in 1882 to 37,774 in 1892-3 and to 38,502 in 1900-1, while 51,518 boys and 5,995 girls were at school in 1903-4, being respectively 35.4 and 4.1 per cent. of the children of school-going age. The number of educational institutions, public and private, in that year was 1,968, including 105 secondary, 1,656 primary, and 207 special schools. The total expenditure on education was 2.57 lakhs, of which Rs. 25,000 was met from Provincial funds, Rs. 46,000 from District funds, Rs. 700 from municipal funds, and Rs. 1,42,000 from fees. The Muhammadans are far more backward than the Hindus, who in proportion to their numbers have six times as many males able to read and write; less than a third of the pupils in the schools are Musalm\u0101ns, though nearly two-thirds of the population profess this religion.\n\nThe District contained 19 dispensaries in 1903, of which 4 had accommodation for 89 in-patients. These include the Kum\u0101r floating dispensary, which moves about on the Kum\u0101r river dispensing medical relief to the inhabitants of the extremely unhealthy areas on its banks. The cases of 164,000 out-patients and 972 in-patients were treated during the year, and 5,223 operations were performed. The total expenditure was Rs. 32,000, of which Rs. 8,000 was met from Government contributions, Rs. 11,000 from Local and Rs. 1,600 from municipal funds, and Rs. 9,000 from subscriptions.\n\nVaccination is carried on under difficulties, the majority of the population being Muhammadans of the Far\u0101zi sect, who are extremely\naverse to vaccination. It is, however, making great progress; and, though it is compulsory only in the two municipalities, 119,000 persons, or 62.3 per 1,000 of the population, were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, *Statistical Account of Bengal*, vol. v (1875).]\n\n**Faridpur Subdivision.** Head-quarters subdivision of Faridpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 23\u00b0 8' and 23\u00b0 42' N. and 89\u00b0 30' and 90\u00b0 12' E., with an area of 860 square miles. The whole of the subdivision is an alluvial formation, comparatively high to the east, but very marshy in the interior. The population in 1901 was 712,226, compared with 666,594 in 1891. The subdivision contains one town, Faridpur (population, 11,649), the head-quarters; and 2,299 villages. The density of population is high (828 persons per square mile), rising to 1,223 in Bhanga thana in the north, and not falling below 600 even in the swampy tracts in the south.\n\n**Faridpur Town (1).** Head-quarters of Faridpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 23\u00b0 37' N. and 89\u00b0 51' E., on the west bank of the Mar\u0101 ('dead') Padn\u0101. Population (1901), 11,649. Faridpur takes its name from a Muhammadan saint Farid Sh\u0101h, whose shrine it contains. The town is connected with the main line of the Eastern Bengal State Railway by a branch from Pachuria. Faridpur was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 14,500, and the expenditure Rs. 13,500. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 19,000, of which Rs. 6,000 was derived from a property tax, and Rs. 5,000 from a conservancy rate; and the expenditure was Rs. 19,800. A water-filter has been constructed at a cost of Rs. 10,000, and a second is under construction. The town contains the usual public offices; the District jail has accommodation for 321 prisoners, who are employed on cloth and carpet-weaving, brick making and pounding, oil-pressing, and the manufacture of cane furniture and coco-nut fibre mats.\n\n**Faridpur Tahsil.**\u2014South-eastern tahsil of Bareilly District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between 28\u00b0 1' and 28\u00b0 22' N. and 79\u00b0 23' and 79\u00b0 45' E., with an area of 249 square miles. Population increased from 119,805 in 1891 to 128,861 in 1901. There are 314 villages and two towns, including Faridpur (population, 6,635), the tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,84,000, and for cesses Rs. 30,000. The density of population, 518 persons per square mile, is the lowest in the District. On the south-west the R\u0101mgang\u0101 river divides the tahsil from Budaun, while the East Bahgul crosses it from north to south. Faridpur is the most unproductive part of the District, consisting for the most part of plateaux of light siliceous soil, undulating into gleaming sandy ridges, which sometimes present the appearance of low hills. In\nseasons of favourable rainfall such soil often produces a good autumn crop, but a series of years of heavy rain throws it temporarily out of cultivation. The basins of the rivers are more fertile, both naturally and because irrigation is easier. In 1903 the area under cultivation was 196 square miles, of which 34 were irrigated. Wells supply more than half the irrigated area, tanks or jhils about a quarter, and rivers the remainder.\n\n**Faridpur Town (2).**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Bareilly District, United Provinces, situated in $28^\\circ 13' N.$ and $79^\\circ 33' E.$, on the main line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, and on the road from Lucknow to Delhi. Population (1901), 6,635. The place was formerly called Pura, and was founded by insurgent Katehriya Rajputs ejected from Bareilly between 1657 and 1679. It derives its present name from one Shaikh Farid, a mendicant or, according to others, a governor, who built a fort here during Rohilla rule (1748-74). The town contains a tahsil, a dispensary, and a branch of the American Methodist Mission. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,000. The tahsil school has 125 pupils, and a girls\u2019 school about 20.\n\n**Farrah.**\u2014Capital of the Farrah province of Afghanistan, situated in $32^\\circ 26' N.$ and $62^\\circ 8' E.$; 2,460 feet above the sea. Formerly a place of some importance, Farrah is now almost deserted, the governor and his escort being the principal inhabitants. The whole place is in ruins, the only habitations being the quarters of the garrison and a few shops. Some large granaries have recently been added. The governor himself lives in a village near the fort. From outside, Farrah presents an imposing appearance, being encircled by a solid rampart of earth to a height of 30 or 40 feet: within, beyond the few buildings mentioned, there is nothing but a succession of mounds and heaps of mud ruins, varied by pits and holes. The place is very unhealthy, being built in a swamp. Farrah is a place of great antiquity: it is believed to be the Phra of Isidore of Charax (first century). According to Ferrier it was sacked by Chingiz Khan, and the survivors were moved farther north. They returned, however, and the town prospered again till its bloody siege by Nadir Shah. In 1837 the remaining population, amounting to 6,000, was carried off to Kandahar.\n\n**Farrukhabad District.**\u2014Easternmost District of the Agra Division, United Provinces, lying between $26^\\circ 40'$ and $27^\\circ 13' N.$ and $79^\\circ 8'$ and $80^\\circ 1' E.$, with an area of 1,685 square miles. On the north the Ganges divides it from Budaun and Shahjahanpur; on the east is the Oudh District of Hardoi, partly separated by the Ganges; Cawnpore and Etawah lie to the south, and Mainpuri and Etah to the west. The greater part of the District lies in the Doab along the right bank of the Ganges, but the Aligarh tahsil lies wholly on the opposite bank.\nThe former division consists of an upland area called *b\u0101ngar*, and a low lying tract called *tarai*, *katri*, or *kachoh\u0101*. The lowlands stretch from the present bed of the Ganges to the old high bank, with a breadth of 6 miles in the north of the District. At Farrukhab\u0101d the river is at present close to its high bank, but farther south it diverges again to a distance of 4 miles. The tract across the Ganges is entirely composed of low-lying land subject to floods, which cover almost the whole area. The uplands are divided into a series of small *du\u0101hs* by the rivers Bag\u0101r, K\u0101l\u012b N\u0101di (East), Isan, Arind, and P\u0101nd\u016b, which flow roughly parallel to each other and join the Ganges. These divisions are generally similar. On each bank of the rivers is a small area of alluvial soil, from which rise sandy slopes. The soil gradually improves, becoming less sandy; and the central portion is good loam, with here and there patches of barren land called *\u016bsar*, often covered with saline efflorescences. The most northern division, from the old high bank to the Bag\u0101r, is the poorest. Besides the small rivers already mentioned, the R\u0101mgang\u0101 flows through part of the Aligarh *tahsil*; and an old channel of the Ganges, called the B\u016brhgang\u0101, lies between the high bank and the present bed of the river in the north of the District. Shallow lakes or *jh\u016bls* are common in the Kaimganj, Aligarh, Chhibramau, and Tirw\u0101 *tahsils*.\n\nThe District consists entirely of Gangetic alluvium. *Kankar* is the chief mineral product, but saline efflorescences (*reh*) are also found.\n\nThe flora presents no peculiarity. The principal groves, which cover 55 square miles, are of mango-trees, and the District is uniformly though not thickly wooded. The toddy-palm (*Borassus flabellifer*) is commoner than in the neighbouring Districts. In the alluvial tract *bab\u016bl* is the commonest tree. In the uplands there are considerable stretches of *dh\u0101k* jungle (*Butea frondosa*). Some damage has been done in the sandy tracts by the spread of a grass called *k\u0101ns* (*Saccharum spontaneum*).\n\nAntelope are still very common, and *nilgai* are occasionally seen. Jackals, hyenas, wolves, and foxes are also found, and wild hog are numerous. Snipe and duck abound in the cold season. Fish are common in the rivers and small tanks, and are largely used as food. Crocodiles are found in the Ganges and K\u0101l\u012b N\u0101di.\n\nFarrukhab\u0101d is one of the healthiest Districts in the Do\u0101b. Its general elevation is considerable, the climate is dry, and the country is remarkably free from epidemics. The trans-Gangetic *parganas* are, however, damper and more feverish, though they are cool in summer. The mean temperature varies from about $58^\\circ$ in January to about $95^\\circ$ in June.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages about 33 inches. Variations from year\nto year are considerable, but the fall is very uniform throughout the District.\n\nThe northern part of the District was included in the ancient kingdom of Panch\u0101la mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and places are still connected by tradition with episodes in the life of History. Draupadi, wife of the P\u0101ndava brothers. Numerous remains of the Buddhist period point to the importance of several towns early in the Christian era. In the fourth and fifth centuries Kanauj was included in the domains of the Gupta emperors; and when the power of that dynasty declined, in the sixth century, a petty independent line of Maukhari kings ruled here. The Maukharis fell before the kings of M\u0101lw\u0101, who in turn were defeated by the ruler of Th\u0101nesar in the Punjab. Harshavardhana of Th\u0101nesar, early in the seventh century, founded a great empire in Northern India, and Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese pilgrim, describes the magnificence of his court. The empire collapsed on Harshavardhana's death, but inscriptions and copperplates tell of other dynasties ruling at Kanauj in later years. At the end of 1018, when Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni crossed the Jumna, the R\u0101jputs were in power at Kanauj, and had to submit to the sudden shock of Muslim invasion. Although Kanauj was plundered, the expedition was a mere raid, and R\u0101thors ruled it for nearly 200 years longer. In 1194, however, Muhammad Ghor\u012b defeated the last great R\u0101j\u0101, Jai Chand, and Hindu rule in the central parts of the Provinces was practically at an end. During the early years of Muhammadan rule Kanauj was the seat of a governor, and the District was constantly the scene of revolt. At the end of the fourteenth century part of it was incorporated in the new kingdom of Jaunpur, while Kanauj became the residence of Mahm\u016bd Tughlak when he lost the throne of Delhi. During the first eighty years of the fifteenth century the District suffered much from the struggle between Delhi and Jaunpur, but in 1479 was finally restored to the empire. While the Mughal power was gradually being consolidated in the sixteenth century, and during the struggle with the Path\u0101ns which led to the establishment of the short-lived Suri dynasty, fighting was frequent, and in 1540 Hum\u0101y\u016bn suffered a disastrous defeat near Kanauj. Under the great Mughal emperors the District enjoyed comparative peace, but early in the eighteenth century it became the nucleus of one of the independent States which arose as the Mughal empire crumbled away. The founder was Muhammad Kh\u0101n, a Bangash Afghan belonging to a village near Kaimganj. He brought 12,000 men to Farrukh Siyar in his fight for the throne, and was rewarded by a grant in Bundelkhand. In 1714 he obtained a grant near his own home and founded the city of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d. Muhammad\n\n---\n\n1 Beal, Buddhist Records of the Western World, vol. i, p. 206; see also Bana's Har\u1e63a Charita.\nKh\u0101n was governor of the province of Allah\u0101b\u0101d for a time, and later of M\u0101lw\u0101, but his chief services were rendered as a soldier. At his death in 1743 he held most of the present Districts of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, Mainpuri, and Etah, with parts of Cawnpore, Aligarh, Etawah, Budaun, and Shahjahanpur. His son, Kaim Kh\u0101n, was craftily embroiled with the Rohillas by Safdar Jang, Naw\u0101b of Oudh, and lost his life near Budaun in 1749. The Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d domains were formally annexed to Oudh, but were recovered in 1750 by Ahmad Kh\u0101n, another son of the first Naw\u0101b, who defeated and slew R\u0101j\u0101 Nawal Rai, the Oudh governor. Safdar Jang called in the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, who besieged Ahmad Kh\u0101n in the fort at Fatehgarh near Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, and drove off the Rohillas who had come to his aid. Ahmad Kh\u0101n had to fly to the foot of the Him\u0101layas, and in 1752 was allowed to return after ceding half his possessions to the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. In 1761 he did good service to Ahmad Shah Durr\u0101ni at P\u0101n\u012bpat, and regained much of his lost territory. The recovery embroiled him with Shuj\u0101-ud-daula, the Naw\u0101b of Oudh, who coveted the tract for himself; but Ahmad Kh\u0101n was too strong to be attacked. In 1771 the Mar\u0101th\u0101s again recovered the parganas which had been granted to them, and shortly afterwards Ahmad Kh\u0101n died. His territory then became tributary to Oudh. In 1777 British troops were stationed at Fatehgarh as part of the brigade which guarded Oudh, and from 1780 to 1785 a British Resident was posted here. The latter act was one of the charges against Warren Hastings, who had engaged to withdraw the Resident. In 1801 the Oudh government ceded to the British its lands in this District, together with the tribute paid by the Naw\u0101b of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, and the latter gave up his sovereign rights in 1802. Two years later Holkar raided the Do\u0101b, but was caught by Lord Lake after a brilliant night march and his force was cut to pieces close to Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nThe District remained free from historical events up to the date of the Mutiny. News of the outbreak at Meerut reached Fatehgarh on May 14, 1857; and another week brought tidings of its spread to Aligarh. The 10th Native Infantry showed symptoms of a mutinous spirit on May 29; but it was not till June 3 that a body of Oudh insurgents crossed the Ganges, and arranged for a rising on the following day. The European officials and residents abandoned Fatehgarh the same evening; but several of them returned a few days later and remained till June 18, when another outbreak occurred, and the rebels placed the Naw\u0101b of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d on the throne. The 41st Native Infantry, from Sitapur, marched into Fatehgarh, and the Europeans began to strengthen the fort. On June 25 the rebels attacked their position, which became untenable by July 4. The fort was then mined, and its defenders escaped in boats. The first boat reached Bith\u016br, and its occupants were subsequently murdered at Cawnpore by the Nana;\nthe second boat was stopped ten miles down the Ganges, and all in it were captured or killed except three. The Naw\u0101b governed the District unopposed till October 23, when he was defeated by the British at Kanauj. The troops, however, passed on, and the Naw\u0101b, with Bakht Kh\u0101n of Bareilly, continued in the enjoyment of power until Christmas. On January 2, 1858, British forces crossed the K\u0101li Nadi and took Fatehgarh next day. The Naw\u0101b and Firoz Sh\u0101h fled to Bareilly. Brigadier Hope defeated the Budaim rebels at Shams\u0101b\u0101d on January 18, and Brigadier Seaton routed another body on April 7. In May a force of 3,000 Bundelkhand insurgents crossed the District, and besieged Kaimganj; but they were soon driven off into the last rebel refuge in Oudh, and order was not again disturbed.\n\nThe ancient sites in the District are numerous. Sank\u012bs\u0101 has been identified with a great city mentioned by Hiuen Tsiang, and from Kampil westwards are mounds which contain a buried city. The buildings of the Hindu and Buddhist periods have, however, crumbled away, or, as at Kanauj, been used as the material for mosques. The buildings of the Naw\u0101bs of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d are not important.\n\nThere are 8 towns and 1,689 villages in the District. Population decreased between 1872 and 1881 owing to famine, and in the next decade rose with the return of more favourable seasons. The number of inhabitants at the last four enumerations was as follows: (1872) 917,178, (1881) 907,608, (1891) 858,687, and (1901) 925,812.\n\nThere are six tahsils\u2014Kanauj, Tirw\u0101, Chhibr\u0101mau, Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, Kaimganj, and Al\u012bgarh\u2014the head-quarters of each being at a town of the same name, except in the case of Kanauj, of which the head-quarters are at Sarai M\u012br\u0101n. The principal towns are the municipality of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d-cum-Fatehgarh and Kanauj. The following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1872 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Kanauj | 181                 | 1              | 206      | 114,215    | 631                       | - 2.6                                           | 4,157                                  |\n| Tirw\u0101  | 380                 | 2              | 256      | 180,086    | 474                       | + 6.8                                           | 3,529                                  |\n| Chhibr\u0101mau | 240         | 2              | 240      | 126,705    | 528                       | + 14.0                                          | 3,204                                  |\n| Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d | 339       | 1              | 387      | 250,352    | 739                       | + 2.2                                           | 12,206                                 |\n| Kaimganj | 363             | 2              | 397      | 168,606    | 494                       | + 17.4                                          | 3,061                                  |\n| Al\u012bgarh | 182               | ...            | 203      | 85,848     | 472                       | + 17.2                                          | 2,059                                  |\n\nDistrict total 1,685 8 1,689 925,812 549 + 7.8 28,216\n\nHindus form 88 per cent. of the total, and Musalm\u0101ns 12 per cent. There are only 1,100 Christians. The density is rather above the\nProvincial average, and between 1891 and 1901 the rate of increase was comparatively large. More than 99 per cent. of the population speak Western Hindi of the Kanauji dialect.\n\nThe following are the most numerous Hindu castes: Kis\u0101ns (cultivators, akin to the Lodhas of other Districts), 94,000; Cham\u0101rs (leather-workers and labourers), 93,000; Ah\u012brs (graziers and cultivators), 89,000; Br\u0101hmans, 76,000; R\u0101jputs, 73,000; and K\u0101chh\u012bs (cultivators), 70,000. Kurmis (28,000) are also important for their skill and industry in agriculture. The only caste peculiar to the District is that of the S\u0101dhs, most of whom are cotton-printers by trade; they are distinguished by belonging to a special sect, which does not recognize the worship of idols or the supremacy of the Br\u0101hman. The District is notable for the large number of Muhammadans of foreign origin; Path\u0101ns number 34,700; Shaikhs, 29,800; Saiyids, 5,800; the most numerous artisan caste is that of the Dhunas or cotton-carders, 7,100. As many as 61 per cent. of the population are supported by agriculture, which is a high proportion. R\u0101jputs hold two-fifths of the land, and Br\u0101hmans and Musalm\u0101ns nearly one-fifth each. Ah\u012brs, Kis\u0101ns, R\u0101jputs, Br\u0101hmans, K\u0101chh\u012bs, and Kurmis occupy the largest areas as cultivators.\n\nThe American Presbyterian Mission was founded in 1838, and 489 out of the 699 native Christians in 1901 were Presbyterians. Many of them reside in the village of Rakha near Fatehgarh, which was held by the mission on lease for sixty years.\n\nThe soil varies from sand to fertile loam and stiff clay, which ordinarily produces rice. Each of the four watersheds between the small rivers which divide the uplands is generally composed of good loam, with occasional patches of sandy soil, and some large \u016bsar plains, the soil near which is clay. The slopes to the rivers are usually sandy; and these and the lowlands near the Ganges and the Aligarh tahsil are precarious tracts, especially liable to suffer from excessive rain, which causes a rank growth of coarse grasses. On the whole the R\u0101mgang\u0101 deposits a more fertile silt than the Ganges.\n\nThe District is held on the usual tenures of the United Provinces. Out of 3,563 mah\u0101ls, 2,432 are zamind\u0101ri, 1,046 pattid\u0101ri, and 85 bhaiy\u0101ch\u0101r\u0101. A few estates are held on talukd\u0101ri tenure. The main agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134 are given in the table on the next page, in square miles.\n\nThe principal food-crops, with the areas sown in 1903\u20134, are: wheat (326 square miles), barley (191), jow\u0101r (140), and gram (93). Less important are maize (87), bajra (102), and arhar (72). Rice is grown chiefly in the outlying village lands, and is of poor quality except in the Tirw\u0101 tahsil. Cotton occupied 19 square miles and sugar-cane 21; but the most valuable miscellaneous crops are poppy (47 square miles),\ntobacco (3), and potatoes (7). The tobacco of the Kaimganj tahsil has a more than local reputation, as it is irrigated with brackish water, which improves the flavour. Indian hemp or bhang (*Cannabis sativa*) is cultivated in a few villages.\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Kanauj     | 181   | 124        | 43        | 21               |\n| Tirw\u0101      | 380   | 197        | 101       | 76               |\n| Chhibr\u0101mau | 240   | 160        | 64        | 29               |\n| Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d| 339   | 223        | 81        | 51               |\n| Kaimganj   | 363   | 226        | 72        | 70               |\n| Aligarh    | 182   | 111        | 17        | 33               |\n| **Total**  | **1,685** | **1,041**  | **378**   | **280**          |\n\nCultivation has slightly decreased in area during the last thirty years, but has intensified in quality. The District is noted for its high standard of cultivation, chiefly in the hands of the Kurmis and Kachhis. The best fields bear three crops in a year: maize in the rains, potatoes in the cold season, and tobacco in the spring. The two latter crops require rich manuring and plentiful irrigation, and are thus largely grown near towns. The cultivation near Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d and Kaimganj can hardly be excelled in the United Provinces. Loans under the Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Act are taken freely during adverse seasons; they amounted to a total of 1.3 lakhs between 1891 and 1900, but have now dropped to about Rs. 2,000 a year. The amounts advanced under the Land Improvement Loans Act are still smaller. Drainage works have been carried out in many parts of the District with good results.\n\nThere is no indigenous breed of cattle, and all the best animals are imported. Attempts to improve the breed have had no result so far. The ponies likewise are inferior. Sheep and goats are bred locally, and are also imported from beyond the Jumna.\n\nThe north and south of the District are fairly well supplied by canal-irrigation from branches of the Lower Ganges Canal, and a third branch irrigates a small area in the centre. Wells, however, are the principal source of irrigation, and in 1903\u20134 supplied 223 miles, while canals served only 105. The jhils and rivers are used to an appreciable extent, serving 38 and 12 square miles respectively. Water is generally raised from wells in a leathern bucket worked by bullocks, but in low-lying tracts the lever (*dhunkli*) is used. In the case of jhils and rivers, a closely-woven basket swung on ropes held by two or four men is the common form of lift.\n\n*Kankar* is the only form of stone found, and it occurs in many parts of the District in both block and nodular forms. Saltpetre is manufactured to a considerable extent and exported.\n\nFarrukh\u0101b\u0101d and Kanauj are celebrated for cloth printing applied to\ncurtains, quilts, table-covers, and the like; but the industry is languishing at Kanauj. A European demand for the articles produced at Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d has recently sprung up. Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d is also a considerable centre for the manufacture of gold lace and of brass and copper vessels. Tents are made in the Central jail and by several private firms, and Kanauj is noted for the production of scent. There are a few indigo factories in the District, but the manufacture is declining. A flour-mill has recently been opened. The Government gun-carriage factory employed 795 hands in 1903, but has undertaken no new work since the completion of the Jubbulpore factory.\n\nThe chief exports are: tobacco, opium, potatoes, fruit, bhang, salt-petre, cotton-prints, scent, and brass and copper vessels; while the imports include grain, piece-goods, salt, timber, and metals. Tobacco, scent, and mangoes are largely exported to Central India and R\u0101jput\u0101n\u0101. The rest of the trade is chiefly local, and is carried on at small markets. Up to 1881 the want of railway communication affected the commerce of the District, which has revived considerably since.\n\nFarrukh\u0101b\u0101d is fairly well supplied with means of communication, except in the Aligarh tahsil, which is often flooded. The Cawnpore-Achhner\u0101 Railway passes through the length of the District near the Ganges, and a branch of the East Indian Railway from Shikoh\u0101b\u0101d was opened in 1906. There are 142 miles of metalled roads, all maintained by the Public Works department; the cost of half of these is, however, local, and 868 miles of unmetalled roads are also maintained by the District board. Avenues of trees have been planted along 118 miles. The grand trunk road passes through the southern half of the District with a branch to Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d city, which is continued to Sh\u0101hjah\u0101npur and Bareilly. Another road gives communication with the north of the District.\n\nThe famine of 1783 doubtless affected this District, though it is not specially referred to in the accounts. In subsequent famines Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d suffered most in 1803\u20134, 1815\u20136, 1825\u20136, and 1837\u20138. In the latest of these years, relief works on the modern system were started, especially along the grand trunk road. Distress was intense, and Br\u0101hmans were seen disputing the possession of food with dogs, while mothers sold their children. Expenditure from Government funds amounted to 1\u00b78 lakhs, and 6 lakhs of revenue was remitted. There was not much distress in 1860\u20131 or 1868\u201370, but in 1877\u20138 scarcity was severely felt. The southern part of the District was then the most precarious, and this is now the portion best protected by canals. In 1896\u20137 there was some distress; but it was not severe, and population increased during the decade, except in the Kanauj tahsil.\nBesides the Collector, the District staff usually includes one member of the Indian Civil Service and four Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. There is a tahsildar at the head-quarters of each tahsil. Other officials include an Executive Engineer of the Canal department, two Opium officers, a Salt officer, and the Superintendent of the District and Central jails.\n\nCivil work is disposed of by three District Munsifs, a Sub-Judge, and a District Judge, who also hears Sessions cases. Crime is of the ordinary character, but the District is subject to outbreaks of dacoity. Female infanticide was formerly very common, but few households are now under surveillance. Opium is largely grown in the District, and small portions of the drug are often retained by the cultivators for personal use or illicit sale.\n\nThe District was acquired in 1801 and 1802, and was at first administered by an Agent to the Governor-General, but a Collector was appointed in 1806. Early settlements were for short periods, and the collection of revenue gave much trouble, owing to the turbulence of the people, especially east of the Ganges. The first regular settlement was made about 1837, the demand being fixed at 12\u00b79 lakhs; but this was reduced in 1845 by 1\u00b74 lakhs, owing to the effects of the famine of 1838. The next revision was made between 1866 and 1875, and is noteworthy for the improvements in procedure introduced by Mr. (now Sir Charles) Elliott, whose methods were copied in other Districts. The assessment was made on a valuation of the rental 'assets,' calculated by ascertaining standard rates for different classes of soil from rates actually paid. Each village was divided for this purpose into tracts of similar soil, instead of each field being separately classified. The estimated 'assets' were also checked by comparison with the actual rent-rolls. The revenue assessed was 12\u00b75 lakhs. In the precarious tracts liable to flooding the demand broke down, and in 1890-2 reductions amounting to Rs. 62,000 were made. The latest revision was carried out between 1899 and 1903. Revenue was assessed on actual rent-rolls, checked and corrected, where necessary, by standard rates, and during settlement rents were enhanced by Rs. 63,000. About two-thirds of the tenants' holdings are protected by occupancy rights. The new demand amounts to 12\u00b72 lakhs, representing 49 per cent. of the net 'assets.' The settlement was thus practically a redistribution, and the deteriorated tracts have been assessed lightly. The incidence of revenue is Rs. 1\u00b74\u20130 per acre, varying from Rs. 1\u00b75\u20130 in the high land to 8 annas in the alluvial tract.\n\nThe total collections on account of land revenue and total revenue are given in the table on the next page, in thousands of rupees.\n\nBesides the municipality of Farrukhabad-cum-Fatehgarh, seven towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. Outside these, local\naffairs are managed by the District board, which had an income of 1.3 lakhs in 1903-4, chiefly derived from rates. The expenditure was 1.5 lakhs, of which Rs. 81,000 was spent on roads and buildings.\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 12,29  | 11,19  | 11,59  | 12,18  |\n| Total revenue  | 15,84  | 17,06  | 18,74  | 19,72  |\n\nThere are 18 police stations and one outpost in the District. The Superintendent of police had in 1904 a force of 4 inspectors, 82 subordinate officers, and 410 constables, besides 230 municipal and town police, and 2,100 village and road police. At Fatehgarh there is a Central jail, besides the ordinary District jail.\n\nThe District takes a medium position in the Provinces as regards literacy, and only 3 per cent. (5.4 males and 0.4 females) of the population could read and write in 1901. The number of public schools fell from 184 in 1880-1 to 156 in 1900-1; but the number of pupils rose from 5,294 to 7,271. In 1903-4 there were 233 public schools with 9,383 pupils, of whom 672 were girls, besides 41 private schools with 457 pupils. Four schools are managed by Government and 128 by the District or municipal boards. The total expenditure on education in the same year was Rs. 55,000, of which Rs. 37,000 was met from Local funds and Rs. 11,000 from fees.\n\nThere are nine hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 112 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 52,000, of whom 1,900 were in-patients, and 4,500 operations were performed. The total expenditure was Rs. 14,500, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nAbout 22,300 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, representing 24 per 1,000 of the population\u2014a low proportion. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipality and the cantonment.\n\n[W.

Hoare, Settlement Report (1903).]\n\nFarrukhabad Tahsil.\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of Farrukhabad District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Bhojpur, Muhammadabad, Pahara, and Shamsabad East, and lying between 27\u00b0 9' and 27\u00b0 28' N. and 79\u00b0 15' and 79\u00b0 44' E., with an area of 339 square miles. It is bounded on the east by the Ganges and on the south by the Kali Nadi (East). Population increased from 244,896 in 1891 to 250,352 in 1901. There are 387 villages and one town, Farrukhabad-cum-Fatehgarh (population, 67,338), the District and tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,55,000, and for cesses Rs. 48,000. The density of population, 739 persons per square mile, is the highest in the District. Excepting a small tract of alluvial land\nnear the Ganges, the whole tahsil lies on the uplands, sloping down on the south to the basin of the K\u0101h Nadi. Through the north-east corner flows the small river Bag\u0101r, whose bed has been deepened and straightened to improve the drainage. Immediately above the Ganges, and especially round Fatehgarh, some of the finest cultivation in the District is to be found. Here a treble crop of maize, potatoes, and tobacco is often raised, while fine groves of mango-trees produce a plentiful supply of fruit, which is largely exported. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 223 square miles, of which 81 were irrigated. The Fatehgarh branch of the Lower Ganges Canal serves a small area, but wells are the chief source of irrigation.\n\nFarrukh\u0101b\u0101d City.\u2014Town which gives its name to Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 24' N. and 79\u00b0 34' E., 769 miles by rail from Calcutta and 924 miles from Bombay. It lies near the Ganges, at the terminus of a branch of the East Indian Railway from Shikoh\u0101b\u0101d, and also on the Cawnpore-Achhner\u0101 Railway, and on a branch of the grand trunk road. The head-quarters of the District and the cantonment are at Fatehgarh, 3 miles east, and the two towns form a single municipal area. Population is decreasing. At the last four enumerations the number of inhabitants was as follows: (1872) 79,204, (1881) 79,761, (1891) 78,032, and (1901) 67,338. The population of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d alone was 51,060 in 1901. Of the total, Hindus numbered 47,041 and Musalm\u0101ns 19,208.\n\nFarrukh\u0101b\u0101d was founded about 1714 by Naw\u0101b Muhammad Kh\u0101n, and named after the emperor Farrukh Siyar. Its history has been related in that of the District. The town is surrounded by the remains of a wall which encloses a triangular area. The houses and shops are well built, and often adorned with beautifully carved wooden balconies. Near the northern boundary is situated a high mound on which stood the Naw\u0101b's palace, but its place has been taken by the town hall and tahsil. The streets are fairly broad and often shaded by trees. There are, however, few buildings of much pretension, the District school being perhaps the finest. North of the city lie the tombs of the Naw\u0101bs, chiefly in a ruinous state. The town contains a dispensary and a female hospital.\n\nThe municipality was constituted in 1864. During the ten years ending 1901 the income averaged Rs. 57,000, and the expenditure Rs. 56,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 70,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 57,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 93,000, including a drainage scheme (Rs. 38,000), conservancy (Rs. 13,000), public safety (Rs. 15,000), and administration and collection (Rs. 8,000). The drainage scheme, which has been financed from savings, is to cost about a lakh.\n\nFor many years after annexation the trade of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d was con-\nsiderable, owing to its position near the Ganges and the grand trunk road, but the opening of the East Indian Railway diverted commerce. At present there is some manufacture of gold lace and of brass and copper vessels, and the calico-printing industry is gaining a more than local celebrity. The latter is chiefly in the hands of S\u0101dhs, a kind of Hindu Quakers. A flour-mill has recently been started. There is also a considerable export of potatoes, tobacco, and mangoes. The high school contained 164 pupils in 1904; the American Presbyterian Mission school, 217; and the town or middle school, 113. There are also several primary schools.\n\n**Farrukhnagar.**\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Gurgaon, Punjab, situated in 28\u00b0 27' N. and 76\u00b0 50' E., on a branch of the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway, 14 miles from Gurgaon town. Population (1901), 6,136. It is the d\u00e9p\u00f4t for the salt extracted from saline springs in the neighbourhood, but the industry has greatly declined of late years and threatens soon to be extinct altogether. Farrukhnagar was founded by a Baloch chief, Faujd\u0101r Kh\u0101n, afterwards Daul\u0113 Kh\u0101n, who was made governor by the emperor Farrukh Siyar. He assumed the title of Nawab in 1732, and the Nawabs of Farrukhnagar played an important part in the history of the tract for the next seventy years. Farrukhnagar was captured by the J\u0101ts of Bharatpur in 1757, but recovered in 1764. On annexation the Nawabs were confirmed in their principality, but it was confiscated in 1858 for the complicity of the reigning chief in the Mutiny. The chief buildings are the Delhi Gate, the Naw\u0101b's palace, and a fine mosque, all dating from the time of Faujd\u0101r Kh\u0101n; also a large octagonal well belonging to the period of J\u0101t occupation. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 6,400, and the expenditure Rs. 5,900. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 6,800, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 10,600. It maintains a dispensary.\n\n**Fatah\u0101b\u0101d Tahsil** (Fatah\u0101b\u0101d).\u2014Tahsil of Hiss\u0101r District, Punjab, lying between 29\u00b0 13' and 29\u00b0 48' N. and 75\u00b0 13' and 76\u00b0 0' E., with an area of 1,179 square miles. The population in 1901 was 190,921, compared with 181,638 in 1891. It contains one town, Fatah\u0101b\u0101d (population, 2,786), the head-quarters; and 261 villages, among which Toh\u0101na and Agroha are places of historical or archaeological interest. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903\u20134 to 2\u00b73 lakhs. The Ghaggar has cut for itself a deep channel in the north of the tahsil. To the south of this channel lies a broad belt of stiff clay, covered with sparse jungle interspersed with stretches of precarious cultivation, which depend on occasional floods brought by natural and artificial channels from the Ghaggar. The east of the tahsil lies in Hari\u0101ma, but the centre and south are bare and sandy. A portion is irrigated by the Western Junna Canal.\nFatah\u0101b\u0101d Town (Fateh\u0101b\u0101d).\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Hiss\u0101r District, Punjab, situated in 29\u00b0 31' N. and 75\u00b0 27' E., 30 miles north-west of Hiss\u0101r. Population (1901), 2,786. The town was founded about 1352 by the emperor Firoz Sh\u0101h, who named it after his son Fateh Kh\u0101n, and had a canal dug to it from the Ghaggar. The fort contains a pillar inscribed with the genealogy of Firoz Sh\u0101h, and a mosque and inscription of Hum\u0101y\u016bn. The town is of no commercial importance. It is administered as a 'notified area,' the income of which in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,700.\n\nFatahjang (Fatehjang).\u2014Easternmost tahsil of Attock District, Punjab, lying between 33\u00b0 10' and 33\u00b0 45' N. and 72\u00b0 23' and 73\u00b0 1' E., with an area of 866 square miles. The population in 1901 was 114,849, compared with 113,041 in 1891. It contains 203 villages, of which Fatahjang (population, 4,825) is the head-quarters. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 1\u00b79 lakhs. The tahsil is divided into three distinct parts. North of the K\u0101l\u0101-Chitta is a small plain much cut up by ravines. South of the Khairi-M\u016brat is the fertile Soh\u0101n valley, while between the two ranges of hills lies a rough plain, narrow in the east and broadening towards the west.\n\nFateh\u0101b\u0101d (1).\u2014South central tahsil of Agra District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between 26\u00b0 56' and 27\u00b0 8' N. and 77\u00b0 55' and 78\u00b0 26' E., with an area of 241 square miles. The tahsil is bounded on the north-east by the Jumna, on the south by the Utangan, and on the west by the Kh\u0101ri Nadi. Population increased from 108,446 in 1891 to 114,733 in 1901. There are 161 villages and one town, Fateh\u0101b\u0101d (population, 4,673), the tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,51,000, and for cesses Rs. 30,000. A considerable area is occupied by the ravines of the Jumna and Utangan; but most of the tahsil is an upland tract of average fertility in which well-irrigation is easy, while the Agra Canal passes through it. There are two main depressions, one of which was probably an old bed of the Jumna. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 169 square miles, of which 60 were irrigated. The Agra Canal serves about one-quarter of the irrigated area, but wells are the most important source of supply.\n\nFateh\u0101b\u0101d (2).\u2014Tahsil of Hissar District, Punjab. See Fatah\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nFatehgarh Tahsil (or Sirhind).\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of the Amar-garh niz\u0101mat, Patiala State, Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 33' and 30\u00b0 59' N. and 76\u00b0 17' and 76\u00b0 42' E., with an area of 243 square miles. The population in 1901 was 126,589, compared with 130,741 in 1891. The tahsil contains the towns of Basi (population, 13,738) and Sirhind or Fatehgarh (5,415), the head-quarters; and 247 villages. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 2\u00b77 lakhs.\n\nFatehgarh Town.\u2014Head-quarters of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d District, United\nProvinces, situated in $27^\\circ 24' \\text{ N.}$ and $79^\\circ 35' \\text{ E.}$, on a branch of the grand trunk road, and on the Cawnpore-Achhner\u0101 Railway. Population (1901), 16,278. The fort was built by Naw\u0101b Muhammad Kh\u0101n about 1714, but first became of importance in 1751, when Naw\u0101b Ahmad Kh\u0101n was besieged in it by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. In 1777 this was chosen as one of the stations for the brigade of troops lent to the Naw\u0101b of Oudh, but it did not pass into the possession of the British till 1802, when it became the head-quarters of an Agent to the Governor-General. In 1804 Holkar reached Fatehgarh in his raid through the Do\u0101b, but was surprised and put to precipitate flight by Lord Lake. When the Mutiny broke out in 1857, a few of the European residents fled early in June to Cawnpore, where they were seized by the N\u0101na and massacred. Those who remained behind, after sustaining a siege of upwards of a week, were forced to abandon the fort, which had been undermined by the rebels, and to betake themselves to boats. On their way down the Ganges, they were attacked by the rebels and villagers on both sides of the river. One boat reached Bith\u016br, where it was captured; the occupants were taken prisoners to Cawnpore and subsequently massacred. Another boat grounded in the river the day after leaving Fatehgarh, and all the passengers but three were shot down or drowned in their attempt to reach land. A number of the refugees were brought back to Fatehgarh, and, after being kept in confinement for nearly three weeks, were shot or sabred on the parade-ground; their remains were cast into a well over which has been built a monument, with a memorial church near it.\n\nThe fort lies near the Ganges at the north of the station. From 1818 it was used as a gun-carriage factory, but since 1906 it has been converted into an army clothing d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Near it stand the barracks of the British and Native infantry garrison, partly occupied at present by a mounted infantry class. The rest of the cantonment and the civil station lie along the high bank of the river separating the native town from the Ganges.\n\nThe municipal accounts are kept jointly with those of Farrukh-\u0101b\u0101d City, which lies three miles away. The cantonment had a population of 4,060 in 1901, and the annual income and expenditure of cantonment funds are each about Rs. 8,000. Trade is almost entirely local, but tents are made in three private factories and in the Central jail. The gun-carriage factory employed 795 hands in 1903. A middle school has 143 pupils, and there are several primary schools, including one in the gun-carriage factory, a girls\u2019 school, and a school for European and Eurasian children.\n\nFatehjang.\u2014Tahsil of Attock District, Punjab. See Fatehjang.\n\nFatehpur District.\u2014District in the Allah\u0101b\u0101d Division, United Provinces, lying between $25^\\circ 26'$ and $26^\\circ 16'$ N. and $80^\\circ 14'$ and $81^\\circ 20'$ E., with an area of 1,618 square miles. It is bounded on the\nnorth by the Ganges, dividing it from Rae Bareli District in Oudh; on the west by Cawnpore; on the south by the Jumna, separating it from Hamirpur and Band\u0101 Districts; and on the east by Allahabad.\n\nThe District of Fatehpur forms a portion of the Do\u0101b, or great alluvial tract between the Ganges and the Jumna, and its main features do not differ from those common to the whole area enclosed by those two great rivers. It consists for the most part of a highly cultivated and fairly well wooded plain. A ridge of slightly higher land, forming the watershed of the District, runs through it from east to west, at an average distance of three to five miles from the Ganges. In the extreme west are three small rivers\u2014the P\u0101nd\u016b, which flows northward into the Ganges, and the Rind and the Non, which swell the waters of the Jumna. The tract enclosed between the Jumna and the two last-named streams is a tangled mass of ravines, with wild and desolate scenery. Shallow lakes (jh\u012bls) are common in the midland portion of the District, which is badly drained, but they ordinarily dry up by January or February. As a whole, the western region is much cut up by ravines and covered with bab\u016bl jungle; the central tract is more generally cultivated, though interspersed with frequent patches of barren usar; and the eastern part, near the Allahabad border, is one unbroken stretch of smiling and prosperous tillage.\n\nThe soil consists entirely of Gangetic alluvium, in which kankar is the chief mineral product.\n\nThe District is well supplied with cultivated trees, in particular the mango in the west and the mahua in the east. Groves are especially numerous in the south-east. Shisham, nim, siris, pipal, and imli are common along roadsides and near the village sites, while bab\u016bl, ber, and dh\u0101k flourish in the ravines and on waste land.\n\nLeopards are occasionally found in the ravines along the Jumna and Rind, and wolves abound in the same tracts. Wild hog and jackals are common everywhere, and the nilgai and antelope are to be seen in places. The \u2018ravine deer\u2019 (gazelle) is found wherever there is broken ground, and often where the country is undulating. Wild-fowl of all kinds are very abundant, and geese, duck, and teal swarm in the numerous jh\u012bls during the cold season. Crocodiles, porpoises, and fish of many kinds are common in the large rivers.\n\nThe climate of Fatehpur is that of the Do\u0101b generally; but from its easterly position the west winds do not reach it with such force in the hot season as in Agra and the western Districts. The surface is somewhat marshy, and the numerous jh\u012bls render the atmosphere damp. It is, however, not unhealthy.\n\nThe annual rainfall over the whole District averages 34 inches, and variations in different parts are small. The amount received from year\nto year, however, fluctuates considerably. Thus in 1894 the fall was 71 inches, and in 1896 less than 17 inches.\n\nAccording to tradition, the R\u0101j\u0101s of Argal held a large part of the District as tributaries of the Kanauj kingdom before the Musalm\u0101n conquest, and Jai Chand, the last king of Kanauj, is said to have deposited his treasure here before his final defeat in 1194. Nothing definite is known of the history of the District during the early Muhammadan period when it formed part of the province of Kor\u0101, or in the fifteenth century, when it was included in the short-lived kingdom of Jaunpur. The Argal R\u0101j\u0101s supported Sher Sh\u0101h against Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and were finally crushed on the restoration of Mughal power. Under Akbar the western half of the District formed part of the sark\u0101r of Kor\u0101, while the eastern half was included in Kar\u0101. It has twice been the scene of battles in which the fate of the Mughal empire was at stake. In 1659 Aurangzeb met Shuj\u0101 between Kor\u0101 and Khaj\u016bh\u0101, and the battle which resulted was one of the bloodiest ever fought in India, Shuj\u0101 being defeated and his army dispersed. In 1712 Farrukh Siyar was unsuccessfully opposed near the same place by his cousin, Azz-ud-din, son of Jah\u0101nd\u0101r, who had seized the throne. During the slow decline of the Delhi dynasty Fatehpur was entrusted to the governor of Oudh; but in 1736 it was overrun by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, on the invitation of a disaffected landholder of Kor\u0101. The Mar\u0101th\u0101s retained possession of the country until 1750, when it was wrested from them by the Path\u0101ns of Fatehgarh. Three years later Safdar Jang, the practically independent Naw\u0101b of Oudh, reconquered it for his own benefit. By the treaty of 1765 Fatehpur was handed over to the titular emperor, Sh\u0101h Alam; but when in 1774 he threw himself into the hands of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, his eastern territories were considered to have escheated, and the British sold them for 50 lakhs of rupees to the Naw\u0101b Wazir. As the Oudh government was in a chronic state of arrears with regard to the payment of its stipulated tribute, a new arrangement was effected in 1801, by which the Naw\u0101b ceded Allah\u0101b\u0101d and Kor\u0101 to the English, in lieu of all outstanding claims.\n\nNo event of interest occurred after the introduction of British rule, until the Mutiny of 1857. On the 6th of June news of the Cawnpore outbreak arrived at the station. On the 8th a treasure guard returning from Allah\u0101b\u0101d proved mutinous; and next day the mob rose, burnt the houses and plundered all the property of the European residents. The civil officers escaped to B\u0101nd\u0101, except the Judge, who was murdered. On the 28th of June fourteen fugitives from Cawnpore landed at Shivar\u0101jpur in this District, and were all killed but four, who escaped by swimming to the Oudh shore. The District remained in the hands of rebels throughout the month; but on the 30th Colonel Neill sent off Major Renaud's column from Allah\u0101b\u0101d to Cawnpore. On the 11th of\nJuly General Havelock's force joined Renaud's at Kh\u0101g\u0101, and next day they defeated the rebels at Bilanda. They then attacked and shelled Fatehpur, drove out the rebels, and took possession of the place. On the 15th Havelock advanced to Aung and drove the enemy back on the P\u0101nd\u016b Nadi. There a second battle was fought the same day, and the insurgents were driven in full flight to Cawnpore. British authority, however, was confined to the tract along the grand trunk road; and order was not re-established till after the fall of Lucknow and the return of Lord Clyde's army to Cawnpore, when the Gwalior mutineers were finally driven off.\n\nAttempts have been made to identify several places in the District with sites visited by the Chinese pilgrims; but no excavations have been carried out, and the identifications are uncertain. The Hindu remains are generally fragmentary, and even the later Muhammadan buildings at Kor\u0101 and Khajuh\u0101 are few, and not of striking merit.\n\nFatehpur contains 5 towns and 1,403 villages. Population is increasing, but received a check owing to the vicissitudes of the seasons between 1891 and 1901, when the District suffered both from floods and from drought. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 663,877, (1881) 683,745, (1891) 699,157, and (1901) 686,391. There are four tahsils\u2014Fatehpur, Khajuh\u0101, Ghazipur, and Kh\u0101g\u0101\u2014each named after its head-quarters. Fatehpur, the only municipality and the head-quarters of the District, is the largest town. The following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Fatehpur   | 356                  | 1               | 374      | 171,598    | 482                       | -2.2                                                     | 6,563                                  |\n| Khajuh\u0101    | 504                  | 3               | 385      | 199,223    | 395                       | -3.6                                                     | 8,392                                  |\n| Ghazipur   | 277                  | ...             | 151      | 91,222     | 329                       | -1.3                                                     | 3,840                                  |\n| Kh\u0101g\u0101      | 481                  | 1               | 493      | 224,348    | 466                       | -0.1                                                     | 6,731                                  |\n| District total | 1,618              | 5               | 1,403    | 686,391    | 424                       | -1.8                                                     | 25,436                                 |\n\nAbout 88 per cent. of the population are Hindus, and less than 12 per cent. Musalm\u0101ns. Fatehpur is less thickly populated than the Districts of the Do\u0101b farther west. Eastern Hindi is spoken by 83 per cent. of the population, and Western Hindi by about 17 per cent.\n\nThe most numerous of the Hindu castes are: Cham\u0101rs (leather-workers and cultivators), 63,000; Br\u0101hmans, 58,000; Ahirs (grazers and cultivators), 57,000; R\u0101jputs, 42,000; Kurmis (agriculturists), 42,000; P\u0101s\u012bs (toddy-drawers and labourers), 32,000; and Lodhas\n(cultivators), 30,000. Among Musalmans the largest divisions are: Shaikhs, 26,000; Pathans, 16,000; and Behnas (cotton-carders), 6,000. The agricultural population forms 70 per cent. of the total, while nearly 7 per cent. are supported by general labour. Rajputs, Brahmins, and Kayasths hold the greater part of the land, while Rajputs, Brahmins, Lodhas, Kurmis, and Kachhis are the chief cultivating castes.\n\nIn 1901 there were 113 native Christians, of whom 84 were Presbyterians. The American Presbyterian Mission has been established here since 1853.\n\nThree natural divisions exist in the District. Bordering on the Ganges is a long narrow tract of alluvial soil, separated from the watershed by a belt of sandy land. South of the watershed, which is marked by a distinct ridge, lies the fertile central area which extends over more than half of the District. The prevailing soil is a good loam, with clay in the depressions, and many jhils near which rice is sown. After a series of wet years portions of this tract become waterlogged, owing to defective drainage. The most southern portion of the District, bordering on the Jumna and forming from one-fourth to one-fifth of the total area, resembles the part of Bundelkhand immediately across the Jumna. A dark heavy soil named kabar, which is unworkable when very dry or very wet, and a lighter and less fertile soil called parwa predominates. Ravines are extensive and tend to increase, while the spring-level is extremely low. On the edge of the Jumna is a little rich alluvial soil.\n\nThe ordinary tenures of the United Provinces are found. Zamindari mahals number 3,197, their predominance being due to the large number of sales during the early period of British rule, when the cultivating communities lost their rights; 1,163 mahals are held pattidari, and 45 bhaiyachari. The main agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|----------------|\n| Fatehpur | 356   | 178        | 91        | 42             |\n| Khajinah | 504   | 276        | 83        | 64             |\n| Ghazipur | 277   | 158        | 39        | 45             |\n| Khaga   | 481   | 269        | 112       | 54             |\n| **Total** | **1,618** | **881**    | **325**   | **205**        |\n\nThe commonest food-crop is a mixture of gram and barley. The areas under the chief crops in 1903-4 were\u2014gram, 222 square miles; barley, 161; jowar, 147; wheat, 123; rice, 94; cotton, 34; and poppy, 13 square miles.\n\nThe area under cultivation has decreased slightly within the last thirty years; but owing to an increase in the area bearing two crops in\na year, the gross area cultivated in each of the main harvests has risen, especially in the case of the autumn crop. The increase is found in the cheaper food-crops, while the area under the more valuable products, especially cotton and sugar-cane, has decreased. On the other hand, poppy is more largely grown than formerly. In adverse seasons loans are freely taken under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists' Loans Acts. The advances amounted to a total of 2-9 lakhs between 1891 and 1900, of which 1-5 lakhs was lent in the famine year, 1896\u20137. With the return of more favourable seasons advances have been smaller.\n\nIn the greater part of the District the cattle are of the inferior type common to the Do\u0101b. Near the Rind and Jumna a smaller and more hardy breed is found, resembling the cattle of Bundelkhand. Nothing has been done to improve the breeds, and there is practically no horse-breeding. The Fatehpur sheep are, however, well-known, and are exported in considerable numbers.\n\nIn 1903\u20134 the area irrigated was 325 square miles, including 130 square miles from wells, 93 from tanks or jh\u012bls, and 99 from Government canals. Wells are the only source of irrigation in the north of the District, and both masonry and unbricked wells are common. The Fatehpur branch of the Lower Ganges Canal, which was opened in 1898, supplies part of the central and southern tracts. It is chiefly used in the spring harvest, and very little canal water is taken for the autumn crops. Irrigation from tanks, which comprise chiefly the numerous swamps or jh\u012bls, is confined to the central tract. Near the Jumna the spring-level is at a depth of 60 to 90 feet, and irrigation from wells is almost unknown.\n\nKankar is found in all parts of the District, and is the only mineral product, except saltpetre which is manufactured from efflorescences on the soil.\n\nThe District is largely agricultural, and its manufactures are unimportant. It is, however, celebrated for the ornamental whips made at Fatehpur town, and for the artistic bed-covers, curtains, and awnings made at Jafarganj. The latter are covered with designs, partly stamped, and partly drawn and coloured by hand, inscriptions in Persian being generally introduced in the border. Coarser cotton prints are made at Kishanpur and playing-cards at Khajuh\u0101.\n\nThe trade of the District is mainly in agricultural products, and BINDK\u012a is the most important commercial town. Grain, cotton, hides, and ghi are largely exported; and piece-goods, metals, and salt are the chief imports. Markets are held in many villages, Kishanpur or Ekd\u0101l\u0101 on the Jumna being the chief; and an important religious fair takes place at Shivar\u0101jpur on the Ganges. The railway takes a large propor-\ntion of the traffic, but trade with Bundelkhand on the south and with Oudh on the north is carried on by road. The great rivers are used much less than formerly.\n\nThe main line of the East Indian Railway crosses the District from end to end. The road system is fairly good; and 197 miles of metalled roads are in charge of the Public Works department, though the cost of all but 78 miles is met from Local funds. There are 341 miles of unmetalled roads. Avenues of trees are maintained on 122 miles. The main routes are: the grand trunk road, which is followed by the line of the railway; and the metalled road at right angles to this, which passes from R\u0101e Bareli in Oudh to Bundelkhand. The old imperial road from Agra to Allah\u0101b\u0101d meets the grand trunk road near Fatehpur town.\n\nThe District must have suffered in the famines immediately before and after the commencement of British rule, but no separate records have been preserved. In 1837\u20138 distress was not so severe as farther west. Fatehpur escaped lightly in 1860\u20131, and again in 1868\u20139, though relief works were opened on the latter occasion. In 1877\u20138 also there was no famine, but the labouring classes were distressed. The drought of 1896 followed a succession of bad seasons in which the crops had been injured by excessive rain, and famine pressed hardly on the southern part of the District. Relief works and poorhouses were opened, and the daily number of persons in receipt of aid rose to 45,000, the total cost of the operations being 1\u00bd lakhs.\n\nThe Collector is usually assisted by four Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. A tahsild\u0101r is posted at the head-quarters of each tahsil, and there is an Assistant Opium Agent at Fatehpur.\n\nThere is only one District Munsif, and the District is included in the Civil and Sessions Judgeship of Cawnpore. Sessions cases, however, are tried by the Judge of B\u0101nd\u0101 as Joint Sessions Judge. Crime is light and presents no special features. Female infanticide was formerly suspected, but no persons are now under surveillance.\n\nAt the cession in 1801 the present District was included partly in Cawnpore and partly in Allah\u0101b\u0101d. In 1814 a Joint-Magistracy was formed with headquarters first at Bhitaura and then at Fatehpur, and the subdivision became a separate District in 1826. The parganas constituting Fatehpur had nominally paid 14.4 lakhs under Oudh rule, and this demand was retained after the cession, but soon had to be reduced. The whole tract was farmed up to 1809 to Naw\u0101b B\u0101kar Ali Kh\u0101n, who received 10 per cent. of the collections. By extortions and chicanery he and his family acquired 182 estates, paying a revenue of 2.3 lakhs. The early settlements were made for short periods and\npressed heavily, though they were lighter than the nominal demand under native rule. The fraudulent sales effected during the early part of the nineteenth century were examined by the special commission appointed under Regulation I of 1821, and 176 public sales and 29 private transactions were cancelled. The first regular settlement under Regulation IX of 1833 was completed during a single cold season, 1839-40, and although a survey was made and villages were inspected, the methods were very summary. The demand fixed was 14\u00b75 lakhs, which was reduced a few years later by Rs. 21,000. The next settlement was made between 1871 and 1876. Villages were grouped together in blocks according to the classes of soil they contained, and rates were selected from the rents actually found to be paid. The total revenue assessed amounted to 13 lakhs, or less than half the assumed \u2018assets.\u2019 In 1900 the question of revision was considered, and it was decided to extend the existing settlement for ten years. The present demand is 13\u00b71 lakhs, with an incidence of Rs. 1\u00b74 per acre, varying from Rs. 1\u00b73 to Rs. 2 in different parts of the District.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and total revenue have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1. | 1890-1. | 1900-1. | 1903-4. |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Land revenue   | 13,08   | 13,13   | 14,50   | 13,04   |\n| Total revenue  | 14,48   | 17,14   | 18,93   | 17,45   |\n\nFatehpur town is the only municipality, but four towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. The local affairs of the District beyond the limits of these places are managed by the District board, which had an income and expenditure of about a lakh in 1903-4. The expenditure includes Rs. 55,000 on roads and buildings.\n\nThere are 20 police stations; and the District Superintendent of police has a force of 3 inspectors, 77 subordinate officers, and 323 constables, besides 51 municipal and town police, and 1,880 rural and road police. The District jail contained a daily average of 223 prisoners in 1903.\n\nThe District is not distinguished for the literacy of its inhabitants, of whom only 3\u00b78 per cent. (7 males and 0\u00b71 females) could read and write in 1901. The number of public schools fell from 132 in 1880-1 to 101 in 1900-1, but the number of pupils rose from 4,046 to 4,371. In 1903-4 there were 177 such institutions, with 6,795 pupils, of whom 200 were girls, besides 180 private schools with 1,737 pupils. Three of the public schools were managed by Government and 115 by the District and municipal boards. In 1903-4 the total expenditure on education was Rs. 36,000, of which Rs. 28,000 was provided by Local funds, and Rs. 6,300 by fees.\nThere are six hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 80 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 28,000, including 946 in-patients, and 1,300 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 7,800, chiefly from Local funds.\n\nAbout 22,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, representing a proportion of 31 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipality of Fatehpur.\n\n[A. B. Patterson, Settlement Report (1878); H. R. Nevill, District Gazetteer (1906).]\n\nFatehpur Tahsil (1).\u2014North-central tahsil of Fatehpur District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Fatehpur and Hasw\u0101, and lying between 25\u00b0 43' and 26\u00b0 4' N. and 80\u00b0 38' and 81\u00b0 4' E., with an area of 356 square miles. Population fell from 175,452 in 1891 to 171,598 in 1901. There are 374 villages and one town, Fatehpur (population, 19,281), the District and tahsil head quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,87,000, and for cesses Rs. 46,000. The density of population, 482 persons per square mile, is the highest in the District. The Ganges forms part of the northern boundary, but the drainage largely flows south-east through a series of jh\u012bls into a channel called the Sasur Khaderi. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 178 square miles, of which 91 were irrigated, wells and tanks or jh\u012bls being the chief sources of supply.\n\nFatehpur Town (1).\u2014Head-quarters of Fatehpur District and tahsil, United Provinces, situated in 25\u00b0 56' N. and 80\u00b0 50' E., on the grand trunk road, and on the East Indian Railway. Population (1901), 19,281. Nothing is known of the early history of the town, but it was extended by Naw\u0101b Abdus Samad Kh\u0101n in the reign of Aurangzeb. In 1825 it became the head-quarters of a subdivision, and in the following year of the newly-formed District. The houses are chiefly built of mud, the only buildings of historical interest being the tomb of Naw\u0101b Abdus Samad Kh\u0101n, and the tomb and mosque of Naw\u0101b B\u0101kar Ali Kh\u0101n, who enjoyed a farm of the District early in the nineteenth century. The chief public buildings, besides the ordinary District courts, are the municipal hall, male and female dispensaries, and school. Fatehpur has been a municipality since 1872. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 13,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 20,000, chiefly from octroi (Rs. 13,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 18,000. Trade is principally local, but grain and gh\u012b are exported, and there is a noted manufacture of whips. The municipality manages one school and aids another, the two containing 292 pupils, while the District high school has 144.\n\nFatehpur Tahsil (2).\u2014Northern tahsil of B\u0101ra Banki District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of R\u0101mnagar, Muhammadpur, B\u0101d\u014d Sarai, Fatehpur, Bhitauli, and Kurs\u012b, and lying between 26\u00b0 58'\nand $27^\\circ 21'$ N. and $80^\\circ 56'$ and $81^\\circ 35'$ E., with an area of 521 square miles. Population increased from 315,652 in 1891 to 335,407 in 1901. There are 673 villages and two towns, including Fatehpur (population, 8,180), the tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 5,05,000, and for cesses Rs. 82,000. Bhitauli pargana is permanently settled. The density of population, 644 persons per square mile, is the lowest in the District. The north-eastern portion of the tahsil is a low tract lying between the Chauk\u0101 and Gogra, which is liable to be swept by floods. Elsewhere the land lies high, forming a level fertile plain studded with many small tanks or swamps. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 353 square miles, of which 113 were irrigated. Tanks or swamps supply a larger area than wells.\n\n**Fatehpur Town (2).**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in B\u0101ra Bank\u012b District, United Provinces, situated in $27^\\circ 16'$ N. and $81^\\circ 14'$ E., on a metalled road. Population (1901), 8,180. Varying traditions assign the foundation of this place to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. It is full of old masonry buildings, most of which are in a state of decay. The finest is an im\u0101mb\u0101ra built by an officer of Nas\u012br-ud-din Haidar. An old mosque is said to have been constructed in the reign of Akbar. Fatehpur contains, besides the usual public offices, a dispensary and a school with 130 pupils. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,400. Markets are held twice a week, and there is a considerable trade in grain. Many weavers reside here, who turn out cotton cloth, rugs, and carpets.\n\n**Fatehpur Town (3).**\u2014Town belonging to the Sikar chiefship in the Shekh\u0101wati niz\u0101mat of Jaipur State, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $28^\\circ$ N. and $74^\\circ 58'$ E., about 95 miles north-west of Jaipur city. The town is the third largest in the State, its population in 1901 having been 16,393. It contains 14 schools attended by about 420 pupils, and a combined post and telegraph office, besides several fine houses belonging to wealthy and enterprising bankers and merchants, who have business connexions all over India and who, prior to the construction of the telegraph in 1896, kept up heliographic communication with Jaipur city to record the rise or fall in the price of opium from day to day.\n\n**Fatehpur Sikri.**\u2014Town in the Kiraoli tahsil of Agra District, United Provinces, situated in $27^\\circ 5'$ N. and $77^\\circ 40'$ E., on a metalled road 23 miles west of Agra city. Population (1901), 7,147. It was close to the village of Sikri that B\u0101bar defeated the R\u0101jput confederacy in 1527; and here on the ridge of sandstone rocks dwelt the saint Salim Chishti, who foretold to Akbar the birth of a son, afterwards the emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br. In 1569 Akbar commenced to build a great city called Fatehpur, and within fifteen years a magnificent series of\nbuildings had been erected. The city was abandoned as a royal residence soon after its completion, but was occupied for a short time in the eighteenth century by Muhammad Sh\u0101h; and Husain Ali Kh\u0101n, the celebrated Saiyid general, was murdered near here in 1720. The site of Fatehpur Sikri is still surrounded on three sides by the great wall, about 5 miles long, built by Akbar; but most of the large space enclosed is no longer occupied by buildings. The modern town lies near the western end, partly on the level ground and partly on the slope of the ridge. It is a small, well-paved place, containing a dispensary and a police station.\n\nFrom close by the highest houses in the town a flight of steps leads up to the magnificent gateway, called the Buland Darw\u0101za or 'lofty gate,' which forms the entrance to the great quadrangle of the mosque, 350 feet by 440. In this stands the marble building containing the tomb of the saint Salim Chishti, the walls of which are elaborately carved. The sarcophagus itself is surrounded by a screen of lattice-work and a canopy inlaid with mother-of-pearl, which has recently been restored. Close by the north wall of the mosque are the houses of the brothers, Abul Fazl and Faiza, but the main block of the palace buildings lies some distance to the north-east. On the west of this block is the large palace called after Jodh Bai, the R\u0101jput wife of Akbar. It consists of a spacious courtyard, surrounded by a continuous gallery, from which rise rows of buildings on the north and south, roofed with slabs of blue enamel. A lofty and richly carved gate gives access to a terrace, on which stand the so-called houses of Birbal and Miriam, or the 'Christian lady.' The former is noticeable for its massive materials and the lavish minuteness of its detail. The 'Christian lady' was probably a Hindu wife. Beyond these buildings is another great courtyard, divided into two parts. The southern half contains the private apartments of Akbar with the Khw\u0101bg\u0101h, or 'sleeping place,' and the lovely palace of the Turkish Sult\u0101na. The latter is of sandstone, richly carved with geometrical patterns and hunting scenes. The P\u0101nch Mahal or 'five-storeyed building,' and the D\u012bw\u0101n-i-kh\u0101s or 'private audience chamber,' are the principal structures in the northern portion. The P\u0101nch Mahal consists of five galleries, one above another, and appears to have been copied from a Buddhist model. The D\u012bw\u0101n-i-kh\u0101s contains an enormous octagonal pillar, crowned by a circular capital, from which four galleries run to the corners of the room. According to tradition, Akbar used to hold his famous theological discussions in this place. Many of the buildings, and especially Miriam's house and the Khw\u0101bg\u0101h, were adorned with paintings. These have largely perished or been destroyed; but the scheme of some has been recovered, and a few restorations have been made. The eastern front of the palace was formed by the D\u012bw\u0101n-i-\u0101m\nor 'public hall,' close to which lay the baths on the south, and a great square called the Mint on the north-east. The palace buildings stand on the crest of the ridge, and below them lies a depression which once formed a great lake. Beyond the lake stretched the royal park. The long descent from the Diw\u0101n-i-Am, through the Naubat-kh\u0101na or entrance gate to the Agra road, is flanked by confused masses of ruins, the remains of the bazars of the old city.\n\nFatehpur Sikri was a municipality from 1865 to 1904. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged about Rs. 5,000, octroi supplying most of the income. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 9,000, and the expenditure Rs. 10,000. The town has now been made a 'notified area.' In the time of Akbar it was celebrated for its fabrics of hair and silk-spinning, besides the skill of its masons and stone-carvers. At present cotton carpets and millstones are the chief products. There are two schools with about 100 pupils.\n\n[E. W. Smith, *The Mughal Architecture of Fatehpur Sikri*, 4 vols. (Allah\u0101b\u0101d, 1894-8).]\n\n**Fatkhelda.**\u2014Village in the Mehkar taluk of Buld\u0101na District, Ber\u0101r, situated in 20\u00b0 13' N. and 76\u00b0 27' E., on the small river Bhog\u0101-wati, an affluent of the Pengang\u0101. Population (1901), 4,198. The original name of the village was Shakarkhelda, but it was changed to Fatkhelda ('village of victory') by Asaf Jah, to commemorate the victory gained here by him in 1724 over Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n, governor of M\u0101lw\u0101, who was slain on the field, a victory which established the virtual independence of the Niz\u0101m of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. The village was sacked by Sindhi\u0101's troops in 1803 before Assaye, and suffered severely in a famine of that year. There is at Fatkhelda a handsome mosque, built by Khuddawand Kh\u0101n Mahdavi in 1581, which much resembles that at Rohankhed.\n\n**Fatw\u0101.**\u2014Village in the B\u0101rh subdivision of Patna District, Bengal, situated in 25\u00b0 30' N. and 85\u00b0 19' E., on the East Indian Railway, 7 miles from Patn\u0101 city, at the junction of the P\u016bnp\u016bn with the Ganges. Population (1901), 857. Tasar cloth is manufactured, and tablecloths, towels, and handkerchiefs are woven by Jol\u0101h\u0101s.\n\n**F\u0101zilka Tahsil.**\u2014Tahsil and subdivision of Ferozepore District, Punjab, lying between 29\u00b0 55' and 30\u00b0 34' N. and 73\u00b0 52' and 74\u00b0 43' E., with an area of 1,355 square miles. It is bounded north-west by the Sutlej, which divides it from the D\u012bp\u0101lpur tahsil of Montgomery District, and east by the Pati\u0101la State. It is divided into three well-marked natural divisions: a narrow low-lying belt along the Sutlej, a somewhat broader strip of older alluvium, and a plain broken by sandhills, which extends to the borders of Bikaner and is irrigated by the Sirhind Canal. The population in 1901 was 197,457, compared with 135,634 in 1891. It contains the town of F\u0101zilka (population,\n8,505), the head-quarters, and 319 villages. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 2\u00b72 lakhs.\n\n**F\u0101zilka Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision and tahsil of the same name, Ferozepore District, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 33' N. and 74\u00b0 3' E. It is the terminus of the F\u0101zilka extension of the Rajput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway, and has been connected with Ludhi\u0101na, Ferozepore, and the Southern Punjab Railway by a line recently constructed. Population (1901), 8,505. It was founded about 1846 on the ruins of a deserted village, named after a Wattu chief, F\u0101zil. It is a considerable grain mart and contains a wool press. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 21,300, and the expenditure Rs. 22,400. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 16,000, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 18,500. The town has an Anglo-vernacular middle school maintained by the municipality, and a Government dispensary.\n\n**Fenchuganj.**\u2014Village in the North Sylhet subdivision of Sylhet District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 23\u00b0 42' N. and 91\u00b0 58' E., on the left bank of the Kusiy\u0101r\u0101 river. Population (1901), 285. It is the head-quarters of the India General Steam Navigation Company in the Surma Valley and an important steamer station. The public buildings include a dispensary.\n\n**Fenny River** (vernacular *Pheni*).\u2014River of Eastern Bengal and Assam. Rising in 23\u00b0 20' N. and 91\u00b0 47' E., in Hill Tippera, it flows south-west, marking the boundary between Hill Tippera and the Chittagong Hill Tracts, which it leaves at R\u0101mg\u0101h\u0101r. Thence it flows west and south, dividing Chittagong from No\u0101kh\u0101l\u012b on the north, and ultimately falls into the Sandwip channel, an arm of the Bay of Bengal, in 22\u00b0 50' N. and 91\u00b0 27' E., after a course of 72 miles. During its course through the hills it is of little use for navigation, as the banks are abrupt and covered with heavy grass jungle and bamboo coppices. The Fenny is of considerable depth during the rains, but is rendered dangerous by rapid currents, whirling eddies, and sharp turns; it is navigable by large boats throughout the year for a distance of 30 miles. It is joined on the right bank by the Muhari river; and the Little Fenny, which flows almost directly south from its source in Hill Tippera, falls into the Bay close to its mouth.\n\n**Fenny Subdivision.**\u2014Eastern subdivision of No\u0101kh\u0101l\u012b District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 22\u00b0 43' and 23\u00b0 18' N. and 91\u00b0 15' and 91\u00b0 35' E., with an area of 343 square miles. It consists of low-lying alluvium, with the exception of a narrow strip of land on the east adjoining Hill Tippera, where the country is more undulating. The population in 1901 was 318,837, compared with 290,530 in 1891, the density being 930 persons per square mile. There are 678 villages, of which the most important is Fenny, the head-quarters.\nFenny Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in No\u0101kh\u0101l\u012b District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $23^\\circ 1' \\text{ N.}$ and $91^\\circ 25' \\text{ E.}$, on the Assam-Bengal Railway. Population (1901), 5,663. Fenny contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for 23 prisoners.\n\nFerokh.\u2014Village in the Ern\u0101d t\u0101huk of Makabar District, Madras, situated in $11^\\circ 12' \\text{ N.}$ and $75^\\circ 49' \\text{ E.}$, 7 miles from Calicut, with a station on the Madras Railway. Population (1901), 3,500. It has an important weekly market and a tile factory. The chief trade is in timber, dried fish, and coco-nuts. In 1788 Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n of Mysore made a determined but ineffectual attempt to raise the town to the position of a rival to Calicut.\n\nFerozepore District (Firozpur).\u2014District in the Jullundur Division of the Punjab, lying between $29^\\circ 55' \\text{ and } 31^\\circ 9' \\text{ N.}$ and $73^\\circ 52' \\text{ and } 75^\\circ 26' \\text{ E.}$, with an area of 4,302 square miles. On the north-east and north-west, the Sutlej forms the boundary separating the District from Jullundur and the Kap\u016brthala State, and, after its confluence with the Be\u0101s, from the Districts of Lahore and Montgomery. On the southwest and south, it is bounded by the States of Bah\u0101walpur and Bikaner, and by Hiss\u0101r District; on the south-east, by the Far\u012bdkot State, and by detached pieces of territory belonging to Pati\u0101la and N\u0101bha; and on the east by the District of Ludhi\u0101na. Far\u012bdkot State lies across the centre of the District, extending from the south-eastern border to within a few miles of the Sutlej on the north-west. A detached area forming a part of the Moga tahsil lies east of the Far\u012bdkot State. The District consists of a flat, alluvial plain, divided into three broad plateaux by two broken and shelving banks which mark ancient courses of the Sutlej. The upper bank, which crosses the District about 35 miles east of the present stream, is from 15 to 20 feet high; and the river seems to have run beneath it until 350 or 400 years ago, when its junction with the Be\u0101s lay near Mult\u0101n. In the second half of the eighteenth century the river ran under part of the lower bank, and in its changes from this to its present bed has cut out two or three channels, now entirely dry, the most important of which, the Sukhar Nai, runs in a tortuous course east and west. The volume of water in the Sutlej has sensibly diminished since the opening of the Sirhind Canal, and during the cold season it is easily fordable everywhere above its confluence with the Be\u0101s; below the confluence the stream is about 1,000 yards wide in the cold season, swelling to 2 or 3 miles in time of flood. The country is well wooded in its northern half, but very bare in the south; it is absolutely without hill or eminence of any description, even rock and stone being unknown.\n\nThere is nothing of geological interest in the District, which is situated entirely on the alluvium. In the north the spontaneous vegetation\nis that of the Central Punjab, in the south that of the desert, while in\nthe F\u0101zilka subdivision several species of the Western Punjab, more\nparticularly saltworts yielding sajji (barilla), are abundant. Trees are\nrare, except where planted; but the t\u0101li or shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo)\nis common on islands in the Sutlej. Along the banks of that river\nthere are large brakes (locally called b\u016blas) of tall grasses (Saccharum,\nAndropogon, &c.) mixed with tamarisk, which are used for thatching,\nbrush-making, and basket-weaving; also munj (used for cordage) and\nkhas-khas (scented roots employed for screens, &c.).\n\nWolves are the only beasts of prey now found, and they are by no\nmeans common; but until the middle of the nineteenth century tigers\nwere found on the banks of the Sutlej. Hog abound, and \u2018ravine deer\u2019\n(Indian gazelle) and antelope are fairly plentiful.\n\nThe climate does not differ from that of the Punjab plains generally,\nexcept that Ferozepore is proverbial for its dust-storms. Owing to the\ndryness of its climate, the city and cantonment of Ferozepore and the\nupland plains are exceptionally healthy; but the riverain tract is mala-\nrious in the extreme.\n\nThe annual rainfall varies from 11 inches at Muktsar to 20 at Zira;\nof the rain at the latter place 17 inches fall in the summer months and\n2 in the winter. The rainfall is very uncertain; the greatest amount\nreceived in any year between 1881 and 1903 was 25 inches at Feroze-\npore in 1882, and in four of the last twenty years one place or another\nhas received absolutely no rain. An unusually heavy flood came down\nthe Sutlej in August, 1900, and the level then rose three feet above the\nhighest on record, a part of the city of Ferozepore being washed away.\n\nThe earliest known rulers appear to have been the Ponw\u0101r R\u0101jputs,\none of whose capitals may have been Janer, a place apparently\nmentioned by Al Baihaki as Hajn\u012br on the route\nfrom Meerut to Lahore. About the time of the first\nMuhammadan invasions a colony of Bhatti R\u0101jputs from Jaisalmer\nsettled in the neighbourhood of Muktsar, and the Manj, a branch of\nthem, ousted the Ponw\u0101rs and became converts to Isl\u0101m about 1288.\nThe great Jat tribes\u2014Dh\u0101liwals, Gils, and others\u2014which now people\nthe District, began to appear 200 years after the Bhattis. About 1370\nthe fort of Ferozepore was built by Firoz Sh\u0101h III, and included in his\nnew government of Sirhind. Up to a comparatively recent date it\nseems probable, as tradition avers, that the District was richly culti-\nvated, and deserted sites and ruined wells in the tract bordering on the\nolder course of the Sutlej bear witness to the former presence of a\nnumerous population. Though no date can be absolutely determined\nfor this epoch of prosperity, there are some grounds for the belief that\nthe Sutlej flowed east of Ferozepore fort in the time of Akbar; for the\nAin-i-Akbar\u012b describes it as the capital of a large tract attached to the\nprovince of Mult\u0101n, and not to Sirhind, as would probably have been the case had the river then run in its modern course. The shifting of the river from which the tract derived its fertility, and the ravages of war, were doubtless the chief causes of its decline. This probably commenced before the end of the sixteenth century, and in another hundred years the country presented the appearance of a desert. About the end of the sixteenth century the Sidhu Jats, from whom the Ph\u016blk\u012b\u0101n R\u0101j\u0101s are descended, made their appearance; and in the middle of the seventeenth century most of the Jat tribes were converted to Sikhism by Har Rai, the seventh Gur\u016b. In 1705 the tenth Gur\u016b, Govind Singh, in his flight from Chamkaur, was defeated with great loss at Muktsar; in 1715 Naw\u0101b Isa Kh\u0101n, a Manj chief, who fifteen years before had built the fort of Kot Isa Kh\u0101n, rebelled against the imperial authorities and was defeated and killed; and about the same time the Dogars, a wild, predatory clan which claims descent from the Chauh\u0101n R\u0101jputs, settled near P\u0101kpattan, and gradually spread up the Sutlej valley, finding none to oppose them, as the scattered Bhatti population which occupied it retired before the new colonists. At length, in 1740, according to tradition, they reached Ferozepore, which was then included in a district called the Lakha Jungle in charge of an imperial officer stationed at Kas\u016br. Three of these officials in succession were murdered by the Dogars, who seem to have had matters much their own way until the Sikh power arose.\n\nIn 1763 the Bhangi confederacy, one of the great Sikh sections, attacked and conquered Ferozepore under their famous leader, G\u016bjar Singh, who made over the newly acquired territory to his nephew, Gurbakhsh Singh. The young Sikh chieftain rebuilt the fort and consolidated his power on the Sutlej, but spent most of his time in other portions of the province. In 1792, when he seems to have divided his estates with his family, Ferozepore fell to Dhanna Singh, his second son. Attacked by the Dogars, by the Path\u0101ns of Kasur, and by the neighbouring principality of Raikot, the new ruler lost his territories piece by piece, but was still in possession of Ferozepore itself when Ranjit Singh crossed the Sutlej in 1808, and threatened to absorb all the minor principalities which lay between his domain and the British frontier. But the British Government, established at Delhi since 1803, intervened with an offer of protection to all the Cis-Sutlej States; and Dhanna Singh gladly availed himself of the promised aid, being one of the first chieftains to accept British protection and control. Ranjit Singh, seeing the British ready to support their rights, at once ceased to interfere with the minor States, and Dhanna Singh retained unmolested the remnant of his dominions until his death in 1818. He left no son, but his widow succeeded to the principality during her lifetime; and on her death in 1835, the territory escheated to the British\nGovernment, under the conditions of the arrangement effected in 1809. The political importance of Ferozepore had been already recognized, and an officer was at once deputed to take possession of the new post. After the boundary had been carefully determined, the District was made over for a while to a native official; but it soon became desirable to make Ferozepore the permanent seat of a European Political officer. In 1839 Sir Henry (then Captain) Lawrence took charge of the station, which formed at that time the advanced outpost of British India in the direction of the Sikh power. Early accounts represent the country as a dreary and desert plain, where rain seldom fell and dust-storms never ceased. The energy of Captain Lawrence, however, combined with the unwonted security under British rule, soon attracted new settlers to this hitherto desolate region. Cultivation rapidly increased, trees began to fringe the water-side, trade collected round the local centres; and Ferozepore, which in 1835 was a deserted village, had in 1841 a population of nearly 5,000 persons. Four years later, the first Sikh War broke out. The enemy crossed the Sutlej opposite Ferozepore on December 16, 1845; and the battles of Mudki, Ferozeshah, Aliwal, and Sobraon, the first two within the limits of the present District, followed one another in rapid succession. Broken by their defeats, the Sikhs once more retired across the boundary river, pursued by the British army, which dictated the terms of peace beneath the walls of Lahore. The whole cis-Sutlej possessions of the Punjab kingdom passed into the hands of the East India Company, and the little principality of Ferozepore became at once the nucleus of an important British District. The existing area was increased by subsequent additions, the last of which took place in 1884. Since the successful close of the first Sikh campaign, the peace of the District has never been broken, except during the Mutiny of 1857. In May of that year, one of the two Native infantry regiments stationed at Ferozepore broke out into revolt, and, in spite of a British regiment and some European artillery, plundered and destroyed the buildings of the cantonment. The arsenal and magazine, however, which gave the station its principal importance, were saved without loss of life to the European garrison. The mutineers were subsequently dispersed. The detachment of Native infantry at Faizilka was at the same time disarmed; and the levies raised by General Van Cortlandt, and in Faizilka by Mr. Oliver, succeeded in preserving the peace of the District, which on any show of weakness would have been in revolt from one end to the other. In 1884, when Sirsa District was broken up, the tahsil of Faizilka was added to Ferozepore.\n\nThe population of the District at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 747,329, (1891) 886,676, and (1901) 958,072, dwelling in 8 towns and 1,503 villages. It increased by 8 per cent. during the\nlast decade, the increase being greatest in the F\u0101zilka tahsil and least in Z\u012bra. It is divided into the five tahsils of\n\nPopulation. Ferozepore, Z\u012bra, Moga, Muktsar, and F\u0101zilka, the head-quarters of each being at the place from which it is named. The chief towns are the municipalities of Ferozepore, the head-quarters of the District, F\u0101zilka, Muktsar, Dharmkot, Z\u012bra, and Makhu.\n\nThe following table shows the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|-------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Ferozepore | 480                  | 2     | 3,20     | 165,851    | 345.5                     | -7.7                                                        | 10,159                                 |\n| Z\u012bra       | 498                  | 3     | 342      | 176,462    | 354.3                     | +1.3                                                        | 4,218                                  |\n| Moga       | 807                  | 1     | 202      | 245,857    | 304.6                     | +4.3                                                        | 11,378                                 |\n| Muktsar    | 937                  | 1     | 320      | 172,448    | 184.0                     | +6.8                                                        | 5,538                                  |\n| F\u0101zilka    | 1,355                | 1     | 319      | 197,457    | 145.7                     | +45.6                                                       | 5,279                                  |\n| District total | 4,302              | 8     | 1,503    | 958,072    | 222.7                     | +8.0                                                        | 36,572                                 |\n\nNote.\u2014The figures for the areas of tahsils are taken from revenue returns. The total District area is that given in the Census Report.\n\nMuhammadans number 447,615, or 47 per cent. of the total; Hindus, 279,099, or more than 29 per cent.; and Sikhs, 228,355, or nearly 24 per cent. The language generally spoken is Punjabi of the M\u0101lwai type, but on the borders of Bikaner B\u0101gr\u012b is spoken.\n\nBy far the largest tribe are the Jats or J\u0101ts (248,000). They are of the M\u0101lw\u0101 type, described under Ludhiana District. The Arains (65,000) appear to be recent immigrants from Jullundur and Lahore. Small to begin with, their holdings in this District have become so subdivided, and their recent extravagance has plunged them so heavily into debt, that they present a complete contrast to their brethren in Ludhi\u0101na. Rajputs number 82,000. The Dogars (16,000) are still mainly a pastoral tribe: they are noted cattle-thieves, and have been described as feeble-minded, vain, careless, thriftless, very self-indulgent, and incapable of serious effort. Gujars number 14,000. The chief commercial tribes are the Aroras (24,000), Bani\u0101s (18,000), and Khattirs (11,000). Of the artisan and menial tribes, the most important are the Chhimbas (washermen, 15,000), Cham\u0101rs (leather-workers, 32,000), Chuhr\u0101s (scavengers, 95,000), Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers, 23,000), Kumh\u0101rs (potters, 35,000), M\u0101chhis (fishermen, 20,000), Mochis (cobblers, 23,000), Son\u0101rs (goldsmiths, 8,000), Tarkh\u0101ns (carpenters, 31,000), Telis (oil pressers, 16,000), and Loh\u0101rs (ironsmiths, 10,000). There are 14,000 barbers and 11,000 village minstrels. Ascetics include the Muhammadan Bodlas (1,200), whose powers of healing by\nincantation are as highly esteemed by the people, both Muhammadan and Hindu, as their curse is dreaded. Br\u0101hmans number 18,000. The B\u0101waris (11,000), H\u0101rnis, and S\u0101nsis (500) have been proclaimed as criminal tribes. Mahtams number 14,000. About 61 per cent. of the population are supported by agriculture.\n\nThe Ludhi\u0101na American Presbyterian Mission has a station, occupied in 1871, at Ferozepore. The mission of the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America started work in 1881. The District in 1901 contained 240 native Christians.\n\nThe conditions of the District vary with the distance from the hills, the annual rainfall decreasing by about 4 inches every 20 miles, while in every part the light soils of the uplands can resist drought much better than the clays of the riverain tract. In the north-east the rainfall is sufficient for ordinary tillage. In the centre the hard clay soils of the riverain require water to grow even ordinary crops in dry years, but the light upland soils do very well with the quantity of rain they usually receive. In the south there is no unirrigated cultivation in the riverain, and in the uplands the cultivation is extremely precarious.\n\nThe District is held mostly on the bhaiy\u0101ch\u0101r\u0101 and pattid\u0101ri tenures, zamind\u0101ri lands covering only 474 square miles.\n\nThe area for which details are available from the revenue records of 1903\u20134 is 4,078 square miles, as shown below:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Ferozepore | 486   | 371        | 144       | 65              |\n| Zira       | 495   | 413        | 155       | 48              |\n| Moga       | 807   | 756        | 268       | 16              |\n| Muktsar    | 935   | 807        | 449       | 73              |\n| F\u0101zl\u012bka    | 1,355 | 1,097      | 595       | 193             |\n| **Total**  | **4,078** | **3,444**  | **1,611** | **395**         |\n\nWheat and gram are the most important crops of the spring harvest, occupying 784 and 841 square miles respectively in 1903\u20134; barley covered 213 square miles. In the autumn harvest, the great and spiked millets occupied 193 and 128 square miles respectively. Some rice (21 square miles) is grown on the inundation canals, and maize (117 square miles) in the riverain. The pulse moth is the autumn crop of the sandy tracts beneath the great bank. Little sugar-cane or cotton is grown.\n\nThe cultivated area increased by 6 per cent. during the twelve years ending 1903\u20134, the increase being chiefly due to the extension of canal-irrigation. Little has been done towards improving the quality of the crops, experiments tending to show that foreign seeds deteriorate\nafter a year or two. The chief improvement in agricultural practice is the substitution of the spring cultivation for the less valuable autumn crops; forty years ago the autumn harvest occupied twice the area of the spring, and even now spring cultivation in the south of the District is insignificant. Loans under the Agriculturists' Loans Act are popular, and as a rule faithfully applied. During the five years ending 1904 Rs. 86,000 was advanced under this Act, and Rs. 1,600 under the Land Improvement Loans Act.\n\nThe cattle of the riverain are greatly inferior to the upland breed, which is an extremely fine one. Before the introduction of British rule, the jungles round Muktsar were inhabited by an essentially pastoral population. Camels are much used in the sandy parts and the local breed is good. Ferozepore is an important horse-breeding District. There are two breeds of horses\u2014a small wiry animal bred chiefly by the Dogars of the riverain, and a larger one bred inland. An important horse and cattle fair is held at Jal\u0101lab\u0101d in the Mamdot estate in February. Nine horse and eighteen donkey stallions are kept by the Army Remount department, and two pony stallions by the District board. Sheep are fairly numerous, and the wool of the country between F\u0101zik\u0101 and Bikaner is much esteemed.\n\nOf the total area cultivated in 1903-4, 1,611 square miles, or 47 per cent., were classed as irrigated. Of this area, 170 square miles were irrigated from wells, 79 from wells and canals, 1,361 from canals, and 519 acres from streams and tanks. In addition, 68 square miles, or 2 per cent., were subject to inundation from the Sutlej. The high lands of the south-east are irrigated by the Abohar branch of the Sirhind Canal, while the riverain is watered by the Grey Inundation Canals. In the riverain wells are worked by Persian wheels, in the high lands by the rope and bucket. In both cases bullocks are used. There were 8,604 wells in use in 1904, besides 808 temporary wells, lever wells, and water-lifts.\n\nForests covering an area of 6 square miles are managed by the Deputy-Commissioner. Small groves of trees are generally found round wells; but there are no large plantations, and the scarcity of wood is felt to a considerable extent. Kankar is the only mineral product of value.\n\nThe manufactures are confined almost entirely to the supply of local wants. Coarse cloths and blankets are woven from home-grown cotton and wool, and the carts made locally are of exceptional excellence. Mats are woven of Indian hemp and false hemp. Excellent lacquer-work on wood is produced. The arsenal at Ferozepore town employed 1,199 hands in 1904.\n\nThe District exports wheat and other articles of agricultural produce,\nwhich are to a great extent carried by the producers direct to markets in Ludhiana, Amritsar, Bahawalpur, Lahore, Jullundur, and Hoshiarpur. The chief imports are sugar, cotton, sesamum, metals, piece goods, indigo, tobacco, salt, rice, and spices. Ferozepore town is the chief trade centre.\n\nFerozepore town lies on the North-Western Railway from Lahore to Bhatinda, and the Fazilka tahsil is traversed by the Southern Punjab Railway. Fazilka town is also connected with Bhatinda by a branch of the Rajputana-Malwa (narrow gauge) Railway, which runs parallel to the North-Western Railway from Bhatinda to Kot Kapura. A railway running from Ludhiana through Ferozepore and Fazilka to join the Southern Punjab Railway at McLeodganj has recently been opened. Ferozepore town lies on the important metalled road from Lahore to Ludhiana. The total length of metalled roads in the District is 81 miles and of unmetalled roads 828 miles. Of the former, 57 miles are under the Public Works department, and the rest under the District board. The Abohar branch of the Sirhind Canal and the Sutlej Navigation Canal form a waterway connecting Ferozepore town with Rupar. Below its junction with the Beas, the Sutlej is navigable all the year round. Little use, however, is made of these means of water communication. There are twenty ferries on the Sutlej.\n\nThe District was visited by famine in 1759-60, and again in 1783-4, the year of the terrible chalisa famine, when rain failed for three successive seasons and wheat sold at a seer and a quarter per rupee. Famine again occurred in 1803-4, 1817-8, 1833-4, 1842-3, 1848-9, 1856-7, and 1860-1. In 1868-9 there was famine, and Rs. 16,739 was spent in relief. The next famine was in 1896-7, by which time the extension of canal-irrigation and the improvement of communications had to a great extent prevented distress becoming really acute. Food for human beings was not scarce, as the stocks of grain were ample, but a good deal of suffering was caused by high prices. The total amount spent on relief was Rs. 33,952, and the greatest number relieved in any week was 4,149. In 1899-1900 scarcity was again felt. The greatest number on test works was 2,296, and the expenditure was Rs. 75,470, of which Rs. 61,435 was for works of permanent utility on canals.\n\nThe District is in charge of a Deputy-Commissioner, aided by six Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, of whom one is in charge of the Fazilka subdivision and one in charge of the District treasury. It is divided into the five tahsils of Administration.\n\nFerozepore, Zira, Moga, Muktsar, and Fazilka, each under a tahsildar and a naib-tahsildar, the Fazilka tahsil forming a subdivision.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner as District Magistrate is responsible for\ncriminal justice. Civil judicial work is under a District Judge, and both officers are subordinate to the Divisional Judge of the Ferozepore Civil Division, who is also Sessions Judge. There are four Munsifs, one at head-quarters and one at each outlying tahsil, except F\u0101zilka. Dacoity and murder are especially common in the District. The most frequent forms of crime are cattle-theft and burglary.\n\nPractically nothing is known of the revenue systems which obtained in Ferozepore previous to annexation. The Ain-i-Akbari mentions Ferozepore as the capital of a large pargana in the Mult\u0101n Subah. The Lahore and Kap\u016brthala governments seem to have taken their revenue in cash. They fixed the amount for short periods only, and sometimes collected in kind. From annexation onwards the revenue history has to be considered in three parts. The District proper is divided into two portions by the State of Faridkot, while the revenue history of the F\u0101zilka tahsil, which was added to the District in 1884, is distinct from either of those portions and possesses different natural features. Several summary assessments were made from annexation to 1852, when the regular settlement was commenced. This assessment, which increased the demand of the summary settlement by only 1 per cent., was sanctioned for a term of thirty years. The Muktsar tahsil was annexed in 1855 and settled summarily. This settlement ran on till 1868, when (together with the Mamdot territory annexed in 1864) the tahsil was regularly settled. The northern part of the District, including the Moga, Z\u012bra, and Ferozepore tahsils, was resettled between 1884 and 1888. Besides raising the demand from Rs. 4,80,000 to Rs. 7,30,000, a water rate was imposed of 6 and 12 annas per ghumao (five-sixths of an acre) on crops irrigated by the Grey Inundation Canals. This rate brings in about Rs. 30,000 a year. The Muktsar tahsil was reassessed immediately afterwards, and the revenue raised from Rs. 1,76,000 to Rs. 2,65,000, excluding the canal rate, which was calculated to bring in a further Rs. 20,000.\n\nThe F\u0101zilka tahsil was summarily settled after annexation, and the regular settlement was made in 1852\u201364. The revised settlement made in 1881 increased the revenue from Rs. 55,000 to Rs. 94,000. At the same time 51 villages on the Sutlej were placed under a fluctuating assessment, based on crop rates varying from Rs. 1-8-0 to 8 annas per acre. The tahsil came again under assessment in February, 1900, when the revenue was increased by Rs. 71,000, excluding a large enhancement of occupiers\u2019 rates on canal-irrigated lands.\n\nThe rates of the present settlement range from R. 0-14-3 to Rs. 1-6-3 on \u2018wet\u2019 land, and from 7 annas to R. 0-13-10 on \u2018dry\u2019 land.\n\nThe collections of land revenue alone and of total revenue are shown in the following table:\u2014\nThe District possesses six municipalities: Ferozepore, Fazilka, Muktsar, Dharmkot, Zira, and Makhu. Outside these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which had in 1903-4 an income of Rs. 1,73,000. The expenditure was Rs. 1,61,000, public works being the largest item.\n\nThe regular police force consists of 679 of all ranks, including 59 cantonment and 91 municipal police, under a Superintendent who usually has four inspectors to assist him. The village and town watchmen number 1,528. There are 18 police stations, 4 outposts, and 13 road-posts. The District jail at head-quarters has accommodation for 424 prisoners.\n\nFerozepore stands fourteenth among the twenty-eight Districts of the Province in respect of the literacy of its population. In 1901 the proportion of literate persons was 3.8 per cent. (6.7 males and 0.3 females). The number of pupils under instruction was 2,942 in 1880-1, 5,446 in 1890-1, 6,113 in 1900-1, and 6,387 in 1903-4. In the last year there were 10 secondary and 93 primary (public) schools, and 7 advanced and 90 elementary (private) schools, with 473 girls in the public and 289 in the private schools. The District possesses an Anglo-vernacular high school maintained by the Ferozepore municipality, the management of which was taken over by the Educational department in 1904, and two unaided high schools\u2014the Har Bhagwan Das Memorial high school at Ferozepore and the Dev Dharm high school at Moga. It also has 7 middle and 93 primary schools under the department, and 2 middle and 95 primary schools supported mainly by private enterprise. Indigenous education, however, is on the decline. The girls' schools, though few, show more signs of life than they did ten years ago, and there is healthy competition between the small mission school for girls and that of the Dev Samaj. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 72,000, of which the District board contributed Rs. 25,300; the Government grant was Rs. 5,000.\n\nBesides the civil hospital and a mission hospital at Ferozepore, the District contains seven outlying dispensaries. These institutions in 1904 treated a total of 97,612 out-patients and 3,067 in-patients, and 7,781 operations were performed. The expenditure was nearly Rs. 23,000, of which Rs. 10,000 was derived from municipal and Rs. 12,000 from Local funds.\nThe number of successful vaccinations in 1903-4 was 24,321, representing 26 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[F.

It is bounded on the north-west by the Sutlej, which divides it from Lahore District. The lowlands along the river are irrigated by the Grey Canals, but the greater part of the tahsil lies in an upland plateau of sandy loam. The population in 1901 was 165,851, compared with 179,606 in 1891. **Ferozepore Town** (population, 49,341) is the head-quarters of the tahsil, which also contains the town of Mudk\u012b (2,977) and 320 villages. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 2\u00b71 lakhs. The battle-fields of Ferozesh\u0101h and Mudk\u012b are in this tahsil.\n\n**Ferozepore Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of Ferozepore, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 58' N. and 74\u00b0 37' E., on the old high bank of the Sutlej, on the North-Western Railway; distant by rail from Calcutta 1,198 miles, from Bombay 1,080, and from Karachi 788. Population (1901), with cantonment, 49,341, including 24,314 Muhammadans, 21,304 Hindus, 1,665 Sikhs, and 1,753 Christians. The town was founded, according to tradition, in the time of Firoz Sh\u0101h III, but was in a declining state at the period of British annexation, the population in 1838 being only 2,732. It was occupied by the British in 1835, on the death of Sard\u0101rni Lachhman Kunwar. It is now the seat of a thriving commerce, due principally to the exertions of Sir H. Lawrence, who induced many native traders to settle in the town, and more lately to the enterprise of an English merchant, who has erected a powerful cotton-press in the vicinity. The main streets are wide and well paved, while a circular road which girdles the wall is lined by the gardens of wealthy residents. The memorial church, in honour of those who fell in the Sutlej campaign of 1845-6, was destroyed during the Mutiny, but since restored. A Sikh temple in honour of the men of the 36th Sikhs who fell holding Fort S\u0101ragarhi and in the sortie from Fort Gulist\u0101n in 1897, erected by private subscriptions collected by the *Pioneer* newspaper, and opened in 1903 by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, testifies to the loyalty and valour of our former foes.\n\nFerozepore has a large and prosperous grain market, but is chiefly important for its cantonment, the population of which in 1901 was 25,866. One of the two arsenals in the Province is situated at Feroze-\npore, which in 1904 employed 1,199 hands. The garrison includes a battery of field artillery and a company of garrison artillery, a British infantry regiment, one regiment of Native cavalry, and two battalions of Native infantry. The income and expenditure of the cantonment funds during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 47,000.\n\nThe municipality was created in 1867. The municipal receipts during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 50,900, and the expenditure Rs. 49,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 52,700, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 45,100, including conservancy (Rs. 7,700), education (Rs. 11,700), medical (Rs. 8,400), public safety (Rs. 7,200), and administration (Rs. 5,500). The chief educational institutions are two Anglo-vernacular high schools, one of which, maintained by the municipality, was taken over by the Educational department in 1904, and an aided Anglo-vernacular middle school in cantonments. There is a civil hospital. The Ludhiana American Presbyterian Mission maintains a hospital for males and a small school for girls.\n\nFerozesh\u0101h (Phariishahr).\u2014Battle-field in the District and tahsil of Ferozepore, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 53' N. and 74\u00b0 50' E., about 12 miles from the left bank of the Sutlej. It is famous for the attack made upon the formidably entrenched Sikh camp, on December 21, 1845, by the British forces under Sir Hugh Gough and Sir Henry Hardinge. After two days' severe fighting, the entrenchments were carried and the enemy completely routed, but not without heavy losses on the part of the conquerors. No traces of the earthworks now remain, but a monument erected upon the spot perpetuates the memory of the officers and men who fell in the engagement. The real name of the place, as called by the people, is Pharushahr, corrupted into the historical name Ferozesh\u0101h.\n\nFife, Lake.\u2014Lake in Poona District, Bombay. See Lake Fife.\n\nFiringipet.\u2014Town in South Arcot District, Madras. See Porto Novo.\n\nFiroz\u0101b\u0101d Tahsil.\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Agra District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between 26\u00b0 59' and 27\u00b0 22' N. and 78\u00b0 19' and 78\u00b0 32' E., with an area of 203 square miles. Population increased from 112,153 in 1891 to 119,775 in 1901. There are 186 villages and one town, Firozabad (population, 16,849), the tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 2,25,000, and for cesses Rs. 27,000. The density of population, 590 persons per square mile, is slightly above the District average. The tahsil lies north of the Jumna, and is crossed by two small streams, the Sirs\u0101 and Sengar. About one-sixth of the total area consists of the Jumna ravines, which produce only thatching grass and a little stunted timber. The rest is a fertile tract of upland soil, with a few patches of usar, dh\u0101k jungle (Butea frondosa), and here and there sandy ridges. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was\n141 square miles, of which 60 were irrigated. Wells supply over 90 per cent. of the irrigated area, and the Upper Ganges Canal serves about 5 square miles.\n\n**Firozabad Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the *tahsil* of the same name in Agra District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 9' N. and 78\u00b0 23' E., on the road from Agra city to Mainpuri, and on the East Indian Railway. Population (1901), 16,849. The town is ancient, but is said to have been destroyed and rebuilt in the sixteenth century by a eunuch, named Malik Firoz, under the orders of Akbar, because Todar Mal was insulted by the inhabitants. It contains an old mosque and some temples, besides a dispensary, and branches of the American Methodist Mission and the Church Missionary Society. A municipality was constituted in 1869. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged about Rs. 14,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 16,000, chiefly from octroi (Rs. 12,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 20,000. The trade of the place is mainly local, but there is a cotton-ginning factory employing about 100 hands. The municipality maintains a school and aids four others with 190 pupils, besides the *tahsili* school with about 80 pupils.\n\n**Firozpur.**\u2014District, *tahsil*, and town in the Punjab. See Feroze-\n\n**Firozpur Tahsil.**\u2014*Tahsil* of Gurgaon District, Punjab, lying between 27\u00b0 39' and 28\u00b0 1' N. and 76\u00b0 53' and 77\u00b0 20' E., with an area of 317 square miles. It is bounded on the north-east by the Nuh and Palwal *tahsils*, on the south-east by the Muttra District of the United Provinces and the State of Bharatpur, and on the west by the State of Alwar. The population in 1901 was 132,287, compared with 113,874 in 1891. It contains the town of Firozpur-Jhirka (population, 7,278), the head-quarters, and 230 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 2.7 lakhs. The *parganas* of Firozpur and Punahana, which make up the present *tahsil*, were assigned for good service to Ahmad Bakhsh Khan, but were forfeited by his son for complicity in the murder of Mr. William Fraser in 1836. Of the two ranges of bare and rocky hills which extend northwards into the *tahsil*, one forms the western boundary and the other runs northeast for 25 miles and then sinks into the plain. The soil in the low-lying parts of the *tahsil*, which are liable to be flooded after heavy rains, is a sandy loam.\n\n**Firozpur-Jhirka.**\u2014Head-quarters of the Firozpur *tahsil* in Gurgaon District, Punjab, situated in 27\u00b0 47' N. and 76\u00b0 58' E., 50 miles due south of Gurgaon town. Population (1901), 7,278. Formerly a trade centre for cotton, it has been ruined by the absence of railway communications. It has an out-still for the distillation of spirit. It is said to have been founded by Firoz Shah III as a military post.\nto control the Mew\u0101t\u012bs. From 1803 to 1836 it was the seat of the Naw\u0101bs of Firozpur, to whom the present tahsil had been granted on annexation. The municipality was created in 1867. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 7,400 and Rs. 7,100 respectively. The income in 1903-4 was Rs. 6,600, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 7,800. It maintains a vernacular middle school and a dispensary.\n\n**Fir\u016bz Sh\u0101h.**\u2014Battle-field in Ferozepore District, Punjab. See FEROZESHAM.\n\n**Forbesganj.**\u2014Village in the Ar\u0101ri\u0101 subdivision of Purnea District, Bengal, situated in 26\u00b0 19' N. and 87\u00b0 16' E. Population (1901), 2,029. Forbesganj lies on the Eastern Bengal State Railway and is a market of growing importance, the chief articles of commerce being jute, grain, and piece-goods; there are two steam jute-presses. The place contains a number of M\u0101rw\u0101r\u012b merchants, some of whom conduct a trans-frontier trade with Nep\u0101l.\n\n**Fort Dufferin.**\u2014Part of Mandalay cantonment, Upper Burma. See MANDALAY CITY.\n\n**Fort Lockhart.**\u2014Military outpost on the S\u0101m\u0101na range, in the Hangu tahsil of Koh\u0101t District, North-West Frontier Province, and summer head-quarters of the general commanding the Koh\u0101t military district, situated in 33\u00b0 33' N. and 70\u00b0 55' E., 6,743 feet above sea-level. The garrison consists of a Native infantry regiment, and in summer a mountain battery.\n\n**Fort Mackeson.**\u2014Formerly a considerable frontier fort in Pesh\u0101war District, North-West Frontier Province, built to command the north entrance to the Koh\u0101t Pass, from which it is 3\u00bd miles distant. It consisted of a pentagon, an inner keep, and a hornwork, with accommodation for 500 troops; but, with the exception of the keep, it was dismantled in 1887; and is now held by 29 men of the border military police.\n\n**Fort Munro.**\u2014Hill station in the District and tahsil of Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 N. and 70\u00b0 3' E., on a peak of the Sulaim\u0101n Hills, 6,300 feet above sea-level.\n\n**Fort St. David.**\u2014A ruined fortress in the Cuddalore taluk of South Arcot District, Madras, situated in 11\u00b0 45' N. and 79\u00b0 47' E., on the bank of the Gadilam river near the point where it falls into the Bay of Bengal, about 1\u00bd miles east of Cuddalore New Town. The place is now included within the limits of the municipality of Cuddalore, and several European bungalows have been erected within its crumbling lines. It has as stirring a history as almost any spot in the Presidency. The Dutch and the French both had settlements here at one time. There was a small fort, which had been built by a Hindu merchant named Chinnia Chetti, and after the capture of\nGingee by Sivaji in 1677 this passed into the possession of the Marathas. From them it was purchased by the English in 1690, the sale including all the land round to the distance of a 'randome shott of a great gun.' The great gun was carefully loaded and fired to the different points of the compass, and wherever its shot fell a boundary mark was set up. The villages so obtained are called the 'cannon-ball villages' to this day. The place was originally known in those days as Tegnapatam or Devipatam; and it has been conjectured with much probability that it was named Fort St. David by Elihu Yale, then Governor of Fort St. George, who was a Welshman, in honour of his country's patron saint. From 1725 onwards the fortifications were greatly improved and the place became of considerable strength. Upon the capitulation of Madras to the French under La Bourdonnais in 1746, Fort St. David became the British head-quarters on the coast, and the Company's agents there assumed the general administration of affairs in the South of India. They successfully resisted an attack made in the same year by Dupleix. Clive received his first commission here in 1747 and was appointed its Governor in 1756. In 1758 the French under Lally (see the graphic account of the affair in Orme's History) captured and dismantled the fort, but abandoned it in 1760 when Eyre Coote marched on Pondicherry. In 1782 they again took it, and restored its defences in 1783 sufficiently to withstand an attack by General Stuart. It was given back to the English in 1785. A curious feature of the fortifications was the subterranean passages under the glacis. These appear to have run completely round the fort, thus forming a safe means of communication for the garrison. At short intervals other galleries, striking off at right angles and terminating in powder chambers, served as mines. At the south-east corner the gallery ran down to the edge of the sea. Some of these passages are still to be seen.\n\nFort St. George.\u2014The citadel of Madras. See MADRAS CITY.\n\nFort Sandeman Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision and tahsil of the Zhob District, Baluchistan, forming the north-eastern corner of the District, and lying between $30^\\circ 39'$ and $32^\\circ 4'$ N. and $68^\\circ 58'$ and $70^\\circ 3'$ E., with an area of 3,583 square miles. Population (1901), 34,712. The land revenue, including grazing tax and royalty levied on wood, amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 40,000. The head-quarters station is Fort Sandeman (population, 3,552). The tahsil possesses 190 villages. The country is hilly, and intersected by the valley of the Zhob and many minor valleys. Cultivation is sparse and backward. The Girdao plain is covered with rich pasture in years of good rainfall. The Shinghar spurs of the Sulaiman range contain fine forests of edible pine.\n\nFort Sandeman Town.\u2014Head-quarters station of the Zhob\nDistrict, Baluchist\u0101n, situated in $31^\\circ 21' N.$ and $69^\\circ 27' E.$ It was first occupied in December, 1889. To the natives the locality is known as Apozai; it received its present name from its founder, Sir Robert Sandeman. The station stands about $6\\frac{1}{2}$ miles east of the Zhob river, in an open plain 4,700 feet above sea-level. A ridge rises 150 feet above the surface of the plain to the north, on which stands the residence of the Political Agent, known as the Castle. The military lines, bazar, dispensaries, and school lie below. The nearest railway station in Baluchist\u0101n is Harnai, 168 miles; Bhakkar, the railway station for Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, is 122 miles. The population numbered 3,552 in 1901. The garrison includes a Native cavalry and a Native infantry regiment, and Fort Sandeman is also the headquarters of the Zhob Levy Corps. A supply of water for drinking purposes, carried by a pipe nine miles from the Sali\u0101za valley, was inaugurated in 1894, at a cost of a little over a lakh of rupees. Water for irrigation is also obtained from the same source, and by this means many fruit and other trees have been planted. A Local fund has existed since 1890; the income during 1903\u20134 was Rs. 18,000 and the expenditure Rs. 17,000. One-third of the net receipts from octroi is paid over to the military authorities. A small sanitarium, about 8,500 ft. above sea-level, exists about 30 miles away at Shunghar on the Sulaim\u0101n range, to which resort is made in the summer months.\n\nFort Victoria.\u2014Fort in the D\u0101poli taluka of Ratn\u0101giri District, Bombay. See Bank\u014dt.\n\nFort William.\u2014The citadel of Calcutta, Bengal. See Calcutta.\n\nFrench Possessions.\u2014The head-quarters of the Governor of French India are at Pondicherry; and the French Possessions comprise five Settlements, with certain dependent loges or plots. They aggregate 203 square miles, and had a total population in 1891 of 286,347 persons and in 1901 of 273,185. These totals were made up as follows: Pondicherry, area 115 square miles, population (1901) 174,456; K\u0101rik\u0101l, 53 square miles, population 56,595; Mah\u00e9, 26 square miles, population 10,298; Yanam, 5 square miles, population 5,005; and Chandernagore, 4 square miles, population 26,831. Except the last, these possessions are all located within the Madras Presidency. The greater part of the decline in the population during the decade ending 1901 occurred at K\u0101rik\u0101l.\n\nThe first French expedition into Indian waters, with a view to open up commercial relations, dates as far back as 1603. It was undertaken by private merchants at Rouen; but it failed, as also did several similar attempts which followed. In 1642 Cardinal Richelieu founded the first Compagnie d'Orient, but its efforts met with no success. Colbert reconstituted the Company on a larger basis in 1664, granting exemption from taxes and a monopoly of the Indian trade for fifty\nyears. After having twice attempted, without success, to establish itself in Madagascar, Colbert's Company again took up the idea of direct trade with India, and its President, Caron, founded in 1668 the Comptoir or agency at Surat. But on finding that city unsuited for a head establishment, he seized the harbour of Trincomalee in Ceylon from the Dutch. The Dutch, however, speedily retook Trincomalee; and Caron, passing over to the Coromandel coast, in 1672 seized St. Thom\u00e9, a Portuguese town adjoining Madras which had for twelve years been in the possession of Holland. He was, however, compelled to restore it to the Dutch in 1674.\n\nThe ruin of the Company seemed impending, when one of its agents, the celebrated Fran\u00e7ois Martin, suddenly restored it. Rallying under him a handful of sixty Frenchmen, saved out of the wreck of the settlements at Trincomalee and St. Thom\u00e9, he took up his abode at Pondicherry, then a small village, which he purchased in 1683 from the R\u0101j\u0101 of Gingee. He built fortifications, and a trade began to spring up; but he was unable to hold the town against the Dutch, who wrested it from him in 1693, and held it until it was restored to the French by the Peace of Ryswick in 1697.\n\nPondicherry became in this year, and has ever since remained, the most important of the French Settlements in India. Its foundation was contemporaneous with that of Calcutta; like Calcutta, its site was purchased by a European Company from a native prince; and what Job Charnock was to Calcutta, Fran\u00e7ois Martin proved to Pondicherry. On its restitution to the French by the Peace of Ryswick in 1697, Martin was appointed governor, and under his able management Pondicherry became an entrep\u00f4t of trade. Chandernagore, in Lower Bengal, had been acquired by the French Company in 1688, by grant from the Delhi emperor; Mah\u00e9, on the Malabar coast, was obtained in 1725\u20136, under the government of M. Lenoir; K\u0101rik\u0101l, on the Coromandel coast, under that of M. Dumas in 1739. Yanam, on the coast of the Northern Circars, was taken possession of in 1750, and formally ceded to the French two years later.\n\nThe war of 1741 between France and England led to the attack alike of Madras and of Pondicherry, the capitals of the English and French Companies in Southern India. La Bourdonnais equipped at his own expense a fleet, and laid siege to Madras, which capitulated on September 21, 1746, and was ransomed for \u00a3400,000. The English in due time made reprisals. On April 26, 1748, they appeared before Pondicherry, but eventually retired after a most skilful defence of the town conducted by the famous Dupleix during forty-two days. The Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle put a stop to further hostilities, and left Dupleix free to further his dream of an Indian empire for France. Between 1746 and 1756, by a happy mingling of clever diplomacy and fearless daring,\nDupleix and his lieutenants passed from success to success until the French reached the height of their power in the South. He obtained from the Mughal emperor at Delhi the title of Naw\u0101b; established a protectorate over the S\u016bbah of Arcot and other parts of Southern India; made large additions to the French territory around Pondicherry, K\u0101rik\u0101l, and Masulipatam; and extended the French authority over the four Sark\u0101rs of Mustaf\u0101nagar, Ellore, R\u0101jahmundry, and Chicacole, and the island of Srirangam, formed by two arms of the Cauvery. These various annexations opened up to French commerce 200 leagues of seaboard, and yielded a revenue of \u00a3800,000 (20 million francs).\n\nThis period of power proved of short duration. Dupleix, feebly supported by the Court of Versailles, met with a series of reverses from the English Company, and was recalled to Paris in 1753. A certain extent of the territory still remained to his successor; but during the Seven Years\u2019 War the Government of France could afford no reinforcements for its Indian possessions. The English Company overran them, defeated the French at Wandiw\u0101sh, and seized Arcot. Lally-Tollendal, after a chivalrous defence, surrendered Pondicherry on January 6, 1761. The English demolished the town; the walls, the forts, the public buildings, were all destroyed. The captured troops and all Europeans in the French Company\u2019s service were deported to France.\n\nTwo years later, the peace of 1763 restored Pondicherry and the other Indian factories to the French, but with their former territories greatly curtailed. The abolition of the monopoly of the French Company in 1769 threw open the trade, and Pondicherry began to show signs of new vitality. But in 1778 it again fell into the hands of the English East India Company. In 1782 the Bailli de Suffren made a brilliant effort on behalf of his countrymen, fighting four naval battles with the English in seven months, and retaking the fort of Trincomalee. Next year, the Treaty of Versailles restored Pondicherry and the other factories to the French, January 20, 1783. But the English Company took advantage, as usual, of the breaking out of the next war in Europe to seize the French possessions in India, and again compelled their rivals to evacuate their settlements in 1793. The Peace of Amiens once more restored them to the French in 1802; on the renewal of hostilities, the English Company again seized them, September 11, 1803. Pondicherry thus passed for the fourth time under British rule; and, during the long Napoleonic wars, the French power ceased to exist in India.\n\nPondicherry and the other factories were restored to the French by the treaties of 1814 and 1815, the territories being finally reduced to their present limits. The French had to begin the whole work of their Indian settlements de novo; and an expedition arrived at Pondicherry\non September 16, 1816, to re-enter on possession. On December 4, 1816, Pondicherry and Chandernagore were delivered over to them; K\u0101rik\u0101l on January 14, 1817; Mah\u00e9, on February 22, 1817; and Yanam, on April 12, 1817. A convention between the Governments of France and England, dated March 7, 1815, regulated the conditions of their restoration. The French renounced their former right, under the convention of August 30, 1787, to claim annually from the English East India Company 300 chests of opium at cost price, and agreed to pay henceforth the average rates realized at the Calcutta sales. They also bound themselves to make over to the English Company, at a fixed price, all surplus salt manufactured within their restored territories over and above the requirements of the local population. In compensation for these concessions, the English agreed to pay 4 lakhs of sicca rupees (one million francs, or, say, \u00a340,000) annually to the French Government. As it was found that the right to make salt at all in the French Settlements led to the smuggling of that article into the surrounding British Districts, the French Government was induced, on May 13, 1818, to surrender it altogether for an annual payment of 4,000 pagodas (33,600 francs, or, say, \u00a31,344). This second treaty, although at first made for only fifteen years, has been indefinitely prolonged; the British Government supplying the French authorities with salt at cost price, and allowing the latter to sell it to their own subjects at their own rates. Difficulties still continue regarding the supply of arrack, or country liquor, that made in Pondicherry being cheaper than the British product after it has paid the heavy excise duty, and special arrangements are required along the Pondicherry border. The cost of manufacture of toddy (palm-juice liquor) is about equal in the two territories, and no complications ensue. The tariff on imports into British India also necessitates the maintenance of a special land customs establishment all along the intricate frontier of the Pondicherry Settlement.\n\nThe military command and administration-in-chief of the French possessions in India are vested in a Governor, whose residence is at Pondicherry. He is assisted by a minister of the interior, secretaries in the different administrative departments, and a principal judicial officer. In 1879 local councils and a council-general were established, the members being chosen by a sort of universal suffrage within the French territories. Ten municipalities or communal boards were erected under a decree issued in 1880: namely, at Pondicherry, Oulgaret, Vallenour, Bah\u016br, K\u0101rik\u0101l, La Grande Ald\u00e9e, Nedung\u0101du, Chandernagore, Mah\u00e9, and Yanam. On municipal boards natives are entitled to a proportion of the seats. Civil and criminal courts, courts of first instance, and a court of appeal compose the judicial machinery. The army and establishments connected with the Governor and his staff at Pondi-\ncherry, and those of the local governors or chefs de service at Chander-\nnagore, Yanam, Mah\u00e9, and K\u0101rik\u0101l, together with other headquar-\nters charges, necessarily engross a large proportion of the revenue.\nAll the state and dignity of an independent Government, with four\ndependent ones, have to be maintained. This is effected by rigid\neconomy, and the prestige of the French Government is worthily\nmaintained in the East. Pondicherry is also the scene of considerable\nreligious pomp and missionary activity. It forms the seat of a Pr\u00e9-\nfecture Apostolique, founded in 1828, consisting of a Pr\u00e9fet Apostolique\nand a body of priests for all French India; and of the Missions\n\u00c9trang\u00e8res, the successors of the Mission du Carnatic founded by the\nJesuits in 1776. But the chief field of this mission lies outside the\nFrench Settlements; a large proportion of its Christians are British\nsubjects and many of the churches are in British territory. The British\nrupee is the only legal tender within French territories. The system of\neducation is progressive to a satisfactory extent. A line of railway\nrunning via Vallenour, from Pondicherry to Villupuram on the South\nIndian Railway, maintains communication with Madras and the rest of\nBritish India, and K\u0101rik\u0101l is linked to the same railway by the branch\nfrom Peralam. The telegraph is working throughout the Settlements.\nA Chamber of Commerce consisting of fourteen members, nine of them\nEuropeans or persons of European descent, was reorganized in 1879.\nThe capital, Pondicherry, is a very handsome town, and presents,\nespecially from the sea, a striking appearance of French civilization. It\nforms the head-quarters of the French national line of steam communi-\ncation with the East, the Messageries Maritimes. The total sea-borne\nexports from French India in 1904 were returned at \u00a31,209,000, of\nwhich \u00a3109,000 was with France, \u00a3113,000 with French colonies, and\nthe remainder with other countries, chiefly British. The imports by sea\nin the same year were valued at \u00a3232,000, of which \u00a3202,000 came\nfrom foreign countries and the remainder from France and her colo-\nnies. The number of ships entering ports in the French Settlements\nin the same year was 413, with an aggregate burden of 683,727 tons.\n\nFrench Rock.\u2014A small rock in Trichinopoly District and Tuluuk,\nMadras, situated in 10\u00b0 49' N. and 78\u00b0 43' E., about a mile to the east\nof Trichinopoly City, and to the north of the Tanjore road at the\npoint where it is crossed by the Uyyakondan channel. It has two\nprominences with a saddle between. In the siege of Trichinopoly by\nChanda S\u0101hib and the French in 1751, the latter occupied the rock and\nmounted on it two 18-pounders; hence its name. The guns were,\nhowever, at too great a distance to make any impression on the walls of\nthe fort. Some time after (April, 1752) the French abandoned for a\ntime all their posts to the south of the Cauvery, except Tiruvaramb\u016br\n(Erumb\u012bswaram). In 1753 Stringer Lawrence pitched his camp a little\nto the south-east of the French Rock, in order to facilitate a junction with the reinforcements expected from Madras. The remains of the redoubt which protected the left of his camp are still to be seen, about 300 yards north of the railway and 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) miles north-east of the Golden (or Sugar-loaf) Rock. After the arrival of these reinforcements the battle of the Sugar-loaf Rock was fought (September 21, 1753), in which the French and Mysore forces were utterly defeated. In the Central jail at Trichinopoly are two old battered guns, one still spiked, which are supposed to have been taken in this fight.\n\n**Fuleli Canal.**\u2014A canal in Sind, Bombay, and one of the largest in India. It used to be fed by a winding channel taking off from the Indus about 9 miles north of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. In 1856 a new mouth at Jamshora, 4 miles from Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, was excavated by Government at a cost of Rs. 1,05,000, and has proved to be the most profitable work in Sind. For about 20 miles south of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d the Fuleli was really a river channel, which flowed back into the Indus; but it was cut off from the river, and extended southwards by Mi\u0101n N\u016br Muhammad Kalhora and the Mirs, to irrigate their lands, and has now become a very large canal. In March, 1900, it was made perennial by the excavation of an escape, which connects it with an old river channel, called the Pur\u0101n, and so carries the excess water to the sea. The result is that the flooding of immense areas at the tail has been stopped, and about 1,000 boats and 5 steam launches ply on it almost continuously throughout the year. The length of the main canal is 98 miles and of its branches 91.4 miles. The maximum discharge, which has been limited on account of breaches in its banks and consequent flooding of large tracts, is 10,000 cubic feet per second; but when another escape is made, it will be possible to admit as much as 12,000 cubic feet.\n\nIn 1903\u20134 the gross revenue was 7\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) lakhs, representing a return of 21.8 per cent. on the capital outlay. If the j\u0101g\u012br land on the canal, which pays only about one-fifth of the ordinary assessment, had paid the full amount, the return on the capital outlay would have been 31.7 per cent. The greatest area cultivated in one year on this canal was 650 square miles in 1900\u20131; but when more scientific means of distribution are provided, this area will be increased.\n\n**Fulta.**\u2014Village in the Twenty-four Parganas District, Bengal. See Falta.\n\n**Fyz\u0101b\u0101d Division (Faiz\u0101b\u0101d).**\u2014Eastern Division of Oudh, United Provinces, lying between 25\u00b0 34\u2032 and 28\u00b0 24\u2032 N. and 85\u00b0 56\u2032 and 85\u00b0 8\u2032 E., with an area of 12,113 square miles. The Division extends from the low hills on the Nep\u0101l frontier to the Ganges, and is bounded on the east by the Gorakhpur and Benares Divisions and on the west by the Lucknow Division. The head-quarters of the Commissioner are\nat Fyz\u0101b\u0101d City. Population is increasing steadily. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1869) 5,905,367, (1881) 6,062,140, (1891) 6,794,272, and (1901) 6,855,991. The density of population, 566 persons per square mile, is considerably above the Provincial average, and the Districts lying between the Gogra and the Ganges are congested. Although third in size in the United Provinces, this Division has the largest population. In 1901 Hindus formed 86 per cent. of the total and Musalm\u0101ns nearly 14 per cent. There were also 2,437 Christians (including 951 natives). The Division contains six Districts, as shown below:\n\n| District       | Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Land revenue and cesses, 1903-4, in thousands of rupees |\n|----------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fyz\u0101b\u0101d        | 1,740                | 1,222,374        | 16,28                                                    |\n| Gond\u0101          | 2,813                | 1,403,195        | 20,47                                                    |\n| Bahraich       | 2,647                | 1,051,347        | 14,34                                                    |\n| Sult\u0101npur      | 1,713                | 1,083,904        | 17,02                                                    |\n| Part\u0101bgarh     | 1,442                | 912,848          | 15,05                                                    |\n| B\u0101ra Bank\u012b     | 1,758                | 1,179,333        | 22,82                                                    |\n| **Total**      | **12,113**           | **6,855,991**    | **195,98**                                                |\n\nBahraich and Gond\u0101 lie north and east of the Kauri\u0101la or Gogra and border on Nep\u0101l. Fyz\u0101b\u0101d and B\u0101ra Bank\u012b are situated along the south bank of the Gogra, and Part\u0101bgarh along the north bank of the Ganges. Sult\u0101npur lies between Fyz\u0101b\u0101d and Part\u0101bgarh. The habitations of the people are scattered in small hamlets; and while the Division contains 13,979 villages, it has only 35 towns. Fyz\u0101b\u0101d with Ajodhy\u0101 (population, 75,085 with cantonment) and Bahraich (27,304) are the only towns with more than 20,000 inhabitants. The chief places of commercial importance are Fyz\u0101b\u0101d, Bahraich, Bel\u0101, Gond\u0101, Naw\u0101ganj (B\u0101ra Bank\u012b), Naw\u0101ganj (Gond\u0101), T\u0101nda, Akbarpur, Jal\u0101mpur, Sult\u0101npur, and B\u0101ra Bank\u012b. Ajodhy\u0101 is to the Hindu one of the most sacred places in India, as it was the capital of Kosala, at which R\u0101ma was born, while the Jains visit it as the birthplace of several of their Tirthankaras or hierarchs. The ruins of Set Mahet are interesting, and the site is identified by some Orientalists with \u015ar\u0101vasti.\n\nFyz\u0101b\u0101d District (Faiz\u0101b\u0101d).\u2014District in the Fyz\u0101b\u0101d Division of the United Provinces, lying between 26\u00b0 9' and 26\u00b0 50' N. and 81\u00b0 41' and 83\u00b0 8' E., south of the Gogra river, with an area of 1,740 square miles. In shape the District is an irregular parallelogram, running from west to east with a slight tendency southwards. It is bounded on the north-east by the Gogra, which divides it from Gonda, Basti, and Gorakhpur; on the south-east and south by Azamgarh and\nSultanpur; and on the west by Bara Banki. The chief river is the Gogra, which flows along the whole northern frontier for a distance of 95 miles, being navigable throughout by large cargo-boats and river steamers. The high banks of the river are about 25 feet above cold-season water-level. While this is the largest river, it receives very little of the drainage of the District. For a short distance at the south-west angle the Gumti forms the boundary. Two small streams, the Marha and Biswi, unite about the centre of the District to form the Tons (Eastern). The Majhoi, Tirwa, Pikiia, Tonri, and Chhoti Sarju are of minor importance. In addition to many isolated jhils or swamps, there are collections of these at two or three places; but Fyzabad contains no lakes of any size.\n\nThe District exposes nothing but alluvium, in which kankar or calcareous limestone occurs both in block form and in nodules.\n\nThe flora presents no peculiarity. The whole area is well wooded, but there is no forest, though patches of dhak jungle (Butea frondosa) occur in many places. Fine mango groves and clumps of bamboos adorn the landscape.\n\nThere are few wild animals. Nilgai are found along the Gogra and in small patches of dhak jungle. Antelope are very scarce. A large herd of domestic cattle has run wild in the lowlands, but the numbers are being reduced by capture. Game-birds, including water-fowl and snipe, are common, and the rivers and tanks contain an abundance of fish.\n\nThe climate is good, though cholera is endemic, and the Ajodhya fairs are frequently sources of epidemics. Extreme heat is unusual, and the mean monthly temperature ranges from about 65\u00b0 to 88\u00b0.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages 41 inches, and it is evenly distributed, though the north receives the heaviest fall. Considerable fluctuations take place from year to year.\n\nThe early history of the District is purely legendary. It is regarded by the Hindus with special veneration as containing Ajodhya, the capital of Kosala, which was the birthplace of Rama.\n\nHistory. Ajodhya is also a place of pilgrimage for the Jains, owing to the birth of several of their saints there. From numismatic evidence it is certain that shortly before the Christian era a line of kings ruled here for some considerable time; but details of the history during the rise and decline of Buddhism, the short but brilliant rule of the Gupta kings, and the rise of the later kingdom of Kanauj, are alike wanting. The first approach to more accurate records is reached in the eleventh century, when the half-mythical raid of Saiyid Salar took place. A portion of the high road is still pointed out along which the country people will not pass after dark, for they say that at night the road is thronged with headless horsemen of Saiyid Salar's army. After\nthe fall of Kanauj, nearly 200 years later, the Musalmans overran Oudh, and Ajodhya became the capital of a province. In the fifteenth century the kings of Jaunpur held the District, and after their fall it lapsed again to Delhi. The Muhammadan historians relate little of interest, though the governorship of Oudh was of some importance. Babar entered the District, and early in Akbar's reign the governor rebelled. In the eighteenth century the importance of Ajodhya increased, as it became the capital of the new line of Nawabs who made Oudh an independent State. Saadat Khan and Safdar Jang spent little time at their head-quarters; but after his defeat at Buxar Shuja-ud-daula made the new town of Fyzabad his permanent residence. Shortly after his death in 1775 the capital was moved to Lucknow, and Fyzabad declined.\n\nThe only important event in the history of the District since the annexation of Oudh in 1859 was the Mutiny of 1857. In the early part of that year the troops in cantonments consisted of the 22nd Bengal Native Infantry, the 6th Irregular Oudh Cavalry, a company of the 7th Bengal Artillery, and a horse battery of light field-guns. The troops revolted on the night of June 8, but the outbreak was not accompanied by the scenes of massacre which occurred at other military stations. The European officers with their wives and families were allowed to leave unmolested; and although some of them were attacked in their flight by mutineers of other regiments, nearly all succeeded after more or less hardship in reaching places of safety. A Muhammadan landholder, Mir Muhammad Husain Khan, sheltered one party in his small fort for several days until the road was open and they could reach Gorakhpur in safety.\n\nAncient mounds exist at many places, but have not been explored. Local tradition ascribes them to the Bhars, but some at least are probably Buddhist. A copperplate grant of Jai Chand and a fragmentary inscription of the same king have been found. Besides the coins of the local rulers referred to above, coins of the Guptas are not uncommon, and an important hoard of silver coins of the sixth or seventh century A.D. was unearthed in 1904. The temples of Ajodhya are chiefly modern. The only Muhammadan buildings of more than local interest are at Ajodhya, Akbarpur, and Fyzabad.\n\nThe District contains 9 towns and 2,661 villages. Its population is increasing. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1869) 1,024,652, (1881) 1,081,419, (1891) 1,216,959, and (1901) 1,225,374. There are four tahsils\u2014Fyzabad, Akbarpur, Bikapur, and Tanda\u2014each named from its head-quarters. The principal towns are the municipalities of Fyzabad with Ajodhya, and Tanda. The table on the next page gives the chief statistics of population in 1901.\nThe figures include 20,407 persons belonging to other Districts, who were enumerated at a fair in Ajodhy\u0101 in 1901. In 1904 pargana Surhurpur, containing two towns and an area of 144 square miles with a population of 100,930, was transferred from T\u0101nd\u0101 to Akbarpur. Nearly 89 per cent. of the total population are Hindus and 11 per cent. Musalm\u0101ns. During the last decade the normal increase of population was arrested by the effects of both excessive rain and drought. This District supplies a considerable number of emigrants to the West Indian colonies and also to Assam. About 70 per cent. of the people speak the Awadhi dialect of Eastern Hindi, and 26 per cent. speak Bih\u0101r\u012b.\n\nCham\u0101rs (tanners and cultivators), 172,000, are the most numerous Hindu caste, forming 16 per cent. of the total. The other castes of importance are Br\u0101hmans, 165,000; Ahirs (graziers and cultivators), 139,000; Kurm\u012bs (agriculturists), 74,000; R\u0101jputs or Chhattris, 68,000; Kewats (cultivators), 41,000; P\u0101s\u012bs (toddy-drawers and cultivators), 39,000; Muraos (market-gardeners), 36,000; Bani\u0101s, 35,000; Koris (weavers), 33,000; and Bhars (labourers), 25,000. The Kurm\u012bs, Kewats, P\u0101s\u012bs, Muraos, and Bhars are chiefly found in the centre and east of the Provinces. Musalm\u0101ns include Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers), 29,000; Shaikhs, 20,000; Path\u0101ns, 14,000; and Belhnas (cotton-carders), 12,000. Agriculture supports 64 per cent. of the total population, and general labour 4 per cent. R\u0101jputs or Chhattris hold more than half of the land.\n\nThere were 341 native Christians in 1901, of whom 141 belonged to the Anglican communion and 113 were Methodists. The Church Missionary Society has laboured in the District since 1862, and the Wesleyan Mission was opened in 1875.\n\nThe District is chiefly situated on the upland above the Gogra; but along the bed of that river lie stretches of alluvial soil, in places producing magnificent spring crops, and in others being merely sand in which tamarisk and grasses are the only vegetation. The natural soils on the upland are sand, loam, and\nclay. Sand is found on the high banks of the Gogra and the other streams, and passes into fertile loam, which stiffens into clay in the swamps and depressions. The heavy clay soil, which covers a large area, produces excellent rice. Owing to the density of population, agriculture has become intensive.\n\nThe ordinary tenures of Oudh are found in Fyzabad. Talukdars own 72 per cent. of the total area. Subordinate tenures are found to a larger extent, both in talukdari estates and in other mahals, than in any other District of Oudh. Thus sub-settlement holders or pukhtadars have rights in about a quarter of the District, and owners of specific plots have rights in an additional 11 per cent. A few of the sub-settled mahals are further sub-settled with a second grade of pukhtadars, and some of these with still a third grade. There are also complex mahals, or revenue units, which extend to a number of villages. The main agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are given below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Fyzabad | 371   | 225        | 99        | 49              |\n| Akbarpur | 393   | 242        | 137       | 60              |\n| Bikapur | 467   | 287        | 143       | 84              |\n| Tanda  | 509   | 330        | 189       | 61              |\n| **Total** | **1,740** | **1,084** | **568**   | **254**         |\n\nRice is the principal food-crop, covering 421 square miles or 39 per cent. of the total. Gram (261), wheat (206), peas and masur (170), barley (93), arhar (64), pulses (52), and kodon (47) are also important. The chief non-food crops are sugar-cane (67 square miles), poppy (22), oilseeds (13), and indigo (9).\n\nThe cultivated area is now about 12 per cent. greater than it was forty years ago, this increase being due mainly to the clearance of the jungle and the breaking up of inferior land which formerly could not be cultivated with profit. The increase has been attended by few changes in methods; but there is a tendency to extend the area under the more valuable crops, such as wheat, sugar-cane, and poppy, and the area double cropped has increased. The cultivation of indigo is not of much importance, but it has maintained its position better than in other Districts. There is a small but constant demand for advances under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists' Loans Acts. During the ten years ending 1900 the total loans amounted to 1.2 lakhs, of which Rs. 70,000 was lent in the famine year, 1897. In the next four years about Rs. 3,000 was advanced annually.\n\nThe cattle bred locally are of an inferior type, and better animals are largely imported. Attempts to improve the breed have failed owing\nto the unsuitability of the bulls. The ponies are also of poor quality. Sheep and goats are kept, but in smaller numbers than in the adjoining Districts.\n\nFyzabad is one of the few Districts in the United Provinces in which the area irrigated from tanks and jhilis in normal years exceeds that supplied from wells. In 1903-4, out of 568 square miles irrigated, tanks and jhilis supplied 289 square miles and wells 264. The proportions vary according to the season, but tank-irrigation is always important. Unfortunately the tanks and jhilis are shallow, and fail in dry seasons when they are most needed, the result being a failure of the rice crop. The number of wells is, however, increasing, and temporary wells can be made in most parts when required. Water is raised by a wheel and pulley from wells, and from jhilis in a swing-basket. It is usually sprinkled over the land with a wooden shovel.\n\nThe chief mineral product is kankar or calcareous limestone, which is used for making lime and for metalling roads. Saline efflorescences are collected in several places, and used for the manufacture of coarse glass for bangles.\n\nThe chief manufacturing industry is cotton-weaving. Coarse cloth is produced in many places; but Tand\u0101, Akbarpur, and Jalalpur are noted for muslins and other fine materials, and during the eighteenth and the early part of the nineteenth century several Europeans had factories at Tand\u0101. Cotton-dyeing and printing are carried on in a few places, and sugar-refining is also of some importance. Many houses are adorned with finely carved doors, but wood-carving is now a declining industry.\n\nThe chief exports are grain (especially rice), sugar, cloth, oilseeds, opium, hides, and tobacco; while the imports include piece-goods, metals, and salt. The recent extension of railways north of the Gogra has affected the trade of Fyzabad, which was formerly a commercial centre for Eastern Oudh. There is still a considerable traffic in sailing boats and in steamers along the Gogra; but the bulk of the trade is carried by rail, and places situated on or near the railway are rising in importance, especially Gosainganj and Akbarpur.\n\nThe loop-line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway from Benares to Lucknow passes through the District. It enters at the south-east and passes north-west to Fyzabad city, from which place it turns west. A branch of the same railway runs south, from Fyzabad to Allahabad. A short length connects Fyzabad with the bank of the Gogra at Ajodhya, opposite which, in Gond\u0101 District, is the terminus of a branch of the Bengal and North-Western Railway. There are 760 miles of road, but only 93 miles are metalled. The latter are in charge of the Public Works department, but the cost of all but 48 miles is charged\nto Local funds. The chief roads are those from Fyz\u0101b\u0101d city to Lucknow, R\u0101e Bareli, Jaunpur, Azamgarh, and Allah\u0101b\u0101d. Avenues of trees are maintained on 193 miles, the fine tamarind avenue on the Lucknow road, which was originally planted in the time of the Naw\u0101bs of Oudh, being specially noticeable.\n\nFyz\u0101b\u0101d suffered severely from famine in 1783-4, and in 1786 further damage was caused by excessive rain. In 1837 there was distress owing to high prices caused by scarcity elsewhere, and in 1860, 1866, and 1874 the lower classes suffered from a similar cause. The scarcity of 1877-8 was more serious, and relief works were opened in 1878. In 1896 the monsoon ceased prematurely, and towards the close of the year relief works and poorhouses were opened. Distress was, however, less felt than elsewhere and ceased with the rains of 1897. Severe floods have done much damage from time to time, especially in 1871, 1894, and 1903.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner is usually assisted by one or two members of the Indian Civil Service, and by four Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. A tahsild\u0101r is stationed at the head-quarters of each tahsil. Two officers of the Opium department reside in the District.\n\nThe ordinary civil courts are those of two District Munsifs and a Subordinate Judge. A system of village Munsifs has recently been introduced. The District and Sessions Judge of Fyz\u0101b\u0101d is also District Judge of B\u0101ra Banki and Sessions Judge of Sult\u0101npur. The District is fairly free from serious crime, even in the cities of Fyz\u0101b\u0101d and Ajodhy\u0101. The kidnapping of girls for marriage to Rajputs and Br\u0101hmans is, however, not uncommon.\n\nThe District of Fyzab\u0101d, as formed at annexation in 1856, included also the northern parts of the present District of Sult\u0101npur as far south as the Gumti. This area was removed in 1869. A summary settlement was made in 1856, followed after the restoration of order by a second summary settlement, which fixed the demand at 8\u00b77 lakhs. The first regular settlement, preceded by a survey, was commenced in 1862. Assessment was mainly based on conjectural data, such as the estimated yield of crops and rates suggested by committees of talukd\u0101rs and zam\u012bnd\u0101rs. Rent-rolls were hardly examined at all, and a very large area of waste land was assessed. The revenue proposed amounted to 12\u00b74 lakhs, and the enhancement was not relieved by being made progressive where it was large. The working of the assessment was affected by bad seasons in 1870 and 1871, and by other causes. Revisions were, therefore, undertaken which were not completed until 1879, by which time many of the defects of the settlement had been remedied. The revised demand was 11\u00b76 lakhs, and was only reached by degrees where exceptionally large enhancements were made. Owing\nto the enormous number of claims to rights in land, the settlement courts had an unusual amount of work. The latest revision, made between 1893 and 1899, was carried out without a complete resurvey and revision of records. The assessment was made on the basis of recorded rents, corrected where necessary. The revenue fixed was 14.6 lakhs, representing 44 per cent. of the estimated net 'assets.' The incidence is Rs. 1.2 per acre, varying from Rs. 1.1 to Rs. 1.3 in different parganas. Enhancements were largely made progressive, and the full demand will not be in force till 1910.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and total revenue have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|        | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue | 11.13  | 11.27  | 13.53  | 14.02  |\n| Total revenue | 13.77  | 17.87  | 21.42  | 23.79  |\n\nThere are two municipalities, Fyz\u0101b\u0101d with Ajodh\u0101 and T\u0101nd\u0101, and eight towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. Beyond the limits of these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which in 1903-4 had an income and expenditure of 1.3 lakhs. About half of the income is derived from local rates, and the expenditure includes Rs. 58,000 on roads and buildings.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police has under him a force of 4 inspectors, 112 subordinate officers, and 427 constables, distributed in 16 police stations, besides 208 municipal and town police, and 2,229 rural and road police. The District jail contained a daily average of 396 prisoners in 1903.\n\nA high proportion of the population of Fyz\u0101b\u0101d is literate, and 4.1 per cent. (6.3 males and 0.2 females) could read and write in 1901. The number of public institutions increased from 97 with 3,941 pupils in 1880-1 to 150 with 9,351 pupils in 1900-1. In 1903-4 there were 198 public schools with 11,314 pupils, of whom 282 were girls, besides 75 private schools with 1,273 pupils. Only 1,648 of the pupils had advanced beyond the primary stage. Government manages 3 of the schools and the District and municipal boards manage 99. The total expenditure on education was Rs. 55,000, of which Rs. 38,000 was provided from Local funds and Rs. 11,000 by fees.\n\nThere are 11 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 160 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 75,000, including 1,982 in patients, and 6,673 operations were performed. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 16,000, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nAbout 33,000 persons were vaccinated in 1903-4, representing the low proportion of 27 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipalities and in the cantonment of Fyz\u0101b\u0101d.\nFYZ\u0100B\u0100D CITY\n\n[H. F. House, Settlement Report (1900); H. R. Nevill, District Gazetteer (1905).]\n\nFyz\u0101b\u0101d Tahsil.\u2014North-western tahsil of Fyz\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Mangalsi, Haveli Awadh, and Amsin, and lying between 26\u00b0 32' and 26\u00b0 50' N. and 81\u00b0 48' and 82\u00b0 29' E., along the right bank of the Gogra, with an area of 371 square miles. Population increased from 316,586 in 1891 to 334,327 in 1901; but the apparent increase was due to a large concourse of pilgrims at a fair. Excluding these, the population in 1901 was 313,920. There are 449 villages and four towns, including Fyz\u0101b\u0101d City (population, 75,085), the District and tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,93,000, and for cesses Rs. 49,000. The high density of population, 846 persons per square mile, is due to the inclusion of the city. The tahsil is a long and narrow strip of land lying above the Gogra, with rich alluvial deposits in the bed of the river. The uplands are generally fertile near the high bank, but towards the south heavy clay soil is found, with patches of dh\u0101k jungle (Butea frondosa) and many swamps. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 225 square miles, of which 99 were irrigated, tanks or jh\u016bls supplying rather more than wells in ordinary years.\n\nFyz\u0101b\u0101d City (Faiz\u0101b\u0101d).\u2014Administrative head-quarters, with cantonment, of Fyz\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 47' N. and 82\u00b0 10' E., near the Gogra, on roads from Lucknow and Allahabad, and at the junction of three branches of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway; distance by rail from Calcutta 599 miles, and from Bombay 965. Population, including cantonment and Ajodhy\u0101: (1881) 71,405, (1891), 78,921, and (1901) 75,085. The population in 1901 included 55,406 Hindus and 17,674 Musalmans. Fyz\u0101b\u0101d alone contained 53,501 inhabitants, of whom 6,097 resided in the cantonment.\n\nWhen Sa\u0101dat Kh\u0101n was appointed governor of Oudh he built a hunting lodge 4 miles west of Ajodhy\u0101, then the head-quarters of the province. Gardens were laid out and shops sprang up in the neighbourhood, and during the time of his successor Safdar Jang the name Faiz\u0101b\u0101d was first applied. Shuj\u0101-ud-daula, the third Naw\u0101b, lived chiefly at Lucknow during the early part of his reign; but after his defeat at Buxar in 1764 he made Fyz\u0101b\u0101d his residence, and during the remainder of his life added largely to its defences and also laid out a large town. Shuj\u0101-ud-daula died early in 1775, and before the close of the year Asaf-ud-daula moved permanently to Lucknow. The importance of Fyz\u0101b\u0101d declined, but it still remained the home of Asaf-ud-daula's grandmother and mother, the Naw\u0101b Begam and Bah\u016b Begam, whose treatment was the subject of charges against Warren Hastings. After the death of the Bah\u016b Begam in 1816 Fyz\u0101b\u0101d decayed still farther, but its position has improved since annexation.\nThe cantonment lies north west of the city, extending to the bank of the Gogra, along which stretches a beautiful park containing some temples at a place known as the Gupt\u0101r Gh\u0101\u1e6d. South of the cantonment is the civil station, which contains the usual offices of the headquarters of a Division, and a fine building used as a museum and public library. There are also male and female dispensaries, and the chief stations of the Church Missionary Society, the Wesleyan Mission, and the Zan\u0101na Bible and Medical Mission. The city is a well-kept place, with fairly wide roads. Most of the large buildings date from the time of Shuj\u0101-ud-daula, and are of brick covered with plaster. Two fine gateways give access to a beautiful garden known as the Gul\u0101b-b\u0101r\u012b. In the centre of this is a lofty and handsome building which was constructed by Shuj\u0101-ud-daula and in which he lies buried. The tomb of the Bah\u016b Begam is a fine domed building lying south of the town. Three lakhs of rupees from the Begam\u2019s property were set aside for the construction of the tomb, and provision was made for its maintenance. The tomb was not completed till after the Mutiny, and its maintenance and the disbursement of the proceeds of the endowment are now supervised by the Deputy-Commissioner. The earthwork of the fort, called Chhota (\u2018the lesser\u2019) Calcutta, constructed by Shuj\u0101-ud-daula, still remains, and portions of the various palaces built by the Naw\u0101bs and their nobles have survived.\n\nFyz\u0101b\u0101d is administered jointly with Ajodhy\u0101 as a municipality, the introduction of local self-government dating from 1865. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 75,000 and Rs. 74,000 respectively. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 88,000, octroi (Rs. 65,000) being the chief item; and the expenditure was Rs. 83,000, including conservancy (Rs. 21,000), public safety (Rs. 11,000), public works (Rs. 16,000), and administration and collection (Rs. 8,000). A large scheme for drainage works has recently been sanctioned. The cantonment is usually garrisoned by British infantry and artillery and Native cavalry and infantry. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure of the cantonment fund averaged about Rs. 10,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 22,000, and the expenditure Rs. 30,000.\n\nThe city is an important centre of the sugar-refining industry, and has a considerable trade in agricultural produce and imported goods, partly carried by river, but chiefly by rail. There are 16 schools for boys, attended by 1,200 pupils, and 4 schools for girls with 162.\n\nFyz\u0101b\u0101d.\u2014Town in Badakhsh\u0101n, Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n. See Faiz\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nG\u0101bat.\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nGadag T\u0101luka.\u2014Eastern t\u0101luka of Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District, Bombay, lying between 15\u00b0 2\u2032 and 15\u00b0 38\u2032 N. and 75\u00b0 26\u2032 and 75\u00b0 57\u2032 E., with an area of 699 square miles. It includes the petty subdivision (p\u0113tha)\nof Mundargi. There are two towns, Gadag (population, 30,652), the head-quarters, and Mulgund (7,523); and 98 villages, including Kurrikoti (5,247). The population in 1901 was 137,573, compared with 124,713 in 1891. The density, 197 persons per square mile, is much below the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 2.73 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 20,000. In the south the village sites are small and lie close together, but they become more scattered in other parts. The chief hills are the Kappat range. They are of strongly iron-charged clay slate, which in the west shows traces of gold. The climate is temperate and healthy. The Dambal tanks, made at a cost of Rs. 64,000, irrigate 40 square miles in the District. The annual rainfall averages about 25 inches.\n\nGadag Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District, Bombay, situated in 15\u00b0 25' N. and 75\u00b0 38' E., on the Southern Mahratta Railway. Population (1901), 30,652. Hindus number 23,297, Muhammadans 6,213, and Christians 933. Gadag with Bettigeri was constituted a municipality in 1859. During the decade ending 1901 the income averaged Rs. 33,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 47,000. Gadag is a flourishing town with a considerable trade in raw cotton and cotton and silk fabrics, and contains a cotton spinning-mill with 14,000 spindles and 9 cotton-ginning factories. The mill, owned by a private company, annually produces about 1,000,000 pounds of yarn valued at 5 lakhs, and employs daily an average of 444 hands. Gadag has the remains of some of the most richly carved temples in the District. The chief of these are dedicated to Trikuteshwar, Saraswati, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47, Someshwar, and R\u0101meshwar. Inscriptions in some of these describe Gadag under the name of Kratuka; and it appears from them that the town was at different times under the Western Ch\u0101lukya (973-1170), Kal\u0101churi (1161-83), Hoysala Ball\u0101l (1047-1310), Deogiri V\u0101dava (1170-1310), and Vijayanagar kings (1336-1565). About 1673 Gadag was included with Nusrat\u0101b\u0101d or Dh\u0101rw\u0101r as one of the chief districts of the Bank\u0101pur sark\u0101r. In 1818 General Munro invested Gadag. The town contains a Subordinate Judge's court, two dispensaries (of which one belongs to the railway company), a school for European and Eurasian girls, a municipal middle school, and 8 other schools.\n\nG\u0101darw\u0101ra Tahsil.\u2014Western tahsil of Narsinghpur District, Central Provinces, lying between 22\u00b0 38' and 23\u00b0 15' N. and 78\u00b0 27' and 79\u00b0 4' E., with an area of 870 square miles. The population in 1901 was 165,213, compared with 194,225 in 1891. The density is 190 persons per square mile. The tahsil contains one town, G\u0101darw\u0101ra (population, 8,198), the head quarters; and 430 inhabited villages. Excluding 63 square miles of Government forest, 69 per cent. of the available area is occupied for cultivation. The cultivated area in 1903-4 was 515\nsquare miles. The demand for land revenue in the same year was Rs. 3,03,000, and for cesses Rs. 27,000. The tahsil occupies a tract in the Narbad\u0101 valley, consisting of a fertile plain of black soil, cut up into ravines near the river and flanked by a narrow belt of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 hill country.\n\nG\u0101darw\u0101ra Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Narsinghpur District, Central Provinces, situated in 22\u00b0 55' N. and 78\u00b0 48' E., on the left bank of the Shakkar and on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway to Jubbulpore, 536 miles from Bombay. The town was the capital of the District in the time of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. Population (1901), 8,198. G\u0101darw\u0101ra was created a municipality in 1867. The municipal receipts during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 19,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 33,000, derived principally from octroi. G\u0101darw\u0101ra is the largest exporting station in the District for the local products of gh\u012b and grain. Various handicrafts, such as weaving, dyeing, shoe-making, and pottery, are also carried on in the town, but are in a depressed condition. A cotton-ginning factory has recently been erected with a capital of Rs. 32,000, which disposed of cotton to the value of a lakh of rupees in 1902-3. G\u0101darw\u0101ra contains an English middle school and a dispensary.\n\nGad Boriad.\u2014Petty State in Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nGadhada.\u2014Town in the State of Bhaunagar, K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay, 42 miles from Bhaunagar town. Population (1901), 5,375. This is one of the principal centres of the sect of Sw\u0101mi N\u0101r\u0101yan, founded in 1804 by a Hindu reformer, Sahaj\u0101nand, from the United Provinces (see Chh\u0101pia), who died here in 1830 after converting many of the K\u0101th\u012bs, Kolis, and Bh\u012bls. Necklaces of sandal-wood beads worn by followers of the sect are made in considerable quantities. The sect possesses a fine temple at Gadhada. The town is the head-quarters of the revenue officer, and the criminal court of the Gadhada district is held here.\n\nGadh\u0101li.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nGadhia.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nGad-Hinglaj.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Kolhapur State, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 12' N. and 74\u00b0 25' E., on the left bank of the Hiranyakeshi river, close to the Sankeshwar-Parpoli pass road, 45 miles south-east of Kolhapur city. Population (1901), 6,373. About three hundred years ago, want of water is said to have forced the people to move the town to the river bank from an older site about 4,600 feet to the north-west. Every Sunday a market is held, when large quantities of rice and other grain are brought for sale. The chief temple in honour of K\u0101leshwar in the centre of the town is built of rubble and mortar. About three miles north of Gad-Hinglaj is a temple of Bahini, where every March a fair is held, attended by about 2,000 people.\nGadhka.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nGadhoola.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nGadw\u0101l Samasth\u0101n (or Keshavnagar). A samasth\u0101n or tributary estate in the east of Raich\u016br District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. It contains one town, Gadw\u0101l (population, 10,195), and 214 villages, and has an area of 864 square miles, with a population (1901) of 968,491. The total revenue is 3 lakhs, and the tribute paid to the Niz\u0101m is Rs. 86,840. Gadw\u0101l existed long before the foundation of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. It formerly issued its own coin, which is still current in Raich\u016br District. Nothing is known regarding the early history of the samasth\u0101n. The fort at Gadw\u0101l town, the residence of the present R\u0101j\u0101, was commenced about 1703, and completed in 1710 by R\u0101j\u0101 Somt\u0101dari. The present R\u0101j\u0101 is a minor, and the estate has been under the control of the Court of Wards since 1902. The Kistna and Tungabhadra water the northern and southern portions of the samasth\u0101n, and the land bordering on these rivers, being alluvial, is very fertile. The remaining portion consists of masab land and uncultivable waste. Most of the cultivation is of the \u2018dry-crop\u2019 description. There being very few tanks, little \u2018wet\u2019 cultivation is possible, and well-irrigation is carried on only to a limited extent. Silk s\u0101ris, scarfs, turbans, and dhotis with gold borders of a superior kind are manufactured at Gadw\u0101l town. Ten factories are at work, and about 2 lakhs\u2019 worth of these articles is exported annually to Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, Secunder\u0101b\u0101d, Raich\u016br, and other places in the neighbourhood.\n\nGadw\u0101l Town. Head-quarters of the samasth\u0101n of the same name in Raich\u016br District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 16\u00b0 14\u2032 N. and 77\u00b0 13\u2032 E., 35 miles east of Raich\u016br town. Population (1901), 10,195.\n\nGagar.\u2014A range of mountains in N\u0101imi T\u0101l and Almor\u0101 Districts, United Provinces, forming a portion of the Outer Him\u0101layan range, lying between 29\u00b0 14\u2032 and 29\u00b0 30\u2032 N. and 79\u00b0 7\u2032 and 79\u00b0 37\u2032 E. This range is also known as G\u0101rgachal, from the legend that the rishi G\u0101rg once dwelt on it. The chain runs along the southern border of the two Districts, parallel to the plains, from the Kosi river to the K\u0101li, and presents a line of higher elevation than any ranges between it and the main ridge of the Central Him\u0101layas. The loftiest peak is Badh\u0101ntola, 8,612 feet, while the steep cliff of Ch\u012bn\u0101, which towers above the lake and town of N\u0101imi T\u0101l, reaches a height of 8,568 feet. The average elevation is from 6,000 to 8,000 feet. Forests of cypress, t\u016bn (Cedrela Toona), fir, and other timber trees clothe the steep hillsides, except where they have been cleared for potato cultivation.\n\nG\u0101graun.\u2014Fort and village in the Kanw\u0101s district of the State of Kotah, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 24\u00b0 38\u2032 N. and 76\u00b0 12\u2032 E., at the junction of the Ahu and K\u0101li Sind rivers, about 2\u00bd miles north-east of the chhaoni of Jh\u0101lap\u0101tan and 45 miles south-east of Kotah city.\nThe fort, which is one of the strongest in Rajputana, is said to have been built by the Dor or Doda Rajputs, who held it till about the end of the twelfth century, when they were dispossessed by the Khichi Chauhans. The latter, under their Raja, Jet Singh, successfully resisted a siege by Al\u00e2-ud-din in 1300; but in the time of R\u00e2ja Achaldas (about 1428) the place was either taken by, or surrendered to, Hoshang Shah of Malwa. In 1519 one Bh\u00eem Karan is mentioned by the Musalm\u00e2n historians as being in possession, but he was attacked by Mahm\u00fbd Khilji, and was taken prisoner and put to death. Shortly after this Mahm\u00fbd was defeated by R\u00e2na Sangram Singh of Mewar, and the Rajputs continued to hold Gagraun till 1532, when Bahadur Shah of Gujar\u00e2t took the place. About thirty years later, Akbar, on his way to Malwa, reached the fort, and gave orders for its reduction, but the commandant hastened to surrender and presented his tribute, which greatly pleased the emperor. In the Ain-i-Akbari Gagraun is mentioned as one of the sarkars or districts of the S\u00fbbah or province of Malwa; and it remained in the possession of the Mughals till the beginning of the eighteenth century, when Mah\u00e2rao Bhim Singh of Kotah obtained it by grant from the emperor. Subsequently the fort was repaired, strengthened, and added to by the regent Z\u00e2lim Singh.\n\nThe fort is separated from the village by a strong high wall, and by a deep ditch cut in the solid rock and crossed by a stone bridge. The principal entrance is from the village; and, after crossing the ditch, the passage lies between two large bastions, without any gateway, ascending with high walls on either side till the great gate is reached. Inside the fort, the path skirts a large excavation in the rock, intended to hold water but often quite dry, and then zigzags into the inner work through a large gateway. The exit is to the south-east by a simple doorway in the wall, from which a descent leads to the end wall immediately over the river. Hence there is a path which, going back towards the village but outside the citadel, crosses a small precipice protected by ramparts 60 or 70 feet above the ground, and leads to the two bastions already mentioned. On the north-east face there is but one wall, the precipitous nature of the hill here rendering a second and lower wall unnecessary. The hills and valleys to the north across the K\u00e2li Sind are thickly wooded, and the gorge by which that river finds its way out into the open plains is very fine, high precipices alternating with wooded slopes on either side. One precipice, absolutely vertical, has been plumbed and found to be 307 feet in height. It is known as the Gidh-kurai or 'vulture's cliff,' and, it is said, was formerly used as a place of execution by the Kotah chiefs, the victims being hurled on to the rocks below. The tops of these ridges are the culminating points of the range, the slope to the open country beyond being gradual. Wild animals abound, and the parrots are celebrated for their beauty and\nthe comparative ease with which they can be taught to imitate the human voice. The village is believed to be very ancient, and to have been called Garg\u0101s\u0101shtar, after Garg\u0101ch\u0101ri, the purohit of Sri Krishna, who lived here; others identify it with the Gargar\u0101tpur of ancient writings from which the Hindu astronomer Garga calculated longitude. The Kotah Darb\u0101r formerly had a mint here, but it was abolished many years ago. The population has greatly decreased since the time when the place was an important military outpost, and in 1901 numbered only 601.\n\nAbout 11 miles to the south-east is the village of Mau, once a large town which Tod called the first capital of the Kh\u012bch\u012bs, and which, in General Cunningham's opinion, probably 'succeeded Chandr\u0101vati as the capital of all the country on the lower course of the K\u0101li Sind shortly after the beginning of the thirteenth century.' The remains of the old town extend for a quarter of a mile from east to west, and about the same distance from north to south. To the west is a large ruined palace attributed locally to the great Prithw\u012b R\u0101j Chauh\u0101n, but this assignment is most completely refuted by its cusped Muhammadan arches and by a N\u0101gar\u012b inscription over the entrance which gives the date as A.D. 1711.\n\n[Archaeological Survey of Northern India, vol. ii.]\n\nGaib\u0101nda Subdivision.\u2014South-eastern subdivision of Rangpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 25\u00b0 3' and 25\u00b0 39' N. and 89\u00b0 12' and 89\u00b0 42' E., along the right bank of the Brahmaputra, with an area of 762 square miles. The subdivision is a flat unbroken plain, containing numerous jhils and marshes. The population in 1901 was 520,184, compared with 463,601 in 1891, and the density was 683 persons per square mile. This is the most progressive part of the District, the population having increased by 12.2 per cent. during the last decade, owing to the opening of the Brahmaputra-Sult\u0101npur Branch Railway and to the extension of jute cultivation, which has attracted settlers from the unhealthy north-western th\u0101nas, and also from P\u0101bna and Mymensingh. Gaib\u0101nda (1,635), the headquarters, is the only town, and there are 1,427 villages.\n\nGaib\u0101nda Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Rangpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 25\u00b0 21' N. and 89\u00b0 34' E., on the Gh\u0101gh\u0101t river. Population (1901), 1,635. The town contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for 18 prisoners.\n\nGaigh\u0101ta Bakshi Kh\u0101l.\u2014An improved natural waterway, 7\u00bd miles in length, forming a connecting link between the D\u0101modar and R\u016bp n\u0101r\u0101yan rivers in the Howrah District of Bengal. The channel was taken over by the Irrigation department from the District board of Howrah in 1894, and no capital account is kept. The right of col-\nleeting tolls was leased out for the five years ending March, 1901, at an annual rental of Rs. 4,500, and the lease has since been renewed for another five years on the same terms. The expenditure in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 5,38 and the receipts to Rs. 2,300.\n\nGajapatinagaram.\u2014Tahsil in Vizagapatam District, Madras, lying near the Gh\u0101ts, between 18\u00b0 1' and 18\u00b0 30' N. and 83\u00b0 3' and 83\u00b0 32' E., with an area of 333 square miles. The population in 1901 was 134,553, compared with 124,057 in 1891. The tahsil contains 228 villages, the head-quarters being at the village of the same name. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 was Rs. 14,600.\n\nGajendragarh.\u2014Town in the Ron taluka of Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District, Bombay, situated in 15\u00b0 44' N. and 75\u00b0 58' E., 51 miles south-east of Kal\u0101dg\u012b. Population (1901), 8,853. The town contains five schools, including one for girls.\n\nG\u0101lna.\u2014Fort in the M\u0101legaon taluka of N\u0101sik District, Bombay, situated in 20\u00b0 46' N. and 74\u00b0 32' E. It is built on a circular detached hill, with fairly flat top affording an area of 20 or 30 acres. The top is 2,316 feet above mean sea-level, or about 800 feet above the plain, and is accessible only by a broad flight of steps cut into the northern face. These steps cross the hill from east to west, and then, reversing the line, climb again to the eastward, and pass under four gateways. The upper walls are perfect and contain magazines of various sizes in each of the bastions, which are semicircles and must have commanded the approach in every direction on the south and west, while the face of the hill being almost perpendicular for nearly 1,000 feet below the wall, the lines are as straight as the outlines of the rock allow, and have been defended by large wall pieces, which were moved on iron pivots; many of these may still be seen on the round bastions at every 80 or 100 yards on the west and north faces. The south side of the hill is a bare scarp for many feet from the wall; and, at about two-thirds of the length from the east, there is a bastion in which are arches of Saracenic form, between the central two of which was a slab containing a Persian inscription dated 1569. There was a second slab in a niche between the battlements, fronting the north and surmounting a row of cellars furnished with moderate-sized windows and probably intended for residences. This slab contained a Devan\u0101gar\u012b inscription dated A.D. 1580. Other antiquities include the idols of G\u0101lneshwar Mah\u0101deo, five cisterns, a series of rock-cut caves, and a handsome mosque. Close to the mosque are the ruins of a palace called the Rang Mahal or 'pleasure palace.' The view from G\u0101lna is magnificent.\n\nG\u0101lna was an important place from the end of the fifteenth century, being held alternately by Musalm\u0101ns and Mar\u0101th\u0101s. In 1634 Muhammad Kh\u0101n, the Musalm\u0101n commandant of G\u0101lna, intended to deliver the fort to Sh\u0101hji, who had possessed himself of N\u0101sik, Trimbak, Sangam-\nner, and Junnar as far as the country of the Konkan. But after promises of imperial favour and of a great reward, Muhammad Kh\u0101n delivered the fort to the representative of the emperor. In 1679 Sivaji plundered G\u0101lna, and in the wars between the Mar\u0101th\u0101s and the Mughals, at the close of the seventeenth century, the fort more than once changed hands. It was attacked by Aurangzeb in 1704 and taken after a long siege in 1705. In December, 1804, after a slight resistance, G\u0101lna was taken by Colonel Wallace. In March, 1818, it was evacuated by the commandant and garrison, and occupied by a company of Native infantry. In 1862 it was found to be ruinous. G\u0101lna fort seems at one time to have been used as a sanitarium for Dh\u016blia. There are the ruins of one or two houses on the top, and the tomb of a young European officer who is said to have committed suicide from grief at having killed an old woman while he was shooting bears. There are also seven Musalm\u0101n tombs. Immediately below and to the north-east of the fort lies the village of G\u0101lna. It appears to have been of great size and importance, and was protected by a double line of defences, traces of which remain. The present population of the village is about 500, including some well-to-do money-lenders. For a few years after 1818 a mamlatd\u0101r held his office in G\u0101lna village.\n\nGamanpura.\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b Kant\u0101ha, Bombay.\n\nGandak, Great.\u2014A river of Northern India. Rising in the central mountain basin of Nep\u0101l, in 27\u00b0 27' N. and 83\u00b0 56' E., where its sources are known as the Sapt Gandak\u012b, or 'country of the seven Gandaks,' it drains the tract between the Dhaul\u0101giri and Gosainthan mountains. The most important of these contributory streams is the Tris\u016blgang\u0101, and they all unite before breaking through the mountains at Tribeni. The river is also known in Nep\u0101l as the S\u0101lgr\u0101mi, and in the United Provinces as the N\u0101rayani; it is the Kondochates of the Greek geographers, and according to Lassen the S\u0101l\u0101nira ('ever-flowing') of the epics. Crossing the British frontier at Tribeni, it forms the boundary between Champ\u0101ran District of Bengal and Gorakhpur District of the United Provinces for about 20 miles, after which it flows for 40 miles within Champ\u0101ran, and then once more separates the Provinces for 12 miles of its course. Thenceforward it forms the boundary between S\u012bran District of Bengal on the southwest and Champ\u0101ran and Muzaffarpur Districts on the north-east, and it finally joins the Ganges opposite Patna, in 25\u00b0 41' N. and 85\u00b0 12' E., after a course of 192 miles. At first a snow-fed torrent, the Gandak, soon after its entry into British territory, acquires the character of a deltaic river, its banks being above the level of the surrounding country, which is protected by embankments from inundation. The river is navigable throughout the year by country boats below Bagah\u0101 in Champ\u0101ran District. Rafts of timber pass\ndown it from Nep\u0101l and from the Gorakhpur forests, and grain and sugar are exported by the same route. Navigation is, however, difficult, as the channel during the dry season is narrow and winding, while in the rains it becomes a torrent. In the hot season the river is rarely more than a quarter of a mile across, but in the rains it widens to 2 or 3 miles. It is nowhere fordable, and is continually changing its course. The Tribeni Canal, now under construction, will carry its waters eastward to within 10 miles of Ad\u0101pur in Champ\u0101ran District, and will irrigate the portion of that District most liable to famine. The S\u0101ran Canals are fed from a side-channel on the right bank of the river. The B\u016brhi ('old') Gandak, or Sikr\u0101na, an old channel of the river, is described in the article on Champ\u0101ran District. A fine railway bridge on the Bengal and North-Western Railway spans the Gandak near its mouth. The most important place on its bank is H\u0101jipur on the left bank, and a great bathing festival takes place annually at Sonpur at its confluence with the Ganges.\n\nGandak, Little.\u2014A river which rises in the lower Nep\u0101l hills, and enters Gorakhpur District of the United Provinces a few miles west of the Great Gandak. It flows from north to south through the whole length of Gorakhpur, and joins the Gogra just within S\u0101ran District of Bengal. Except in the rains it has a small stream, not exceeding 60 feet in breadth, and is generally fordable. In 1859 it was proposed to turn it into a navigable canal, but the scheme was never carried out. Boats ply during the rains as high as Ragarganj in the Padraun\u0101 tahsil.\n\nGandevi.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in Navs\u0101ri prant, Baroda State, situated in 20\u00b0 49' N. and 73\u00b0 2' E., 3 miles from Amalsar on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, and 28 miles south-east of Surat. Population (1901), 5,927. The town possesses a magistrate's court, a dispensary, a high school aided by the State, vernacular schools, and public offices. A municipality, constituted in 1905, receives an allotment of Rs. 3,500 from customs, excise, and tolls. There is a considerable trade in grain, molasses, ghi, and castor-oil. A large sugar factory, which was worked for some time by the State, has now been purchased by a private firm. The chief industry is hand-loom weaving.\n\nGandh\u0101ra (the Gandaria of the Greeks).\u2014The ancient name for the tract on the north-west frontier of India which comprised the whole lower valley of the K\u0101bul river, the ancient Kophene or Kubh\u0101, from the Kau or Aling\u0101r river near 70\u00b0 E. to the Indus, and from the Safed Koh and Koh\u0101t range on the south to the borders of the Sw\u0101t valley on the north. It thus included the modern District of Pesh\u0101war, with part of Koh\u0101t, the Mohmand country, Sw\u0101t, B\u0101jaur, and Buner, and\nat one period even embraced within its limits the great city of Takshasil\u0101, east of the Indus. Its length was 170 miles from west to east at its greatest, and 100 miles from north to south. Its people were known to Herodotus, Hekataeus, Ptolemy, and Strabo as Gandarioi or Gandarae, and furnished a contingent to Darius in his invasion of Greece. Gandh\u0101ra was included in the Arachosian satrapy of the Achaemenid kings of Persia. At different times Pushkalavati (the Peukelaotis of the Greeks), Purushapura (Pesh\u0101war), and Udabh\u0101ndapura (Uxnu) formed its capital. The province between the Sw\u0101t and Indus rivers, corresponding to the modern Y\u016bsufzai country, was known as Udy\u0101na or Ujj\u0101na, and to the Greeks as Suastene. At times it formed a separate principality. Gandh\u0101ra was a great seat of the Buddhist religion and Graeco-Bactrian culture in the centuries after Alexander's invasion until about A.D. 515, when Mihirakula, the Hun, overran Udy\u0101na and Kashmir and oppressed the Buddhists. Of the Chinese pilgrims who visited Gandh\u0101ra, Fa Hian found (c. 404) 500 monasteries and the people devoted to the Buddhist faith; in the seventh century Hiuen Tsiang laments its decline; while fully 100 years later (757\u201364) U-Kong still found 300 monasteries and princes who were zealous patrons of the monks. Gandh\u0101ra has given its name to the Graeco-Buddhist sculpture found so abundantly in this region.\n\nGandhol.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nGandikota (\"Gorge-fort\").\u2014Ancient fortress in the Jammalamadugu taluk of Cuddapah District, Madras, perched on a hill overlooking the gorge of the Penner river, 1,670 feet above the sea, in 14\u00b0 47' N. and 78\u00b0 16' E.\n\nThis narrow and deep gorge is the finest river pass in the District, and indeed in Southern India, with the exception of the wild bed of the Kistna where that river cuts its way through the Nallamalais between Kurnool District and the Niz\u0101m's Dominions. For a mile or more the Penner rushes through a gap barely 200 yards wide, on either side of which rise, sheer from its foaming waters, dark cliffs 200 or 300 feet in height. Those on the right bank are crowned by the Gandikota fort.\n\nAccording to an ancient grant in the fort, a king called Kapa, of Bommanapalle, a village close by, founded the village of Gandikota, and built its fortress. Harihara, the first of the Vijayanagar kings, is said to have constructed a temple in it. According to Firishta, however, the fort was not built until 1589. It was captured by the Golconda Sult\u0101n and held by Mir Jumla; later, it was the capital of one of the five sark\u0101rs of the Carnatic Bal\u0101gh\u0101t, until it was absorbed by the Path\u0101n Naw\u0101b of Cuddapah. It was here that Fateh Naik, the father of the great Haidar Al\u012b, first distinguished himself. Haidar improved\nand garrisoned the fort, but it was captured by Captain Little in the war with Tip\u00fb in 1791. Properly defended, it should, in the conditions of warfare then existing, have been impregnable. It was always one of the most important strongholds in the Cuddapah country, being the key to the valley of the Penner, and its name occurs frequently in the accounts of the ancient struggles.\n\n**Gang\u0101dhar.**\u2014River in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. *See Sankosh.*\n\n**Gangaikondapuram.**\u2014Village in the Udaiy\u0101rp\u0101laiyam taluk of Trichinopoly District, Madras, situated in 11\u00b0 12' N. and 79\u00b0 28' E., about 6 miles east of Jeyamkondacholapuram, the head-quarters of the taluk, and 1 mile west of the trunk road from Madras to Kumbakonam. It is now an unimportant agricultural village with a population (1901) of only 2,702, but historically and archaeologically it is one of the most interesting places in the District. The name as now spelt means literally the 'city visited by the Ganges,' and is popularly derived from a well in the temple which according to tradition is connected by underground ways with the Ganges. The story is that B\u0101n\u0101sura having been disabled from going to the Ganges for his bath, Siva made the river appear in this well and thus enabled the demon to obtain salvation. The name, however, is quite certainly a contraction of Gangaikondacholapuram, the city founded by Gangaikonda-Chola ('the Chola who conquered the country round the Ganges'), this surname having been borne by R\u0101jendra Chola I. The city, of which the remains still lie scattered in the neighbourhood, was the residence of the Chola kings from R\u0101jendra Chola I to Kulottunga I, A.D. 1011\u20132 to 1118.\n\nThe most prominent object in the ruins is the great temple, which resembles in many respects the famous shrine of Tanjore. Bishop Caldwell thought this latter was probably copied from it; but the present belief is that it was founded by R\u0101j\u0101r\u0101ja, the father of R\u0101jendra Chola I, who was also the founder of the Tanjore temple, and that therefore the two buildings were both erected about the same time. The temple consists of one large enclosure, measuring 584 feet by 372. This was evidently once well fortified by a strong surrounding wall, with a two-storeyed colonnade all round and bastions at each corner. In 1836, however, the bastions were almost entirely destroyed and most of the wall removed, to provide materials for the Lower Anicut across the Coleroon, which was then under construction. The wall is being gradually rebuilt, and there are traces of three bastions, one at each end of the eastern wall and another in the centre of the west wall. The remains of two other bastions in front of the temple are said to be buried in the d\u00e9bris of the gopuram (tower) over the eastern entrance, which is now almost completely in ruins. This gopuram was evidently once a very fine structure, being built entirely of stone except at the\nvery top, whereas in almost every other case all but the lowest storey of such towers consists of brick and plaster. The ruins of six other gopurams are said to have once existed, but there is now no trace of them. The vim\u0101na or shrine in the centre of the courtyard strikes the eye from a great distance. The pyramidal tower above it reaches the great height of 174 feet. All the lower part is covered with inscriptions. They relate chiefly to grants to the temple made in the reigns of Ko R\u0101ja-kesari-varma Udaiy\u0101r, Sri V\u012bra R\u0101jendra Deva, Kulottunga Chola Deva, Kulasekhara Deva, and Vikrama P\u0101ndya Deva. One grant was made by Sundara P\u0101ndya in the second year of his reign, and another inscription, which is imperfect, probably refers to the Vijayanagar dynasty. There were a large number of mantapams (halls) and small buildings all round the inner side of the enclosing wall; but most of these have been pulled down and the materials carried off, and the rest are in ruins. Among them is a round well about 27 feet in diameter, down to which leads a flight of steps surmounted by a figure of a huge dragon (r\u016bpa), put up, as a tablet shows, by the zamindar of Udaiy\u0101rp\u0101laiyam. This dragon is perhaps the most striking figure in the temple precincts. It may be described as a cat-like sphinx. The steps to the well pass between its fore-legs. There is also a bull, much resembling the famous one in the Tanjore temple. It is so placed that, when the doors of the shrine are open, it can contemplate the idol at the end of a long dark corridor. The carving on the vim\u0101na is very fine, and includes all the principal Saivite deities, &c. The boldness and the spirit of the chief figures and the absence of grossness in the representations bring to mind the old Jain temple, said to be of the fifth or sixth century, at Conjeeveram. These two buildings and the celebrated shrine at Tanjore are perhaps the only important instances in the Presidency in which the design culminates in the tower over the central shrine. The architectural superiority of this method of design over the later temples, of which that at Madura may be taken as a type, is obvious.\n\nAbout a mile to the west of the temple an embankment of great strength runs north and south for 16 miles. It is provided with several substantial sluices, and in former times must have formed one of the largest reservoirs in India. This huge tank or lake, called Ponneri, was partly filled by a channel from the Coleroon, upwards of 60 miles in length, which entered it at its southern end; and partly by a smaller channel from the Vell\u0101r, which entered it on the north. Traces of both these still remain. The tank is now in ruins and has been useless for many years, and the bed is almost wholly overgrown with high and thick jungle, except in portions of the foreshore which have been assigned for cultivation. A scheme for the restoration of this gigantic work and for supplying it by a channel from the Upper Anicut across the Cauvery has been recently investigated and abandoned.\nTraces of many ancient buildings still exist round about Gangai-\nkondapuram, and their foundations are often quarried for bricks, some\nof which are 15 inches long by 8 wide and 4 deep. In a quarry now\nopen have been found ashes, bricks, and concrete with burnt iron nails\nimbedded in the mass, showing that the buildings they once formed\nmust have been destroyed by fire. The destruction of the city and\ntank was probably the act of an invading army. Local names still\nindicate the disposition of the several parts of the city: such as M\u0101l\u012bgaimedu, the site of the \u2018royal residence\u2019; Edaikattu, the \u2018middle\nstructure\u2019; Ulkottai, the \u2018hindmost structure\u2019; Yuddhapallam, \u2018battle-\nfield\u2019; Ayudakalavan, \u2018arsenal\u2019; Palliv\u0101dai, the \u2018suburb occupied by\nthe cultivators\u2019; P\u0101kalmedu, \u2018vegetable garden\u2019; Meyk\u0101valteru, the\n\u2018street occupied by k\u0101valg\u0101rs\u2019 (watchmen); Chunn\u0101mbukuli, \u2018lime-\nkilns\u2019; Tottikulam, a \u2018pond where cattle were watered\u2019; Kalanikulam,\na \u2018pond in which rice-washings were allowed to stagnate to be drunk by\nthe cattle\u2019; and Vann\u0101nkuli, the \u2018washerman\u2019s pond.\u2019\n\nGang\u0101kher.\u2014Head-quarters of a j\u0101g\u012br in Parbhani District, Hyder-\n\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 18\u00b0 58\u2032 N. and 76\u00b0 45\u2032 E., on the south bank of\nthe God\u0101vari, 14 miles north-east of Pingli on the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-God\u0101vari\nValley Railway. Population (1901), 5,007. It contains two schools,\na State post office, and a British sub-post office, the police inspector\u2019s\nand sub-registrar\u2019s offices. The gh\u0101t, or steps leading to the river, is\nbuilt of masonry; and during the rains and part of the cold season\na ferry of boats plies across the river.\n\nGang\u0101pur (1).\u2014South-western t\u0101luk of Aurang\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder-\n\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 518 square miles. The population in\n1901, including j\u0101g\u012brs, was 51,413, compared with 59,638 in 1891, the\ndecrease being due to the famines of 1897 and 1899-1900. The t\u0101luk\nhas 190 villages, of which 15 are j\u0101g\u012br, and Gang\u0101pur (population,\n3,122) is the head-quarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 3\u00b72 lakhs.\nRegar is the predominant soil.\n\nGang\u0101pur (2).\u2014Head-quarters of the niz\u0101mat and tahs\u012bl of the same\nname in the State of Jaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 26\u00b0 29\u2032 N. and\n76\u00b0 44\u2032 E., about 70 miles south-east of Jaipur city, and close to the\nKarauli border. Population (1901), 5,155. The town possesses 3\nschools attended by about 200 pupils, and a hospital with accommo-\ndation for 4 in-patients.\n\nGang\u0101pur (3).\u2014Western tahs\u012bl of Benares District, United Provinces,\nincluded in the Benares Estate, conterminous with pargana Kasw\u0101r\nR\u0101j\u0101, and lying between 25\u00b0 10\u2032 and 25\u00b0 24\u2032 N. and 82\u00b0 42\u2032 and 83\u00b0 E.,\nwith an area of 118 square miles. Population fell from 89,934 in 1891\nto 86,703 in 1901. There are 280 villages, but no town. The demand\nfor land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,25,000, and for cesses Rs. 3,000.\nThe density of population, 735 persons per square mile, is high. This\nis a fertile tract lying south of the Barn\u0101 river. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 85 square miles, of which 45 were irrigated.\n\n**Gang\u0101-S\u0101gar.**\u2014Island in the Twenty-four Parganas District, Bengal. See S\u0101gar.\n\n**Gangav\u0101di.**\u2014The territory of the Ganga kings in Mysore, who ruled from the second to the eleventh century. It was a 'ninety-six thousand' province\u00b9, the boundaries of which are given as\u2014north, Marandale (not identified); east, Tondan\u0101d (the Madras country east from Mysore); west, the ocean in the direction of Chera (Cochin and Travancore); south, Kongu (Salem and Coimbatore). The inhabitants of Gangav\u0101di are represented by the existing Gangadik\u0101ras, a contraction of Ganga-v\u0101dik\u0101ras.\n\n**Gangaw Subdivision.** North-western subdivision of Pakokku District, Upper Burma, comprising the Gangaw and Tilin townships.\n\n**Gangaw Township.**\u2014Northernmost township of Pakokku District, Upper Burma, lying between 21\u00b0 49\u2032 and 22\u00b0 50\u2032 N. and 93\u00b0 59\u2032 and 94\u00b0 27\u2032 E., with an area of 698 square miles. It comprises, with the Tilin township, the whole of that part of the District which drains into the Upper Chindwin and is watered by the Myittha. Gangaw is a narrow valley shut in by the Chin Hills on the west and by the Pondaung range on the east, and is to a great extent cut off from the rest of the District. Its population was 22,648 in 1891, and 24,200 in 1901 (including 1,989 Chins), distributed in 118 villages. The headquarters are at Gangaw (population, 1,300), on the Myittha river. The area cultivated in 1903-4 was 22 square miles, and the land revenue and thathameda amounted to Rs. 52,000.\n\n**Gang\u0101wati T\u0101luk.**\u2014T\u0101luk in Raich\u016br District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 517 square miles, including j\u0101girs. The population in 1901 was 65,010, compared with 55,097 in 1891. The t\u0101luk contains one town, Gang\u0101wati (population, 6,245), the head-quarters; and 140 villages, of which 37 are j\u0101gir. The samasth\u0101n of Anegundi, comprising 12 villages with a population of 4,295, is included in this t\u0101luk. The Tungabhadra river separates it from the Madras District of Bellary on the south-east. The land revenue in 1901 was 1\u00b78 lakhs. The soil includes alluvial, black cotton, and sandy varieties. The j\u0101gir t\u0101luk of Koppal, belonging to the S\u0101l\u0101r Jang family, is situated to the west of this t\u0101luk. It has an area of 513 square miles, and a population of 85,033, and 152 villages, besides one town, Koppal (population, 8,903), the head-quarters.\n\n**Gang\u0101wati Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Raich\u016br District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 15\u00b0 26\u2032 N., and\n\n\u00b9 These numerical designations, almost invariably attached to the names of ancient divisions in Mysore, apparently refer to their revenue capacity or to the number of their n\u0101ds.\n76\u00b0 32' E., 5 miles north of Anegundi. Two miles east of it flows the Tungabhadra river. Population (1901), 6,245. The town contains a school, a dispensary, a post office, and two old temples. It is a commercial centre, largely exporting grain and jaggery. A weekly market is held on Sundays.\n\nGanges (Ganga).\u2014The great river of Northern India which carries off the drainage of the Southern Himalayas, and also a smaller volume received from the northern and eastern slopes of the Vindhyas. It rises in the Tehri State, in 30\u00b0 55' N. and 79\u00b0 7' E., where it issues under the name of Bhagirathi from an ice cave at the foot of a Himalayan snow-bed near Gangotri, 13,800 feet above the level of the sea. During its earlier course it receives the Jahnavi from the north-west, and subsequently the Alaknanda, after which the united stream is called Ganges. It pierces the Himalayas at Sukhi, and turns south-west to Hardwar. From this point it flows south and south-east between the Meerut and Rohilkhand Divisions of the United Provinces, and then separates the latter from the Agra Division, and flows through the eastern part of Farrukhabad District. It next forms the south-western boundary of Oudh, and then crosses the Districts of Allahabad, Mirzapur, Benares, and Ghazipur, after which it divides the Districts of Ghazipur and Ballia from Bengal. The Ganges is a considerable river even at Hardwar, where the Upper Ganges Canal starts, and it is tapped again at Naraura for the Lower Ganges Canal. It thus supplies the largest irrigation works in the United Provinces, and is also the source of the water-supply of the cities of Meerut (by a canal), Cawnpore, and Benares. Its chief tributaries are: the Ramganga (Farrukhabad), Jumna and Tons (Allahabad), Gumti (Ghazipur), and Gogra (Ballia), while smaller affluents are the Malin (Bijnor), Burhganga (Meerut), Mahawa (Budaun), Sot or Yar-i-Wafadar (Shahjahanpur), Burhganga and Kali Nadi (Farrukhabad), Isan (Cawnpore), Pandu (Fatehpur), Jirgo (Mirzapur), Barna (Benares), Gangi and Besu (Ghazipur), and Chhoti Sarju (Ballia), which is called the Tons in its upper portion. The principal towns on or near its banks in the United Provinces are: Srinagar (on the Alaknanda), Hardwar, Garhmuktesar, Anupshahr, Soron, Farrukhabad (now left some miles away), Kanauj, Bilhaur, Bithur, Cawnpore, Dalmau, Manikpur, Kara, Allahabad, Sirsa, Mirzapur, Chunar, Benares, Ghazipur, and Ballia.\n\nImpinging on the Shahabad District of Bengal, in 25\u00b0 31' N. and 83\u00b0 52' E., the Ganges forms the boundary of this District, separating it from the United Provinces, till it receives as a tributary the Gogra on the north bank. It shortly afterwards receives another important tributary, the Son, from the south, then passes Patna, and obtains another accession to its volume from the Gandak, which rises in Nepal. Farther to the east, it receives the Kosi, and then, skirting the Rajmahal Hills, turns sharply to the south, passing near the site of the\nruined city of Gaur. About 20 miles farther on, the Ganges begins to branch out over the level country; and this spot marks the commencement of its delta, being 220 miles in a straight line, or nearly 300 by the windings of the river, from the Bay of Bengal. The present main channel, assuming the name of the Padma, proceeds in a south-easterly direction past Pabna to Goalundo, where it is joined by the Jamuna, the main stream of the Brahmaputra. The bed is here several miles wide, and the river is split up into several channels, flowing between constantly shifting sandbanks and islands. During the rains the current is very strong, and even steamers find difficulty in making headway against it. This vast confluence of water rushes towards the sea, joining the great Meghna estuary in $23^\\circ 13' N.$ and $90^\\circ 33' E.$, after the Ganges has had a course of 540 miles in Bengal, and 1,557 miles from its source.\n\nThe Meghna estuary, however, is only the largest and most easterly of a great number of Ganges mouths, among which may be mentioned the Hooghly, Matla, Raimangal, Malancha, and Haringhata. The most westerly and the most important for navigation is the Hooghly, on which stands Calcutta. This receives the water of the three westernmost distributary channels that start from the parent Ganges in Murshidabad District (generally known as the Nadia Rivers, one of which takes again the name of Bhagirathi), and it is to this exit that the sanctity of the river clings. Between the Hooghly on the west and the Meghna on the east lies the Ganges delta. The upper angle of this consists of the Districts of Murshidabad, Nadia, Jessore, and the Twenty-four Parganas. These Districts have for the most part been raised above the level of periodical inundation by the silt deposits of the Ganges and its offshoots; and deltaic conditions now exist only in the eastern Districts of Khulna, Faridpur, and Backergunge, and towards the southern base of the delta, where the country sinks into a series of great swamps, intersected by a network of innumerable channels, and known as the Sundarbans.\n\nIn its course through Bengal, the Ganges rolls majestically down to the sea in a bountiful stream, which never becomes a merely destructive torrent in the rains and never dwindles away in the hottest summer. Embankments are seldom required to restrain its inundations, for the alluvial silt which it spills over its banks, year by year, affords to the fields a top-dressing of inexhaustible fertility. If one crop be drowned by the flood, the cultivator calculates that his second crop will abundantly requite him. In Eastern Bengal, in fact, the periodic inundations of the Ganges and its distributaries render the country immune from the results of a scanty rainfall and make artificial irrigation unnecessary.\n\nUntil some 400 years ago the course of the Ganges, after entering Bengal proper, was by the channel of the Bhagirathi and Hooghly as\nfar as the modern Calcutta, whence it branched south-eastwards to the sea, down what is still known as the Adi Gang\u0101, which corresponds for part of its course with Tolly's Nullah. By degrees this channel silted up and became unequal to its task, and the main stream of the Ganges was thus obliged to seek another outlet. In this way the Ich\u0101mat\u012b, the Jalang\u012b, and the M\u0101t\u0101bh\u0101nga became in turn the main stream. The river tended ever to the east; and at last, aided perhaps by one of the periodic subsidences of the unstable surface of the country, it broke eastwards right across the old drainage channels, until it was met and stopped by the Brahmaputra. Great changes still take place from time to time in the river-bed, and alter the face of the country. Extensive islands are thrown up and attach themselves to the bank; while the river deserts its old bed and seeks a new channel, it may be many miles off. Such changes are so rapid and on so vast a scale, and the eroding power of the current upon the bank is so irresistible, that it is considered perilous to build any structure of a large or permanent character on the margin.\n\nThe junction of two or more rivers, called Pray\u0101g, is usually considered sacred; but that of the Ganges and Jumna at Allah\u0101b\u0101d, where according to popular belief a third river, the Saraswat\u012b, which sinks into the sands at Bhatner in R\u0101jput\u0101na, reappears from its subterranean course, is one of the most holy places in India. Here, on the spit of land below the fort, a large bathing festival is held annually in the month of M\u0101gh (January). Every twelve years the fair is called the Kumbh m\u0113la, as it is held when Jupiter is in Aquarius (kumbh) and the sun in Aries, and the efficacy of bathing is increased, large numbers of pilgrims from every part of India flocking to the junction. At the Kumbh m\u0113la in 1894 the attendance was estimated at a million to a million and a half.\n\nThe holiest places upon the banks of the Ganges in Bengal are Sonpur at its confluence with the Gandak, and S\u0101gar Island at the mouth of the Hooghly. Both places are the scene of annual bathing festivals, which are frequented by thousands of pilgrims from all parts of India. Even at the present day, the six years' pilgrimage from the source of the Ganges to its mouth, and back again, known as pradakshina, is performed by many; and a few fanatical devotees may be seen wearily accomplishing this meritorious penance by measuring their length.\n\nMost rivers in India have sanctity attached to them, but the Ganges is especially sacred. Its importance in Vedic literature is slight, but in the epics and Pur\u0101\u1e47as it receives much attention. S\u0101gar, the thirty-eighth king of the Solar Dynasty, had performed the great horse-sacrifice (Asvamedha) ninety-nine times. In this ceremony the horse wandered over the world, unhaltered and never guided or driven. Every country it entered was conquered by the following army, and on its return it\nwas sacrificed to the gods. When S\u0101gar drove out a horse for the hundredth time, the god Indra stole it and tied it up in P\u0101t\u0101l (the underworld) near the place where a sage, Kapila Muni, was meditating. S\u0101gar had two wives, one of whom bore Asmanjas, and the other had sixty thousand sons who were following the horse. The sons found it, and believing Kapila to be the thief abused him, and were consumed to ashes in consequence of the sage's curse. Ansm\u0101n, son of Asmanjas, had gone in search of his uncles, and finding the horse took it home. Garuda, the mythical half-man, half-bird, king of the snakes, told him that the sin of those who had abused Kapila could best be removed by bringing to earth the Ganges, which then flowed in heaven (Brahm\u0101 Lok). In spite of much prayer and the practice of austerities by Ansm\u0101n and his son, Dalip, this could not be brought about; but Bh\u0101girath, son of Dalip, persuaded Brahm\u0101 to grant him a boon, and he chose the long-sought permission to allow the Ganges to flow on this world. Brahm\u0101 agreed, but told Bh\u0101girath that the earth could not sustain the shock, and advised him to consult Siva, who consented to break the force of the river by allowing it to fall on his head. The ice-cavern beneath the glacier, from which the stream descends, is represented as the tangled hair of Siva. One branch, the Mand\u0101kini, still flows through Brahm\u0101 Lok; a second, which passes through P\u0101t\u0101l, washed away the sin of the sixty thousand; and the third branch is the Ganges.\n\nBesides the places which have already been referred to, Gangotri, near the source, Devapray\u0101g, Garhmuktesar, Soron, Dalmau, and Benares are the principal bathing resorts. The sanctity of the river still exists everywhere, though according to prophecy it should have passed away to the Narbad\u0101 a few years ago. Dying persons are taken to expire on its banks, corpses are carried to be burned there, and the ashes of the dead are brought from long distances to be thrown into its holy stream, in the hope of attaining eternal bliss for the deceased. About the time of the regular festivals the roads to the river are crowded with pilgrims, who keep up an incessant cry of salutation to the great goddess (Gang\u0101 j\u012b k\u012b jai). On their return they carry away bottles of the sacred water to their less fortunate relations.\n\nTill within the last forty years of the nineteenth century, after which the extension of railways provided a quicker means of transport, the magnificent stream of the Ganges formed almost the sole channel of traffic between Upper India and the seaboard, and high masonry landing-places for steamers still exist at Allah\u0101b\u0101d and other places lower down, though they are no longer used. The products of the Gangetic plain, and the cotton of the Central Provinces and Central India, used formerly to be conveyed by this route to Calcutta. At present it is\n\n---\n\n1 A variant of the legend represents the ashes of the sixty thousand as having been purified by the Bh\u0101girathi, a branch of the Ganges.\nchiefly used for the carriage of wood and grain in many parts of its course, and also of oilseeds, saltpetre, stone, and sugar in the eastern portion of the United Provinces. The principal import to these Provinces is rice, but manufactured goods and metals are also carried in considerable quantities. The canal dam at Naraura in Bulandshahr District has stopped through traffic between the upper and lower courses of the Ganges.\n\nIn Bengal, however, the Ganges may yet rank as one of the most-frequented waterways in the world. The downward traffic is most brisk in the rainy season, when the river comes down in flood. During the rest of the year the boats make their way back up stream, often without cargoes, either helped by a favourable wind or laboriously towed along the bank. The most important traffic in Bengal is in food-grains and oilseeds; and, though no complete statistics are available, it appears probable that the actual amount of traffic on the Ganges by native craft has not at all diminished since the opening of the railway, to which the river is not only a rival, but a feeder. Railway stations situated on the banks form centres of collection and distribution for the surrounding country, and fishing villages like Goalundo have by this means been raised into river marts of the first magnitude. Steamer services ply along its whole course within Bengal, and many towns lie on its banks, the most important being Patna and Monghyr.\n\nSix railway bridges cross the Ganges: near Roorkee, at Garhmuktesar (2,332 feet), Rajghat, Cawnpore (2,900 feet), and Benares (3,518 feet), while the sixth, measuring 3,000 feet, was completed near Allahabad in 1905. There is no bridge below Benares, though the construction of a railway bridge near Sara Gh\u00e2t in Bengal is contemplated. The normal flood discharge varies from 207,000 cubic feet per second at Hardwar, where the bed is steep and only 2,500 feet wide, to 300,000 at Garhmuktesar and 150,000 at Naraura (width at canal weir and about a mile above it, 3,880 feet). The bridge at Allahabad is designed to allow the discharge of a million cubic feet per second. The normal flood-level falls from 942 feet above the sea at Hardwar to 287 at Allahabad.\n\nGanges Canal, Lower.\u2014An important irrigation work designed to water the southern and eastern portion of the Doab in the United Provinces. The canal owes its origin to the recommendations of the committee appointed in 1866 to examine the various projects for improving the Upper Ganges Canal. It takes off from the Ganges at Naraura in Bulandshahr District, where a solid wall 3,800 feet long, with a section of 10 feet by 9, having forty-two weir-sluices, has been thrown across the river. At mile 25 the Fatehgarh branch, 61 miles long, is given off, and soon after, at mile 34, the canal is carried on a fine aqueduct across the Kali Nadi at Nadrai. The Bewar branch, 65 miles long, takes off 6 miles lower down, and at mile 55 the main canal meets\nthe old Cawnpore branch of the Upper Ganges Canal at Gop\u0101lpur, and provides most of its supply. It then passes on to the Et\u0101wah branch of the Upper Ganges Canal and supplies it also, the main channel taking the name of the Bhognipur branch and terminating in Cawnpore District. The canal was first opened for irrigation in 1878; in 1895 the Fatehpur branch, which is a continuation of the Cawnpore branch, extending into Allah\u0101b\u0101d District, was commenced, and it was opened for irrigation in 1898. The total capital outlay on this canal to the end of 1903\u20134 was more than 4 crores. The system commands an area of 5,300,000 acres in the Districts of Etah, Mainpuri, Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, Et\u0101wah, Cawnpore, Fatehpur, and Allah\u0101b\u0101d, of which 831,000 acres were irrigated in 1903\u20134. The gross revenue has exceeded the working expenses since 1880\u20131, but the net revenue still falls, in some years, below the interest charges. In 1903\u20134 the canal earned 28 lakhs gross and 15 lakhs net, giving a return of 3.8 per cent. on the capital outlay. The main channel of 62 miles and 137 miles of branches are navigable. Navigation accounts are kept jointly with those of the Upper Ganges Canal.\n\n**Ganges Canal, Upper.** The largest and most important irrigation work in the United Provinces, taking off from the right bank of the Ganges river and watering the Upper Do\u0101b. Two miles above Hardw\u0101r the Ganges divides into several channels, the most westerly of which contains a large volume of water and, after passing Hardw\u0101r, rejoins the main stream at Kankhal. This channel is held up by a temporary dam which diverts the water into the canal head-works, where the amount admitted is regulated at the M\u0101y\u0101pur bridge. During the first 20 miles of its course four large torrents liable to sudden floods of extreme violence have to be crossed. Two of these are carried over the canal, the third is passed through it by a level crossing provided with flood-gates, and the canal itself flows on a magnificent aqueduct over the bed of the Sol\u0101ni. At mile 22 the canal throws off the Deoband branch (52 miles long); at mile 50 the An\u016bpshahr branch (107 miles); and at mile 181 (at N\u0101n\u016b in Al\u012bgarh District) it divides into what were originally called the Cawnpore and Et\u0101wah branches of the Ganges Canal. The Lower Ganges Canal now crosses these in their 32nd and 39th miles respectively, and from the points of junction they are considered to belong to it. The Upper Ganges Canal, on March 31, 1904, had 213 miles of main line, 227 miles of branches, and 2,694 miles of distributaries.\n\nIn 1827 Captain De Bude proposed a scheme for utilizing the waters of the West K\u0101l\u012b Nadi, along a drainage line constructed under native rule, to irrigate Meerut, Bulandshahr, and Al\u012bgarh Districts. The supply would, however, have been deficient and uncertain, and in 1836, at the suggestion of Colonel Colvin, the Ganges was examined\nnear Hardwar. The next year a terrible famine, which devastated the Do\u00e1b, increased the anxiety of Government to provide a satisfactory scheme. Major (afterwards Sir) Proby Cautley commenced a survey in 1839, and prepared a project which was warmly approved by the Court of Directors in 1841, the estimated cost being over a million sterling. In April, 1842, the actual works were commenced by opening the excavation between Kankhal and Hardwar. The work had, however, hardly begun when Lord Ellenborough abruptly stopped it, on the grounds that money could not be spared and that the project was unsound from an engineering point of view. Subsequently the totally inadequate grant of 2 lakhs a year was made. In 1844 Mr. Thomason, shortly after assuming office as Lieutenant-Governor, made a strong representation on the subject, and was informed that the main object of the canal was to be navigation, not irrigation. The grant was, however, increased by a lakh a year, and surveys were pressed on. A committee considered the arguments raised, and in 1847 reported favourably on the scheme. Lord Hardinge visited the head-works in the same year, and reversed the decision of his predecessor: an annual grant of 20 lakhs a year was sanctioned, with a promise of more if it could be usefully spent. The revised estimate of 1\u00bd million sterling was passed by the Directors in 1850, and the canal was opened in April, 1854. The works were, however, not complete; in particular, those at the Sol\u0101ni river gave way, and irrigation really commenced from May, 1855. Although the canal had been extraordinarily successful, owing to the genius of its projector, Sir Proby Cautley, ten years' experience pointed out defects in the system, and in 1866 a committee sat to examine the proposals which had been made. The result of their report was the expenditure of large sums on improvements and remodelling, the chief objects of which were to increase the supply, and to reduce the excessive slope of the channel by providing more falls. They also recommended a site near R\u0101jgh\u0101t in Aligarh as a point from which a supplementary supply might be drawn, and this was carried out later in the Lower Ganges Canal.\n\nThe expenditure on capital account up to 1904 has been about 3 crores (\u00a32,000,000 at present rate of exchange). The total area commanded by the canal at the end of 1903\u20134 was 3,800,000 acres in the Districts of Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Muttra, Agra, Etah, and Mainpuri, of which 978,000 acres were irrigated. There is not much room for further increase. The canal also supplements the supply available in the Lower Ganges and Agra Canals (by means of the Hindan cut). The gross revenue first exceeded the working expenses in 1860\u20131. The net revenue has been larger than the interest charges on the capital expended since 1873\u20134. The most successful year of working was 1900\u20131, when the net\nrevenue amounted to $1\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. on the capital outlay. In 1903\u20134 the gross and net revenue amounted respectively to 42 and 31 lakhs, the latter representing 10.3 per cent. on the capital outlay.\n\nSpecial expenditure has been undertaken to facilitate navigation by constructing locked channels round falls, and by raising bridges; and boats can pass from Roorkee to Cawnpore. The portion of the Cawnpore branch from N\u0101n\u016b to Gop\u0101lpur, where it meets the Lower Ganges Canal, is kept open chiefly for navigation; and both the Ganges Canals are, in this respect, considered a single system. Operations are carried on at a loss; the receipts in 1903\u20134 were Rs. 11,000, while the expenditure was Rs. 19,000. Grain, cotton, oilseeds, and timber are the most important commodities carried; the rafting of timber is, however, decreasing. A small income is derived from mills worked by water-power at the falls, and the water-supply of Meerut city is raised by turbines worked by the canal.\n\n**Gangoh.**\u2014Town in the Nak\u016br talukd of Sah\u0101ranpur District, United Provinces, situated in $29^\\circ 47'$ N. and $77^\\circ 17'$ E. It is the chief town in the pargana of the same name. Population (1901), 12,971. Hindus numbered 5,741 and Musalm\u0101ns 7,172. The town consists of an old and new quarter, the former founded by a legendary hero, R\u0101j\u0101 Gang, from whom its name is derived, and the latter by the famous saint, Shaikh Abdul Kuddus, who gives his title to the western suburb, where his mausoleum stands, built by Hum\u0101y\u016bn in 1537. During the Mutiny Gangoh was frequently threatened by the rebel G\u016bjars under the self-styled R\u0101j\u0101 Fath\u016b\u0101; but Mr. H. D. Robertson and Lieutenant Boisragon attacked and utterly defeated them towards the end of June, 1857. There are three old mosques, two of which were built by Akbar and Jah\u0101ng\u012br, besides a school and a dispensary. The town is liable to be flooded from a large swamp south of the site, but a scheme has been prepared to drain this. The streets are paved and most of them have brickwork drains. Gangoh is administered under Act XX of 1856, the income raised being about Rs. 3,000 a year. It is the cleanest and best kept of all the towns under Act XX in the District.\n\n**Gangotri.**\u2014Mountain temple in the State of Tehri, United Provinces, situated in $31^\\circ$ N. and $78^\\circ 57'$ E. It stands at an elevation of 10,319 feet above the sea on the right bank of the Bh\u0101girathi, the chief feeder of the Ganges, eight miles from its source in the Gaumukh glacier. The temple is a square building, about 20 feet high, containing small statues of Gang\u0101, Bh\u0101girathi, and other mythological personages connected with the spot. It was erected by Amar Singh, Thappa, the chief of the Gurkha commanders in Garhwal, early in the eighteenth century. During the summer large numbers of pilgrims visit this place, and several dharmas\u0101las have been built for their accommodation. Flasks filled at Gangotri with the sacred water are sealed up by the\nofficiating Brahmans and conveyed to the plains as valuable treasures. In the winter the temple is closed and the priests migrate to Mukhba, a village 10 miles away.\n\nG\u0101ngpur.\u2014A Tributary State of Orissa, Bengal, lying between $21^\\circ 47'$ and $22^\\circ 32'$ N. and $83^\\circ 33'$ and $85^\\circ 11'$ E., with an area of 2,492 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the State of Jashpur and R\u0101nch\u012b District; on the east by Singhbh\u016bm; on the south by the States of Bonai, Sambalpur, and B\u0101mra; and on the west by the State of Raigarh in the Central Provinces. G\u0101ngpur consists of a long undulating table-land about 700 feet above the sea, dotted here and there with hill ranges and isolated peaks which rise to a height of 2,240 feet. In the north the descent from the higher plateau of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur is gradual; but on the south the Mah\u0101v\u012bra range springs abruptly from the plain in an irregular wall of tilted and disrupted rock with two flanking peaks, forming the boundary between G\u0101ngpur and the State of B\u0101mra. The principal rivers are the Ib, which enters the State from Jashpur and passes through it from north to south to join the Mah\u0101nadi in Sambalpur, the S\u0101nkh from R\u0101nch\u012b, and the South Koel from Singhbh\u016bm. The two latter meet in the east of G\u0101ngpur, and the united stream, under the name of the Br\u0101hm\u0101ni, flows south into the plains of Orissa. The confluence of the Koel and S\u0101nkh is one of the prettiest spots in G\u0101ngpur; and it is said by local tradition to be the scene of the amour of the sage Par\u0101sara with the fisherman's daughter Matsya Gandh\u0101, the offspring of which was Vy\u0101sa, the reputed compiler of the Vedas and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. These rivers are practically dry from the end of the cold season till the rains, and there is no systematic navigation on them. Tigers, leopards, wolves, hyenas, bison, and many kinds of deer abound, and peafowl are numerous.\n\nThe State was once under the suzerainty of Sambalpur, which formed part of the dominions of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Raj\u0101s of N\u0101gpur. It was ceded in 1803 to the British Government by the Treaty of Deogaon, but was restored to the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Raj\u0101 in 1806. It reverted under the provisional engagement with M\u0101lhuji Bhonsla in 1818, and was finally ceded in 1826. In 1821 the feudal supremacy of Sambalpur over Gangpur was cancelled by the British Government, and a fresh sanad granted to the chief. In 1827, after the permanent cession, another sanad was granted for a period of five years, but this was allowed to run till 1875 before it was renewed. The last sanad was granted to the chief in 1899. The State was transferred from Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur to Orissa in 1905.\n\nThe total revenue is Rs. 2,40,000, and the tribute payable to the\n\n---\n\n1 This figure, which differs from the area shown in the Census Report of 1901, was supplied by the Surveyor-General.\nBritish Government is Rs. 1,250. The relations of the chief with the British Government are regulated by the sanad granted in 1899, which was reissued in 1905 with a few verbal changes due to the transfer of the State to Orissa. Under this sanad the chief was formally recognized and permitted to administer his territory subject to prescribed conditions, and the tribute was fixed for a further period of twenty years, at the end of which it is liable to revision. The chief is under the general control of the Commissioner of Orissa, who is Superintendent of the Tributary Mahals, as regards all important matters of administration, including the settlement and collection of land revenue, the imposition of taxes, the administration of justice, arrangements connected with excise, salt, and opium, and disputes in which other States are concerned; and he cannot levy import and export duties or transit dues, unless they are especially authorized by the Lieutenant-Governor. He is permitted to levy rents and certain other customary dues from his subjects, and is empowered to pass sentences of imprisonment up to five years and of fine to the extent of Rs. 200, but sentences of imprisonment for more than two years and of fine exceeding Rs. 50 require the confirmation of the Commissioner.\n\nThe recorded population increased from 191,440 in 1891 to 238,896 in 1901, the development being due partly to a more accurate enumeration and partly to the State having been opened out by the Bengal-Nagpur Railway, which runs through the south-east corner for about 70 miles. The number of villages is 806, one of which, Suadi, contains the residence of the Rajah. The density is 96 persons per square mile. Hindus number 146,549, Animists 88,949, Muhammadans 1,640, and Christians 1,758. The most numerous tribes are the Oraons (47,000), Gonds (37,000), Kharias (26,000), Bhuiyas (24,000), and Mundas (19,000). The Agarias (7,000) a cultivating caste, claim to be descendants of Kshatriya immigrants from Agra. A branch of the German Evangelical Mission, with its head-quarters at Kumarkela, has been at work since 1899 and has made several converts. The Roman Catholic Jesuit Mission established in the Biru pargana of Ranchi claims many converts in the State, chiefly among the Oraons.\n\nThe soil of the Ib valley towards the south is extremely productive, and here the skilful and industrious Agarias make the most of their land; in the north the soil is less fertile, and the cultivators are ignorant and lazy. The principal crops are rice, sugar-cane, and oilseeds. Irrigation from rivers and streams is extensively resorted to, but large works are not numerous. The estates of Hingir and Nagra and certain portions of the khalsa, or chief's own domain, contain stretches of sal (Shorea robusta), which have been worked since the opening of the Bengal-Nagpur line through the State. The chief\njungle products are lac, resin, and catechu. The forests also contain a large number of edible roots and indigenous drugs. *Sabai* grass (*Ischaemum angustifolium*) grows plentifully throughout the State and is exported in large quantities. Diamonds have occasionally been found in the sands of the Ib river, and gold-washing is carried on in most of the rivers and streams by Jhor\u0101 Gonds, who thus gain a precarious livelihood. An extensive coal-field is situated in the Hingir estate, and negotiations for its working are now in progress. Limestone and iron occur throughout the State in great abundance, especially in the north-east, where a concession of 100 square miles has been made to a European prospector; the industry is developing rapidly and promises to be important. Work has also been commenced in the dolomite deposit in the same concession, where the stone procurable is said to be extremely rich and extensive. Villages in G\u0101ngpur are held either on feudal tenures or on farming leases. The feudal tenures date back to the early times when the vassals of the chief received grants of land in consideration of rendering military service and making certain payments in kind. These payments and the service conditions also have been gradually commuted to a quit-rent in money. The other villages are leased out to small farmers, called *g\u0101onti\u0101s* or *ganjhus*, who pay a fixed annual rent and are remunerated by lands, called *begr\u0101*, which are held rent-free. Rents are paid only for rice lands, but the cultivators are bound to work gratuitously for the chief in return for the uplands which they hold rent-free. The police force was reorganized in 1900, and is now managed by the chief's eldest son as District Superintendent on the lines followed in British Districts. The State contains altogether 13 police stations and outposts, and the force consists of 24 officers and 134 constables, maintained at a cost of Rs. 20,000; there is in addition a *chaukid\u0101r* in each village, who is remunerated by a grant of land. The State jail at Su\u0101di has accommodation for 50 prisoners, and there is a dispensary at the same place, at which in- and out-patients are treated. The State maintains a middle English school, and 7 upper primary and 8 lower primary schools.\n\n**Gangtok.**\u2014Capital of Sikkim State, Bengal, situated in $27^\\circ 20' N.$ and $88^\\circ 38' E.$ Population (1901), 749. Gangtok contains the residence of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 and other public buildings. It is connected with the Tista valley by a cart-road.\n\n**Ganj\u0101m District.**\u2014Northernmost District of the Madras Presidency, lying along the shore of the Bay of Bengal between $18^\\circ 12' \\text{ and } 20^\\circ 26' N.$ and $83^\\circ 30' \\text{ and } 85^\\circ 12' E.$, with an area of 8,372 square miles. It is called after its former head-quarters, but the derivation of the name is unknown. The fanciful etymology from *Ganji-\u0101m*, 'the store-house of the world,' has no satisfactory authority and no sufficient\nwarrant in the fertility of the District. In shape Ganj\u0101m is triangular, running to a point at its southern end. Its northern boundary is formed by Orissa and the States recently transferred from the Central Provinces to Bengal, its eastern by the sea, and its western by the adjoining Madras District of Vizagapatam. Much of it is mountainous and rocky, but it is interspersed with valleys and fertile plains; pleasant groves of trees give to the scenery of the low country a greener appearance than is usually met with in the plains farther south; and with its background of wild hills, frequently covered with dark jungle, it is one of the most beautiful Districts in the Presidency, winning the affections of almost every officer who serves within it.\n\nThe Eastern Gh\u0101ts traverse it from north to south, and are nowhere more than 50 miles from the sea. At B\u0101ruva, in the centre of the District, they are within 15 miles of the sea, and at this point are much loftier than elsewhere, the peaks of Singar\u0101zu and Mahendragiri, the two highest points in the District, being close upon 5,000 feet. Devagiri (4,535 feet), which stands farther south behind Parl\u0101kimedi, is their next highest hill. They divide the District into two well-defined portions: the M\u0101l\u0101hs, or hills, and the plains. The former, which are described in more detail in the separate account of them, occupy the whole of the western half. This hilly area is also known as the Agency of Ganj\u0101m. It is a wild country, for the most part inhabited by backward forest tribes, to whom it would be inexpedient to apply the whole of the ordinary law of the land, and it is consequently ruled by the Collector under special powers as Agent to the Governor. The ordinary courts of justice have no jurisdiction within it, the Collector being the chief civil and criminal tribunal, with an appeal from his decisions to the High Court and the Governor in-Council. There are similar Agencies in the two adjoining Madras Districts of Vizagapatam and God\u0101vari. In Ganj\u0101m these tracts are for the most part held on a kind of feudal tenure, while the plains consist of three Government t\u0101luks and several permanently settled estates.\n\nNo real lakes are situated in Ganj\u0101m; but near the coast, and sometimes farther inland, shallow depressions occur, which are filled in some cases with fresh, and in others with brackish water. These are known as tampar\u0101s or s\u0101garams. The largest of them is the Chilka Lake on the northern frontier.\n\nThe three principal rivers of the District, all of which are utilized for irrigation, run eastwards into the Bay. They are the Rushikulya, which with its tributaries (the chief of which are the Mah\u0101nadi and God\u0101haddo) drains the northern part of the District, and the Vamsadh\u0101ra and L\u0101ngulya, which traverse it in the extreme south. The Vamsadh\u0101ra enters Ganj\u0101m at Battuli, and after running southwards\nthrough it for 70 miles falls into the sea at Calingapatam. The L\u0101ngulya forms, for the last 30 miles of its course, the southern boundary of the District, and enters the sea 3 miles from Chica\u00e7ole, where it is crossed by the trunk road on a fine bridge.\n\nThe rocks exposed in the District are Archaean gneisses and schists of the older and younger type, together with intrusive bands of charnockite (hypersthene granulite) and biotite gneissose granite. The younger type is of a distinctly metamorphic series. Cappings of high-level horizontal laterite, as much as 200 feet thick, are common at about the 4,000 feet level. In the flat coast region, except for the thickly dotted rocky ridges and hills, recent alluvium and low-level lateritic red clay are generally present.\n\nBotanically, most of Ganj\u0101m is included in what is classed as the moist region of the Presidency. Near the coast the wooded area consists to a large extent of scrub jungle, but it comprises tree forest inland where the rainfall is heavier; the herbaceous flora is made up of plants belonging to both the dry and moist regions. The more prominent crops and the chief growth of the forests are referred to later. The most characteristic tree of the latter is s\u0101l (Shorea robusta). In some places along the coast casuarina has been planted, which grows very fast and is valuable as firewood.\n\nGanj\u0101m is a fair sporting country. Bears and hyenas are common, and wolves, leopards, and tigers are also met with. Of the deer tribe, sambhar, spotted deer, barking-deer, and mouse deer occur on the slopes of the hills, where are also some nilgai; and antelope are found on the plains. The four-horned antelope, bison, and wild hog are rarer. Wild dogs commit havoc among the game. It is believed by the natives that there are two kinds of them: the bolio-kukuro, which hunt in pairs, and the khogo, which hunt in packs; but the former are apparently wolves which have been mistaken for wild dogs.\n\nThe climate along the coast, close to which most of the chief towns are situated, is usually cool and healthy, but Ganj\u0101m town is notoriously malarious, and for this reason has ceased to be the District head-quarters. The M\u0101liahs and the tracts adjoining them are also particularly malarious. The District is one of the few in the Presidency which enjoys a real cold season.\n\nThe rainfall is usually considerable, being greatest in the Agency tracts, where it averages 55 inches annually. In the plains, the rain brought by the south-west monsoon is heavier inland than on the coast, while the reverse is the case with the north-east monsoon. On the coast the fall in both monsoons is heavier at the northern stations than in the south. The annual rainfall in the District as a whole averages 45 inches, and the average number of wet days in the year is 59. The south-west current rarely fails, though it often sets in late; but the\nnorth-east is much more precarious, and there have been three famines (see below) in the last half-century. Otherwise Ganjam has escaped serious natural calamities. A heavy flood in the L\u00e4ngulya in 1876, caused by a cyclone, destroyed six arches of the bridge at Chicacole, and floods in the Rushikulya on another occasion washed away a portion of the town of Purushottapur.\n\nHistorically, Ganjam formed part of the ancient Kalinga, though at times the kingdom of Vengi encroached upon its southern border. Conquered by the Mauryan king Asoka in 260 B.C., it seems to have passed later under the Andhra kings of Vengi. Both of these were Buddhists, and Asoka has left an edict at Jaugada. The Andhras were driven out of this part of the country in the third century A.D., and made way for the early line of the Ganga kings of Kalinga. The dates of the early Gangas are very obscure, and so are their relations with the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi; but the latter seem at one time to have ruled a part of Ganjam. The Chola conquest of Vengi and Kalinga, which took place at the end of the tenth and the beginning of the eleventh centuries, certainly included parts of Ganjam, and the great king Rajendra Chola has left a record of his victories on Mahendragiri hill. But the degree and the variation of the Chola control over Kalinga are still obscure. About the time of the Chola conquest the line of the later Ganga kings of Kalinga comes into view, who ruled, first no doubt as Chola feudatories, but later as independent sovereigns, for the next four centuries. They extended their dominions far to the north and south, and only fell before domestic treachery. The power of the Gajapatis of Orissa, whose descendants still hold considerable portions of the District, was founded in the fifteenth century by a minister of the former dynasty, who murdered his master and usurped the throne. About 1571 these last were ousted by the Kutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda, and for the next 180 years the country was ruled from Chicacole by Muhammadans. Apart from the mosque at that town, there are scarcely any permanent traces of their dominion.\n\nIn 1687 the emperor Aurangzeb compelled Golconda to acknowledge his authority, and the governors of Chicacole were thereafter appointed by his Subahdars of the Deccan. For services to two of these Subahdars, the French obtained in 1753, among other tracts, the Chicacole Sarkar\u2014one of the five Northern Circars\u2014which included the present District of Ganjam. In 1757 De Bussy came to reduce it to order, but in the next year he was summoned south by Lally, then Governor of Pondicherry, to help in the siege of Madras. Immediately on his departure, Clive dispatched Colonel Forde to the south with a force from Bengal. Forde defeated De Bussy's successor and captured Masulipatam, the French head-quarters, in January, 1759. The Subah-\nd\u0101r of the Deccan thereupon changed sides, and made a treaty with Forde agreeing to prevent the French ever settling in these parts again. By this agreement, ratified by a farm\u0101n from the emperor Sh\u0101h Alam in 1765, and another treaty with the S\u016bbahd\u0101r in 1766, the English obtained the whole of the Northern Circ\u0101rs.\n\nGanj\u0101m, however, took longer to pacify than any area in the Presidency, and it was not until seventy years later that it was finally reduced to order. It originally consisted of the country as far south as the Pundi river; and most of the numerous zamind\u0101rs in this area (who had 34 forts and 32,000 irregular troops) were contumacious, frequently annexing Government villages, quarrelling with one another or over disputed successions, and declining to pay any tribute until compelled by force. Troops were used at different times against no less than fifteen of them; but these expeditions, though they cost time, money, and often valuable lives, had little permanent effect.\n\nIn 1803 the Chicacole division, which included the Parl\u0101k\u012bmed\u012b Zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b, was added to the District. The disturbances which subsequently occurred in that tract lasted in a more or less open manner for nineteen years from 1813 to 1832, being chiefly caused by the factions among the eleven hill chiefs, called Bissoyis, to whom certain villages had been granted by the zamind\u0101r on condition that they prevented the Savara hill tribes from raiding the low country. They not only failed to keep the Savaras in order, but themselves perpetually harassed the villages in the plains. In 1816, 4,000 or 5,000 Pind\u0101ris entered the District from Jeypore and swept through the whole of it, plundering and burning.\n\nBy 1832 the Bissoyis' doings became so intolerable that Mr. George Russell, first Member of the Board of Revenue and name-father of Russellkonda, was sent to stop them. He proclaimed martial law, captured the Bissoyis and their forts one after the other, hanged some and transported others, and gave the District a spell of quiet. In 1836 he followed a similar policy in Goomsur, and since then there have been no disturbances of importance. Two other notable results of Russell's mission were the appointment in 1836 of the Meriah Agents to put down the practice of human sacrifice among the Khonds, and the passing of the Act of 1839, by which the Collector of Ganj\u0101m, under the title of Agent to the Governor, received special powers over the hill country and its inhabitants. Russell's account of his mission and the reports of the Meriah Agents down to 1861, when they were abolished, give a vivid picture of the Ganj\u0101m of those restless days.\n\nExcept Asoka's edicts at Jaugada, the only notable antiquities in the District are several ancient temples, some of which furnish interesting examples of architecture and sculpture, and contain inscriptions throwing much light on the early history of Kalinga. The most important\nare the Vaishnavite shrine at SriK\u016brmam and the Saivite temple at Mukhalingam.\n\nThe District as a whole contains 8 towns, all in the low country, and 6,145 villages; but the villages in the M\u0101liahs are small, with an average of less than 200 inhabitants.\n\nPopulation has shown a steady advance during the past thirty years, the total numbering 1,520,088 in 1871; 1,749,604 in 1881; 1,896,803 in 1891; and 2,010,256 in 1901. Migration to the Assam tea gardens and to Bengal and Burma has lately somewhat checked the increase.

In the plains 96 per cent. of the population are Hindus and nearly all the remainder are Animists; while in the Agency tract more than two-thirds of the total are Animists. Musalm\u0101ns and Christians are fewer than in any other Madras District. In the low country the density of population is above the average for the Presidency, but in the Agencies it is only one-third as great, being less than 100 persons per square mile. Telugu is mainly spoken in the southern half of the District, while in the north the prevailing language is Oriya. In the Agency tract Khond is on the whole the chief vernacular, but in the Southern M\u0101liahs Savara is most used.\n\nExcept for a few Khonds and Savaras, the people of the plains nearly\nall belong to either Telugu or Oriy\u0101 castes. The Telugu castes resemble, generally, those found elsewhere. The cultivating K\u0101pus (150,000) are the most numerous, and then come the K\u0101lingis (104,000), who are in greater strength in this District than in any other. Of the Oriy\u0101 castes by far the most numerous are the Br\u0101hmans. They number nearly 8 per cent. of the Hindus and Animists of the District, a proportion which is exceeded only by the Br\u0101hmans in South Kanara. Some classes of them differ from their fellows farther south in having no religious scruples against engaging personally in cultivation and trade.\n\nIn the Agency tract there are 90,000 persons of Oriy\u0101-speaking castes, 44,000 of whom are P\u0101nos (whose usual occupations are weaving and thieving); but otherwise the population consists almost entirely of Khonds (139,000) and Savaras (83,000). These two tribes are described in the article on the M\u0101liahs. They are more numerous in Ganj\u0101m than anywhere else in the Presidency.\n\nThe means of livelihood of the people in the low country differs but little from the normal. About 66 per cent. of them are engaged in agricultural and pastoral pursuits, compared with an average of 70 per cent. for the Presidency as a whole; but a larger proportion than usual returned themselves as living by unskilled labour, and probably many of these are in reality mainly agricultural labourers. In the Agency tract, however, the population subsists almost entirely by the land, the only industrial pursuit of any consequence being weaving.\n\nOf the 3,042 native Christians in the District in 1901, 1,948 belonged to the Roman Catholic Church, which began work in the District in 1768 and has its head-quarters at Surada; and 910 to the Baptist Mission, which started operations in 1825, with its chief station at Berhampur. The Canadian Baptist Mission has stations at Chicacole, Parl\u0101k\u012bmed\u012b, and Tekkali.\n\nThe soils in the Agency tract are of three kinds\u2014black earth, loam, and red ferruginous land; but the first, which is the best, occurs only in occasional patches, and the second, the next most fertile, is chiefly used for turmeric cultivation. In the plains, black cotton soil (regar) predominates, the other land being red and sandy and, to a small extent, alluvial. Of the \u2018dry\u2019 (unirrigated) land, three-fifths in the Goomsur taluk, one-fourth in Chicacole, and one-sixth in Berhampur is of superior quality, being regar clay or regar loam. Of the \u2018wet\u2019 land, three-fourths in the Chicacole taluk is of good quality, but in Berhampur and Goomsur the proportion is only two fifths. Rice, the most important crop in the District, is for the most part sown broadcast on \u2018dry\u2019 land, and then transplanted to the \u2018wet\u2019 fields and matured with the aid of artificial irrigation. On some \u2018dry\u2019 land it is raised with the aid of rainfall alone. If rain fails in a\nsingle month in the season, the 'dry' crop is lost. Many officers have accordingly advocated the cultivation on these lands of r\u0101gi, which requires less moisture; but the ryots adhere to the more precarious rice cultivation, as the produce, if only it comes to maturity, is treble the value of a crop of r\u0101gi. The Oriy\u0101 ryots of the District are not industrious. The use of wells and garden cultivation are both very limited, though fencing and tree-growing are common.\n\nOf the 8,372 square miles of the District, 4,439 are ryotw\u0101ri land, 3,509 samind\u0101ri, and 124 in\u0101m. Detailed agricultural statistics are not available for the Agency tract (except for Chokkap\u0101d Khandam, a small area managed on the ryotw\u0101ri system) or for samind\u0101ri or 'whole in\u0101m' land. Of the ryotw\u0101ri land shown in the revenue accounts, 1,999 square miles were classified as follows in 1903-4:\n\n| Taluk     | Area shown in accounts | Forests | Cultivable waste | Cultivated | Irrigated |\n|-----------|------------------------|---------|------------------|------------|-----------|\n| Udayagiri |                        |         |                  |            |           |\n| Goomsur   | 1,162                  | 568     | 48               | 290        | 80        |\n| Berhampur | 526                    | 28      | 19               | 349        | 183       |\n| Chicacole | 302                    | 2       | 18               | 197        | 115       |\n| Total     | 1,999                  | 598     | 86               | 844        | 378       |\n\nRice and r\u0101gi are the staple food grains of the District. Rice covers nearly three-fourths, and r\u0101gi nearly one-sixth, of the total area cultivated. Other important crops are green gram, horse-gram, and gingelly. In the Agency tract the staple cereal is rice, and the main 'dry' grains are r\u0101gi and pulses. The special crop of the M\u0101lahs is turmeric, which takes three years to come to maturity and requires to be shaded from the sun during its first hot season. Products of the forest areas are alum, arrowroot, myrabolams, gall-nuts, and oranges. Every village owns a large number of mango-trees scattered about the jungle round it, and their fruit and a kind of flour made from the stones of the fruit are largely eaten. Mahu\u012b trees (*Bassia latifolia*) also afford food, and arrack (strong spirit) is distilled from their flowers.\n\nGanj\u0101m ryots are conservative and have introduced few agricultural improvements. During the seventeen years ending 1905 they have borrowed only Rs. 63,000 under the Land Improvement Loans Act. Most of this has been spent in reclaiming waste land, and wells are few in number and often only temporary pits. Not a single well has been constructed with advances from Government in either Berhampur or Goomsur.\n\nBoth bullocks and buffaloes are used for ploughing and other agricultural operations. They are bred locally, and are inferior and undersized animals, though there is no lack of pasture or fodder, even in bad years.\nOf the total area of ryotwari and inam land under cultivation 378 square miles, or 45 per cent., were irrigated in 1903-4. Of this, 213 square miles were watered from Government channels, 127 from tanks, and only 2 square miles from wells. The chief canals and channels are those belonging to the Rushikulya project and to what is known as the 'Ganjam minor rivers system.' These irrigated 92,000 acres and 79,000 acres respectively in 1903-4. The former, which is referred to in the article on the Rushikulya river, supplies land in the Berhampur, Aska, and Goomsur taluks, and is still being extended; while the latter, which irrigates part of the Chicacole taluk, consists of the channels from the two rivers L\u00e4ngulya and Vamsadh\u0101ra, and of a hill stream known as the Garibulagedda. In the three Government taluks of Berhampur, Goomsur, and Chicacole there are, including the major irrigation works, 2,505 Government tanks and 302 river and spring channels. The private works in the same area include 102 tanks and one river channel. Most of the wells in the District are mere shallow, temporary pits dug to supplement tank-irrigation. At present 2,493 of these constructions exist in the three Government taluks. In Goomsur, not even one permanent well is used for irrigation, but Berhampur and Chicacole contain 1,007 and 408 respectively. The area watered from each of them averages only one acre. In the Mahias, irrigation is entirely from hill streams and springs. The slopes of the hills and the valley through which the stream runs are levelled into terraces, and the water is led from field to field till the bottom of the slope is reached. Springs are diverted in a similar manner. These terraces are monuments of hard work and ingenuity, and have been constructed wherever there is any sufficient supply of water. They are made by the Khonds and Savaras, and in some places cover the whole side of a high hill from top to bottom.\n\nThe Forest Act has not been yet introduced into any part of the Agency tract except a small corner of Surada. Most of the forests are in zamindari land; and even where they are at the disposal of Government the extension of the Act is held to be unnecessary and inadvisable, for the reasons that no special denudation has taken place in the valleys where the great rivers rise, that the best timber is inaccessible and so of no direct commercial value, that the introduction of the Act would involve the maintenance of a considerable establishment in a deadly climate, and that the curtailment of the existing privileges of the hillmen would lead to great discontent. Consequently the area in the District which has been constituted forest under the Act is only about 600 square miles. Of this, 570 square miles lie in Goomsur and practically all the remainder in Berhampur. The Goomsur forests are famous as containing the best sal (Shorea robusta) in the Presidency. This timber perhaps ranks\nsecond in utility to teak, and grows best on the alluvial deposits in the basins of the Mah\u0101nadi and Rushikulya rivers and their tributaries, where a light covering of alluvium overlies a gravelly subsoil and disintegrated rock. Small areas of inferior sal are found on the kankar and sandy conglomerates which occur on the plateaux and terraces above these basins. The Goomsur forests were much spoilt in former days by the shifting cultivation practised by the hill tribes, and have also been overworked. Steps are now being taken for their effective protection and improvement. Besides sal, the more valuable timber trees found are Pterocarpus Marsupium, Terminalia tomentosa, Adina cordifolia, Strymida febrifuga, Stehegyne parvifolia, ebony, and satinwood. The stock of bamboos and small timber on the outer slopes of the M\u0101liahs and on several of the detached hills is almost inexhaustible. There is a small teak plantation in one of the Reserves, but it is not flourishing.\n\nIn the Berhampur t\u0101luk the Reserves contain only firewood, bamboos, and small timber. In Chicacole they consist of a single small patch of scrub. A Government casuarina plantation has been made in Agastinaug\u0101m, three miles north of Chatrapur.\n\nThere are no mines in Ganj\u0101m. Manganese ore has been discovered in small quantities near Boyir\u0101ni in the Atagada zamind\u0101ri. Mica, antimony ore, and corundum are found in parts of the Goomsur t\u0101luk and the Parl\u0101kimedi tahsil, but not of commercial value. Salt is manufactured in large quantities in the Government salt-pans along the coast, at Humma, Surl\u0101, Naupada, and Calingapatam.\n\nThe chief non-agricultural industry of the District is weaving. Ordinary cloths are woven in most villages on the plains, and silk fabrics are made at Berhampur. The latter are dyed, the favourite colours being purple and red. Chicacole used to be famous for its extremely fine muslins, but the better kinds of these are now made only to order. In the M\u0101liahs, the P\u0101nos weave the coarse cloths which are used by the Khonds and Savaras. They are much thicker and narrower than those woven in the plains, and are of various colours. This tribe also rears the tasar silk-moth, and the silk produced is sent to Berhampur and to Sambalpur in Bengal. The Khonds collect the valuable red kamela dye, a powder with which the scarlet berries of Mallotus philippinensis (the monkey-face tree) are coated, and, in their ignorance of its worth, part with it for a few measures of rice or a yard or two of cloth to the dealers in the plains, who export it in considerable quantities and make large profits. In addition to the ordinary gold and silver jewels, quaint brass bangles and other ornaments are made and worn by Oriy\u0101s in the north of the District. The women of some castes wear numbers of these bracelets, to the weight of several pounds.\nhalf-way up their arms. Fine betel-boxes and curious flexible fish of brass and silver are made at Bellugunta near Russellkonda.\n\nA sugar factory and distillery at Aska supplies country spirit to the excise tracts of the District, and makes various other alcoholic liquors. There is a tannery at Russellkonda. The Oriental Salt Company has a factory at Naupada, where the ordinary marine salt is converted by a patented process into a fine white granular variety, which is expected to compete favourably with the salt at present imported from Europe. In 1903-4, 4,400 tons of crushed and 750 tons of sifted salt were treated by the company's special machinery. Sea and river fisheries form an important industry. There are 21 fish-curing yards, and their out-turn is greater than that of any District except the two on the west coast. In 1903-4 nearly 3,000 tons of fish were salted in them.\n\nThe main exports of Ganjam are grain, pulses, myrabolams, hides and skins, hemp, oilseeds, turmeric, wood, salt, salted fish, and coconuts; while the chief imports are rice, piece-goods, twist, glassware, metals and metal goods, kerosene oil, spices, and gunny-bags. There are three ports in the District, at Gop\u0101lpur, Calingapatam, and B\u0101ruva. The first two are open to foreign as well as coasting trade. The total value of the foreign exports and imports at these during 1903-4 was 10 lakhs and Rs. 9,000 respectively. Myrabolams are exported to London and Antwerp, hemp to London, rice to Colombo and Galle, and oilseeds and turmeric to Colombo. Matches are imported from Christiania and Hamburg, areca-nuts from Penang, coco nut oil from Galle, refined sugar from Colombo, and spirits, wines, and many miscellaneous articles from the United Kingdom.\n\nThe total value of the exports and imports carried coastwise to and from all three ports during 1903-4 was Rs. 10,87,000 and Rs. 2,60,000 respectively. The exports go chiefly to Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Negapatam, Cochin, Calicut, Tellicherry, Cannanore, Mangalore, Rangoon, and Moulmein; they consist mainly of coir, grain and pulse, hides and skins, oilseeds, railway sleepers, apparel, and turmeric. The principal imports come from Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Cuddalore, Cochin, and Rangoon; they are largely hardware and cutlery, metals, kerosene oil, haberdashery, and gunny-bags. There is much passenger traffic to and from Rangoon at the three ports.\n\nOf the imports by land, grain is the chief. It comes from Orissa, salt being sent there in return, and travels largely by way of the Chilka canal, which connects the Chilka Lake with the Rushikulya river. Turmeric is largely exported from the Agency tract, not only to the low country within the District, but also to the Central Provinces and Orissa. Berhampur, Gop\u0101lpur, and Calingapatam are the chief centres of general trade. The principal trading castes are Komatis in the plains and Sondis in the M\u0101liahs. Most of the internal trade is carried\non at weekly markets. The most important of these are held at Narasannapeta, Battili, Hiramandalam, and Lakshminarasupeta in the plains, and at R\u0101yagada, Chelligodo, Sarangodo, and Tikk\u0101balli in the M\u0101liahs. Those in the plains are managed by the local boards, and in 1903\u20134 Rs. 3,960 was collected in the shape of tolls.\n\nThe East Coast section of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway (standard gauge) runs through the District from north to south, not far from and nearly parallel to the coast. At Naupada a branch runs to the salt factory there, and the 2 feet 6 inches line which the R\u0101j\u0101 of Parl\u0101kimedi has constructed through his estate meets it at the same place.\n\nThe total length of metalled roads in the plains is 729 miles, and of unmetalled roads 12 miles, the whole being maintained from Local funds. There are avenues of trees along 650 miles. The chief is the trunk road from the Bengal frontier on the north to the borders of Vizagapatam on the south. Except the Goomsur t\u0101luk, the low country is well supplied with communications. The Agency tract has 508 miles of roads, of which only 84 miles are metalled and 221 more are practicable for carts. European officials whose duty takes them to the M\u0101liahs carry their baggage on elephants, and a certain number of these animals are allotted to each of them and maintained at Government expense. Six chief routes lead to the M\u0101liahs from the plains, all of which are passable by loaded elephants and horses. Two of these, the Kalingia and Taptap\u0101ni gh\u0101ts, can be used by carts. A third, the Puip\u0101ni gh\u0101t, is also, though steep, practicable for carts in the dry season. In the Goomsur M\u0101liahs a road from Kalingia to the Bengal frontier is metalled. Another, known as the K\u0101lip\u0101no road, leads from Kalingia to Udayagiri, thence to Balligud\u0101, and on to K\u0101l\u0101handi in Bengal. An old military road passes from Balligud\u0101 to R\u0101magiri-Udayagiri and on to Parl\u0101kimedi. This runs through the heart of the Agency tract, but owing to a series of gh\u0101ts it cannot be used by carts.\n\nFamine visited the District in 1790\u20132, in 1799\u20131801, in 1836\u20139, in 1865\u20136, in 1888\u20139, and in 1896\u20137. That of 1888\u20139 affected no other area, and is known as the Ganj\u0101m famine. The first three were partly due to the disturbed state of the country. Except for the cyclonic rain in November, 1888, the seasons were similar in the last three. In all of them a partial failure of the south-west monsoon was followed by an almost entire failure of the north-east monsoon. The highest numbers relieved at any one time during the course of each of them were: in 1866, 30,500 on gratuitous relief and 1,500 at relief works; in 1889, 11,632 in kitchens, 93,561 on other gratuitous relief, and 20,726 at relief works; and in 1897, 8,897 in kitchens, 79,473 on other gratuitous relief, and 46,529 at relief works. Weavers were also relieved on all three occasions. The cost of these three famines to Government, including advances\nof money and the remissions of land revenue granted in consideration of the failure of crops, was 4\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), 11, and 14 lakhs respectively. In all three, small-pox and cholera caused many deaths; but the small-pox of 1897, which claimed 6,028 persons as its victims in four months, was unprecedented in the annals of the District.\n\nFor administrative purposes Ganjam is arranged into five sub-\n\nAdministration. divisions, of which three, Chicacole, Berhampur, and Balligud\u0101, are in charge of Indian Civilians, and two, Goomsur and Chatrapur, of Deputy-Collectors recruited in India.\n\nThe taluks and zamindari tahsils included in each of these are as follows: in Chicacole, Chicacole, Narasannapeta, Tekkali, Parlakimedi, and the Parlakimedi Agency; in Berhampur, Berhampur, Ichchapuram, Sompeta, and the Sompeta Agency; in Balligud\u0101, the Balligud\u0101 Agency, Udayagiri Agency, and R\u0101magiri Agency; in Goomsur, Goomsur, Aska, Surada, and the Surada Agency; and in Chatrapur, Ganjam and Perushottapur. The Balligud\u0101 subdivision consists entirely of Agency country, and the divisional officer is known as the Special Assistant Agent. Chicacole, Berhampur, and Goomsur are the only taluks in the whole of the ordinary tracts which are not zamindari land. A tahsildar and a stationary sub-magistrate are stationed at the headquarters of each of these, and at Berhampur a town sub-magistrate as well. The zamindari tahsils and Agencies are in charge of deputy-tahsildars. Those at Parlakimedi, Sompeta, and Surada look after both the ordinary and Agency tracts known by these names. The Deputy-Collector at Chatrapur exercises magisterial jurisdiction over a portion of the Berhampur taluk. The head-quarters of the Collector, the Superintendent of police, the District Forest officer, and the District Registrar are at Chatrapur, while the District Judge, the Executive Engineer, and the District Medical and Sanitary officer live at Berhampur. Chatrapur has a Civil Surgeon; and there are two Assistant Superintendents of police in the District, one at Parlakimedi and the other at Russellkonda.\n\nThe District Judge and four District Munsifs dispose of the civil suits in the plains; but cases arising in the M\u0101liyahs, where, as already explained, the whole of the ordinary law is not in force, are dealt with by the Collector in virtue of his extraordinary powers as Agent to the Governor, by the three divisional officers in their capacity as Assistant Agents, and by six deputy-tahsildars who exercise the powers of a District Munsif in the M\u0101liyah tracts within their jurisdiction. Litigation is extremely rare in these backward hill tracts. In an average year less than one in 3,000 of their population bring any kind of suit, whereas in the Presidency as a whole the corresponding figure is one in 115. The hill people often settle their little differences by primitive methods of their own. They still resort to trial by ordeal: the parties each nominate\na representative, who endeavours to stay under water as long as possible, and the verdict goes to the side whose champion is victorious.\n\nThe chief court of criminal justice in the plains is that of the Sessions Judge, and, in the Agency tract, that of the Agent to the Governor. The senior of the three Assistant Agents is an Additional Sessions Judge for the latter, and sessions cases may be transferred to him by the Agent for disposal. Serious crime is rare in these tracts, and petty offences are usually dealt with by the heads of villages without resort to the police or the courts of law. The Khonds have a reputation for honesty and truthfulness, but the P\u0101nos are notorious thieves. In the District, as a whole, dacoities and robberies are rare, but house-breaking and cattle-theft are frequent and are often committed by professional thieves. The number of murders or cases of culpable homicide reported averages fifteen a year; they are due in a majority of cases to jealousy or other personal motives.\n\nLittle is known of the revenue history of the District in the Hindu and Muhammadan periods. The hill country seems, from time immemorial, to have been parcelled out among military chieftains, who held hereditary posts and appropriated the entire revenues, subject to the condition of performing military service for their suzerains when called upon. The plains were held by petty non-military chiefs, some of whom represented old families, while others were little more than government officers entrusted with the collection of the revenue of various tracts. Under the Hindu governments the people seem to have paid an assessment of half the gross produce in kind; but after the Muhammadans conquered the country the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs employed by them imposed fixed rates on the land (to which extra assessments were afterwards added), by which the ryots' share of the rice crops, the chief cultivation of the country, was nominally reduced to one-third, but actually to one-fifth of the gross produce; in the case of 'dry' grains the shares of the ryot and the government were equal. This division of produce seems to have continued till the introduction in 1817 of the ryotw\u0101ri settlement.\n\nWhen the English assumed charge of the District in 1766, they found that the cultivation was divided into zam\u012bnd\u0101ri and haveli (or household) land. At first the Company rented out both these classes of land. On the receipt of the orders of Government directing the introduction of a permanent settlement into the Presidency, a Special Commissioner was appointed to examine the matter, and by 1804 the whole District was permanently assessed. The zam\u012bnd\u0101rs were confirmed to their holders in perpetuity, and the haveli lands were parcelled out into small estates and sold by auction to the highest bidder. Some of the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs and other proprietors subsequently fell into arrears; and between 1809 and 1850 the estates of these one after the other eventually reverted\nto Government, and now form the Government taluks of Chicacole, Berhampur, and Goomsur.\n\nThe ryotwari system was first introduced in the Chicacole taluk in 1817. The fields, including both arable and waste land, were measured, classified, and assessed; but there were great anomalies in the assessment, and it was not until 1878 that revenue administration reached the stage at which it now stands.\n\nA regular survey of all the Government taluks was begun in 1866 and a systematic settlement in 1875. The work was completed in 1884, and resulted in an increase in the three taluks of 16 per cent. in area over that shown in the old revenue accounts, and of 10 per cent. (or Rs. 60,000) in revenue. At present the average assessment per acre on 'dry' land is R. 0-15-8 (maximum Rs. 4, minimum 4 annas), and on 'wet' land Rs. 3-12-11 (maximum Rs. 5-8, minimum Rs. 1-4).\n\nThe revenue from land and the total revenue in recent years are given below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 14.43  | 16.24  | 18.03  | 17.95  |\n| Total revenue  | 18.99  | 20.80  | 25.76  | 28.68  |\n\nThe Local Boards Act V of 1884 was not in force in the Agency tract till 1906, when 122 villages in the country below the Parlakimedi Hills were brought under that enactment. The local affairs of the plains, outside the three municipalities of Chicacole, Parlakimedi, and Berhampur, are managed by the District board and the three taluk boards of Chicacole, Berhampur, and Goomsur, the areas under which correspond with the three administrative subdivisions of the same names, excluding the Agency tracts in them and including, in the case of the Berhampur taluk board, the jurisdiction of the Deputy-Collector at Chatrapur. The total expenditure of these boards in 1903-4 was about 4 lakhs, more than half of which was devoted to roads and buildings. The chief source of their income is, as usual, the land cess. In addition, fifteen Unions are managed by bodies called panchayats established under the Local Boards Act.\n\nThe police force of the District is controlled by a Superintendent and the two Assistants already mentioned. There are 15 police inspectors and 63 police stations. Bodies of reserve police are maintained at Chatrapur and at Balliguda in the Agency tract, numbering 106 and 94 respectively, each in charge of an inspector. These are picked men, better armed than the rest of the force, and are capable of dealing with any disturbances in the Agencies. The ordinary force includes 888 head constables and constables, and 809 rural police. In addition to the District jail at Berhampur there is a smaller prison\nat Russellkonda, under the charge of the divisional officer, which was established to save convicts belonging to the hill tracts from the fever which attacks them if they are brought down to the coast; and 13 subsidiary jails which, taken together, can contain 271 prisoners.\n\nIn the literacy of its population, the plains portion of the District stood seventeenth among the twenty-two Districts of the Presidency at the Census of 1901, only 4.4 per cent. (8.9 males and 0.4 females) being able to read and write. In knowledge of English the Telugus surpass the Oriy\u0101s, but the Oriy\u0101s are superior in vernacular education. The Agency tract is educationally the most backward area in the whole Presidency, only seven persons in 1,000 being able to read and write. Only 56 females in the whole tract were returned as literate at the Census of 1901, and only 26 people, including all the officials, as knowing English. Special efforts are being made to improve this state of things. In 1903\u20134 there were 165 schools in the Agency tract, all but one of which were of the primary grade. Telugu is taught in one of these (in the Parl\u0101kimedi M\u0101liahs) and Oriy\u0101 in all the others. Almost all the teachers are Oriy\u0101s, and the pupils are largely Khonds, Savaras, P\u0101nos, and Oriy\u0101s.\n\nIn the District as a whole the number of pupils under instruction in 1880\u20131 was 13,067; in 1890\u20131, 37,784; in 1900\u20131, 38,679; and in 1903\u20134, 40,802. On March 31, 1904, the District contained 1,460 public educational institutions of all kinds. Of these, 1,449 were primary schools, 14 were secondary, and 4 training schools. There were two second-grade colleges, at Parl\u0101kimedi and Berhampur, and 111 private schools. Of the public institutions, 96 were managed by the Educational department, 100 by Local boards or municipalities, 951 were aided, and 322 unaided. They had 2,668 girl pupils, but all except 4 of these were in primary classes. The District is the most backward in the Presidency in female education, only 1.7 per cent. of the girls of school-going age being under instruction. Among Musalm\u0101ns, who form a smaller proportion of the population than anywhere else in the Presidency, the percentages were 76.4 for males and 19.4 for females. About 1,700 Panchama pupils were under instruction on March 31, 1904. Most of these were in 51 schools specially maintained for them. The total expenditure on education in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,89,000, of which Rs. 52,700 was derived from fees. Of the total, 68 per cent. was allotted to primary schools.\n\nGanj\u0101m possesses 7 hospitals and 16 dispensaries, besides 3 police hospitals at Chatrapur, Aska, and Russellkonda, with accommodation for 110 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 229,186, of whom 1,266 were in-patients, and 4,098 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 50,000, four-fifths of which was met from Local and municipal funds. The Collector and the Special Assistant\nAgent take a Hospital Assistant with them on their periodical tours in the Agency tract, and thus bring medical aid within reach of the hill tribes.\n\nDuring 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 32 per 1,000, compared with an average for the Presidency of 30. There has been a gradual improvement in the matter in recent years. Vaccination is compulsory only in the three municipalities. The number of persons successfully operated on in the hill tracts, where there is a special establishment for the purpose, was 43 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[For further information regarding Ganj\u0101m see the District Manual by T. J. Maltby (1882), S. C. Macpherson's Report on the Khonds (Calcutta, 1842), and the printed reports of Mr. Russell's mission and of the Meriah Agents from 1836 to 1861.]\n\nGanj\u0101m Tahsil.\u2014Zamind\u0101ri tahsil in the north-east of Ganj\u0101m District, Madras, consisting of the Kallikota, Biridi, Humma, and P\u0101luru estates, lying between 19\u00b0 23' and 19\u00b0 49' N. and 84\u00b0 56' and 85\u00b0 12' E., adjoining the Chilka Lake and the Bay of Bengal, with an area of 308 square miles. The tahsil is a picturesque tract, sloping gradually to the sea, and dotted with low hills which cause an unusually cool climate. The population in 1901 was 95,882, compared with 88,714 in 1891. They live in 324 villages. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 was Rs. 48,500. The deputy-tahsild\u0101r in charge resides at Chatrapur outside the tahsil. The four estates of which it is made up are heavily involved in debt.\n\nGanj\u0101m Town. Former head-quarters of the District in Madras to which it gives its name, situated in 19\u00b0 23' N. and 85\u00b0 5' E., in the Berhampur t\u0101luk, at the mouth of the Rushikulya river, on the trunk road and on the East Coast Railway. Population (1901), 4,397. The town itself and the remains of the old fort, built in 1768 as a defence against the Mar\u0101th\u0101s at Cuttack, stand on rising ground; but to the north the country is low and malarious. Ganj\u0101m was formerly a seat of considerable trade, and its factory and fort were presided over by a Chief and Council and protected by a garrison. But since the removal of the head-quarters of the District to Berham-pur in 1815 it has declined in importance, and the handsome buildings which it once contained have either fallen into ruins or been pulled down. The removal was occasioned by an epidemic of fever which carried off a large proportion of the inhabitants, both European and native. Ganj\u0101m was once a port, but this was closed in 1887 owing to the decay in its trade. It was reopened in 1893 for landing the material required for the railway which was then being built, but was closed again in 1897. There is no possibility of its ever being used for private trading, owing to the heavy surf outside and the constant\nshifting of the sandbanks round about. The chief land trade consists in the export of rice to Orissa.\n\n**Gantak.**\u2014Capital of Sikkim State, Bengal. *See Gangtok.*\n\n**Gantar\u0101wadi.**\u2014One of the Karennti States, Burma.\n\n**Ganutia.**\u2014Village in the R\u0101mpur H\u0101t subdivision of Birbhum District, Bengal, situated in $23^\\circ 52' N.$ and $87^\\circ 50' E.$, on the north bank of the Mor river. Population (1901), 407. Ganutia is the centre of the silk industry of Birbhum. A factory was established here in 1786 by a Mr. Frushard. After various vicissitudes, which are related in Hunter's *Annals of Rural Bengal*, this gentleman succeeded in converting the forest and waste land around Ganutia into thriving and prosperous villages, and founded factories throughout the north east of Birbhum. His head factory, which is the most imposing edifice in the District, is now the property of the Bengal Silk Company. The industry has seriously declined of late years and now employs only about 500 persons.\n\n**Garai.**\u2014The name given to the upper reaches of the Madhumati river in Bengal and Eastern Bengal, forming one of the principal channels by which the waters of the Ganges are carried to the sea, especially during the monsoon when the comparatively high level of the Brahmaputra prevents an exit by the more eastern channels. At a former period, while the Ganges was still working its way eastwards, the Garai probably formed its main eastern outlet, and during the nineteenth century there seemed a likelihood of the river reverting to this channel. The Garai, which leaves the Ganges near Kushtia in Nadi\u0101 District ($23^\\circ 55' N.$ and $89^\\circ 9' E.$), flows in a southerly direction from Ganeshpur to Haripur, about 32 miles; it is 420 yards wide in the rains, and navigable by steamers all the year round. It is spanned by a fine railway bridge of the Eastern Bengal State Railway.\n\n[For an account of the history of this river see Ferguson's 'Some Recent Changes in the Delta of the Ganges,' *Journal of the Geographical Society*, vol. xviii, pp. 321 seq., and Hunter's *Statistical Account of Faridpur*, pp. 265 seq.]\n\n**Garamur.**\u2014Village in Sibsagar District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $26^\\circ 59' N.$ and $94^\\circ 9' E.$, in the Majuli Island. It is the site of one of the three colleges or sattras, which are held in highest estimation by the Assamese. The Gosains or high priests of these sattras exercise great influence over the people, but they are loyal supporters of the Government and display an enlightened and progressive spirit. The sattra is chiefly supported by the offerings of its numerous disciples. It is said to have received a grant of nearly 40,000 acres of revenue-free land from the Ahom Rajas; but the proofs of title were destroyed by the Burmans, and the grants lapsed, as the Gosain, who was living at Brindaban, took no steps to support\nhis claims when they were under examination by Government. A grant of 331 acres of revenue-free land has, however, recently been sanctioned by the Government of India.\n\nGarauth\u0101.\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Jh\u0101ns\u012b District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between 25\u00b0 23' and 25\u00b0 49' N. and 79\u00b0 1' and 79\u00b0 25' E., with an area of 466 square miles. Population fell from 88,926 in 1891 to 66,963 in 1901, the rate of decrease being the highest in the District. The density of population, 144 persons per square mile, is below the District average. There are 153 villages, but no town. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,25,000, and for cesses Rs. 24,000. On the north-west and north the Betw\u0101 forms the boundary, while the Dhas\u0101n flows on the eastern frontier to join it. The soil is chiefly m\u0101r or black soil, becoming very poor near the ravines which scar this tract in every direction. For the last thirty years the growth of k\u0101ns (Saccharum spontaneum) has thrown a large area out of cultivation. In 1903-4 the cultivated area was 194 square miles, but there was practically no irrigation.\n\nGarby\u0101ng.\u2014Station in Almor\u0101 District, United Provinces, on the trade route from Tanakpur to Tibet, situated in 30\u00b0 8' N. and 80\u00b0 52' E., near the junction of the Kuthi Y\u0101ntki and K\u0101l\u0101p\u0101ni, which form the K\u0101li or S\u0101rda river. The road divides at this place, one branch going to the Lip\u016b Lekh pass, and another to the Lampiya Dhur\u0101 and Mangsha Dhur\u0101 passes. A peshk\u0101r is posted here to watch the interests of traders and pilgrims, and there is a branch of the American Methodist Mission. A small school has 36 pupils.\n\nGarden Reach.\u2014Town in the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 33' N. and 88\u00b0 19' E., immediately below Calcutta, of which it forms a suburb, on the east bank of the Hooghly river. The suburb is divided for administrative purposes into two portions, the Nemuckmahal Gh\u0101t road dividing the 'Added Area' of Calcutta on the east from the Garden Reach municipality on the west. The population of the latter in 1901 was 28,211. Hindus number 12,181, Musalm\u0101ns 15,779, and Christians 187. The site of the Aligarh fort, taken by Clive in December, 1756, during the operations for the recapture of Calcutta, may still be seen. The suburb was formerly a favourite European quarter, and contains many fine houses built between 1768 and 1780. The residence of the late ex king of Oudh was fixed here, and many of his descendants still inhabit the place. Garden Reach is now an important industrial suburb of Calcutta, containing jute-mills, a cotton mill, and dockyards. Until 1897 the Garden Reach municipality formed part of the South Suburban municipality, but was separated from it in that year. The income during the seven years ending 1903-4 averaged Rs. 49,000,\nand the expenditure Rs. 46,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 56,400, including Rs. 25,000 derived from a tax on houses and lands, Rs. 14,000 from a conservancy rate, and Rs. 11,000 from a water rate. The expenditure was Rs. 55,700. The municipality is now supplied with filtered water from the Calcutta mains.\n\nGargaon. Old Ahom capital in Sibs\u0101gar District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See N\u0101zir\u0101.\n\nGarha.\u2014Petty State in the Central India Agency, under the Resident at Gwalior, with an area of about 44 square miles, and a population (1901) of 9,481. It was originally included in the R\u0101ghugarh State; but family feuds necessitated the grant of a separate j\u0101g\u012br to the various members of the Khichi family, and in 1843 Bijai Singh obtained a sanad for fifty-two villages, with a revenue estimated at Rs. 15,000. The State is much cut up by small hills; but the soil in the valleys is fertile and bears good crops, including poppy, which is a valuable asset, the opium being exported to Ujjain. The chief is a Khichi Chauhan Rajput of the R\u0101ghugarh family, and bears the title of R\u0101j\u0101. The present holder, named Dh\u012brat Singh, succeeded in 1901. As he is a minor, the State is managed by a k\u0101md\u0101r under the direct supervision of the Resident. The total revenue is Rs. 22,000, and the expenditure on administration Rs. 13,000. The administrative head-quarters are at J\u00e4nner (population, 901), where a dispensary and a school are situated. The chief place is Garha, situated on the eastern scarp of the M\u0101lw\u0101 plateau in 25\u00b0 2' N. and 78\u00b0 3' E. It also has a school and a dispensary.\n\nGarh\u0101kot\u0101. \u2014Town in the Rehl\u012b tahsil of Saugor District, Central Provinces, situated in 23\u00b0 46' N. and 79\u00b0 9' E., at the junction of the Gadheri and Son\u0101r rivers, 28 miles from Saugor on the Damoh road. Population (1901). 8,508. In the fork of the Son\u0101r and Gadheri rivers stands an old fort, which must formerly have been of great strength. It was held by the rebels and stormed by Sir Hugh Rose in 1858. Two miles from the town in the forest is a high tower which formed part of the summer palace of a Bundel\u0101 king, and is said to have been constructed in order that both Saugor and Damoh might be visible from its summit. The municipality of Garh\u0101kot\u0101 has recently been abolished, but a town fund is raised for sanitary purposes. Garh\u0101kot\u0101 is now best known as the site of an important cattle fair held annually in the month of February. It contains vernacular middle and girls' schools, and a dispensary.\n\nGarhchiroli. \u2014Tahsil of Ch\u0101nda District, Central Provinces, constituted in 1905. It was formed by taking the zamind\u0101ri estates of Bramhapuri, and those of Ch\u0101nda with the exception of Ahiri, together with 1,457 square miles of the kh\u0101lsa or land held in ordinary proprietary right, from the east of the Ch\u0101nda and Bramhapuri tahsils.\nThe area of the tahsil is 3,708 square miles, and the population of this area in 1901 was 155,214, compared with 207,728 in 1891. The density is 42 persons per square mile. The tahsil contains 1,098 inhabited villages. Its head-quarters are at Garhchiroli, a village of 2,077 inhabitants, 51 miles from Ch\u0101nda town by road. The tahsil includes 19 zamind\u0101ri estates, lying to the east and south of the Waingang\u0101 river, with an area of 2,251 square miles and a population of 82,221 persons. Most of this area is hilly and thickly forested, the area of forest in the zamind\u0101ris being 900 square miles. Outside the zamind\u0101ri estates there are 849 square miles of Government forest. The land revenue demand in 1903\u20134 for the area now constituting the tahsil was approximately Rs. 41,000.\n\nGarhdiw\u0101la.\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Hoshiarpur, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 45' N. and 75\u00b0 46' E., 17 miles from Hoshiarpur. Population (1901), 3,652. The chief trade is in sugar. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 2,300, and the expenditure Rs. 2,200. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 2,900, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 2,600. It maintains a Government dispensary.\n\nGarhi.\u2014Thakur\u0101t in the Bhop\u0101war Agency, Central India.\n\nGarhi Ikhti\u0101r Kh\u0101n.\u2014Town in the Kh\u0101npur tahsil of Bah\u0101walpur State, Punjab, situated in 28\u00b0 40' N. and 70\u00b0 39' E., 84 miles southwest of Bah\u0101walpur town. Population (1901), 4,939. Founded by a governor of the Kalhora rulers of Sind, it was originally named Garhi Sh\u0101di Kh\u0101n after him, but in 1753 a Daudputra chief wrested it from the Kalhoras. In 1806 Naw\u0101b Bah\u0101wal Kh\u0101n II of Bah\u0101walpur annexed it, and founded Kh\u0101npur in its vicinity. It has a considerable trade in dates, large groves of palm-trees surrounding the town, and formerly had a great reputation for the manufacture of arms. It is administered as a municipality, with an income in 1903\u20134 of Rs. 1,150, chiefly from octroi.\n\nGarhi Y\u0101sin.\u2014Town in the Naushahro Abro taluka of Sukkur District, Sind, Bombay, situated in 27\u00b0 54' N. and 68\u00b0 33' E. Population (1901), 6,554. There is a considerable trade in oilseeds. The municipality, established in 1870, had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 12,100. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 25,000. The town contains a dispensary and two schools with 171 pupils.\n\nGarhmuktesar.\u2014Town in the H\u0101pur tahsil of Meerut District, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 47' N. and 78\u00b0 6' E., near the Ganges, on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway and the Delhi-Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d road. Population (1901), 7,616. The place is said to have been part of Hastin\u0101pur, the great city of the Kauravas; but the site now pointed out as Hastin\u0101pur is 25 miles away. It contains an ancient fort, which\nwas repaired by a Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u0101 leader in the eighteenth century. The name is derived from the great temple of Muktesvara Mah\u0101deva, dedicated to the goddess Gang\u0101, which consists of four principal shrines, two on the Ganges cliff and two below it. Close by is a sacred well whose waters are said to cleanse from sin, surrounded by eighty sat\u012b pillars. The principal festival is held at the full moon of K\u0101rtik, when about 200,000 pilgrims collect, the numbers being much larger at intervals of six, twelve, and forty years. The cost of the fair is met from a tax on carts and cattle, and the rent of shops. Horses were formerly exhibited, but the numbers are decreasing. On the other hand, mules are now brought in increasing numbers. The town also contains a mosque built by Gh\u012by\u0101s-ud-din Balban in 1283, and a branch of the American Methodist Mission. Garhmuktesar is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 2,000. There is little trade except in timber and bamboos, which are rafted down the river from the D\u016bn and Garhw\u0101l.\n\nGarhshankar Tahsil. Tahsil of Hoshiarpur District, Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 59' and 31\u00b0 31' N. and 75\u00b0 51' and 76\u00b0 31' E., with an area of 509 square miles. The population in 1901 was 261,468, compared with 264,141 in 1891. Garhshankar Town (population, 5,803) is the head-quarters. It also contains 472 villages, of which Jaijon is of some historical interest. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903\u20134 to 4.4 lakhs. The physical features of the tahsil are similar to those of Hoshiarpur, except that the hills are steeper and torrent-beds less frequent. The Sutlej forms the southern boundary.\n\nGarhshankar Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Hoshiarpur District, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 13' N. and 76\u00b0 9' E. Population (1901), 5,803. A fort built on the site of the present town is said to have been taken by Mahmud of Ghazni, and subsequently given by Muhammad of Ghor to the sons of R\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101n Singh of Jaipur. Its inhabitants are Rajputs, who expelled the Mahtons about A.D. 1175. It possesses a considerable trade in sugar and tobacco. The municipality, founded in 1882, was abolished in 1891. The town has a vernacular middle school and a Government dispensary.\n\nGarhw\u0101l District.\u2014Western District of the Kumaun Division, United Provinces, lying between 29\u00b0 26' and 31\u00b0 5' N. and 78\u00b0 12' and 80\u00b0 6' E., with an area of 5,629 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Tibet; on the south-east by Almora and Naini T\u0101l; on the south-west by Bijnor; and on the north-west by the State of Tehri. The District extends from the submontane plain across the central axis of the Him\u0101layas to the watershed between the drainage systems of the Sutlej and the Ganges. It consists for the most part of rugged mountain ranges, which appear to be tossed about in the most intricate confusion. They can,\nhowever, be ultimately traced to the great watershed, and by their general direction from north-east to south-west they determine the course and direction of the drainage channels. The greater part of the District is included in the basin of the Ganges, the principal tributary of which is the Alaknand\u0101. This stream is formed by the junction of the Bishangang\u0101 with the Dhauligang\u0101, both rising near the watershed and flowing south-west, their upper courses being divided from that of the Mand\u0101kin\u012b, which joins the Alaknand\u0101 at Rudrapray\u0101g, by a massive spur of mountains. At Devapray\u0101g, on the border of Tehri State, the Alaknand\u0101 meets the Bh\u0101girathi, their valleys being separated by another lofty range. The combined stream now assumes the name of the Ganges, and from the point of junction separates Garhw\u0101l from Tehri and subsequently from Dehra D\u016bn. The great central axis of the Him\u0101layas, lying about 30 miles south of the watershed, includes two ranges of lofty snow-clad hills on either side of the Alaknand\u0101. From the eastern range, which culminates in the giant peak of Nand\u0101 Dev\u012b, a series of spurs divides the valleys of the Birehi, Mand\u0101kin\u012b, and Pindar, all tributaries of the Alaknand\u0101, from each other. Farther south the D\u016bd\u0101t\u014dli range forms the boundary between the Ganges basin and the R\u0101mgang\u0101, which drains the south-east of the District. The principal peaks are: Tris\u016bl, 23,382 feet; D\u016bnagiri, 23,181 feet; K\u0101met, 25,413 feet; Badr\u012bn\u0101th, 23,210 feet; and Ked\u0101rn\u0101th, 22,853 feet. The rivers flow in narrow valleys which may rather be described as gorges or ravines, and in their lower courses some of them are used for rafting timber. There are a few small lakes; but the Gohn\u0101 Lake is the only one of importance. A narrow strip of Bh\u0101bar or waterless forest land, some 2 or 3 miles in breadth, intervening between the southern base of the hills and the alluvial lowlands of Rohilkhand, forms the only level portion of the District.\n\nOn the south the narrow sub-Him\u0101layan zone displays a great sequence of fresh-water deposits resembling the geological formation of the Siw\u0101lik. The outer Him\u0101layan zone and central axis include enormous tracts of highland country and snowy peaks, composed in their southern half of slates, massive limestones sometimes succeeded by bands of mesozoic (?) limestone, and Nummulitic shales, and in their more northern portion of schistose slates, quartz-schists, and basic lava-flows. The schistose slates pass into mica-schists, with isolated patches of gneissose granites or massive bands, as along the central axis. To the north of the central axis, the Tibetan watershed, in the neighbourhood of the Niti pass, introduces an entirely new and vast sequence of marine strata from Silurian to Cretaceous, including a fine development of Trias.\n\nThe Bh\u0101bar and the hills immediately above it are covered with a dense forest growth, the principal tree being s\u0101l (Shorea robusta).\nFrom about 4,000 to 6,000 feet the place of sal is taken by chir (Pinus longifolia), which then yields to the banj oak (Quercus incana) and the tree rhododendron. Above 8,000 another oak, tilonj (Quercus dilatata), is found, and above 10,000 feet the chief trees are various firs, yew, and cypress. The birch grows up to 12,000 feet, but beyond this limit lies a vast expanse of grass, variegated in the summer by rich flowers of Alpine species.\n\nElephants are found in the Bh\u0101bar, and tigers in the same locality and in the lower hills. Leopards are common in all parts of the District. Three kinds of bear are known, and other beasts of prey include the wolf, jackal, and wild dog. Sambar or jaran and gural are also found. The District is rich in bird life, and the rivers contain fish, including mahseer.\n\nThe great variations in altitude cause a corresponding diversity in the climate of different parts of the District. In the Bh\u0101bar conditions resemble those of the adjacent submontane Districts. Heat is excessive in the river valleys from March to October, while the temperature falls very low in the winter. In open situations the climate is more equable.\n\nThe maximum rainfall occurs at the outer edge of the Him\u0101layas, and in the interior near the foot of the snows. In these localities the annual amount is about 100 inches. Where there are no high mountains the precipitation is much less, and at Srinagar only 37 inches are received, though in places of the same altitude situated near lofty ranges the fall is as much as 50 inches. The snow-line is at about 18,000 feet in the summer, but in the winter snow falls as low as 4,000 feet in the north of the District and 5,000 feet in the south.\n\nThe early history of Garhw\u0101l is extremely obscure. Part of it was probably included in the kingdom of Brahmapura referred to by the Chinese traveller of the seventh century. The earliest dynasty of which records exist was that of the Katy\u016bris. According to tradition, they had their origin at Joshimath in the north of the District, and thence spread to the south-east and into Almor\u0101. The country was subsequently divided among a series of petty chiefs. Local tradition states that a R\u0101j\u0101, named Ajaya P\u0101la, reduced the petty chiefs about the middle or close of the fourteenth century and settled at Dewalgarh; but a successor, named Mahipat Sh\u0101h, who lived early in the seventeenth century and founded Srinagar, was possibly the first of the line to establish real independence. The Garhw\u0101l R\u0101j\u0101s first came into conflict with their neighbours, the Chands of Almora, about 1581, when Rudra Chand attempted, but without success, to invade Garhw\u0101l. Subsequent attempts were also repulsed. In 1654 Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n dispatched an expedition to coerce R\u0101j\u0101 Pirth\u012b Sh\u0101h, which ended in the separation of Dehra D\u016bn from Garhw\u0101l. The same R\u0101j\u0101, a few years later, robbed the unfortunate refugee, Sulaim\u0101n Shikoh,\nson of D\u0101r\u0101 Shikoh, and delivered him up to Aurangzeb. Towards the close of the seventeenth century the Chand R\u0101j\u0101s again attempted to take Garhw\u0101l, and Jagat Chand (1708\u201320) drove the R\u0101j\u0101 from Srinagar, which was formally bestowed on a Br\u0101hman. Pradip Sh\u0101h (1717\u201372), however, recovered Garhw\u0101l, and held the D\u016bn till, in 1757, Najib Kh\u0101n, the Rohilla, established his authority there. In 1779 Lalat Sh\u0101h of Garhw\u0101l defeated the usurper who was ruling in Kumaun, and allowed his son, Parduman Sh\u0101h, to become R\u0101j\u0101 of that territory. A few years later, on the death of his brother, Parduman Sh\u0101h held both Garhw\u0101l and Kumaun for a year; but he then preferred the more certain tenure of his own dominions to the intrigues of Almor\u0101, and retired to Srinagar. The Gurkhas conquered Almor\u0101 early in 1790 and made an attempt on Garhw\u0101l, but withdrew owing to trouble with the Chinese in Tibet. Internal dissensions prevented another advance for some years; but in 1803 the Gurkhas overran Garhw\u0101l and also took Dehra D\u016bn. Parduman Sh\u0101h fled to the plains and collected a force, but perished near Dehra with most of his Garhw\u0101li retainers in 1804. The Gurkha rule was severe; and when the British conquered Kumaun in 1815, in consequence of aggressions by the Gurkhas, the change was hailed with delight by the hill-men. The whole Division was administered directly by a Commissioner; but in 1837 Garhw\u0101l became a separate subdivision under an Assistant Commissioner, and in 1891 was constituted a District.\n\nThe District contains a number of temples held sacred by the Hindus of all parts of India. Among these may be mentioned the shrines of Badr\u012bn\u0101th, Josh\u012bmath, Kedarn\u0101th, and P\u0101ndukeshwar. At Gopeshwar an iron trident 10 feet high bears an inscription of the twelfth century, recording the victories of Anekamalla, possibly a ruler of Nep\u0101l. Many copperplates are preserved in temples or by individuals, which are valuable for their historic interest.\n\nGarhw\u0101l contains 3 towns and 3,600 villages. Population is increasing steadily. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 310,288, (1881) 345,629, (1891) 497,818, and (1901) 429,900. The whole District forms a single tahsil, sometimes called Pauri from its head-quarters. The towns are the cantonment of Lansdowne, Srinagar, and Kotdw\u0101ra. Paur\u012b, the District head-quarters, is a mere village. The following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Number of Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|----------------------|----------------|--------------------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 5,629                | 3              | 3,600              | 429,900    | 76                        | + 5.4                                           | 27,410                                 |\nNearly 99 per cent. of the total are Hindus, and Musalmans number only 4,400. The density of population is low, as usual in Himalayan tracts. About 97 per cent. of the people speak the Garhw\u0101li dialect of Central Pah\u0101r\u012b.\n\nMore than 97 per cent. of the total Hindu population are included in three castes: R\u0101jputs or Kshattriyas (245,000), Br\u0101hmans (101,000), and Doms (68,000). The two former are subdivided into the descendants of settlers from the plains, and members of the great Khas tribe who are regarded as autochthonous. The Doms are labourers and artisans. Garhw\u0101lis and Kumaunis still preserve a certain degree of antagonism towards each other. The District is essentially agricultural, and agriculture supports 89 per cent. of the total. Two battalions of the Indian army are recruited entirely in Garhw\u0101l.\n\nThere were 588 native Christians in 1901, of whom 536 were Methodists. The American Methodist Mission was founded in 1859 and has a number of stations in the District.\n\nThe most striking feature of the cultivated area is its scattered nature. The richest land lies in the river valleys where these widen out, and in places the rivers have left a series of terraces. Elsewhere cultivation is confined to those parts of the hill-side which are the least steep, and even here terracing is required, each field being protected by an outer wall of stones. There is also some temporary cultivation, called katil, in which the land is not terraced. The shrubs and bushes are cut and burnt, and the land is dug with a hoe. After cropping it remains fallow for a number of years. In the extreme north crops are sown in the spring and reaped in the autumn; but in the greater part of the District two crops are grown, ripening in the spring and in the autumn, as in the plains. The Bh\u0101bar or submontane tract resembles the plains, but cultivation here entirely depends on irrigation.\n\nThe tenures are those of the Kumaun Division. Detailed agricultural statistics are not maintained, but the total cultivated area in 1903\u20134 was 410 square miles. The principal food-crops are rice, maru\u0101 (Eleusine coracana), jhangor\u0101 (Oplismenus frumentaceus), wheat, and barley. The District also produces small millets, amaranth, sesamum, peas, pulses, pepper, ginger, turmeric, and mustard. Rice grows up to about 5,000 feet, and jhangor\u0101 and maru\u0101 to about 6,000. Above that altitude amaranth is the chief autumn crop. Only one crop can be grown annually above 8,000 feet, and here ph\u0101par or buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) is largely cultivated. Wheat grows up to 10,000 feet, and barley and mustard up to 11,000 feet. In the Bh\u0101bar, maize, tobacco, and cotton are also cultivated.\n\nBetween 1864 and 1896 the cultivated area increased by about 50 per cent., and the rise in population is causing a further increase,\nApart from the fact that the area under the plough is rising, the cultivated land is also steadily improving. The soil on the hill-sides is usually very thin; and when fresh land is broken up, only a small excavation can be made in the first year. The soil is gradually improved by the weathering of rock and the annual cultivation, and the fields become broader and higher, the outer walls being gradually raised. There have, however, been no improvements in agricultural methods, and no new staples have been introduced. Advances from Government are taken only in adverse seasons, and 2\u00bd lakhs was advanced in 1890\u20131 and 1892\u20133.\n\nAbout two per cent. of the cultivated area is irrigated. In the hills irrigation is usually supplied by small channels conducted from rivers along the hill-sides to the fields. Only the smaller streams are used for this purpose, and the supply is effected entirely by gravitation, no artificial means of lifting being employed. Cultivation in the Bh\u0101bar is entirely dependent on irrigation, which is supplied by small canals.\n\nThe outer ranges of hills are covered with forests which have been formally \u2018reserved\u2019 and are administered by officers of the Forest department. Their area is 579 square miles. Bamboos and s\u0101l are the chief products, and firewood and grass are also extracted. The hills near Lansdowne are covered with pines and oak. In addition to these forests, the whole of the waste land has been declared \u2018District-protected\u2019 forest in charge of the Deputy-Commissioner, and simple regulations for conserving the forests have been framed, with beneficial results. The \u2018reserved\u2019 forests belong to the Ganges and Garhw\u0101l Forest divisions, and bring in a revenue of about 1\u00b75 lakhs annually, while the District forests yield about Rs. 20,000.\n\nCopper and iron were formerly worked to some extent, but only for local use, and little is extracted now. Minute quantities of gold are found in some of the rivers. Lead, arsenic, lignite, graphite, sulphur, gypsum, soapstone, asbestos, alum, and stone-lac have also been observed.\n\nThe manufactures of the District are few and unimportant. Hemp is woven into coarse cloth and rope, and blankets are made. Leathern goods, mats, baskets, wooden bowls, and glass bangles are made for local use. Stone is carved in one or two places.\n\nThe most important trade is with Tibet. Salt, wool, sheep and goats, ponies, and borax are imported, and grain, cloth, and cash exported. The trade is chiefly in the hands of the Bhoti\u0101s, who alone are permitted to cross the frontier, and the merchandise is carried on yaks, j\u016bbas (a cross between the yak and the cow), asses, sheep, and goats, or even by the Bhoti\u0101s themselves. In the west of the District there is\nsome trade with the State of Tehri, which exports grain in return for salt from Tibet. The borax from Tibet and some portion of the other imports are taken to Kotdw\u0101ra or R\u0101mnagar at the foot of the hills. Other exports include gh\u012b, chillies, ginger, and turmeric, the produce of the lower valleys, and forest products. The resources of the District are considerably increased by the pilgrim traffic to the sacred shrines, and by the money earned by the hundreds of men who work as coolies in the hill stations of Simla, Naini T\u0101l, and Mussoorie throughout the summer. Srinagar and Kotdw\u0101ra are the two chief marts in the District, but most of the trade is done in villages.\n\nA branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway from Najib\u0101b\u0101d to Kotdw\u0101ra just reaches the foot of the hills. There are 1,063 miles of road, of which only one mile is metalled. Of the total, 462 miles are maintained by the Public Works department, 352 miles being repaired at the cost of Provincial revenues. Avenues of trees are maintained on 6 miles. The roads are almost entirely bridle-paths, and in places are barely practicable for laden animals; but a cart-road is under construction from Kotdw\u0101ra to Lansdowne. The pilgrim route and the roads from Kotdw\u0101ra to Lansdowne and Srinagar are the chief tracks.\n\nGarhw\u0101l is more subject to distress from drought than the neighbouring District of Almor\u0101; but the scarcity is usually local. In 1867 the spring crops failed in the southern half of the District; Government advanced Rs. 10,000, and the people carried up grain from the Bh\u0101bar. The scarcity of 1869-70 was little felt, as the export of grain was forbidden. When traffic was allowed, large profits were made by the export of grain to Bijnor. The District suffered severely in 1877-8, when many deaths occurred from privation. In 1889-90 both the autumn and spring crops failed, and Government imported grain and gave advances. A similar failure in 1892, which affected most of the District, was met in the same way. In 1896 relief works were opened and Rs. 27,000 was spent; but the works were abandoned when the rate of wages was reduced below the market rate.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner is assisted by three Deputy-Collectors recruited in India, of whom one is stationed at head-quarters, one at Lansdowne, and one at Chamoli. Each of these is in charge of a subdivision of the District, the limits of which can be varied by the Deputy-Commissioner. There is only one tahsild\u0101r, who is posted to Paur\u012b, the District head-quarters.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner, the Deputy-Collectors, and the tahsild\u0101r all have civil, revenue, and criminal powers, the first named being District Judge. The Commissioner of Kumaun sits as a High Court in civil cases and as a Sessions Judge. Crime is very light.\n\nThe short rule of the Gurkhas was sufficiently harsh to cause a great diminution in the prosperity of Garhw\u0101l. A formal settlement of the\nland revenue was indeed made, but the local officers disregarded it. In the last year of the Gurkha government only Rs. 37,700 could be collected, out of a demand of Rs. 91,300. The first British settlement was made in 1815, as a temporary arrangement for one year, by farming whole parganas to the pargana headmen for the sum collected in the previous year, which yielded Rs. 36,000. Succeeding settlements were made by villages; but the revenue was still fixed on the basis of previous collections for a whole pargana at a time, and was distributed over villages by the village headmen. Six revisions were carried out between 1816 and 1833, and the revenue rose to Rs. 69,200. In 1822 the first attempt was made to prepare a rough record-of-rights, which consisted merely of a statement of the nominal boundaries of each village, an enumeration of the blocks of cultivation with the estimated area of each, and the names of the proprietors. In 1837 Garhw\u0101l was placed in charge of a separate officer temporarily subordinate to the Commissioner of Bareilly, who made the first regular settlement. Each village was inspected and a fresh estimate was made of the cultivated area, which was divided into six classes, according to its quality. The new demand was fixed for twenty years on a consideration of this estimate and of the previous fiscal history of the village, the total amounting to Rs. 68,700. At the same time a careful record-of-rights was prepared in great detail, and was the means of settling innumerable disputes. The next revision was preceded by a complete measurement of the cultivated area, and was carried out on a new plan. It was assumed, after calculating the out-turn of the principal crops, that terraced land generally was worth so much an acre. Land was divided into five classes, and a scale of relative value was fixed. The valuation was made by reducing the total area to a common standard and applying the general rate; but other checks were also used, and in particular the population of each village was considered. The revision was completed in 1864, and the demand was raised from Rs. 69,300 to Rs. 96,300. The revenue was collected in full with an ease unknown in any District of the plains. In 1890 preparations commenced for a new revision which was to be based on a scientific survey; but after a year's experience it was found that a complete survey would cost 5 lakhs, and the cadastral survey was completed for only 971 square miles. A modification of the system followed in the plains, by which villages are classified in circles according to their general quality, was introduced; but on the whole the methods of the previous settlement were adhered to, and a new valuation of produce and a revised scale of relative values were used to calculate the land revenue. In the area which was not surveyed cadastrally, the assessment was first fixed for each patli (a division of a pargana) and distributed in consultation with the village headmen. In the extreme north, the produce of the neigh-\nbouring jungles was also taken into account. The result was a total assessment of Rs. 1,66,000. The small Bh\u0101bar cultivation is treated for the most part as a Government estate on which rent is fixed by the Deputy-Commissioner. The gross revenue of the District is included in that of the Kumaun Division.\n\nThere are no municipalities in Garhw\u0101l, but two towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. Beyond the limits of these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which in 1903\u20134 had a total income of Rs. 61,000, chiefly derived from a grant from Provincial revenues. The expenditure in the same year was Rs. 64,000.\n\nRegular police are permanently maintained at Srinagar and at Kotdw\u0101ra, and during the pilgrim season at six other places. The whole force consists of 11 subordinate officers, 130 constables, and 6 town police, and is under the District Superintendent of Kumaun. Elsewhere there are no police, but the patw\u0101ris have powers corresponding to those of sub-inspectors in the plains. The District jail contained a daily average of 12 prisoners in 1903.\n\nGarhw\u0101l takes a very high place as regards the literacy of its inhabitants, of whom 6.4 per cent. (13 males and 0.2 females) could read and write in 1901. The number of public schools increased from 59 in 1880\u20131 to 76 in 1900\u20131, and the number of pupils from 2,746 to 2,813. In 1903\u20134 there were 118 such schools with 4,527 pupils, of whom only 15 were girls. All the pupils but 187 were in primary classes. The District also contained three private schools with 350 pupils. Two schools are managed by Government, and 101 by the District board, which contributed Rs. 22,000 out of a total expenditure on education of Rs. 31,000. Receipts from fees were only Rs. 1,200.\n\nThere are 10 hospitals and dispensaries with accommodation for 84 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 58,000, including 653 in-patients, and 1,514 operations were performed. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 12,000, about Rs. 10,000 of which is derived from endowments of land called sad\u0101b\u0101rt.\n\nAbout 41,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903\u20134, representing the very high proportion of 95 per 1,000 of population.\n\n[N.-W.

It is bounded on the north by Go\u0101lp\u0101ra District; on the east by the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills; and on the west\nand south by the Eastern Bengal Districts of Rangpur and Mymensingh. As its name implies, the greater portion of the District consists of hills, which form the western extremity of the range dividing the valleys of the Brahmaputra and the Surm\u0101. These hills rise sharply from the plain on the south, and attain their highest elevation in the Tur\u0101 and Arbela ranges, which lie parallel to one another, east and west, near the centre of the District. The highest peak, Nokrek (4,652 feet), is a little to the east of Tur\u0101 station. On the north a succession of low hills fall away towards the Brahmaputra. The ranges include many steep ridges separated from one another by deep valleys, and, except where they have been cleared for cultivation, are covered with dense forest. At the foot of the hills is a fringe of level land, into which outlying spurs project, but which otherwise does not differ from the adjoining plains. The principal river is the Someswari, which rises to the north of Tur\u0101 station and falls into the Kangsa river in Mymensingh. Other important streams flowing towards the south are the Bhugai, Nitai, and Maheshkh\u0101li, all of which are used for floating timber, while from the northern side of the watershed the Krishnai, Dudhnai, Jinjiram, and other minor streams fall into the Brahmaputra. There are no lakes or bh\u016bs in the hills, but near Phulb\u0101ri lies a large marsh, which is leased as a fishery. The general appearance of the District is wild and picturesque. Some of the rivers flow through rocky gorges, which are overgrown with trees, creepers, and giant ferns to the water's edge, and nowhere is the scenery tame or uninteresting. On a clear day a magnificent view over hill and plain is obtained from the summit of Tur\u0101 hill, and the course of the Brahmaputra can be traced for many miles.\n\nThe greater portion of the District is formed of gneissic rock, overlaid by sandstones and conglomerates belonging to the Cretaceous system. On the top of these rest limestones and sandstones of Nummulitic age, while sandstones of Upper Tertiary origin form low hills along the Mymensingh border.\n\nIn their natural condition the hills are covered with dense forest, most of which is evergreen, though s\u0101l and other deciduous trees are also found. Dense bamboo jungle springs up on land which has been cleared for cultivation and then left to fallow, and the bottoms of the valleys are often covered with high reeds and grass.\n\nThe hills abound in game, including elephants, tigers, leopards, bears, bison, deer, and a species of wild goat or serow (*Nemorhaedus bubalinus*); and in the low country buffalo and occasionally rhinoceros are found. In 1904, 17 persons were killed by wild animals, and rewards were paid for the destruction of 50 tigers and leopards and 54 bears. Since 1878 elephants have been hunted almost every year by the Government\nKhedda department, about 190 animals being annually captured; but operations have recently been suspended, to allow the herds a little rest. Small game include peafowl, jungle-fowl, partridges, snipe, pheasants, and hares; while excellent mahseer fishing is to be obtained in the rivers.\n\nThe whole of the District is malarious and unhealthy, and *kal\u0101 az\u0101r* here made its first appearance in Assam. This disease is an acute form of malarial poisoning, which has been a cause of dreadful mortality in the Brahmaputra Valley. The elevation is not, as a rule, sufficient to produce any material reduction in the temperature; but the heavy rainfall, and the evaporation which goes on over the immense expanse of forest, tend to cool the air during the rainy season. The rainfall is recorded only at Tur\u0101, where about 125 inches usually fall in the year. As in the rest of Assam, there is heavy rain in March, April, and May, a time when in Northern India precipitation is at its minimum.\n\nThe earthquake of 1897 was felt very severely in the G\u0101ro Hills, but as there are no masonry buildings in the District, the actual damage done was less than in other places. Violent storms frequently pass over the country at the foot of the hills in March and April. In 1900 two cyclones swept over this portion of the District, uprooting trees and destroying everything in their path. Fourteen persons were killed and nine injured, but more damage was done in the neighbouring District of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra.\n\nPractically nothing is known of the early history of the District. Ethnologically the G\u0101ros are a section of the great Bodo race, which at one time occupied a large part of the valley of the Brahmaputra, and were probably driven from the plains into the hills by early Hindu invaders from Bengal. The earliest notices of the G\u0101ros describe them as being in a state of intermittent conflict with the *zamind\u0101rs* of the large estates lying at the foot of the hills. These *zamind\u0101rs* were, in all probability, themselves sprung from the great Bodo stock to which the G\u0101ros belong, but in power and civilization had advanced far beyond their highland kinsmen. The exactions levied by the subordinates of these border chiefs irritated the hillmen, and the belief that the spirits of their headmen required the souls of others to attend them in the next world acted as a further incitement to the dispatch of raiding parties. At the end of the eighteenth century, the G\u0101ros inhabiting the outer ranges had been brought to some extent under the authority of the *zamind\u0101rs*, but the villages in the interior were entirely independent. As early as 1790 the British Government had tried to put an end to these disturbances by appointing one of the most powerful G\u0101ro chiefs a *zamind\u0101r* under the Company, but their efforts were frustrated by the turbulence of the Go\u0101lp\u0101ra *zamind\u0101rs*. In 1816 Mr. Scott was deputed\nto the frontier, and steps were taken to release the tributary G\u0101ros from the control of the Bengali landlords. It was difficult, however, to put down all oppression, and the hillmen continued to be turbulent. In 1848 an expedition was sent into the hills to punish the Dasanni G\u0101ros for having murdered one of their headmen, with all his family, because he attempted to collect the tribute due from them to Government. In 1852 seven G\u0101ro raids took place, in which 44 persons were killed, and a blockade was established along the frontier, which produced some effect; but in 1856 the tribes broke out again and successive raids were made upon the plains. Between May, 1857, and October, 1859, nine incursions were made into Go\u0101lp\u0101ra and 20 heads were taken. An expedition was dispatched into the hills in 1861, the effects of which lasted for a few years; but in 1866 a most murderous raid was made into Mymensingh District, and it was decided to post an officer, Lieutenant Williamson, in the hills. The success with which this experiment was attended was very striking. Raids ceased, and many independent villages submitted of their own accord. The hills were constituted a separate District in 1869. In 1870 the survey, which had been carried through the neighbouring hills, entered the District, and it was determined to take this opportunity of exploring independent G\u0101ro territory. No opposition was offered at first, but in the following year a survey coolly was seized and murdered by the villagers of Rongmagiri. An expedition was accordingly dispatched at the beginning of the cold weather, and in the summer of 1872 some villages, which had attacked G\u0101ros who had assisted the expedition, were punished by the Deputy-Commissioner. It was then decided that the whole of the country should be brought under control; and in 1872\u20133 three detachments of police marched through the independent territory from the south, north, and west. Little resistance was experienced, and since that date the history of the District has been one of profound peace.\n\nThe population of the G\u0101ro Hills rose from 121,570 in 1891, the first year in which a regular Census was taken, to 138,274 in 1901, or by 13.7 per cent. The people live in 1,026 villages, and the density of population is 44 persons per square mile. About 82 per cent. of the population in 1901 were still faithful to their animistic beliefs, 10 per cent. were Hindus, and 6 per cent. Muhammadans. The head-quarters of the American Baptist Mission are at Tur\u0101, and almost all the native Christians (3,629) are members of this sect. G\u0101ro is the language of 77 per cent. of the population, and 5 per cent. use Rabh\u0101, which is also a dialect of the Bodo group.\n\nAs the name of the hills implies, the great majority of the population are G\u0101ros, who numbered 103,500, or 75 per cent. of the whole. To these should be added nearly all the native Christians. Of the same stock are the Rabh\u0101s (7,700), the Kochs (4,300), and the Haijongs.\n(5,300), though the last two profess to be Hindus by religion. The language spoken by the Haijongs is akin to Bengali, but from their appearance it is evident that they have a large admixture of G\u0101ro blood. The economic organization of the hillmen is naturally of the most simple character, and 96 per cent. of the population returned agriculture as their means of livelihood in 1901.\n\nLinguistically, the G\u0101ros belong to the Bodo group, and there seem good grounds for supposing that they are members of the great Tibeto-Burman race, whose cradle is said to have been north-western China between the upper waters of the Yang-tse-kiang and the Ho-ang-ho. The Tibeto-Burmans sent forth successive waves of emigrants, who spread down the valley of the Brahmaputra and the great rivers, such as the Chindwin, the Irrawaddy, and the Mekong, that flow towards the south. The G\u0101ros are believed to be closely related to the K\u0101ch\u0101ris, Rabh\u0101s, Mechs, and other tribes inhabiting the Assam Valley, but to belong to a wave of immigrants subsequent to, and distinct from, that which left the Kh\u0101s\u012bs in the hills to the east. According to their own traditions, they came originally from Tibet and settled in Cooch Beh\u0101r. From there they were driven to the neighbourhood of Jogighop\u0101, where they remained 400 years, but were again compelled to fly towards the south by the king of the country and his ally, the ruler of Cooch Beh\u0101r. Their next wanderings were towards Gauh\u0101ti, where they were enslaved by the Assamese, but released by a Kh\u0101si prince, who settled them in the neighbourhood of Boko. The place was, however, infested with tigers, and the G\u0101ros then moved into the hills in which they are now found.\n\nThe name they use among themselves is not G\u0101ro, but Achikrang, 'hill people,' or Manderang, 'men.' The G\u0101ros classify themselves by geographical divisions (jal) and by exogamous septs (chachi), subdivided into maharis or families. There are altogether about fifteen jals, the most important of which are the Abeng, who live to the west of Tur\u0101, the Atong in the lower, the Matchi in the central, and the Matjangchi in the upper Someswari valley, the Awi and Akawi in the low country round D\u0101mr\u0101, the Chisak to the north of the Awi, the Mataabeng in the hills north of Tur\u0101, and the Migam on the borders of the Kh\u0101si Hills. The great majority of these divisions do not appear to denote racial distinctions. The Migam seem to have intermarried with the Kh\u0101s\u012bs, and the Atong have some connexion with the Kochs. There are differences of dialect, but customs, as a rule, are similar. The Abeng are the most numerous section, but the Atong have made more progress, and the Awi dialect is used in the publications of the Tur\u0101 mission, as they were the first G\u0101ros to come under missionary influence. There are two main exogamous septs, the Sangma and the Marak. A third sept called Momin is found among\nthe Awi. The septs are again divided into numerous families called maharis. There is no restriction on intermarriage between members of different jals, provided that they do not belong to the same sept. The village organization at the present day is of a very democratic character; but if their legends are to be believed, the G\u0101ros were originally ruled by chiefs. In appearance they are squat and sturdy, with oblique eyes, large head, thick lips, and large and ugly features, which have a peculiarly flattened appearance. In disposition they are cheerful and friendly.\n\nThe villages are often built on the side of the hills, and are unfortified, unlike those of the N\u0101g\u0101s and Lushais, who prior to the British occupation of their country lived in a perpetual state of warfare. They consist, in fact, of small hamlets, containing but a few houses, and in no other District in the Province are the villages so small. The houses are chiefly constructed of bamboo, and though one end rests on the earth, the other, which overhangs the slope of the hill, is supported on bamboo posts, and is some height above the ground. They are often from 80 to 100 feet in length, and are divided into different compartments; but, owing to the absence of windows, they are dark and gloomy, and the fire smouldering on the hearth serves only to accentuate the darkness.\n\nThe G\u0101ro costume is as scanty as is compatible with decency. The men wear a very narrow cloth, which is passed between the legs and fastened round the waist. The woman's cloth, which is also of the scantiest description, is fastened round the body below the navel, the two top corners meeting over the thigh; the bottom corners are left unfastened, as otherwise the petticoat would be too tight for comfort. The women load their ears with masses of brass earrings, and individuals have been seen with more than 60 brass rings, $6\\frac{1}{2}$ inches in circumference and weighing altogether just under 2 lb., in the lobe of a single ear. The lobe, though enormously distended, was not broken; but the weight of the rings was to a great extent supported by a string passed over the head. The G\u0101ro weapons consist of spear, sword, and shield. The sword, which is peculiar to these hills, is a two-edged instrument, the blade and handle forming one piece. The shield is composed of thin strips of bamboo woven together so as to be almost proof against a spear-thrust. The staple article of food is rice, but G\u0101ros will eat practically anything.\n\nThe G\u0101ros are not exclusive in matters matrimonial, and will intermarry with any persons except Jugis or sweepers. Owing to the conditions under which they live, mixed marriages are, however, far from common. The proposal comes from the family of the bride, and though his parents' consent must of course be obtained, the wishes of the person most concerned are sometimes not consulted. If he dislikes\nthe girl, the bridegroom runs away, and after he has done this and been recaptured twice or thrice, he is allowed to go for good and all. The essential portions of the ceremony are an address from the priest and the slaughter of a cock and hen. Divorce is recognized, and widows are allowed to marry, but are expected to marry in their husband's family. Polygamy is permitted, provided that the consent of the first wife be obtained. Contrary to the usual customs of the animistic tribes, girls who are heiresses are sometimes married before the age of puberty. Inheritance goes through the female, and property frequently passes through the daughter to the son-in-law. Where this is the case, the latter is compelled to marry his mother-in-law, if she is still alive, and a man not unfrequently occupies the position of husband towards mother and daughter at the same time. When a woman dies, the family property passes to her youngest, or occasionally to her eldest, daughter. The husband is, however, allowed to retain possession of the estate if he can succeed in obtaining one of his first wife's family as his second spouse. In spite of the liberal exposure of their persons, the women are chaste and make good and steady wives; and, as far as the orthodox standards of sexual morality are concerned, they compare favourably with the Kh\u0101si women, their neighbours on the east, who swathe themselves in a multitude of garments.\n\nThe dead are burned and the calcined bones buried in the neighbourhood of the homestead. The villagers are feasted, and in each house can be seen a bullock which is kept fatted up in preparation for the next funeral, and serves as a perpetual *memento mori*. A post is erected near the porch in memory of the deceased, and houses which have been in the same position for many years have sometimes as many as fifty posts, standing like a gigantic sheaf of corn before them. A great man's post is carved into a rude effigy of his features, clothed in his dress of state, and further ornamented with his umbrella and his head covering, if he had one.\n\nThe G\u0101ros appear to believe in a supreme deity and in a future life; but, as is usual in the hills, the greater part of their religious activities is devoted to the propitiation of evil spirits, who are supposed to be the cause of the misfortunes that befall them. The following is an accurate description of a G\u0101ro sacrifice:\n\n'The priest squatted before a curious flat shield of split bamboo and cane, and muttered strangely to himself, as though under the influence of some drug. A villager kept dragging a kid in a circle round and round the priest and his curious god, and each time as it passed the priest dabbed it on the head with a little flour and water. Finally a little of the mixture was forced into its mouth and it was summarily beheaded. The blood was allowed to pour upon a plate of rice, which, with the tail, was offered to the deity. The rest of the animal went to form part of the feast.'\nThe people, as a whole, are well-to-do, and have accumulated property. Some of their most treasured possessions are metal gongs, to which they attach a fictitious value. The intrinsic worth of these articles is small, and new gongs do not cost more than a few rupees, but one collection of 60 old ones is known to have been sold for Rs. 3,000, a large price to obtain from a semi-savage community.\n\nIn the hills the Garos cultivate their land on the system known as jhum. A spot of land is selected on the hill-side, and the jungle cut down during the cold season. Towards the end of March, the trees and brushwood are burned as they lie, and the rice crop is planted in April at the commencement of the rains. Shortly afterwards, the seeds of vegetables, cotton, pepper, and pulses are sown in the same clearing; and each crop is reaped in rotation as it comes to maturity. Miscellaneous crops include potatoes, arhar (Cajanus indicus), reared as food for the lac insect, ginger, indigo, and turmeric. In the second year, rice only is grown; and after two years' cultivation the clearing is abandoned and suffered to lie fallow for about ten years. Neither plough nor spade is used, except in the few Hinduized villages bordering on the plains. The sole implements of agriculture are a short dao fixed in a long handle with which jungle is cleared, and a small hoe. The cotton is short in staple and poor in quality, but contains a small proportion of seed and has been found suited for mixing with woollen fabrics.\n\nThere are no means of ascertaining the area under cultivation in the hills; but in the submontane villages, which contain a little over one-fourth of the total population, the land is measured every year by the local revenue officials. The area under the principal crops in this tract in 1903-4 was: rice 23,000 acres, mustard 3,700, and jute 1,800 acres; but in the District as a whole cotton is the most important staple after rice. The area under cultivation has expanded with the growing population, but no figures can be quoted to show the extent to which this has taken place. Irrigation is unknown; it would be impossible in the hills except with a system of artificially constructed terraces, and in the plains it is not required. Loans are occasionally made by Government to the cultivators, as there are very few money-lenders in the District, but only small sums are thus distributed.\n\nIn the hills cattle are used only for food, and are, as a rule, fat and sturdy animals, as the Garos, like other hill tribes, leave all the milk to the calf.\n\nThere are eighteen patches of 'reserved' forests dotted about the District, which cover altogether an area of 139 square miles. A considerable portion of these Reserves is stocked with sal (Shorea robusta), but the difficulty experienced in getting the timber to market has hitherto prevented them from being\nworked with any success. Other valuable trees are *sam* (*Artocarpus Chaplasha*), *gomari* (*Gmelina arborea*), *paroli* (*Stereospermum chelonoides*), and *koroi* (*Albizia procera*). On three occasions leases of the D\u0101mbu Reserve have been given to private persons on favourable terms; but in every case the concession was abandoned, as the holder found that he was unable to work it at a profit. The whole of the hills are covered with mixed evergreen and *s\u0101l* forest and bamboo jungle, in which the G\u0101ros are allowed to cultivate, and from which they may take anything which they require for their own use. Royalty must, however, be paid on all timber removed for sale. These forests are managed by the Forest department, and more timber is sold from them than from the Reserves.\n\nOutcrops of coal, all of which are of Cretaceous origin, have been found in the G\u0101ro Hills, from Samding in the north-west corner of the District to Siju, which is situated at the point where the Someswari river pierces the main range. The most important field is situated a little farther up the valley of that river in the neighbourhood of the Darangiri, but, though the quantity of coal is very large, the field has not been worked, owing to the lack of means of transport. A syndicate has recently obtained a prospecting licence. Petroleum oil has been found at Dholakh\u0101l in the Someswari valley. There are deposits of limestone in the valley of the Maheshkh\u0101li, and of fine potter's clay near the base of the Cretaceous rocks of the western range. None of these minerals is at present worked.\n\nThere are no special local manufactures in the hills. The G\u0101ro women weave a coarse cotton cloth for the scanty garments of themselves and the men, and baskets and bamboo mats are also made for sale. The cloth is generally coloured with a blue dye and ornamented with red stripes. Rude pottery is made in certain villages, but all metal utensils are imported.\n\nTrade is chiefly carried on at the small markets situated at the passes leading into the plains. The most important are: on the southern border, Khata, Mahendraganj, D\u0101lu, Ghoshgaon, and B\u0101ghm\u0101ra; on the north, N\u012bb\u0101ri; and on the north-west border, Phulb\u0101ri and Singrim\u0101ri. In the hills the two chief markets are at Tur\u0101 and G\u0101rob\u0101dha. The principal articles of export are cotton, timber and other forest produce, boats, chillies, and lac from the hills, and mustard and jute from the plains; the imports received in exchange consist of rice, dried fish, cattle, goats, fowls, pigs, cloth, and ornaments. The raw cotton is bought up by M\u0101rw\u0101ri merchants to be shipped to Sirajganj, but Tur\u0101 is the only place in which they have established shops.\n\nTwo cart-roads leave Tur\u0101, one to Rowmarigh\u0101t on the Brahma\nputra, the other to D\u0101lu on the Mymensingh border. A cart-road has also been constructed by the lessee of the D\u0101mbu forest to D\u0101mr\u0101, a distance of 24 miles; bridle-paths run to S\u0101lm\u0101ra and D\u0101mr\u0101. Altogether, 73 miles of cart-roads and 126 miles of bridle-paths were maintained by the Public Works department in 1903-4. The remaining means of communication are the tracks made by the G\u0101ros from one village to another.\n\nThe District does not contain any subdivisions, and only a small staff is employed on its administration. Public works are in charge of the Executive Engineer stationed at Dhubri, and the Administration. Forest officer is usually a native subordinate. The officer in charge of the civil and military police is generally invested with magisterial powers.\n\nThe G\u0101ro Hills are administered under a code of Regulations specially framed by the Chief Commissioner on their behalf. The High Court at Calcutta has no jurisdiction; and the Deputy-Commissioner is empowered to try civil suits of any value, and to pass sentence of death subject to confirmation by the Chief Commissioner. Petty criminal and civil cases are decided by village officers called laskars, who are also entrusted with the greater part of the duties assigned to the police in other Districts. The Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure are not in force, but the courts, though not bound by the letter, are guided by the spirit of these laws. In the G\u0101ro polity almost every form of wrong can be atoned for by the payment of pecuniary compensation; but the hillmen have no sense of a statute of limitations, and complaints are sometimes preferred with regard to offences and civil causes of action which occurred many years before. The people have now become peaceful and law-abiding, and there is little litigation either criminal or civil.\n\nLand revenue is not assessed in the hills, but the G\u0101ros pay a tax of Rs. 2 per house, irrespective of the area brought under cultivation. In the villages in the plains settlement is made annually with the cultivators, the ordinary rates charged being Rs. 3 per acre for homestead, Rs. 1-8-0 for transplanted rice land, and Rs. 1-2-0 for land growing other crops. About one-third of the settled area falls within the boundaries of the estates of the neighbouring zamind\u0101rs, who receive 75 per cent. of the collections, but are not allowed to interfere in the management. The total revenue of the District and the revenue realized from house tax are shown in the table on the next page, in thousands of rupees.\n\nThe peace of the District is maintained by a battalion of military police, with a sanctioned strength of 24 officers and 178 men, under the command of the District Superintendent of police. The civil police force consists of one sub-inspector and 66 head constables and\nmen, who are employed only in the villages at the foot of the hills. There is a small jail at Tur\u0101, with accommodation for 36 prisoners.\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue from house-tax | 14     | 35     | 40     | 40     |\n| Total revenue    | 46     | 1,05   | 1,18   | 1,84   |\n\nExclusive of forest revenue.\n\nEducation is in a very backward condition. The number of pupils under instruction in 1880-1, 1890-1, 1900-1, and 1903-4 was 458, 593, 1,538, and 1,870 respectively. At the Census of 1901 only 0.8 per cent. of the population (1.5 males and 0.2 females) were returned as literate. Primary education, which is largely in the hands of the American Baptist Mission, has made considerable progress of recent years. In 1903-4 there were 94 primary schools in the District, and one training school. The number of girls under instruction was 276. Of the male population of school-going age 15 per cent., and of the females 3 per cent., were under instruction. The expenditure on education was Rs. 11,000, of which only Rs. 98 was derived from fees.\n\nThe District contains 2 hospitals and 2 dispensaries, with accommodation for 15 in-patients. In 1904 the number of cases treated was 19,000, of whom 200 were in-patients, and 300 operations were performed. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 5,000, the whole of which was met from Provincial revenues.\n\nThe Garos are fully alive to the advantages of vaccination. In 1903-4, 77 per 1,000 of the population were protected, and nearly half the population were vaccinated between 1896 and 1900. The result is that small-pox has been almost stamped out in the hills, and deaths from that disease are very rare.\n\n[A.

Population (1901), 3,456. The town appears to have been originally a Bhil settlement, which fell to the Chandr\u0101wat R\u0101jputs of R\u0101mpura in the sixteenth century. Historically, Garot is important as the place from which Colonel Monson commenced his retreat before Jaswant Rao Holkar, which culminated in the disaster in the Mukundw\u0101ra pass, in 1804. At Piplia village, 4 miles north-east of Garot, Monson\u2019s rear-guard, under Lucan and\nAmar Singh of Koela, made the desperate stand against the whole Mar\u0101th\u0101 army which enabled Monson to retire. The cenotaph of Amar Singh still stands on the field; Lucan, whom Tod erroneously supposes to have been also killed, was taken to Kotah, where he died of his wounds. In 1811 Jaswant Rao Holkar was removed from Bh\u0101npura to Garot, as the madness from which he was then suffering was attributed to a local demon, who haunted the former place; later on he was taken back to Bh\u0101npura, and died there the same year. At one time the Sondhi\u0101s, who form the greater part of the surrounding population, caused much trouble by their turbulent behaviour, and a detachment of the Mehidpur Contingent was stationed in the town from 1834 to 1842.\n\nBesides the zila and pargana offices and the Subah\u012b\u2019s official residence, a school, a dispensary, and an inspection bungalow are situated in the town. The decrease in prosperity has been caused by its distance from roads and railways. It has lately, however, been made the head-quarters of the district, and the N\u0101gda-Mutra branch of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway will pass about 3 miles east of the town. A metalled road to Chandw\u0101sa, B\u0101lia, and R\u0101mpura is under construction.\n\n[J.

See Garauth\u0101.\n\nGarrauli.\u2014A petty sanad State in Central India, under the Bundelkhand Agency, with an area of about 37 square miles. Population (1901), 5,231. This j\u0101g\u012br was recognized by a sanad granted in 1812 by the British Government to Diw\u0101n Gop\u0101l Singh, Bundel\u0101, descended from a branch of the Orchh\u0101 family. Gop\u0101l Singh seized the pargana of Kotri during the invasion of Ali Bah\u0101dur, and was one of the most active and daring of the military adventurers who opposed the occupation of Bundelkhand by the British. For years he resisted all efforts of persuasion or force to reduce him to submission, and surrendered only when he saw the absolute hopelessness of further opposition. On the conditions of a full pardon and provision in land he submitted, an additional inducement being the grant for life of eighteen villages by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Pann\u0101. The present j\u0101g\u012brd\u0101r, Diw\u0101n Chandra Bh\u0101n Singh, succeeded his grandfather Parichhat as a minor in 1884, and was granted powers in 1904. In 1905, however, it was found necessary to put the administration under the chief\u2019s mother. The State contains 18 villages and a cultivated area of 11 square miles, and the revenue is Rs. 25,000. The chief place, Garrauli, is situated in 25\u00b0 5\u2032 N. and 79\u00b0 21\u2032 E., on the right bank of the Dhas\u0101n, 8 miles from Nowgong. Population (1901), 878.\n\nG\u0101rulia.\u2014Town in the Barrackpore subdivision of the District\nof the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 49' N.$ and $88^\\circ 22' E.$, on the east bank of the Hooghly river. Population (1901), 7,375. It is a busy industrial place, containing jute and cotton mills. The village of Sy\u0101mnagar is within the town. G\u0101rulia was included within the North Barrackpore municipality until 1896, when it was constituted a separate municipality. The income of the municipality during the eight years since its constitution has averaged Rs. 9,000, and the expenditure Rs. 8,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 18,000, including a loan of Rs. 5,000 from Government, while the same sum was realized from a tax on persons (or property tax). The expenditure was Rs. 13,000.\n\nG\u0101rvi.\u2014Petty State in the D\u0101ngs, Bombay.\n\nGarw\u0101.\u2014Town in the Pal\u0101mau District of Bengal, situated in $24^\\circ 10' N.$ and $83^\\circ 50' E.$, on the D\u0101nro river. Population (1901), 3,610. Garw\u0101 is the chief distributing centre for the surplus produce of the District, and of a great part of Surguj\u0101 State. Stick-lac, resin, catechu, cocoons of *tasar* silk, hides, oilseeds, *gh\u012b*, cotton, and iron are here collected for export; the imports are food-grains, brass vessels, piece-goods, blankets, silk, salt, tobacco, spices, drugs, &c. The market is held in the dry season on the sands of the D\u0101nro river.\n\nGauh\u0101ti Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of K\u0101mr\u016bp District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between $25^\\circ 43'$ and $26^\\circ 53' N.$ and $90^\\circ 56'$ and $92^\\circ 11' E.$, on both sides of the Brahmaputra, with an area of 2,584 square miles. It had a population in 1901 of 473,252, compared with 498,544 in 1891. It contains one town, Gauh\u0101ti (population, 11,661), the head-quarters of the District; and 1,116 villages. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 10,97,000. South of the river the country is much broken up by outlying spurs of the Assam Range and by isolated hills which crop up above the alluvium, but on the north a wide plain stretches right up to the frontier of Bhut\u0101n. The centre of this plain is densely populated, and in the Nalb\u0101ri *ta/s\u012b/ there are as many as 613 persons per square mile; but near the hills stretch large tracts of waste land, and the subdivision as a whole supports only 183 persons per square mile. The decrease during the last intercensal period was due to the ravages of *kal\u0101 az\u0101r*, malarial fever, and cholera. The average rainfall at Gauh\u0101ti is only 67 inches in the year, but nearer the hills, both on the north and south, it is as much as 75 or 80 inches. The majority of the population consist of respectable S\u016bdra castes, such as the Kalit\u0101 and Kewat, but a large tract lying between the Go hain Kamala Ali and the Bhut\u0101n hills is almost exclusively occupied by the K\u0101ch\u0101ri tribe. *S\u0101l\u012b*, or transplanted winter rice, forms the staple crop; but the subdivision was most injuriously affected by the earthquake of 1897, which covered some of the most valuable land with\ndeposits of sand, and increased the liability to flood, from which the District was never free, by disturbing the beds of rivers and drainage channels. Mustard and bao, a long-stemmed variety of winter rice, are grown near the Brahmaputra, and in recent years jute has been raised on a commercial scale. The K\u0101ch\u0101ris in the north irrigate their fields from the hill streams; elsewhere drains and embankments rather than irrigation channels are required. The tea industry is of comparatively small importance. In 1904 there were 19 gardens with 3,659 acres under plant, which gave employment to 7 Europeans and 2,411 natives. The subdivision contains many places which are objects of pilgrimage to the devout Hindu, such as K\u0101m\u0101khya, H\u0101jo, Basistha, Um\u0101nanda, Aswakr\u0101nta opposite Gauh\u0101ti, where the footprint of Krishna is to be seen embedded in the rock, and Chitr\u0101chal, where there is a temple dedicated to the nine planets, which marked the eastern boundary of old Gauh\u0101ti.\n\nGauh\u0101ti Town (Goa-hathi = \u2018high land covered with areca-palms\u2019)\u2014Head-quarters of K\u0101mr\u016bp District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 26\u00b0 11\u2032 N. and 91\u00b0 45\u2032 E., on both banks of the Brahmaputra river. The principal portion of the town is, however, on the left or southern bank. This lies on the trunk road from Bengal to Sadiya, and is the terminus of the Assam Valley branch of the Assam-Bengal Railway. A line is under construction along the north bank of the Brahmaputra, which will connect the northern portion with Calcutta by the Eastern Bengal State Railway. An excellent metalled road runs from South Gauh\u0101ti to Shillong, the head-quarters of the Province. A steam ferry crosses the Brahmaputra, and the town is a port of call for the river steamers. The population of North and South Gauh\u0101ti in 1901 was 14,244. The majority of the inhabitants, as in most of the towns of Assam, are foreigners. Modern Gauh\u0101ti is identified with Pr\u0101gjyotishapura, the capital of king Bhagadatta, who is mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. Its subsequent history is uncertain, but in the sixteenth century it was included in the Koch kingdom. In the seventeenth century it was the sport of the armies of the Muhammadans and Ahoms, and in the short space of fifty years was taken and retaken no less than eight times. In 1681 the Muhammadans were driven out of K\u0101mr\u016bp, and from that time onward Gauh\u0101ti became the residence of the Ahom governor of Lower Assam. In 1786, when Rangpur was captured by the Moamarias, the Ahom R\u0101j\u0101 transferred his capital to Gauh\u0101ti. The extensive earthworks which protect it on the land side, the numerous large tanks, and the brick and masonry remains which are found in every direction beneath the soil, all clearly show that the place was originally an important city, with a considerable population, which occupied both banks of the Brahmaputra. The portion which lies on the north of the river is said to have been bui\nby Parikshit, a Koch king who flourished at the end of the sixteenth century, and was the ancestor of the present Bijni family. By the end of the eighteenth century Gauh\u0101ti had, however, fallen from its high estate, and Buchanan Hamilton, writing in 1809, describes it as a 'very poor place.' From 1826, when Assam was ceded to the British, till 1874, when the Province was separated from Bengal, Gauh\u0101ti was the head-quarters of the Assam Division, and it is still the head-quarters of the Commissioner and the Judge of the Assam Valley Districts, as well as of the ordinary District staff. The most noteworthy event in its recent history was the earthquake of 1897, which destroyed all the Government offices and wrecked every masonry building in the place. The town has since been rebuilt, and hardly any traces are now to be seen of this great catastrophe. The situation of Gauh\u0101ti is extremely picturesque. To the south it is surrounded by a semicircle of thickly wooded hills, while in front rolls the mighty Brahmaputra, which during the rains is nearly a mile across. In the centre of the stream lies a rocky island, the farther bank is fringed with graceful palms, and the view to the north is again shut in by ranges of low hills. Such a site, though beautiful, is far from healthy, and at one time the mortality in the town was very high. Improvements in the drainage and water-supply have done much to remedy this defect, but owing to its sheltered situation and the comparatively low rainfall (67 inches) the climate in the summer is rather oppressive. In addition to the ordinary public buildings, there are a town hall, a hospital with 29 beds, and a jail with accommodation for 352 prisoners. The convicts are chiefly employed on gardening, oil-pressing, and weaving. Branches of the American Baptist Mission and of the Roman Catholic Mission are located in the town, while the numerous temples situated in Gauh\u0101ti itself and in its immediate vicinity render it an object of pilgrimage to Hindus from all parts of India.\n\nGauh\u0101ti was constituted a municipality, under (Bengal) Act V of 1876, in 1878, and (Bengal) Act III of 1884 was subsequently introduced in 1887. The municipal receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 43,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 49,000, including taxes on houses and lands (Rs. 8,900), water rate (Rs. 10,000), revenue from markets and slaughterhouses (Rs. 5,400), and a contribution from Provincial revenues (Rs. 10,000). The expenditure was Rs. 51,000, the chief items being water-supply (Rs. 10,600), conservancy (Rs. 16,800), and public works (Rs. 11,200). The water-supply is pumped from the Brahmaputra, passed through filtering beds, and distributed by standpipes all over the town. Since the completion of these works in 1887, cholera, which used to be very prevalent, has almost disappeared. The town is the principal centre of trade in Lower Assam. The exports to Calcutta consist of mustard\nseed, cotton, silk, cloth, lac, and other forest produce; the principal imports are salt, cotton piece-goods and thread, grain and pulse, and kerosene and other oils. Nearly the whole of the business is in the hands of M\u0101rw\u0101ri merchants, who have recently made some attempt to work up raw material obtained from the Assamese instead of exporting it in that condition to Calcutta. Two steam mills have been started for cotton-ginning, flour-grinding, and the manufacture of mustard oil. The larger mill has a daily out-turn of about 1,200 gallons of oil. The chief educational institutions are a second-grade college\u2014the Cotton College\u2014which teaches up to the First Arts standard, and two high schools. The Government school was opened in 1835 and the college in 1901. In 1903-4 the college had an average attendance of 64 students.\n\nGaur.\u2014Ruined city and ancient capital in M\u0101l\u0101 District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 24\u00b0 54' N. and 88\u00b0 8' E., on a deserted channel of the Ganges. The date of the foundation of the city is involved in obscurity, and the whole course of its history down to the day when it was finally deserted is only to be conjectured. It is known, however, that it was the metropolis of Bengal under its Hindu kings; and local traditions connect some of its ruins with the names of Ball\u0101l Sen and Lakshman Sen, from the last of whom it took the name Lakshmanavat\u012b or Lakhnaut\u012b. The name Gaur is also of great antiquity, but was more strictly applicable to the kingdom (called Gauri\u0101 Bang\u0101l\u0101) than to the city. It is, according to Cunningham, derived from gaur, the common name for molasses or raw sugar, for which this country has always been famous, the city being, in all probability, the great export mart for all the northern Districts in the days when the Ganges flowed past it. The recorded history of Gaur begins with its conquest in 1198 by the Muhammadans, who retained it as the chief seat of their power in Bengal for more than three centuries, and erected numerous mosques and other buildings, a few of which yet remain in a tolerable state of preservation. After the Afgh\u0101n kings of Bengal established their independence, they founded about 1350 another capital, called Firoz\u0101b\u0101d, at P\u0101ndua, which appears to have been the seat of government till the capital was again transferred to Gaur by Jal\u0101l-ud-din Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h seventy years later. From that time, the royal residence remained at Gaur, which was known by various names, such as Jannat\u0101b\u0101d, or the 'abode of paradise,' Fateh\u0101b\u0101d, Husain\u0101b\u0101d, and Nusrat\u0101b\u0101d, the first name being given to it by Hum\u0101y\u016bn during his residence here in 1538. After the conquest of Bengal by Sher Sh\u0101h in 1539, the seat of government was again removed to T\u0101nd\u0101 or T\u0101nr\u0101, a few miles south-west of Gaur, on the bank of the then main channel of the Ganges, which was gradually receding westwards; and shortly afterwards Gaur was depopulated by pestilence when Munim Kh\u0101n, after defeating Daud Sh\u0101h, the last of the Afgh\u0101n dynasty, who\nhad denied the suzerainty of the emperor Akbar, proceeded here with his army during the rainy season of 1575. Thousands of the troops and inhabitants died daily; the people were unable to bury or burn the dead; and the corpses of Hindus and Musalmans alike were thrown into the marshes and tanks, and into the adjoining river Bh\u0101grathi. The few people that survived the plague left the city; and the imperial general, who had resolved to maintain Gaur as the seat of the government and to restore its former magnificence, himself fell a victim to the general contagion. Gaur was never again populated to any extent, although various additions were made to its buildings from time to time, such as the Luk\u0101churi, or eastern gate of the fort, which was erected by Sult\u0101n Shuj\u0101 in 1650. This prince was a disciple of Ni\u0101mat-ullah-Wali, a saint who lived in Firozpur, the southern suburb of Gaur, where his tomb still exists; and though his capital was at R\u0101jmah\u0101l, he appears to have spent some time in this city.\n\nThe final desertion of Gaur dates from the time when the Mughal viceroys removed the seat of government to Dacca and Murshid\u0101b\u0101d; but as late as 1683, when William Hedges visited the place, the palace and most of the buildings were fairly intact. The greatest damage done to the ruins has, however, been due to human agency. They have been a quarry not only for the brick houses of the neighbouring towns and villages, but also for the mosques, palaces, and public monuments of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d; and the towns of Old M\u0101lda and English B\u0101z\u0101r have been constructed almost entirely with bricks from Gaur. Mr. Reuben Burrow, who visited the ruins in the year 1787, wrote as follows:\n\n'These tombs were not long ago in perfect order and were held in a manner sacred, till they were torn to pieces for the sake of stone; indeed such of the gates as happened to have no stone in them are almost perfect; but wherever a piece of stone happened to be placed, the most elegant buildings have been destroyed to get it out, so that there is now scarce a piece left except a part in the round tower, which happens to have been preserved by the peculiar construction of the building.'\n\nMr. Creighton, who was in charge of the indigo factory at Gomalti towards the end of the eighteenth century, wrote:\n\n'R\u0101jmah\u0101l, M\u0101lda, and Murshid\u0101b\u0101d for centuries have been supplied from hence with materials for building, and bricks and stones are continually carried away to other parts of the country on carts, bullocks, and in boats by the natives for the purpose of modern edifices.'\n\nAccording to Grant, the Viz\u0101mat Daftar received Rs. 800 annually from two local zamind\u0101rs as a fee for the privilege of demolishing the venerable ruins, and stripping from them their highly-prized enamelled tiles and the so-called Gaur marble. During the last fifty years, however, extensive clearances of jungle have been effected, and the\nwanton destruction of the buildings has been stopped; but the damage already done is unfortunately irreparable. Dr. Buchanan Hamilton, who visited Gaur in 1819, has left an elaborate description of the ruins as they then appeared, from which the following account is mainly condensed. It must be remembered, however, that their dilapidation rapidly advanced since that time till within a few years ago, when it was stopped by Government.\n\nThe city with its suburbs covered an area variously estimated at from 22 to 30 square miles; and the dimensions of the city proper were about $7\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in length from north to south, and from 1 to 2 miles in breadth, giving a total area of about 13 square miles. The west side of the city was throughout washed by the main stream of the Ganges, the eastern side being protected partly by the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 and partly by a line of perennial swamps, representing a former channel of the Ganges. To the south but little protection was needed, for the junction of the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 and the Ganges a little lower down would have prevented an invader from choosing such a circumscribed base of operations. To the north, which was the most accessible quarter, an artificial bulwark was required; and this was afforded by a line of fortifications about 6 miles in length, extending in an irregular curve from the old channel of the Bh\u0101girathi at Son\u0101tal\u0101 to near the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 at Bhol\u0101 H\u0101t. This rampart, which was mainly composed of earth, was about 100 feet wide at its base. At the north-east part of the curve was a gate protected by a strong projecting outwork in the form of a quadrant, through which a high embanked road passed north and south.\n\nNorth of the rampart was the site of the ruins of the palace where Ball\u0101l Sen is said to have resided, consisting, like the palace at R\u0101mpal in Dacca District, of a square of about 400 yards surrounded by a ditch. No trace, however, can now be found of these ruins, which were still extant in the time of Buchanan Hamilton. Behind the rampart was the northern suburb of the city. It was of vast extent, in the shape of a quadrant of a circle, with an area of about 6,000 square yards. The eastern portion is now occupied by marshes, but the western portion near the Bh\u0101girathi is enclosed by earthworks and contains the remains of many public buildings. Here is situated the S\u0101gard\u012bghi, the most celebrated artificial piece of water in Bengal, which was formed by deepening and embanking natural hollows existing in the high clay lands. Its dimensions are nearly 1,600 yards from north to south and more than 800 yards from east to west. The banks are occupied by Muhammadan buildings, of which the most conspicuous is the tomb of Makhdum Shaikh Akhi Sir\u0101j, one of the saints of Gaur, who came here from Delhi and died in 1357. In the neighbourhood are the two most frequented places of Hindu pilgrimage in the District: namely, S\u0101dullahpur gh\u0101\u1e6d and the Du\u0101rb\u0101sin\u012b shrine. The\ngh\u0101t, which formed the chief descent to the old bed of the Ganges, is said to have been the only burning gh\u0101t which the Muhammadan rulers allowed their Hindu subjects to use, and dead bodies of Hindus are still brought here from great distances to be burned.\n\nImmediately to the south lies the city itself, which towards each suburb and along the Ganges was defended by a strong rampart and a ditch. On the side facing the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 the rampart was doubled, and in most parts there were two, and in some parts three, immense ditches. These works were designed for embankments against inundation, and were utilized as drains and as fortifications, the double embankment having, apparently, been constructed to prevent the Ganges from cutting away the site of Gaur, when the main body of its water began to gravitate westwards in the early part of the sixteenth century. The encroachments of the river were successfully checked by these works, combined with the hardness of the clay of the high lands on which Gaur was built; and the Ganges cut fresh channels west of the embanked city, instead of sweeping it away. The base of the outer embankment was measured in one place by Mr. Creighton and found to be 150 feet thick. By far the greater portion of the city appears to have been densely inhabited. Broad roads from east to west traversed the northern portion at irregular intervals; and there were also water channels affording easy communication between different parts of the city, as well as a regular system of drainage for carrying off the rain-water to the large natural and artificial reservoirs. Somewhat to the south, on the banks of the Bh\u0101girathi, was the citadel or k\u012bla, a work evidently of the Muhammadan period, extending in the form of an irregular pentagon about a mile in length from north to south and about 600 to 800 yards broad. The rampart which encircled this was strongly built of earth and brick, with many flanking angles and bastions. The main entrance was to the north through a noble gate called the D\u0101khil Darwaza, the erection of which is ascribed to B\u0101rbak Sh\u0101h (1459\u201374). The palace at the south-east corner of the citadel was surrounded by a wall of brick, 66 feet high and 18 feet broad at the base and $8\\frac{1}{2}$ feet at the top; only a portion of this wall, which is called the Baisg\u0101z\u012b wall or Ghordaur ('racecourse'), is still standing. In the interior the remains of several cross-walls are visible, but the arrangement of the apartments cannot be ascertained. A little north of the palace were the royal tombs, where Al\u0101-ud-din Husain and other independent kings of Bengal were buried, but these have now entirely disappeared. Within the citadel close to the Luk\u0101churi Gate is the Kadam Ras\u016bl mosque, erected in 1530 over a stone bearing the impression of Muhammad's foot. It is still used as a place of worship, and is consequently in fairly good preservation. Near it is the Chikk\u0101 mosque, so called from the number of bats infesting its interior, which,\naccording to some traditions, was used not as a mosque but as a courthouse or a prison. Just outside the east wall of the citadel stands a lofty tower known as the Firoz Min\u0101r. Local tradition ascribes this tower to the reign of Al\u0101-ud-din Husain Sh\u0101h; and a plausible hypothesis is that Firoz Min\u0101r is a translation of the Sanskrit Jai Stambha, or 'tower of victory,' and that it was erected by Husain Sh\u0101h after the conquest of Assam. According to some writers, it was built by Saif-ud-din Firoz. Farther away along the eastern wall of the citadel stand the Tantip\u0101ra and Lotan mosques, both of which date from 1475-80. The former is famous for its moulded brickwork. The latter, which consists of a single chamber 34 feet square, with a corridor in front 34 feet by 11 feet, is the only building with glazed tiles which has escaped the vandal despoilers of previous generations. The name Lotan has been explained as a corruption of natin or 'dancing girl,' the tradition being that the mosque was erected by a woman of that profession.\n\nAbout a mile and a half north of the citadel is a plot of land of 600 square yards surrounded by a rampart and a ditch, known as the Flower Garden. South-east of this is the Piy\u0101sb\u0101ri, or 'abode of thirst,' a tank of considerable dimensions. It is said to have formerly contained brackish water, and tradition relates that condemned criminals were allowed to drink nothing but the water from this tank, and thus perished of thirst. Between the Piy\u0101sb\u0101ri and the citadel is the Great Golden mosque, generally known as the Baradarw\u0101z\u012b of R\u0101mkel, which is 180 feet from north to south, 60 feet from east to west, and 20 feet high to the top of the cornice; it was formerly covered with 33 domes, and was built by Nusrat Sh\u0101h in 1526. Another structure of considerable interest was the fine central gate in the south wall of the city, which fell to pieces in the earthquake of 1897. It was called the Kotw\u0101li Darw\u0101z\u0101, presumably from the circumstance that the superintendent of police was stationed here.\n\nSouthwards from this gate stretches an immense suburb called Firozpur. It extends as far as Pukhariy\u0101, a distance of about 7 miles, though its width is comparatively small, and it bears abundant traces of having been at one time densely populated. Towards the east and south lay an embankment and a ditch, probably designed to ward off the floods, which have now formed long marshes in that direction. The most prominent building in this suburb is the Golden or Eunuch's mosque, erected during the reign of Husain Sh\u0101h, which is called the Small Golden mosque to distinguish it from that mentioned above. It has some very fine carvings and is the best preserved mosque with stone facings at Gaur. Another monument of some interest is the tomb of Ni\u0101mat-ullah Wali, the spiritual guide of Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101, which is to this day carefully tended by his descendants.\n\nGovernment has since 1900 taken steps for the preservation of certain\nof the more interesting or prominent buildings: namely, the Firoz Min\u0101r, the Kadam Ras\u016bl mosque, the Great Golden mosque, and the Small Golden mosque; the tomb of Fateh Kh\u0101n (said to have been a son of Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n, a general of Aurangzeb), situated outside the enclosure of the Kadam Ras\u016bl; the east gate of the fort, called Luk\u0101churi, which was built by Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101 when he temporarily endeavoured to revive the city long after its desertion; the Chikk\u0101 mosque near the palace; the D\u0101khil Gate, forming the northern entrance to the fort; the Tantip\u0101ra mosque; and the Lotan mosque.\n\n[M.

Population (1901), 7,965. Gaur\u0101 is administered, together with Barhaj, under Act XX of 1856. There are several sugar factories, but not much trade besides.\n\n**Gaurih\u0101r.**\u2014A petty sanad State in Central India, under the Bundelkhand Agency, with an area of 73 square miles. Population (1901), 7,760. The chief is a Jijhotia Br\u0101hman. His ancestors originally held the village of Mah\u0101pura (now in Charkh\u0101ri). R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101m Tiw\u0101r\u012b was governor of the fort of Bhuragarh (B\u0101nd\u0101 District), under R\u0101j\u0101 Gum\u0101n Singh of Ajaigarh; but during the confusion caused by Ali Bah\u0101dur\u2019s invasion, he rebelled and became the leader of a marauding band. The Ajaigarh chief was unable to reduce him to order, and the British, after their occupation of Bundelkhand, were obliged to offer a reward of Rs. 30,000 for his capture. R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101m, however, thereupon surrendered, on the condition that he should receive land on terms similar to those granted to the other Bundel\u0101 chiefs. The grant was made in 1807. R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101m died in 1846, and was succeeded by R\u0101jdhar Rudra Singh Tiw\u0101r\u012b, who rescued some Europeans during the Mutiny, and was rewarded with the title of Rao Bah\u0101dur and a khilat of Rs. 10,000. In 1862 he received a sanad of adoption. The present chief is Prithvip\u0101l Singh, who was born in 1886 and succeeded in 1904. The State contains 22 villages. Of the total area, 12 square miles, or 16 per cent., are cultivated, and 39 square miles, or 53 per cent., are cultivable; the rest is jungle and waste. The chief administers the estate when not a minor, but all serious matters are referred to the Political Agent for disposal. The revenue is Rs. 27,000. The chief place, Gaurih\u0101r, is situated in 25\u00b0 15' N. and 80\u00b0 12' E., 15 miles by country track from B\u0101nd\u0101, on the Jhansi M\u0101nikpu\nsection of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 1,457.\n\n**Gauripur.**\u2014A permanently settled estate in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 25\u00b0 38' and 26\u00b0 19' N. and 89\u00b0 50' and 90\u00b0 6' E., and consisting of parganas Ghurl\u0101, J\u0101mir\u0101, Makrampur, and Kalumalup\u0101ra, with other smaller parganas. The estate covers an area of 583 square miles, and the rent roll is about Rs. 2,34,000; but the land revenue demand is only Rs. 5,396, and the demand on account of local rates Rs. 25,000. This extremely low rate of assessment is due to the fact that under Mughal rule Go\u0101lp\u0101ra was a frontier District. The zam\u012bnd\u0101rs were required to keep the peace of the marches, and in return to pay a tribute that was little more than nominal. At the time of the Permanent Settlement this tribute was accepted as the land revenue, though no settlement was ever made in detail, and it is doubtful whether the District ever came within the purview of the Permanent Settlement at all. The family seat of the zam\u012bnd\u0101r is at Gauripur, which is a flourishing village about 6 miles north of Dhubri. It contains a high school, a dispensary, and a busy market. A colony of M\u0101rw\u0101ri merchants carry on a large trade in jute, grain, and piece-goods; and the place contains blacksmiths, wheelwrights, potters, goldsmiths, confectioners, and the complement of shopkeepers and artisans found in a small Indian town.\n\n**Gautampur\u0101.**\u2014Town in the Indore district of Indore State, Central India, situated in 22\u00b0 59' N. and 75\u00b0 35' E., 33 miles north-west of Indore city, and 3 miles from the Chambal Station on the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. It is usually called Runaji-Gautampur\u0101, to distinguish it from other towns of the same name. Population (1901), 3,103. The town is comparatively a modern one, having been founded by Gautama Bai, wife of Malh\u0101r Rao Holkar (1728-66), after whom it was called. A curious concession was made regarding residence in the town, all malefactors, even murderers, being safe from pursuit within its walls. Under the patronage of the R\u0101n\u012b and her famous daughter-in-law, Ahaly\u0101 Bai, the place soon reached a flourishing state. Gautampur\u0101 is reputed for its calico-printing industry, the products of which find a ready market at Indore and in the neighbourhood. A committee has been lately (1905) constituted for the control of municipal affairs. In the town are a large temple to Siva as Achaleshwar Mah\u0101deo, built by Gautama Bai, several smaller edifices, and a monastery of the R\u0101msaneh\u012b sect of devotees, besides a school and a dispensary.\n\n**Gavrid\u0101d.**\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\n**G\u0101wilgarh Hills.**\u2014A hill range in Ber\u0101r, which branches off from the S\u0101tpur\u0101 mountains, and lies between 21\u00b0 10' and 21\u00b0 47' N. and 76\u00b0 40' and 77\u00b0 53' E. It is named from the fort of G\u0101wilgarh,\nwhich is situated on its southern side. The range is mentioned in the *Jin-i-Akbari* under the name of Banda. It passes in a south-westerly direction through Betul, the Melghat or upland country of Amraoti, and the southern portion of Nimar, terminating at the junction of the Tapti with its principal tributary, the Purna. In the Melghat the crest of the range attains an average elevation of 3,400 feet above sea-level, the highest point, Bairat, being 3,989 feet. The mean height of the lower hills, bordering on the Tapti, is about 1,650 feet. The range is composed of Deccan trap, of the Upper Cretaceous or lower eocene group. The chief passes are Malbar on the east, Deulghat on the west, and Bingara on the extreme west; the first two have been made practicable for wheeled traffic, and the same may be said of communications in the Melghat generally.\n\n**Gawilgarh Fort.**\u2014A deserted hill fortress in the Satpuras, in the Melghat taluk of Amraoti District, Berar, situated in 21\u00b0 22' N. and 77\u00b0 23' E., on the watershed between the Purna and Tapti rivers, at an elevation of 3,595 feet. It is impossible to say when the Gawilgarh hill was first fortified, but the name seems to point to its having been at one time a Gaoli stronghold. The fort as it stands is the work of Muhammadan builders, and cannot be assigned to an earlier date than that given by Firishta, who tells us that it was built by the Bahmani king, Ahmad Shah Wali, when he halted at Ellichpur from 1425 to 1428. It was improved and thoroughly repaired in 1488 by Fath-ullah Imad-ul-mulk, as appears from a partially obliterated inscription over the south-western gate. Imad-ul-mulk, who as viceroy of the province under the *rai faizan*, Mahmud Shah Bahmani, had been for some years the actual ruler of Berar, was forced in 1490 by the pretensions of the minister, Amir Barid, to proclaim himself independent. He founded the short-lived Imad Shahi dynasty, whose principal stronghold was Gawilgarh. The fort was again improved and repaired in 1577 by the officers of Murtaza Nizam Shah of Ahmadnagar, owing to a premature report that Akbar was marching on the Deccan. The Burj-i-Bahr\u0101m, a bastion in the south-west face, contains an inscription recording its construction by Bahr\u0101m Kh\u0101n on this occasion. The date (A.H. 985 = A.D. 1577) is given in a chronogram.\n\nThe fort was captured from the officer who held it on behalf of the king of Ahmadnagar by Saiyid Yusuf Khan Mashhadi and Shaikh Abul Fazl in 1597-8, less than two years after Berar had been formally ceded to Akbar. In the second Maratha War the fortress was held by Beni Singh for Raghuji Bhonsla, and was stormed by General Arthur Wellesley on December 15, 1803. It was dismantled in 1853.\n\nThe principal building still standing in the fort is the large masjid, a handsome stone building in the Pathan style of architecture. The front of the mosque is formed of seven arches, the central arch being\nslightly higher than the rest: and the covered portion was formerly three arches deep, and had twenty-one domes, but the western wall has fallen away and carried with it a row of domes, so that only fourteen now remain. A low minaret at the north-eastern angle has some handsome stone lattice-work. The gate now known as the Delhi Gate has two bas-reliefs, each representing a double-headed eagle holding elephants in its beaks and claws. This bird is the fabulous gandabherunda, the emblem of the Hindu empire of Vijayanagar in the Carnatic; and the occurrence of the emblem on a gate of the old military capital of Ber\u0101r is particularly interesting, for it enables us to assign the gate to Fath-ull\u0101h Im\u0101d-ul-mulk, who was, as Firishta tells us, a Br\u0101hman of Vijayanagar captured in boyhood and brought up as a Musalm\u0101n. The gandabherunda on the Delhi Gate is a proof that he was proud of his origin.\n\nGay\u0101 District. District in the Patna Division of Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 17' and 25\u00b0 19' N. and 84\u00b0 0' and 86\u00b0 3' E., with an area of 4,712 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Patna District; on the east by Monghyr and Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh; on the south by Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh and Pal\u0101mau; and on the west by Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d, from which it is separated by the Son river.\n\nThe southern part of the District is elevated and occupies the declivity from the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, from which numerous ridges and spurs project into the plains. About 10 miles south of Gay\u0101 town the surface becomes more level; but semi-isolated ranges stand out from the plains, and still farther to the north separate ridges and isolated peaks crop up here and there. The chief hills are: the Durv\u0101\u015barishi and Mah\u0101bar hills in the south of the Naw\u0101da subdivision, which rise to a height of 2,202 and 1,832 feet above sea-level, the former being the highest point in the District; the M\u0101her (1,612 feet) and Hasr\u0101 hills, the Ganj\u0101s and Bhindas, the Jethian range running from the neighbourhood of Buddh Gay\u0101 to R\u0101jgir and Giriak, and the Pahr\u0101, Cherki, and Gay\u0101 hills in the head-quarters subdivision; the Pawai, Dugul, and Pach\u0101r hills in the Aurang\u0101b\u0101d subdivision; and the Bar\u0101bar and Kow\u0101dol hills in the Jah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d subdivision. The general level falls somewhat rapidly towards the north, and numerous hill streams from the highlands of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur flow northwards across the District in more or less parallel courses. The chief of these from east to west are the Sakri, Dhanarji, Tilay\u0101, Dh\u0101dh\u0101r, Paim\u0101r, Phalgu, Jamun\u0101, Morhar, Dhaw\u0101, Madar, Adr\u012b, and P\u016bnp\u016bn; and the Son, which forms the western boundary of the District. The two last-named rivers are the only ones which reach the Ganges. The water brought down by the other streams is nearly all used up in the network of p\u0101ins or artificial irrigation channels; the Dhaw\u0101 and\nMadar are tributaries of the P\u016bnp\u016bn, and the Morhar and Phalgu also eventually join that river; while other streams, after being thus diverted for the purposes of irrigation, cannot be traced or mingle in the rainy season in a huge jhil in the B\u0101rh subdivision (of Patna). The Phalgu, which is formed by the junction of the Lil\u0101j\u0101n and Mohana rivers about 2 miles below Buddh-Gay\u0101, flows past the town of Gay\u0101, and then northwards under the foot of the Bar\u0101bar Hills. This river and the P\u016bnp\u016bn are regarded by the Hindus as sacred streams, and to bathe in them is the duty of every pilgrim who performs the Gay\u0101 t\u012brtha or pilgrimage. The most important river is the Son, its bed being nearly as broad as that of the Ganges, though it becomes almost dry in the hot months. During the rains the current is very rapid and navigation difficult, in consequence of which the river is used only by small craft up to about 20 tons burden for a few months in the year. Between Barun on the Gay\u0101 bank and Dehri on the Sh\u0101hab\u0101d side a stone causeway leads the grand trunk road across the bed. Just above this causeway is the great anicut of the Son Canals system, and below the causeway the river is spanned by one of the longest railway bridges in the world, comprising 98 spans of 100 feet each; it is made of iron girders laid on stone-built pillars.\n\nA considerable part of the District is occupied by the Gangetic alluvium, but older rocks rise above its level chiefly in the south and east. These are composed for the most part of a foliated gneiss, consisting of a great variety of crystalline rocks forming parallel bands and known as the Bengal gneiss. It is a subdivision of the Archaean system, which contains the oldest rocks of the earth\u2019s crust. Scattered at intervals amid the Bengal gneiss in the east of the District are several outcrops of another very ancient series, resembling that described in Southern India under the name of Dh\u0101rw\u0101r schists and constituting another subdivision of the Archaean system. Owing to the predominance of massive beds of quartzite, these beds stand out as abrupt ridges and constitute all the most conspicuous hills of the District. Not only are these rocks everywhere altered by \u2018regional metamorphism,\u2019 caused by the great pressure that has thrown them into close-set synclinal and anticlinal folds, as expressed by the elongated shape of the ridges and high dips of the strata with the inducement of slaty cleavage; but they have also been affected to a great extent by contact metamorphism from the intrusion of great masses of granite and innumerable veins of coarse granitic pegmatite, by which the slates have been further transformed into crystalline schists. In its more massive form the granite is relatively fine-grained and very homogeneous, and it weathers into great rounded hummocks that have suggested the name of \u2018dome-gneiss\u2019 by which it is sometimes known. It is the narrow sheets of the same intrusive\ngroup, where they cut across the metamorphosed schists as excessively coarse granitic pegmatites, that are of most economical importance on account of the mica which they contain.\n\nThe R\u0101jg\u012br hills, consisting of slaty schists and quartzites, are less metamorphosed; but contact effects are well seen in the M\u0101her hills, and in the detached spurs forming the south-western continuation of the R\u0101jg\u012br range near Gay\u0101, where idols and utensils are extensively wrought from the soft serpentinous rock of the converted schists.\n\nThe T\u0101lcher rocks, which constitute the basement beds of the coal-bearing Gondw\u0101na series, are seen at the small village of Gangti, 20 miles south-west-by-west of Shergh\u0101t\u012b: and also 4 miles west-by-south of Im\u0101nganj, in the bed of the Morhar river, where they occupy a small outcrop entirely surrounded by alluvium. This outcrop is of great interest, as indicating the possibility that coal-measures may exist beneath the alluvial formation in this part of the Gangetic plain\u00b9.\n\nIn the north the rice-fields have the usual weeds of such localities. Near villages there are often considerable groves of mango-trees and palmyras (Borassus flabellifer), some date palms (Phoenix sylvestris), and numerous isolated examples of Tamarindus and other semi-spontaneous and more or less useful species. There are no Government forests, but the hills on the south are completely covered with dense jungle; here the fuel-supply of the District is obtained, and the lac industry is a considerable source of income to the landlords. The principal trees are the pipal (Ficus religiosa), n\u012bm (Melia Azadirachta), banyan (Ficus indica), siris (Albizia odoratissima), mahua (Bassia latifolia), palas (Butea frondosa), sis\u016b (Dalbergia Sissoo), tamarind (Tamarindus indica), j\u0101mun (Eugenia Jambolana), sal (Shorea robusta), bab\u016bl (Acacia arabica), cotton-tree (Bombax malabaricum), and kahu\u0101 (Terminalia Arjuna). Flowering shrubs and creepers grow luxuriantly in the hills after the rains: and during the cold season wild plums and other small edible berries are common in these tracts, and form part of the food-supply of the poorer classes.\n\nTigers are found in the hills in the south, and leopards, hyenas, bears, and wild hog on most of the hills in the District. S\u0101mbar (Cervus unicolor), spotted deer (Cervus axis), \u2018ravine deer\u2019 (Gazella bennetti), four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis), and barking-deer (Cervulus muntjac) live in the jungles in the south: but their numbers are rapidly decreasing. The antelope (Antilope cervicapra) is still occasionally found. Wolves and wild dogs are comparatively rare. A few nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) still frequent the banks of the Son. Peafowl, jungle-fowl (Gallus ferrugineus), black\n\n\u00b9 T. H. Holland, 'Mica Deposits of India,' Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. xxxiv. pt. i. This account was contributed by Mr. F. Vredenburg, Deputy-Superintendent, Geological Survey of India.\npartridge (*Francolinus vulgaris*), grey partridge (*Francolinus pondicorius*), and spur fowl (*Galloperdix* sp.) are found in and along the skirts of the southern hills.\n\nBy reason of its distance from the sea, Gay\u0101 has greater extremes of climate than the south and east of Bengal. The mean temperature varies from $64^\\circ$ in January to $93^\\circ$ in May, and the highest average maximum is $105^\\circ$ in May. Owing to the hot and dry westerly winds which prevail in March and April, the humidity at that season averages only 51 per cent. With the approach of the monsoon the humidity increases, and then remains steady at from 84 to 87 per cent. throughout July and August. The annual rainfall averages 42 inches, of which 5\u00b76 fall in June, 12\u00b71 in July, 11\u00b78 in August, and 6\u00b74 in September. The strength of the monsoon during the month of September is of special importance to the cultivator, as the winter rice harvest is largely dependent on a good supply of rain at that season.\n\nLocal floods are occasionally caused by the rivers breaching their banks after abnormally heavy rain in the hills, or by a river leaving its bed and appropriating the channel of a *pani* or irrigation canal. A case of this nature occurred in 1896\u20137, when the Sakri river changed its course and flooded the lands of some villages in the Naw\u0101da subdivision, converting a considerable area of fertile land into a sandy waste. In September, 1901, in consequence of the sudden simultaneous rise of the Son and the Ganges, the former river topped its bank near Arwal and flooded Badr\u0101b\u0101d and other villages, many mud-built houses falling in.\n\nThe modern District was comprised, with the country now included in Patna and Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d, within the ancient kingdom of Magadha. Both Patna and Gay\u0101, which formed part of the Muhammadan *S\u016bbah* of Bih\u0101r, passed into the hands of the English in 1765, being at first administered from Patna. This arrangement lasted till 1781, when Bih\u0101r was made into a District under a Collector and a Judge-Magistrate. In 1814 the south of the District was placed under the jurisdiction of a special Joint-Magistrate, stationed at Shergh\u0101ti. In 1865 Gay\u0101 was separated from Patna and constituted an independent Collectorate.\n\nThough Gay\u0101 was not the scene of fighting during the Mutiny of 1857, yet an incident took place in the District worthy of record. The sepoys in the cantonments at Dinapore mutinied in July and escaped into Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d. After the first attack upon them by a British force had resulted in disaster, orders were issued by the Commissioner of Patna to all the civil officers within his jurisdiction to withdraw their establishments and retire on Dinapore. A small garrison of the 64th Regiment, together with a few Sikhs, was then stationed at Gay\u0101 town. In obedience to the written orders of the Commissioner, the handful of\nsoldiers and civilians at Gay\u0101 started on the road to Patna, leaving behind about 7 lakhs in the treasury. But on the way bolder counsels prevailed. Mr. Money, the Magistrate of the District, and Mr. Hollings, an uncovenanted official in the opium agency, determined to return to Gay\u0101 and save what they could from the general pillage that would inevitably follow upon the abandonment of the town. The detachment of the 64th Regiment was also sent back. The town was found still at peace. By the time that carriage had been collected for the treasure the Patna road had become unsafe, and the only means of retreat was by the grand trunk road to Calcutta. As soon as the little party had started a second time, they were attacked by a mixed rabble of released prisoners and the former jail-guards. They repulsed the attack, and conveyed the treasure safely to Calcutta.\n\nThe District is full of places of the greatest archaeological interest, and the rocky hills teem with associations of the ancient religion of Buddha. As a place of Hindu pilgrimage, the town of Gay\u0101 is of comparatively modern interest, but at Buddh (or Bodh) Gay\u0101, 7 miles to the south, are remains of great religious and archaeological importance. Many Buddhist images are to be found in the neighbourhood and also at Pun\u0101w\u0101n, 14 miles east of Gay\u0101. Two miles south of Pun\u0101w\u0101n is Hasr\u0101 hill, identified by Dr. Stein with the Kukkutapada-giri of Fa Hian and Hiuen Tsiang. There are many scattered remains of undoubted Buddhist origin in the valley between the Sobhn\u0101th hill and Hasr\u0101 hill proper; while in the neighbouring village of Bishnupur Tarw\u0101 are some finely cut Buddhist images. At Kurkih\u0101r, 7 miles to the north-east, is a large mound, from which many Buddhist sculptures have been unearthed. About 11 miles to the north-east lies the village of Jethian, identified with the Yashtivana of Hiuen Tsiang, in the neighbourhood of which there are several sites associated with the wanderings of Buddha. At Konch is a curious brick-built temple, and traces of Buddhist influence are observable in sculptures round about. Seven miles south-east of Gay\u0101 is the Dhongr\u0101 hill, which is clearly identifiable with the Pr\u0101gbodhi mountain of Hiuen Tsiang, and contains a cave in which Gautama is supposed to have rested before he went to Buddh Gay\u0101. At Guneri are many Buddhist images and remains marking the site apparently of the Sri Guna Charita monastery. The above remains are all in the head-quarters subdivision, in the extreme north of which lie the Bar\u0101bar Hills with their famous rock-cut caves. Not far from these hills to the west is the isolated rocky peak of Kow\u0101dol, at the base of which is a huge stone image of Buddha; it probably marks the site of the ancient Buddhist monastery of Sil\u0101bhada.\n\nIn the Naw\u0101da subdivision at Sit\u0101marhi, about 7 miles south-west of Hisu\u0101, is a cave hewn in a large isolated boulder of granite. Tradition relates that here Sit\u0101, the wife of R\u0101ma, gave birth to Lava while in\nexile. Many legends also cluster round Rajauli, with its picturesque hills and pretty valleys. At Aesar are several remains, including a fine statue of the Varaha or Boar incarnation of Vishnu.\n\nIn the Jah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d subdivision, about 3 miles north of the Bar\u0101bar Hills, stands Dharawat, near the site of another Buddhist monastery called Gun\u0101mati. South of this, on the slope of a low ridge of hills, many Buddhist remains have been found. At D\u0101pthu, there are some finely carved images and ruins of temples; and not far from here, lying half-buried in an open field, is a large carved monolith of granite. At Jaru and Banwaria, on the east side of the Phalgu river, are the ruins of what must have been a large temple, and there are other remains of interest at K\u0101ko, Ghenjan, and Ner.\n\nIn the Aurang\u0101b\u0101d subdivision a fine stone temple stands at Deo and a similar one at Umga. Large Buddhist images and many remains are found at Manda; and at Bhurha, 2 miles farther east, are some finely carved chaityas and images, and some remains marking the site of a monastery. Deokuli, Cheon, and Pachar also contain remains of Br\u0101hmanical, Buddhist, and Jain interest.\n\nThe recorded population of the present area rose from 1,947,824 in 1872 to 2,124,682 in 1881 and to 2,138,331 in 1891, but fell again to 2,059,933 in 1901. The population is not progressive, and much of the increase between 1872 and 1881 must have been due to better enumeration. The decrease at the Census of 1901 was largely due to the ravages of the plague. The greatest loss took place in the central police circles, where plague was most prevalent; but a slight decadence for which plague was not to blame occurred in the south-west, where the land is high and barren and the crops are scanty and uncertain. The Naw\u0101da subdivision in the east and a small tract which benefits by irrigation from the Son in the north-west added to their population.\n\nThe principal statistics of the Census of 1901 are shown below:\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Gay\u0101        | 1,905               | 3              | 2,999    | 751,855    | 395                       | - 9.7                                           | 26,638                                 |\n| Naw\u0101da      | 955                 | 2              | 1,752    | 453,868    | 475                       | + 3.2                                           | 15,166                                 |\n| Aurang\u0101b\u0101d  | 1,246               | 2              | 2,042    | 467,675    | 375                       | - 1.0                                           | 16,695                                 |\n| Jah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d   | 606                 | 1              | 1,078    | 386,535    | 638                       | - 1.8                                           | 16,264                                 |\n| District total | 4,712             | 8              | 7,871    | 2,059,933  | 437                       | - 3.7                                           | 74,763                                 |\n\nOf the towns, Gay\u0101, the District head-quarters, Tekari, and Daudnagar are municipalities. The other chief towns are Aurang\u0101b\u0101d,\nNawada, and Jah\u0101n\u0101bad. The density of the population is greatest in the north, rising to 666 persons per square mile in the Jah\u0101n\u0101bad th\u0101na; along the southern boundary, where a considerable area belongs geographically to the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, it is very sparse, and in the B\u0101r\u0101chati th\u0101na there are only 257 persons per square mile. Gay\u0101 sends out numerous emigrants to the adjoining Districts of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh and Pal\u0101mau, but the most marked feature connected with migration is the great number of natives of the District who earn a livelihood in distant parts. No less than 58,952, or 2.8 per cent. of the population, were residing in Bengal proper at the time of the Census of 1901, and of these 36,953 were enumerated in Calcutta. These emigrants are employed chiefly as darv\u0101ns, peons, and weavers in jute-mills; and they remit a large portion of their earnings for the support of their families, whom they seldom take with them. It was estimated in 1893 that as much as Rs. 8,40,000 was thus annually remitted to the District. The vernacular of Gay\u0101 is the Magahi dialect of Bih\u0101ri; the Awadh\u012b dialect of Eastern Hind\u012b is spoken by Muhammadans. Of the total population, 1,849,382 persons (89.3 per cent.) are Hindus and 219,124 (10.64 per cent.) Muhammadans.\n\nThe Go\u0101l\u0101s (306,000) are the most numerous Hindu caste, next to whom come B\u0101bhans (163,000) and Koiris (145,000). There are several aboriginal or semi-Hinduized tribes, the principal being Bhuiy\u0101s (112,000), Dos\u0101dhs (108,000), Musahars (55,000), and Rajw\u0101rs (53,000). The most common higher castes are Br\u0101hmans (64,000), R\u0101jputs (111,000), and K\u0101yasths (39,000). The Br\u0101hmans include a number of persons who, though not regular or orthodox Br\u0101hmans, are allowed a kind of brevet rank; among these the most remarkable are the Gay\u0101w\u0101ls (see Gay\u0101 Town) and the Dh\u0101mins. Many of the functional castes are well represented, such as Kah\u0101rs (110,000), Cham\u0101rs (81,000), Telis (58,000), Kurmis (41,000), Barhais (39,000), and Hajj\u0101ms and P\u0101s\u012bs (38,000 each). Among Muhammadans, Jolah\u0101s (74,000) are the most numerous. Agriculture supports 65.1 per cent. of the population, industries 14 per cent., commerce 0.6 per cent., and the professions 1.9 per cent.\n\nChristians number only 253, of whom 40 are natives; the missions at work are the London Baptist Missionary Society, the London Baptist Zan\u0101na Missionary Society, and the World\u2019s Faith Missionary Association.\n\nThe northern portion of the District, extending southwards to about 10 miles beyond Gay\u0101 town and constituting about two-thirds of the whole area, is fairly level and is mostly under cultivation. Farther south the rise towards the hills of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur is more rapid, the country is intersected with hills and ravines, the proportion of sand in the soil is much higher, and a large\narea is composed of hill and scrub-covered jungle, which extends for several miles below the hills. Cultivation in this tract is far more scanty; but in recent years large areas of waste have been reclaimed, and the process will probably be accelerated with the opening of new lines of railway and the general improvement of communications. Between the numerous rivers the land is higher: in the south these doabs can only be irrigated with difficulty, and rabi and bhadoi crops are most grown. Farther north, where the surface is more level, most of them can be watered by channels from the rivers and from ahurs, and rice is largely grown. In the west near the Son a considerable area, which was formerly sandy and infertile, is irrigated from the Patna canal and its distributaries. In the northern tract the soil is generally alluvial, consisting chiefly of clay with a small proportion of sand. In the south, however, sand generally predominates. In some parts the soil is impregnated with carbonate of soda.\n\nThe chief agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are given below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Subdivision | Total | Cultivated | Cultivable waste | Irrigated |\n|-------------|-------|------------|------------------|-----------|\n| Gay\u0101        | 1,905 | 1,049      | 92               | ...       |\n| Naw\u0101da      | 955   | 498        | 37               | ...       |\n| Aurang\u0101b\u0101d  | 1,246 | 657        | 98               | 52        |\n| Jah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d   | 606   | 508        | 20               | 33        |\n| **Total**   | **4,712** | **2,712** | **247**         | **85**    |\n\nThis column represents the area irrigated from Government canals. Statistics showing the area irrigated from private channels, tanks, wells, &c., are not available; but it is estimated that in the whole District the area irrigated from all sources is 75 per cent. of the total cultivated area.\n\nThe area twice cropped is estimated at 287 square miles. The most important staple is rice, grown on 1,382 square miles or about 51 per cent. of the cultivated area. Besides this, a great variety of crops are raised; and it is not unusual to find four crops\u2014such as gram, wheat, sesamum, and linseed\u2014grown together in the same field: to this fact and to the protection afforded by the Son Canals and the indigenous system of irrigation followed in the District may be ascribed the comparative immunity it enjoys from famine. Wheat covers about 249 square miles; and the other important cereals and pulses are gram, maru\u0101, maize, barley, khes\u0101ri, mas\u016br, peas, urd, and mung. B\u0101jra and jow\u0101r are cultivated to a large extent on high lands. Oilseeds cover 329 square miles, the chief crop being linseed, grown on 160 square miles. Gay\u0101 is one of the chief opium-producing Districts in Bengal, and 75 square miles are devoted to the cultivation of the poppy. Sugar-cane is widely grown, as also are potatoes, yams and other vegetables, and p\u0101n\u2014or betel-leaf.\nIn the ten years ending 1901-2, 283 lakhs was advanced under the Land Improvement Loans Act and Rs. 67,000 under the Agriculturists' Loans Act; the loans are chiefly used for the improvement or extension of the means of irrigation.\n\nThe local cattle are small but sturdy. Extensive pasture lands exist in the thinly cultivated tracts in the south, but elsewhere the cattle are largely fed on chopped straw. Sheep are reared extensively by the Gareri caste, especially near the hills where grazing is plentiful; and their wool is used in the manufacture of carpets, rugs, and blankets. Goats are common, and pigs are kept by Bhuiy\u0101s, Musahars, Dosadh, and Doms. A veterinary dispensary is maintained at Gay\u0101 by the District board. Numerous religious gatherings are held at various places in the District, especially in Gay\u0101 town, which is a place of pilgrimage throughout the year; to some of these cattle and ponies are brought for sale, but no special fair is held for the sale of cattle.\n\nAgricultural prosperity depends almost entirely on irrigation. It is supplied in the west by two branches of the Son Canals system. The Eastern Main Canal, which was originally intended to pass across Gay\u0101 into Monghyr, runs eastward for 8 miles to the Punpun river, and the Patna Canal runs northwards for 43 miles before entering Patna District. One-fifth of the District is thus irrigated, the area actually supplied with water from these canals and their distributaries in 1903-4 being 85 square miles. The remainder is cut into parallel strips by a number of rivers which flow from south to north. Between each pair of rivers is necessarily a watershed, and in the slope leading from it to the river reservoirs are constructed. These are filled either by the rain-water which comes down the slope, this system being known as gur\u0101bandi, or from a water channel (p\u0101in) which passes along the side, and takes off from the river at a higher level. As the rivers fall only 6 feet in the mile, the channels are sometimes carried to a considerable distance, and Dr. Grierson writes of having seen one 20 miles long. Whenever a flood comes down, during the rainy season, it fills all the reservoirs (\u0101hars) attached to each channel. Well-irrigation is largely resorted to in the neighbourhood of villages, where less expensive methods are not practicable. Though no accurate statistics are available, it is believed that about 156 square miles are irrigated by these means.\n\nThe principal mineral product is mica, which is found at Sapahi, Singar, Basron, Chatkari, and Belam in the Naw\u0101da subdivision, and in smaller quantities among the hills in the south on the border of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh. The seams are reached by blasting; and the sheets of mica are then dug out, separated, clipped, and sorted and packed according to size, and dispatched to Calcutta for export to America and Europe. In 1903 the only mines\nworked regularly were those at Sapahi, Basron, Singar, and Belam. The average number of labourers employed was 464: they are drawn from the ordinary labouring classes, and are paid a daily wage varying from 2 to 6 annas, according to age, sex, and skill. The output, which varies according to the demand in the market, amounted in 1923 to 122 tons. Iron ore is found in considerable quantities at Pachamb\u0101 in the Naw\u0101da subdivision and at Lodhwe in the head-quarters subdivision, but is not now worked. It also exists in the Bar\u0101bar Hills, where there were formerly smelting works under European management; it is now being worked again to a small extent. Granite, syenite, and laterite are quarried in many of the hills for building purposes and road-metalling. The so-called Gay\u0101 black stone, of which ornaments, bowls, and figures are carved, is quarried at Pathal-kat\u012b in the Atr\u012b th\u0101na, and worked chiefly by stone-carvers who claim to be of Br\u0101hman descent and to have come from Jaipur. Pottery clay exists in many places, and nodules of limestone are found in scattered localities. Saltpetre is manufactured, chiefly in the Jah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d subdivision, from efflorescences on the clay of village sites.\n\nThe manufactures include lac, sugar, tasar and cotton cloth, brass utensils, stoneware, gold and silver ornaments, blankets, rugs and carpets. Paper was formerly made on a large scale at Arwal, but the industry has entirely died out. Silk cloth is woven to a considerable extent at M\u0101npur near Gay\u0101, and in a smaller degree at K\u0101dirganj in the Naw\u0101da subdivision and Daudnagar. Carpets and rugs are manufactured at Obr\u0101 and Daudnagar. Brass utensils are also made in large quantities at the latter town. Carving in wood was formerly an important industry, and the carvers had attained much proficiency, as is evident from some examples still existing in the balconies, doors, and windows of Old Gay\u0101; but the art has almost died out. Cane chairs are made at Gay\u0101, but not to any great extent. Small statues of animals and figures of gods are carved by a few artists at Gay\u0101 from black stone. Sugar refining is on the wane, but raw sugar is largely manufactured for export. The lac insect is cultivated, generally on the pal\u0101s-tree (Butea frondosa) in the southern jungles; and the manufactured product, which is prepared in about forty factories, is exported chiefly to Calcutta. The average annual out-turn is estimated at 50,000 maunds.\n\nThe principal exports are food-grains, especially rice, oilseeds, pepper, crude opium, raw sugar, mahua flowers, saltpetre, mica, lac, blankets, carpets, stone and brass utensils, hides, prepared tobacco, and betel-leaves. Among the imports are salt, coal, coke, piece-goods and shawls, kerosene oil, tea, cotton, timber, tobacco (unmanufactured dry-leaves), iron, spices of all kinds, dried and fresh fruits, refined\nsugar, paper, and various articles of European manufacture. The bulk of the trade is with Calcutta, but unrefined sugar finds its way in large quantities to the Central Provinces, Rajputana, Central India, and Berar. The chief centres of trade are Gay\u0101, Tekari, Guru\u0101, R\u0101niganj, and Im\u0101nganj in the head-quarters subdivision; Rajauli and Akbarpur in Naw\u0101da; Jah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d and Arwal in Jah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d; and Daudnagar, Deo, Mah\u0101r\u0101jganj, Tarw\u0101, Khiriaw\u0101n, Rasiganj, and Jamhur in the Aurang\u0101b\u0101d subdivision. Owing to the opening of new railways, which now tap most of the trade routes in the District, several other places are rising in importance, the most noticeable being Naw\u0101da. Feeder-roads have been constructed by the District board, and trade tends more and more to converge upon the railway stations. For the conveyance of produce, bullock-carts are used, but pack-bullocks also are still very largely employed, especially in the hilly parts. The principal classes engaged in trade are the various Baniy\u0101 castes and M\u0101rw\u0101ris; some Mughals deal in sugar, cloths, and shawls.\n\nThe Patna-Gay\u0101 branch connects Gay\u0101 with the main line of the East Indian Railway at Bankipore, 34\u00bd miles of it lying within the District. Three other lines have recently been opened: namely, the South Bih\u0101r branch, which runs east from Gay\u0101 to Luckesarai through the Naw\u0101da subdivision, 58 miles falling within the District; the Mughal Sarai-Gay\u0101 branch from Gay\u0101 through the Aurang\u0101b\u0101d subdivision to Mughal Sarai, 51 miles lying within Gay\u0101; and the Barun-Daltonganj branch, which leaves the latter line at Barun on the Son and runs for 23\u00bc miles before it enters Pal\u0101mau District. A fifth line from Gay\u0101 to Katrasgarh, of which 34 miles fall within Gay\u0101 District, has recently been completed, and, with the Mughal Sarai-Gay\u0101 line, forms the grand chord-line to Calcutta.\n\nThe District is intersected by numerous excellent roads, of which 202 miles are metalled and 719 miles unmetalled, in addition to 628 miles of village tracks. The chief lines are: the grand trunk road, with a length of 51 miles maintained from Provincial funds; the Kharhat-Rajauli road, running from Bih\u0101r to Naw\u0101da and southwards; the Gay\u0101-Salimpur road, which is a portion of the Patna-Gay\u0101 road, running parallel to the Patna-Gay\u0101 Railway; and the Gay\u0101-Naw\u0101da road, with several feeder-roads leading from it to the stations on the South Bih\u0101r Railway.\n\nA small steamer plies weekly on the Patna Canal, but it carries very little merchandise. None of the small rivers is navigable. Most of them, where not bridged, are provided with ferries during the rainy season, but the only large ferry is that across the Son from Daudnagar to N\u0101srganj in Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d District.\n\nOwing to the construction of the Son Canals, the indigenous system of irrigation which prevails, and the improvement in communications\nwhich has taken place since 1874, the District is not seriously affected by famines. The whole of the western border is protected by the Son Canals, and almost all the remainder of the District by the local system of reservoirs and channels described above. A great variety of crops are grown, and it rarely happens that famine obtains a grip over any considerable area. The famine of 1866 affected 1,300 square miles; but the majority of the people were able to support themselves, and the relief operations were on a comparatively small scale, costing only Rs. 22,000, of which Rs. 12,000 was raised by local subscription. In 1874 also the District was not seriously involved; the food-supply was augmented by private trade, and the Government had only to supplement it by a small amount of grain, and by the provision of relief works on the canals. The total expenditure on that occasion was 1.38 lakhs. Slight scarcities occurred in 1888-9 and 1891-2, while in 1896-7, when severe famine was felt over a large part of India, prices rose very high, and the landless labourers suffered much in consequence. No regular works were opened, but 50,000 persons were gratuitously relieved, most of them being travellers passing through the District in search of labour. The total expenditure was only about Rs. 18,000, all of which was subscribed locally.\n\nFor administrative purposes the District is divided into four subdivisions, with head-quarters at Sahibganj (Gay\u0101 Town), Naw\u0101da, Jah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, and Aurang\u0101b\u0101d. The District headquarters staff subordinate to the Magistrate-Collector consists of three or four Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors, besides two special Deputy-Collectors for excise and partition work. A Joint-Magistrate is usually deputed to Gay\u0101 for the cold-season months, and one or two Sub-Deputy-Collectors and an Assistant Magistrate-Collector are also occasionally posted to the District. The Naw\u0101da, Jah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, and Aurang\u0101b\u0101d subdivisions are in charge of Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors, and sometimes, in the case of the two subdivisions first named, of Assistant Magistrates.\n\nThe civil courts are those of the District and Sessions Judge, two Sub-Judges, and four Munsifs, one of whom sits at Aurang\u0101b\u0101d. The criminal courts include those of the District and Sessions Judge, the District Magistrate, and the above-mentioned Joint, Assistant, and Deputy-Magistrates. A special magistrate is authorized under section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Code to try cases connected with breaches of the Irrigation laws. The District was formerly notorious for the prevalence of crime, especially in the south, which was in a lawless state, dacoities and highway robberies being frequent. Now, though dacoities are occasionally committed, the commonest offences are burglary, cattle stealing, and riots caused by disputes about irrigation.\nOwing to changes in the jurisdiction of the District and the destruction of records at the time of the Mutiny, early statistics of the land revenue are not available. The current demand has risen from 13\u00b78 lakhs in 1870-1 to 14\u00b739 lakhs in 1903-4. Subdivision of estates has gone on rapidly, there being in the latter year 7,876 estates, of which 7,828 with a demand of 13\u00b740 lakhs were permanently settled, 15 with a demand of Rs. 47,000 temporarily settled, and the remainder were held direct by Government. Among special tenures may be mentioned altamgha grants, or lands given in perpetuity as a reward for conspicuous military service; gh\u0101tew\u0101li lands, assigned for the maintenance of guards and patrols on roads and passes; and madat-m\u0101sh, lands granted to favourites and others. About 70 per cent. of the cultivated land is held under the system of bhaoli or produce rents. There are two kinds: d\u0101n\u0101bandi, where the crop is appraised while standing in the field; and batai or agorbatai, where the crop is taken to the threshing-floor and divided equally between the landlord and tenant after the labourers engaged in cutting and carrying it have been given their share. Under the d\u0101n\u0101bandi system also the crop is supposed to be divided equally, but in practice the landlord's share is generally 1/6ths and often even more. In the case of cash rents three kinds of tenure obtain: namely, the ordinary nagdi, shikmi, and chakath. A shikmi tenure in this District means a tenure held on a cash rent fixed for ever. A chakath holding is one in which the rent is fixed for a term of years; the term is also often applied to settlements made for the reclamation of cultivable waste. Another local tenure is the paran or paranpheri, under which rice land held on the bhaoli system and suited to the growth of sugar-cane or poppy is settled at a specially high rate of rent in the years when these crops are grown.\n\nThe following rates of rent per acre may be regarded as fairly general: rice land, if fit for only a single crop, Rs. 1-8-0 to Rs. 8, and if yielding a double crop, Rs. 3 to Rs. 10; land on which wheat, barley, gram, pulses, and oilseeds are grown, Rs. 2 to Rs. 8; sugar-cane and poppy land, Rs. 3 to Rs. 16; land growing bh\u0101d\u014di crops such as maize, maru\u0101, or jow\u0101r, Rs. 1-8-0 to Rs. 5; and land growing potatoes, Rs. 4 to Rs. 16. The Government estates in the District and part of the Tek\u0101ri estate with a total area of 582 square miles were cadastrally surveyed and settled between 1893 and 1898. The incidence of land revenue was found to be R. 0-10-5 per acre and the rent Rs. 4 0-10, the land revenue demand thus amounting to only 16 per cent. of the rent. Over the whole District the maximum and minimum rent rates per acre are about Rs. 16 and 8 annas respectively, the average being Rs. 5 12-0. The average holding of a ryot is about 6 acres. Recently the Deo and Maksudpur estates, with an area of 92 and 132 square miles respectively, have also come under survey and settlement.\nThe following table shows the collections of land revenue and of total revenue (principal heads only), in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 14.35  | 14.67  | 14.69  | 14.34  |\n| Total revenue  | 24.91  | 24.82  | 28.52  | 30.08  |\n\nOutside the municipalities of Gay\u0101, Tek\u0101ri, and Daudnagar, local affairs are managed by the District board, with subordinate local boards in each subdivision except the head-quarters subdivision. In 1903-4 its income was Rs. 3,26,000, of which Rs. 2,26,000 was derived from rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 3,07,000, including Rs. 2,04,000 spent on public works and Rs. 45,000 on education.\n\nIn 1903 the District contained 14 police stations and 22 outposts; and the force subordinate to the District Superintendent consisted of 5 inspectors, 49 sub-inspectors, 56 head constables, and 659 constables. The rural police consisted of 389 daffad\u0101rs and 3,648 chaukid\u0101rs. The District jail at Gay\u0101 has accommodation for 542 prisoners, and subsidiary jails at Naw\u0101da, Jah\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, and Aurang\u0101b\u0101d for 105.\n\nGay\u0101 District is backward in point of education, and only 3.6 per cent. of the population (7.2 males and 0.2 females) could read and write in 1901. The number of pupils in the schools increased from 19,118 in 1880-1 to 26,250 in 1892-3 and to 26,849 in 1900-1. In 1903-4 37,824 boys and 2,303 girls were at school, being respectively 24.9 and 1.4 per cent. of the children of school-going age. The number of educational institutions, public and private, in that year was 1,598, including 19 secondary, 979 primary, and 600 special schools. The expenditure on education was Rs. 1,49,000, of which Rs. 14,000 was met from Provincial funds, Rs. 45,000 from District funds, Rs. 3,000 from municipal funds, and Rs. 51,000 from fees. The chief institutions are the Government school and two private schools at Gay\u0101 town, and a school maintained by the Tek\u0101ri R\u0101j at Tek\u0101ri, all teaching English up to the matriculation standard.\n\nIn 1903 the District contained 15 dispensaries, of which 10 had accommodation for 182 in-patients; the cases of 90,000 out-patients and 2,300 in-patients were treated, and 7,000 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 67,000, of which Rs. 3,000 was met by Government contributions, Rs. 22,000 from Local funds and Rs. 7,000 from municipal funds, and Rs. 25,000 from subscriptions. The chief institutions are the pilgrim and zan\u0101na hospitals at Gay\u0101 town.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only in municipal areas, but the practice is steadily gaining ground, and the people as a whole are beginning to\nrealize its efficacy. In 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 58,000, or 29.5 per 1,000.\n\n[M. Martin (Buchanan-Hamilton), Eastern India, vol. i (1838); G. A. Grierson, Notes on the District of Gay\u0101 (Calcutta, 1893); L. S. S. O'Malley, District Gazetteer (Calcutta, 1906).]\n\nGay\u0101 Subdivision.\u2014Head-quarters subdivision of Gay\u0101 District, Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 17' and 25\u00b0 5' N. and 84\u00b0 17' and 85\u00b0 24' E., with an area of 1,905 square miles. The population in 1901 was 751,855, compared with 832,442 in 1891. A plague epidemic was raging at the time of the Census of 1901, which not only caused many deaths and a considerable exodus, but also made the work of enumeration exceptionally difficult. The subdivision comprises two tracts, that to the north being a level plain dotted with isolated hills and containing some long hill ranges, that to the south an undulating country with several hills forming the northern fringe of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau. The density for the whole subdivision is only 395 persons per square mile, and the population along the south is very sparse. It contains three towns, Gay\u0101 (population, 71,288), its head-quarters, Tek\u0101ri (6,437), the residence of the Tek\u0101ri family (see Tek\u0101ri Raj), and Shergh\u0101ti (2,641); and 2,999 villages. Gay\u0101 town, which possesses a very ancient history, is an important place of pilgrimage, and at Buddh Gay\u0101 are remains of unusual religious and archaeological importance. The subdivision contains numerous other remains of great interest, which have been referred to in the articles on Gay\u0101 District and Bar\u0101bar Hills.\n\nGay\u0101 Town.\u2014Chief town, and, with S\u0101hibganj, the administrative head-quarters of Gay\u0101 District, Bengal, situated in 24\u00b0 49' N. and 85\u00b0 1' E., on the left bank of the Phalgu river, on branches of the East Indian Railway leading to Patna, Mughal Sarai, Luckeesarai, and Katrasgarh. The town is divided into two adjoining parts, Gay\u0101 proper or the old town, and S\u0101hibganj or the new town. The old town, which contains the famous temple of Vishnupada and other sacred shrines, is chiefly inhabited by the Gay\u0101w\u0101l priests. The new town (S\u0101hibganj) is the administrative head-quarters of the District, and contains all the public offices, revenue, magisterial, civil, opium, police, &c., the dwelling-houses of the European officers and residents, and also the police station and lines, hospitals, circuit and d\u016bk bungalows, railway offices, a church, a public library, a school, and a racecourse. The jail building, which was formerly in the midst of the new town, has now been removed to a distance. It has accommodation for 542 prisoners, who are employed on oil-pressing, breaking of road metal, weaving of daris and nevar, manufacture of bamboo baskets, money-bags, string and mats, jute twine, and cotton rope. The streets of the old town are narrow, but those of the new town are\ngenerally straight and broad with numerous cross-roads. There are many brick houses, often three storeys high. The population, which was 66,843 in 1872, rose to 76,415 in 1881 and to 80,383 in 1891, but fell in 1901 to 71,288, the heavy decrease probably being entirely due to the plague which was raging at the time of the Census. Of those enumerated, 54,223, or 76 per cent., were Hindus, and 16,778, or 23 per cent., Musalmans, while among the others were 156 Christians and 121 Jains. Gay\u0101 was constituted a municipality in 1865. The income during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 88,000, and the expenditure Rs. 83,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 1,13,000, including Rs. 50,000 derived from a tax on houses and lands, Rs. 23,000 from a conservancy rate, Rs. 9,000 from a tax on vehicles, and Rs. 5,000 as revenue from markets. The incidence of taxation was Rs. 1\u20132\u20138 per head of the population. In the same year the expenditure amounted to Rs. 1,06,000, the chief items being Rs. 4,000 spent on lighting, Rs. 2,000 on drainage, Rs. 42,000 on conservancy, Rs. 16,000 on medical relief, Rs. 8,000 on roads, and Rs. 2,000 on education. A scheme of water-supply is under consideration, but has been deferred for lack of funds.\n\nAccording to the Bh\u0101gavat Pur\u0101na, Gay\u0101 was the name of a king who dwelt in the town in the Tret\u0101-Yuga. The more generally accepted legend, however, is that contained in the V\u0101yu Pur\u0101na, according to which Gay\u0101 was the name of an Asura, or demon of giant size, who by long and austere penance and devotion obtained the quality of holiness to such an extent that all who saw or touched him were admitted to heaven. Yama, the lord of hell, grew jealous and, pleading that his post was becoming a sinecure, appealed to the gods, who, after conferring in council, visited Gay\u0101 and persuaded the demon to grant his pure and holy body as a place of sacrifice. To this Gay\u0101 assented, and lay down with his head resting where the old town of Gay\u0101 now is. Yama then placed a sacred rock (dharmasila) on his head; but this was not sufficient to keep him quiet until Vishnu promised the rock should be the holiest spot on earth, that the devas should rest there, that the locality should be known as Gay\u0101-k\u1e63etra, and that whoever offered funeral cakes and performed the funeral ceremonies there should be translated with their ancestors to the heaven of Brahm\u0101. This legend, purporting to explain the reason for the peculiar sanctity of the spot which is an object of pilgrimage to every member of the Hindu religion, contains, in the opinion of the late Dr. R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra, an allegory of the final victory of Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism over Buddhism, which had flourished strongly in and around Gay\u0101 for many centuries. The pilgrimage to Gaya is undertaken by thousands of Hindus from every part of India. There are forty-five places at which the pilgrims should offer pindas or funeral\ncakes in the Gay\u0101-kshettra, an area extending from 5 miles north-west of Gay\u0101 to 7 miles south. The whole forty-five are rarely visited now, the majority of pilgrims contenting themselves with seven and often with three only. The Vishnupada, a temple built over the footprint of Vishnu on the solid rock that crops up on the west bank of the Phalgu river, and round which the old town of Gay\u0101 proper was built, may be regarded as the centre of this pilgrimage, and is the largest and most important temple in Gay\u0101. It faces east, the fa\u00e7ade being very striking. It is an ugly octagonal building about 100 feet high, with many very clumsy mouldings. The threshold is guarded by high folding doors plated with silver. In the centre is an octagonal basin plated with silver, which surrounds the impress on the rock of the god's foot about 16 inches in length. Pilgrims to the temple stand round the basin and throw in their offerings of rice and water. To the south of the temple, almost touching it, is a handsome pillared hall or porch, where the bare rock shows itself; in fact the pillars are let into the solid rock for a foundation. This temple is said to have been erected in the eighteenth century by Ahaly\u0101 Bai, widow of Holkar of Indore, on the site of a more ancient temple. The Gay\u0101w\u0101ls are the hereditary officiating priests, possessing the exclusive privilege to grant to the pilgrims the blessing without which their visit would be ineffectual, and they take advantage of their position to obtain from the pilgrims such gifts as they are able to afford. The poorest pilgrim can rarely get through the functions required of him under five rupees, while certain princes are reputed to have spent more than a lakh.\n\n[M. Martin (Buchanan-Hamilton), Eastern India, vol. i (1838); L. S. S. O'Malley, District Gazetteer of Gay\u0101 (Calcutta, 1906).]\n\nGedi.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thiaw\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nGeonkh\u0101li.\u2014Village in the Tamluk subdivision of Midnapore District, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 10' N. and 87\u00b0 57' E., on the right bank of the Hooghly river at the entrance of the Orissa Coast canal. Population (1901), 524. It is a considerable trading centre. A steam ferry crosses from Diamond Harbour in connexion with the Eastern Bengal State Railway. There is a lighthouse here, known as the Cowcolly lighthouse.\n\nGeorgegarh (Jah\u0101zgarh).\u2014Village in the Jhajjar tahsil of Rohtak District, Punjab, situated in 28\u00b0 37' N. and 76\u00b0 36' E. Population (1901), 1,285. It was founded by George Thomas, who built a fort to overawe the towns of Beri and Jhajjar, which was besieged and taken by a large Mar\u0101th\u0101 force under Louis Bourquin, Thomas being obliged to retire to H\u0101nsi (1801). A large cattle fair is held here twice a year.\n\nGersoppa Falls.\u2014The Gersoppa Falls are situated in 14\u00b0 14' N. and 74\u00b0 49' E., on the Bombay-Mysore frontier, about 18 miles east of Gersoppa, and 35 miles east of Hon\u0101var (North Kanara District), from\nwhich they can best be visited. They are locally known as the Jog Falls, from the neighbouring village of Jog. The waterfall is on the Shar\u0101vati river, which, with a breadth above the falls of about 230 feet, hurls itself over a cliff 830 feet high, in four separate cascades, known as the R\u0101j\u0101 (or Horseshoe) Fall, the Roarer, the Rocket, and La Dame Blanche. The best time to see the falls is early in December, when the river is low enough to make it possible to cross to the left or Mysore bank. Between June and November, when the river is flooded, the banks are shrouded in clouds of mist. From Gersoppa village the road climbs about 10 miles through noble stretches of forest to the crest of the Gersoppa or Malemani pass, and from the crest passes 8 miles farther to the falls. Close underwood hides all trace of the river, till, at the bungalow near the falls, the plateau commands a glorious view. The rock of the river-bed and the cliff over which the river falls are gneiss associated with hypogene schists. The Gersoppa Falls eclipse every other in India and have few rivals in the world for height, volume, and beauty combined. The varying effects of light and shade at different times of the day are among their greatest beauties. In the afternoon, as the sun sinks to the west, a lovely rainbow spans the waters; at night, the moon at times throws across the spray a belt of faintly-tinted light. On a dark night, rockets, blazing torches, or bundles of burning straw cast over the cliff light the raging waters with a fitful and weird glare. The best sight of the chasm is gained by lying down and peering over a pinnacle of rock, which stands out from the edge of the cliff. The finest general view of the falls is from the Mysore bank. From the right bank of the river a rough bamboo bridge crosses the R\u0101j\u0101 channel to the rocks beyond. The path then keeps well above the edge of the cliff, among large rocks, over small channels, and across seven or eight of the broader streams by rude bamboo and palm-stem bridges. On the left or Mysore bank a well-kept path leads through shady woods to a point called Watkins's Platform, which commands a view across the chasm to the deep cleft where the waters of the R\u0101j\u0101 and the Roarer join and plunge into the pool below. Hence a farther path through the woods leads down a series of steep steps to the open hill-side, which slopes to the bed of the river. The edge of the pool affords a fine general view of the falls, of the magnificent rugged chasm, and of the deep winding gorge through which, in the course of ages, the waters of the river have untiringly eaten their way.\n\nGersoppa Village (= 'the cashew nut').\u2014Village in the Hon\u0101var t\u0101luka of North Kanara District, Bombay, situated in 14\u00b0 14' N. and 74\u00b0 39' E., on the Shar\u0101vati, about 18 miles east of Hon\u0101var and a similar distance from the falls known by this name. The village is pleasantly placed on the left bank of the river, shaded by a grove of coco-nuts. About a mile and a half east of Gersoppa are the extensive\nruins of Nagarbastikere, which was the capital of the Jain chiefs of Gersoppa (1409-1610), and is locally believed to have contained, in its prosperous days, 100,000 houses and 84 temples. The chief object of interest is a cross-shaped Jain temple, with four doors and four images. There are five other ruinous temples, in which are a few images and inscriptions. The temple of Vardddham\u0101n or Mah\u0101v\u012bra-swami contains a fine black stone image of Mah\u0101v\u012bra, the twenty-fourth or last Jain T\u012brthankar. There are four inscribed stones in Vardddham\u0101n\u2019s temple.\n\nAccording to tradition the Vijayanagar kings (1336-1565) raised a Jain family of Gersoppa to power in Kanara, and Buchanan records a grant to a temple of Gunvanti near Manki in 1409 by Itchappa Wodearu Pritani, the Gersoppa chief, by order of Prat\u0101p Dev Rai Trilochia of the family of Harihar. Itchappa\u2019s granddaughter became almost independent of the Vijayanagar kings. The chiefship seems to have been very often held by women, as almost all the writers of the sixteenth and early part of the seventeenth century refer to the queen of Gersoppa or Bhatkal. In the early years of the seventeenth century Bhaira Devi of Gersoppa, the last of the name, was attacked and defeated by Venkatappa Naik, the chief of Bednur. According to a local account, she died in 1608. In 1623 the Italian traveller Della Valle describes the place as once a famous city, the seat of a queen, the metropolis of a province. The city and palace had fallen to ruin and were overgrown with trees; nothing was left but some peasants\u2019 huts. So famous was the country for its pepper that the Portuguese called the queen of Gersoppa \u2018Rainha da Pimenta,\u2019 or the Pepper-Queen.\n\n**Gevrai.** Northern taluk of Bhar District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 506 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 58,361, compared with 81,119 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famines of 1897 and 1899-1900. The taluk has 135 villages, of which 16 are j\u0101gir; and Gevrai (population, 3,965) is the head-quarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 2\u00b73 lakhs. The God\u0101vari in the north separates the taluk from Aurang\u0101b\u0101d District.\n\n**Ghaggar.**\u2014River of Northern India. It rises on the lower slopes of the Him\u0101layas in the Native State of Sirm\u016br, in 30\u00b0 4\u2032 N. and 77\u00b0 14\u2032 E. Passing within three miles of Amb\u0101la town and touching British territory, it traverses the Native State of Pati\u0101la, where it receives the Saraswat\u012b, enters Hiss\u0101r District, and finally loses itself in Bikaner territory near Hanum\u0101ngarh, formerly called Bhatnair. The river was once an affluent of the Indus, the dry bed of the old channel being still traceable. It is not a perennial stream, but depends on the monsoon rainfall for its supply. At present every village through which the stream passes in its upper course diverts a portion of its waters for irrigation, and no less than 10,000 acres in Amb\u0101la District alone are\nsupplied from this source. The dams thus erected check the course of the stream, while the consequent deposit of silt, greatly facilitated by the dams, has permanently diminished the power of the water to force its way across the dead level of the Karn\u00e1l or Pati\u0101la plains. Near Jakh\u00e1l station on the Southern Punjab Railway a District canal, the Rangoi, takes off from the main stream, and irrigates an average of 12,000 acres annually. The Bikaner Darb\u0101r constantly complained that the dams constructed in Hiss\u00e1r District prevented the water of the river from entering their territory; and in 1896 it was decided to construct a weir at the lower end of the Dhanur lake at Otu, which supplies two canals, one on the north and the other on the south bank. The work was completed at a cost of 6 lakhs, of which the Bikaner State contributed nearly half. The two canals are nearly 95 miles in length (51\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) miles in Bikaner and about 43\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in British territory), and have more than 23 miles of distributaries. They form the most important irrigation works in the Bikaner State, and have supplied about 10,000 acres annually since 1897-8.\n\nThe Ghaggar water, in or near the hills, when used for drinking, produces disastrous results, causing fever, enlarged spleen, and goitre; families are indeed said to die out in the fourth generation, and the villages along its banks are greatly under-populated. Only the prospect of obtaining exceptional returns for their labours can induce cultivators to settle in such an unhealthy region. During the lower portion of its course in Hiss\u00e1r District the bed of the river is dry from November to June, and yields excellent crops of wheat and rice. Even in the rains the water-supply is very capricious, and from time to time it fails entirely except in the immediate neighbourhood of the hills.\n\n**Ghaggar Canals.**\u2014An Imperial system of minor canals in the Punjab, taking off from the Ghaggar. Owing to the waste of water in the lakes and swamps of that river, and the insanitary condition to which the low-lying lands in the valley below Sirsa were reduced, it was agreed between the British Government and the State of Bikaner that the Dhanur lake, about 8 miles from Sirsa, should be converted into a reservoir by the construction of a masonry weir at Otu, and that irrigation should be effected by two canals, the northern and southern, taking off from each end of the weir, with a combined capacity of 1,000 cubic feet per second. The Bikaner State was to share the canal supplies and meet a proportionate part of the cost. The canals were constructed with famine labour in 1896-7, and began to irrigate in the monsoon of 1897. The areas commanded in British and Bikaner territory are 130 and 117 square miles, and the irrigable areas are 53 and 35 square miles, respectively. There are 95 miles of main canals and 24 of distributaries; and the total capital outlay to the end of March, 1904, was 6\u00b73 lakhs, of which 2\u00b78 lakhs was debited to Bikaner.\nThese canals are never likely to show any return on their capital cost, as only part of the irrigated area is assessed to canal occupiers' rates, the remainder being assessed to land revenue only.\n\n**Gh\u0101gr\u0101.**\u2014River in the United Provinces and Bengal. *See Gogra.*\n\n**Ghanaur.** Southern tahsil of the Pinjaur niz\u0101mat, Pati\u0101la State, Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 4' and 30\u00b0 29' N. and 76\u00b0 29' and 76\u00b0 50' E., with an area of 186 square miles. The population in 1901 was 45,344, compared with 49,842 in 1891. The tahsil contains 171 villages, of which Ghanaur is the head-quarters. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 2 lakhs.\n\n**Gh\u0101t\u0101l Subdivision.**\u2014Northern subdivision of Midnapore District, Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 28' and 22\u00b0 52' N. and 87\u00b0 28' and 87\u00b0 53' E., with an area of 372 square miles. The subdivision slopes back from the bank of the R\u016bpn\u0101r\u0101yan; the soil is a rich alluvium, but much of its area is liable to floods, and though excellent crops are obtained, the inhabitants suffer greatly from malaria. The population in 1901 was 324,991, compared with 327,902 in 1891, the density being 874 persons per square mile. It contains five towns, Gh\u0101t\u0101l (population, 14,525), its head-quarters, Chandrakona (9,309), Khirpai (5,045), Ramjib\u0101npur (10,264), and Kahr\u0101r (9,508); and 1,042 villages.\n\n**Gh\u0101t\u0101l Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Midnapore District, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 40' N. and 87\u00b0 43' E., on the Silai river near its junction with the R\u016bpn\u0101r\u0101yan. Population (1901), 14,525. A Dutch factory was formerly situated here. Gh\u0101t\u0101l is an important trade centre and is connected with Calcutta by a daily service of steamers. Cloth and tasur silk are manufactured. It was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income and expenditure during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 7,700 and Rs. 7,400 respectively. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 9,400, mainly from a tax on persons (or property tax): and the expenditure was Rs. 9,300. The town contains the usual public offices: a sub-jail has accommodation for 18 prisoners.\n\n**Gh\u0101tampur.**\u2014Southern tahsil of Cawnpore District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying along the Jumna, between 25\u00b0 56' and 26\u00b0 19' N. and 79\u00b0 58' and 80\u00b0 21' E., with an area of 341 square miles. Population increased from 117,797 in 1891 to 124,662 in 1901. There are 233 villages, but no town. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,76,000, and for cesses Rs. 44,000. The density of population, 366 persons per square mile, is the lowest in the District. The tahsil is divided into two portions by the small stream called Non. The northern half is a tract of fertile loam, while the southern is occupied by soils resembling those found in Bundelkhand, and is much cut up in parts by wild and bare ravines. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 216\nsquare miles, of which 62 are irrigated. The Bhognipur branch of the Lower Ganges Canal supplies five-sixths of the irrigated area.\n\n**Gh\u0101ts, The** (etymologically, 'a pass through a mountain,' or 'landing-stairs from a river'; in this case the 'passes' or 'landing-stairs' from the coast to the inner plateau).\u2014Two ranges of mountains, forming the eastern and the western walls which support the triangular table-land of Southern India. The Eastern Gh\u0101ts run in fragmentary spurs and ranges down the east side of the Peninsula, receding inland and leaving broad tracts between their base and the coast. The Western Gh\u0101ts form the great sea-wall for the west side of the Peninsula, with only a narrow strip between them and the shore. At one point they rise in precipices and headlands out of the ocean, and truly look like colossal 'landing-stairs' from the sea. The Eastern and the Western Gh\u0101ts meet at an angle in the Nilgiris, and so complete the three sides of the interior table-land. The inner plateau has an elevation seldom exceeding 2,000 to 3,000 feet. Its best-known hills are the Nilgiris ('blue mountains'), which contain the summer capital of Madras, Ootacamund (7,000 feet). The highest point is Anaimudi peak in Travancore State (8,837 feet), while Dodabetta in the Nilgiri District reaches 8,760 feet. This wide region of highlands sends its waters chiefly to the east coast. The drainage from the northern edge of the three-sided table-land enclosed by the Gh\u0101ts falls into the Ganges. The Narbad\u0101 runs along the southern base of the Vindhyas which form that edge, and carries their drainage due west into the Gulf of Cambay. The T\u0101pti flows almost parallel to the Narbad\u0101, a little to the southward, and bears to the same gulf the waters from the Satpura Hills. But from this point, proceeding southwards, the Western Gh\u0101ts rise into a high unbroken barrier between the Bombay coast and the waters of the inner table-land. The drainage has therefore to make its way right across India to the eastwards, now twisting round hill ranges, now rushing down the valleys between them, until the rain which the Bombay sea-breeze drops upon the Western Gh\u0101ts finally falls into the Bay of Bengal. In this way the three great rivers of the Madras Presidency\u2014the God\u0101vari, Kistna, and Cauvery\u2014rise in the mountains overhanging the Bombay coast, and traverse the whole breadth of the central table-land before they reach the ocean on the eastern shores of India.\n\nThe entire geography of the two coasts of the Peninsula is determined by the characteristics of these two mountain ranges. On the east, the country is comparatively open, and everywhere accessible to the spread of civilization. It is here that all the great kingdoms of Southern India fixed their capitals. Along the west, only a narrow strip of lowland intervenes between the barrier range and the seaboard. The inhabitants are cut off from communication with the interior, and have been left to\ndevelop a civilization of their own. Again, the east coast is a comparatively dry region. Except in the deltas of the great rivers, the crops are dependent upon a local rainfall which rarely exceeds 40 inches in the year. The soil is poor, the general elevation high, and the mountains are not profusely covered with forest. In this region the chief aim of the Forest department is to preserve a sufficient supply of trees for fuel.\n\nOn the west all these physical conditions are reversed. The rivers are mere hill-torrents, but the south-west monsoon brings an unfailing rainfall in such abundance as to clothe even the hill slopes of the southern portion with a most luxuriant vegetation. The annual fall all along the coast from Surat to Malabar averages 100 inches, which increases to 300 inches high up among the mountains. What the western coast loses in regular cultivation it gains in the natural wealth of its primaeval forests, which display the most magnificent scenery in all India and supply most valuable timber.\n\n(For further information see Gh\u0101ts, Eastern, and Gh\u0101ts, Western.)\n\nGh\u0101ts, Eastern.\u2014The triangular table-land of Southern India is flanked and upheld by two ranges of mountains, which run roughly parallel to its eastern and western seaboard and eventually meet in the high plateau of the Nilgiris. These are known by the generic names of the Eastern and Western Gh\u0101ts, though various portions of them bear local appellations. The Eastern Gh\u0101ts are a disjointed line of small confused ranges which begin in Orissa, pass into Ganj\u0101m, the northernmost District of the Madras Presidency, and run through a greater or less extent of all the Districts which lie between Ganj\u0101m and the Nilgiri plateau. They are about 2,000 feet in elevation on an average, and their highest peaks are less than 6,000 feet. In Ganj\u0101m and Vizagapatam they run close to the shore of the Bay of Bengal, but as they travel southwards they recede farther inland, and leave a stretch of low country from 100 to 150 miles wide between their easternmost spurs and the sea. To the west of them lies a level upland plain, averaging from 1,000 to 2,000 feet in height, one section of which is known as the Deccan.\n\nThe Eastern Gh\u0101ts belong to no one geological formation, and the rocks of which they consist vary in structure and origin with the country through which they pass. The various sections of the range, indeed, differ greatly in other characteristics also. In the Agency tracts of the three northernmost Districts, Ganj\u0101m, Vizagapatam, and God\u0101vari, the range consists of a confused tangle of low and very malarious hills, which have an annual rainfall of from 50 to 80 inches, and are covered with a sparse forest valuable only for the s\u0101l (Shorea robusta) and teak it contains. In these inhospitable hills, parts of which go by the local name of the M\u0101llahs, dwell several backward hill tribes which are not met\nwith elsewhere, such as the Khonds, who almost within living memory practised human sacrifice to secure favourable crops; the Savaras, who still use bows and arrows; the shy Koyis of the God\u0101vari Agency; and other smaller communities. The chief peak in this part of the range is Mahendragiri in Ganjam, which is close on 5,000 feet above the sea.\n\nFarther south, in Kurnool District, the range widens out to form the Nallamalai Hills. Here the annual rainfall is only from 30 to 40 inches, the forest is more sparse, and the peaks are less bold than in the Agencies, scarcely ever exceeding 3,000 feet. Malaria still infests them, however, and they are likewise inhabited by primitive people, the Chenchus of the Nallamalais differing altogether ethnologically from the dwellers in the plains below them.\n\nStill farther southwards, in Cuddapah, the Eastern Gh\u0101ts are known as the P\u0101lkonda Hills, and by other local names. Here they are less malarious, though uninhabited, and the forest growth upon them has changed and contains much of the valuable red-sanders tree (*Pterocarpus santalinus*).\n\nIn North Arcot, Salem, and Coimbatore the range is very broken and contains no well-marked lines, until in the last-named District the Biligiri-Rangan Hills, which lie close to the Nilgiri plateau, are reached.\n\nFew rivers rise in the range. In the north, where the rainfall is heaviest, the Rushikulya and the L\u0101ngulya and one or two considerable tributaries of the God\u0101vari have their sources among its valleys; but farther southwards no streams of importance flow from it. It is not usually a watershed. The various great rivers which rise in or near the moister Western Gh\u0101ts\u2014the God\u0101vari, Kistna, Penner, Ponnav\u0101r, and Cauvery\u2014have all forced their way through the many gaps which occur in its long course.\n\n**Gh\u0101ts, Western.** A range of mountains about 1,000 miles in length, forming the western boundary of the Deccan and the watershed between the rivers of Peninsular India. The Sanskrit name is Sahy\u0101dri. The range, which will be treated here with reference to its course through Bombay, Mysore and Coorg, and Madras, may be said to begin at the Kundaib\u0101ri pass in the south-western corner of the Kh\u0101ndesh District of Bombay Presidency, though the hills that run eastward from the pass to Chimt\u0101na, and overlook the lower T\u0101pti valley, belong to the same system. From Kundaib\u0101ri (21\u00b0 6' N. and 74\u00b0 11' E.) the chain runs southward with an average elevation which seldom exceeds 4,000 feet, in a line roughly parallel with the coast, from which its distance varies from 20 to 65 miles. For about 100 miles, up to a point near Trimbak, its direction is somewhat west of south; and it is flanked on the west by the thickly wooded and unhealthy table-land of Peint, Mokh\u0101da, and Jawh\u0101r (1,500 feet),\nwhich forms a step and a barrier between the Konkan lowlands and the plateau of the Deccan (about 2,000 feet). South of Trimbak the scarp of the western face is more abrupt; and for 40 miles, as far as the M\u0101lsej pass, the trend is south-by-east, changing to south-by-west from M\u0101lsej to Khand\u0101la and V\u0101gjai (60 miles), and again to south-by-east from here until the chain passes out of the Bombay Presidency into Mysore near Gersoppa (14\u00b0 10' N. and 74\u00b0 50' E.). On the eastern side the Gh\u0101ts throw out many spurs or lateral ranges that run from west to east, and divide from one another the valleys of the God\u0101v\u0101ri, Bh\u012bma, and Kistna river systems. The chief of these cross-ranges are the S\u0101tm\u0101las, between the T\u0101pti and God\u0101v\u0101ri valleys; the two ranges that break off from the main chain near Harischandra-garh and run south-eastwards into the Niz\u0101m's Dominions, enclosing the triangular plateau on which Ahmadnagar stands, and which is the watershed between the God\u0101v\u0101ri and the Bh\u012bma; and the Mah\u0101deo range, that runs eastward and southward from Kam\u0101lgarh and passes into the barren uplands of Atp\u0101di and Jath, forming the watershed between the Bh\u012bma and the Kistna systems. North of the latitude of Goa, the Bombay part of the range consists of eocene trap and basalt, often capped with laterite, while farther south are found such older rocks as gneiss and transitional sandstones. The flat-topped hills, often crowned with bare wall-like masses of basalt or laterite, are clothed on their lower slopes with jungles of teak and bamboo in the north; with j\u0101mbul (Eugenia Jambolana), ain (Terminalia tomentosa), and n\u0101na (Lagerstroemia parviflora) in the centre; and with teak, blackwood, and bamboo in the south.\n\nOn the main range and its spurs stand a hundred forts, many of which are famous in Mar\u0101th\u0101 history. From north to south the most notable points in the range are the Kund\u0101ib\u0101ri pass, a very ancient trade route between Broach and the Deccan; the twin forts of S\u0101lher and Mulher guarding the B\u0101bhu\u1e37na pass; Trimbak at the source of the holy river God\u0101v\u0101ri; the Thal pass by which the Bombay-Agra road and the northern branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway ascend the Gh\u0101ts; the Pimpri pass, a very old trade route south between N\u0101sik and Kaly\u0101n or Sop\u0101ra, guarded by the twin forts of Alang and Kulang; Kalsubai (5,427 feet), the highest peak in the range; Harischandra-garh (4,691 feet); the N\u0101na pass, a very old route between Junnar and the Konkan; Shivner, the fort of Junnar; Bh\u012bmashankar, at the source of the Bh\u012bma; Ch\u0101kan, an old Musalm\u0101n stronghold; the Bhor or Khand\u0101la pass, by which the Bombay-Poona road and the southern branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway enter the Deccan, and on or near which are the caves of Kond\u0101ne, K\u0101rli, Bh\u0101ja, and Bedsa; the caves of N\u0101dsur and Kars\u0101mbla below the V\u0101gji pass; the forts of Sinhgarh and Purandhar in the spurs south\nof Poona: the forts of Raigarh in the Konkan and of Pratapgarh between the new Fitzgerald gh\u0101t road and the old P\u0101r pass; the hill station of Mah\u0101baleshw\u0101r (4,717 feet) at the source of the Kistna; the fort and town of S\u0101t\u0101ra; the Kumbh\u0101rli pass leading to the old towns of P\u0101tan and Kar\u0101d; the Amb\u0101 pass, through which runs the road from Ratn\u0101giri to Kolhapur; the forts of Vishalgarh and Panh\u0101lu; the Phonda pass, through which runs the road from Deogarh to Nip\u0101ni; the Amboli and the R\u0101m passes, through which run two made roads from Vengurla to Belgaum; Castle Rock, below which passes the railway from Marmagao to Dh\u0101rw\u0101r; the Arball pass on the road from K\u0101rw\u0101r to Dh\u0101rw\u0101r; the Devimane pass on the road from Kumta to Hubli; and the Gersoppa Falls on the river Shar\u0101vati.\n\nOn leaving the Bombay Presidency, the Western Gh\u0101ts bound the State of Mysore on the west, separating it from the Madras District of South Kanara, and run from Chandragutti (2,794 feet) in the north-west to Pushpagiri or the Subrahmanya hill (5,626 feet) in the north of Coorg, and continue through Coorg into Madras. In the west of the S\u0101gar taluk, from Govardhangiri to Devakonda, they approach within 10 miles of the coast. From there they trend south-eastwards, culminating in Kudremukh (6,215 feet) in the south-west of Kad\u016br District, which marks the watershed between the Kistna and Cauvery systems. They then bend east and south to Coorg, receding to 45 miles from the sea. Here, too, numerous chains and groups of lofty hills branch off from the Gh\u0101ts eastwards, forming the complex series of mountain heights south of Nagar in the west of Kad\u016br District. Gneiss and hornblende schists are the prevailing rocks in this section, capped in many places by laterite, with some bosses of granite. The summits of the hills are mostly bare, but the sides are clothed with magnificent evergreen forests. Gh\u0101t roads to the coast have been made through the following passes: Gersoppa, Koll\u016br, Hosangadi, and Agumbi in Shimoga District; B\u016bndh in Kad\u016br District; Manjar\u0101b\u0101d and Bis\u0101le in Hassan District.\n\nIn the Madras Presidency the Western Gh\u0101ts continue in the same general direction, running southwards at a distance of from 50 to 100 miles from the sea until they terminate at Cape Comorin, the southernmost extremity of India. Soon after emerging from Coorg they are joined by the range of the Eastern Gh\u0101ts, which sweeps down from the other side of the Peninsula; and at the point of junction they rise up into the high plateau of the Nilgiris, on which stand the hill stations of Ootacamund (7,000 feet), the summer capital of the Madras Government, Coonoor, Wellington, and Kotagiri, and whose loftiest peaks are Dodabetta (8,760 feet) and Makur\u1e6di (over 8,000).\n\nImmediately south of this plateau the range, which now runs between\nthe Districts of Malabar and Coimbatore, is interrupted by the remarkable P\u0101lgh\u0101t Gap, the only break in the whole of its length. This is about 16 miles wide, and is scarcely more than 1,000 feet above the level of the sea. The Madras Railway runs through it, and it thus forms the chief line of communication between the two sides of this part of the peninsula. South of this gap the Gh\u0101ts rise abruptly again to even more than their former height. At this point they are known by the local name of the Anaimalais, or \u2018elephant hills,\u2019 and the minor ranges they here throw off to the west and east are called respectively the Nelliampathis and the Palni Hills. On the latter is situated the sanitarium of Kodaik\u0101nal. Thereafter, as they run down to Cape Comorin between the Madras Presidency and the Native State of Travancore, they resume their former name.\n\nNorth of the Nilgiri plateau the eastern flank of the range merges somewhat gradually into the high plateau of Mysore, but its western slopes rise suddenly and boldly from the low coast. South of the P\u0101lgh\u0101t Gap both the eastern and western slopes are steep and rugged. The range here consists throughout of gneisses of various kinds, flanked in Malabar by picturesque terraces of laterite which shelve gradually down towards the coast. In elevation it varies from 3,000 to 8,000 feet above the sea, and the Anamudi Peak (8,837 feet) in Travancore is the highest point in the range and in Southern India. The scenery of the Western Gh\u0101ts is always picturesque and frequently magnificent, the heavy evergreen forest with which the slopes are often covered adding greatly to their beauty. Large game of all sorts abounds, from elephants, bison, and tigers to the Nilgiri ibex, which is found nowhere else in India.\n\nConsiderable areas on the Madras section of the range have been opened up by European capital in the last half-century for the cultivation of tea, coffee, cinchona, and cardamoms. Its forests are also of great commercial value, bamboos, black-wood (Dalbergia latifolia), and teak growing with special luxuriance. The heavy forest with which the range is clothed is the source of the most valuable of the rivers which traverse the drier country to the east, namely the Cauvery, Vaigai, and T\u0101mbraparni; and the waters of the Periy\u0101r, which until recently flowed uselessly down to the sea on the west, have now been turned back by a tunnel through the range and utilized for irrigation on its eastern side.\n\nBefore the days of roads and railways the Gh\u0101ts rendered communication between the west and east coasts of the Madras Presidency a matter of great difficulty; and the result has been that the people of the strip of land which lies between them and the sea differ widely in appearance, language, customs, and laws of inheritance from those in the eastern part of the Presidency. On the range itself, moreover,\nare found several primitive tribes, among whom may be mentioned the well-known Todas of the Nilgiris, the Kurumbas of the same plateau, and the K\u0101dars of the Anaimalais. Communications across this part of the range have, however, been greatly improved of late years. Besides the Madras Railway already referred to, the line from Tinnevelly to Quilon now links up the two opposite shores of the Peninsula, and the range is also traversed by numerous gh\u0101t roads. The most important of these latter are the Charmadi gh\u0101t from Mangalore in South Kanara to Mudgiri in Mysore; the Samp\u0101ji gh\u0101t between Mangalore and Merc\u0101ra, the capital of Coorg; the roads from Cannanore and Tellicherry, which lead to the Mysore plateau through the Perumb\u0101di and Peria passes; and the two routes from Calicut to the Nilgiri plateau up the Karkur and Vayittiri-G\u016bdalur gh\u0101ts.\n\nGh\u0101zi\u0101b\u0101d Tahsil.\u2014South-western tahsil of Meerut District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d, Lon\u012b, and D\u0101sn\u0101, and lying between 28\u00b0 33' and 28\u00b0 56' N. and 77\u00b0 13' and 77\u00b0 46' E., with an area of 493 square miles. The Jumna forms the western boundary. The population rose from 247,141 in 1891 to 276,518 in 1901. The tahsil contains 332 villages and 9 towns, of which the most important are Gh\u0101zi\u0101b\u0101d (population, 11,275), the tahsil head-quarters, Pilkhu\u0101 (5,859), Sh\u0101hid\u0101ra (5,540), and Fak\u012bnagar (5,620). In 1903\u20134 the demand for land revenue was Rs. 4,85,000, and for cesses Rs. 80,000. The tahsil is one of the poorest in the District, the density of population being only 562 persons per square mile, while the District average is 654. The Hindan passes through the western portion and the Chhoiy\u0101, a tributary of the East K\u0101li Nadi, through the eastern. The worst tract, a sandy area cut up by ravines, lies between the Hindan and the Jumna; but the north-east corner, which forms a badly-drained basin, is also very poor. On the other hand, communications by both railway and road are excellent. The tahsil is well supplied by irrigation from the Upper Ganges and Eastern Jumna Canals. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 349 square miles, of which 180 were irrigated. Indigo is a more important crop here than elsewhere, while sugar-cane is less grown than in the rest of the District.\n\nGh\u0101zi\u0101b\u0101d Town. Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Meerut District, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 40' N. and 77\u00b0 26' E., on the grand trunk road from Calcutta to Pesh\u0101war, and a junction for the East Indian, North-Western, and Oudh and Rohilkhand Railways. Population (1901), 11,275. It was founded in 1740 by the Waz\u012br Gh\u0101z\u012b-ud-d\u012bn, son of Asaf Jah, ruler of the Deccan, and was formerly called Gh\u0101zi-ud-din-nagar. In 1763 S\u016braj Mal, the Jat R\u0101j\u0101 of Bharatpur, met his death at the hands of the Rohillas near this place. In May, 1857, a small British force from Meerut encountered and\ndefeated the Delhi rebels, who had marched out to hold the passage of the Hindan. The main site contains two broad metalled bazars at right angles, with masonry drains and good brick-built shops. Extensions have recently been made, including two fine markets, called Wrightganj and Wyerganj, after the Collectors who founded them. The police station and town hall are located in the large sarai built by Gh\u0101zi-ud-din. There is also a dispensary. Near the station the railway companies have built several barracks and houses. The Church Missionary Society and the American Methodists have branches here. Gh\u0101zi\u0101b\u0101d has been a municipality since 1868. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 13,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 17,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 13,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 18,000. There is a considerable trade in grain, hides, and leather. The town contains an Anglo-veracular school, supported by the Church Missionary Society, with 120 pupils in 1904, a tahsil\u012b school with 147, eight aided primary schools with 211, and a girls\u2019 school with 27 pupils.\n\nGh\u0101zipur District.\u2014District in the Benares Division of the United Provinces, lying on both banks of the Ganges, between 25\u00b0 19' and 25\u00b0 54' N. and 83\u00b0 4' and 83\u00b0 58' E., with an area of 1,389 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Azamgarh and Balli\u0101; on the east by Balli\u0101 and the Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d District of Bengal; on the south by Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d and Benares; and on the west by Jaunpur. No hill or natural eminence is to be found within the District; but both north and south of the Ganges the country may be divided into an upland and a low-lying tract. The higher land marks the banks of ancient streams which have now disappeared. Gh\u0101zipur is very thickly inhabited and closely cultivated; and its villages contain numbers of small collections of houses scattered in all parts, instead of being concentrated in a central site, as in the western Districts. The Ganges flows through the southern portion of the District in a series of bold curves. It is joined by the Gumti after a short course in the west, and in the south-east by the Karamn\u0101s\u0101, which for 18 miles forms the boundary between Gh\u0101zipur and Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d. Smaller streams flow across the northern part of the District from north-west to south-east. The G\u0101ngi and Besu join the Ganges midway in its course, while the Mangai and Chhoti Sarj\u016b unite beyond the limits of the District, and subsequently fall into the Ganges.\n\nNo rocks are exposed anywhere in Gh\u0101zipur, and the formation is purely Gangetic alluvium. Kankar or calcareous limestone and saline efflorescences are common.\n\nThe District is well wooded, but its flora presents no peculiarity. The trees are largely of cultivated varieties, such as the mango, bamboo,\nand various fruit trees. There are a few patches of jungle, in which dhak (Butea frondosa) is the most conspicuous tree.\n\nThe country is too densely populated and too well cultivated to harbour many wild animals. The nilgai and antelope are the only large game. The ordinary kinds of water-fowl are found on some of the tanks, and fish are plentiful in the Ganges and its tributaries.\n\nAs compared with other Districts in the United Provinces, Gh\u0101zipur is hot and damp; but the temperature is not subject to the extremes recorded farther west.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages 40 inches, the amount received in different parts of the District varying very little. From year to year, however, fluctuations are considerable. In 1887 the fall was only 16 inches, while in 1894 it was as much as 59 inches.\n\nTradition refers the foundation of the city of Gh\u0101zipur to a mythical hero, G\u0101dh, who is said to have called his stronghold G\u0101dhipur. Nothing definite is known of the early history of the District, which was, however, certainly included in the kingdom of the Guptas of Magadha in the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese pilgrim, in the seventh century, found a kingdom called Chen-Chu in this neighbourhood, the site of the capital of which has not been satisfactorily identified. He noted that the soil was rich and regularly cultivated, and that the towns and villages were close together. A long blank follows, which can only be filled by speculation.\n\nIn 1194 Bih\u0101r and the middle Ganges valley were conquered by Kutb-ud-d\u012bn, the general of Muhammad Ghori, first Musalm\u0101n emperor of Delhi. He had defeated and slain the Hindu champion, Jai Chand, the R\u0101thor R\u0101ja of Kanauj, in the Jumna ravines of Et\u0101wah; and the whole country as far as Bengal lay at his mercy. During the succeeding century we hear little of the present District; but about the year 1330 the city of Gh\u0101zipur was founded (according to a probable tradition) by a Saiyid chief, named Mas\u016bd, who slew the local Hindu R\u0101ja in battle. Sult\u0101n Muhammad Tughlak thereupon granted him the estates of his conquered enemy, with the title of Gh\u0101zi, which gave the name to the newly-founded city. From 1394 to 1476 Gh\u0101zipur was incorporated in the dominions of the Shark\u012b dynasty of Jaunpur, who maintained their independence for nearly a century as rivals to the rulers of Delhi. After their fall, it was reunited to the dominions of the Delhi Sult\u0101ns, and was conquered like the surrounding country by the Mughal emperor, B\u0101bar, after the battle of P\u0101nipat in 1526. In 1539, however, the southern border of the District, close to Buxar in Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d, was the scene of a decisive engagement between the Afghan prince Sher Sh\u0101h and Humay\u016bn, the son of B\u0101bar, in which the latter was utterly defeated and driven out of the country.\nSher Shah's victory settled the fate of Gh\u0101zipur for the next twenty years. It remained in the undisturbed possession of the Afghans, not only through the reigns of the three emperors belonging to the S\u016bri dynasty, but throughout the restored supremacy of Humayun. It was not till the third year of Akbar that Gh\u0101zipur was recovered for the Mughal throne by Kh\u0101n Zam\u0101n, governor of Jaunpur, from whom the town of Zam\u0101nia derives its name. After his rebellion and death in 1566, the District was thoroughly united to the Delhi empire, and organized under the S\u016bbah of Allah\u0101b\u0101d. During the palmy days of Akbar's successors the annals of Gh\u0101zipur are purely formal and administrative, until the rising of the Nawabs of Oudh at the beginning of the eighteenth century. In 1722 Sa\u0101dat Kh\u0101n made himself practically independent as viceroy of Oudh. About 1748 he appointed Shaikh Abdullah, a native of the District, who had fled from the service of the governor at Patna, to the command of Gh\u0101zipur. Abdullah has left his mark in the city by his splendid buildings. His son, Fazl Al\u012b, succeeded him, but after various vicissitudes was expelled by R\u0101j\u0101 Balwant Singh of Benares. Balwant Singh died in 1770, and the Naw\u0101b was compelled by the English to allow his illegitimate son, Chet Singh, to inherit his title and principality. In 1775 the suzerainty of the Benares province was ceded to the British by the Naw\u0101b Waz\u012br, Asaf-ud-daula. The new government continued Chet Singh in his fief until the year 1781, when he rebelled and was deposed by Warren Hastings.\n\nIn 1857 order was preserved till the mutiny at Azamgarh became known on June 3. The fugitives from Azamgarh arrived on that day, and local outbreaks took place. The 65th Native Infantry, however, remained stanch, and 100 European troops on their way to Benares were detained, so that order was tolerably re-established by June 16. No further disturbance occurred till the news of the mutiny at Dinapore arrived on July 27. The 65th then stated their intention of joining Kuar Singh's force; but after the rebel defeat at Arrah they were quietly disarmed, and some European troops were stationed at Gh\u0101zipur. No difficulties arose till the siege of Azamgarh was raised in April, 1858, when the rebels came flying down the Gogra and across the Ganges to Arrah. The disorderly element again rose, and by the end of June the eastern half of the District was utterly disorganized. In July a force was sent to Balli\u0101, which drove the rebels out of the Ganges-Gogra Do\u0101b, while another column cleared the parganas north of the Ganges. The parganas south of the river remained in rebellion till the end of October, when troops were sent across, which expelled the rebels and completely restored order.\n\nThe whole District abounds in ancient sites, where antiquities have been discovered ranging from stone celts, through the Buddhist epoch, to the later Hindu period. In particular, a valuable pillar inscription\nand an inscribed seal of the Gupta kings of Magadha have been found at Bhitri, and another inscribed pillar of the same period (now at Benares). A few Muhammadan buildings of interest stand at Bhitri, Ghazipur Town, and Saidpur.\n\nThe District contains 7 towns and 2,489 villages. The population increased between 1872 and 1891; but a series of adverse seasons from 1893 to 1896 caused a serious decrease in the next decade, chiefly through deaths from fever and migration. The numbers at the four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 832,635, (1881) 963,189, (1891) 1,024,753, and (1901) 913,818. It is probable that the Census of 1872 understated the actual population. More emigrants are supplied to Eastern Bengal and Assam from this District than from any other in the United Provinces. There are four tahsils\u2014Ghazipur, Muhammadabad, Zamania, and Saidpur\u2014each named from its head-quarters. The only municipal town is Ghazipur, the District head-quarters. The chief statistics of population in 1901 are given below:\n\n| Tahsil       | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Ghazipur     | 391                  | 1               | 824      | 266,871    | 683                       | -16.4                                                       | 9,227                                  |\n| Muhammadabad | 320                  | 2               | 694      | 226,760    | 709                       | -9.9                                                        | 5,365                                  |\n| Zamania      | 381                  | 2               | 354      | 237,867    | 624                       | -3.7                                                        | 8,206                                  |\n| Saidpur      | 297                  | 2               | 617      | 182,320    | 614                       | -11.7                                                       | 5,595                                  |\n| District total | 1,389                | 7               | 2,489    | 913,818    | 658                       | -10.8                                                       | 28,393                                 |\n\nAbout 90 per cent. of the population are Hindus and nearly 10 per cent. Musalmans. The District is very thickly populated in all parts. Almost 97 per cent. of the total speak the Bhojpuri dialect of Bihari, and the remainder Hindustani.\n\nThe most numerous Hindu castes are the Ahirs (graziers and cultivators), 145,000; Chamars (leather-workers and labourers), 117,000; Rajputs or Chhattis, 78,000; Koiris (cultivators), 66,000; Brahmins, 63,000; Bhars (labourers), 45,000; Bhuinhars (agriculturists), 38,000; and Binds (fishermen and cultivators), 28,000. The Bhuinhars are a high caste, corresponding to the Babhans of Bihar. The Koiris, Bhars (an aboriginal race), and Binds (akin to the Kahars) are found only in the east of the United Provinces and in Bihar. The District is essentially agricultural, 71 per cent. of the population being supported by agriculture, and 5\u00bd per cent. by general labour. Brahmins, Rajputs or Chhattis, and Bhuinhars own nearly two-thirds of the land, and\n\n---\n\n1 Specimens are given in Journal, Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1884, p. 232.\nMusalm\u0101ns about one-fifth. The three high castes of Hindus named above cultivate about two-fifths of the area held by tenants, and lower castes about half.\n\nOut of 329 native Christians in 1901, the Anglican communion claimed 111, the Lutherans 63, and Presbyterians 42. The Lutheran Mission has been established at Gh\u0101zipur town since 1855, and the Zan\u0101na Mission since 1890.\n\nThe usual soils are found in the upland areas, varying from light sandy to loam and clay. In some places, and especially in the east of the District, the soil is black, resembling the rich black soil of Bundelkhand in its physical qualities. In the wide valley of the Ganges large stretches of rich alluvial soil are found, which produce excellent spring crops without irrigation. The District is within the area in which blight attacks the spring crops.\n\nThe ordinary tenures found in the permanently settled Districts of the United Provinces exist in Gh\u0101zipur. Many mah\u0101ls are of the variety called \u2018complex,\u2019 and instead of including a single village (mausa) or part of a village extend to several villages. The weakness of joint responsibility, and the large number of co-sharers who desire to collect rent and pay revenue separately instead of through a representative, render the revenue administration very difficult. The main agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134 are shown below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil       | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Gh\u0101zipur     | 391   | 236        | 143       | 90              |\n| Muhammad\u0101b\u0101d | 320   | 234        | 82        | 38              |\n| Zam\u0101nia      | 351   | 302        | 53        | 16              |\n| Saidpur      | 297   | 186        | 87        | 41              |\n| **Total**    | **1,389** | **958**    | **365**   | **185**         |\n\nRice and barley are the chief food-crops, covering 209 and 230 square miles, or 22 and 24 per cent. of the total cultivated area. Peas and mas\u016br (161 square miles), gram (117), kodon (89), arhar (82), wheat (61), and bijra (60) are also largely cultivated. Barley is grown chiefly on the uplands, and pure wheat, pure gram, and mixed wheat and gram in the lowlands. Sugar-cane (35 square miles) and poppy (26) are important crops. Melons are grown in sandy alluvial deposits, and close to Gh\u0101zipur town 200 or 300 acres of roses supply material for the manufacture of scent.\n\nThe area under cultivation increased by about 11 per cent. between 1840 and 1880; but there has been no permanent increase since then, and within the last twenty years no improvements have been noted in agricultural practice. Poppy is more largely grown, and the area\nunder gram has increased; but, on the other hand, indigo cultivation, which was formerly important, is rapidly dying out, and a smaller area is planted with sugar-cane. The cultivation of tobacco for the English market was introduced at Gh\u0101zipur in 1876, but has been abandoned. Few advances are made under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists' Loans Acts. Out of a total of Rs. 60,000 advanced between 1890 and 1900, Rs. 49,000 was lent in the single year 1896\u20137. In four years since 1900 Rs. 10,000 was advanced.\n\nThere is no particular breed of cattle, and the best animals are imported. Two selected bulls are at present maintained by the Court of Wards for the improvement of the local stock. A stud farm was maintained at Gh\u0101zipur for many years, but was closed about 1873, and only inferior ponies are now bred. Sheep and goats are plentiful, but the breed is not peculiar.\n\nOut of 365 square miles irrigated in 1903\u20134, 259 were irrigated from wells, 93 from tanks, and 13 from streams. The rivers are of little use, owing to their depth below the surrounding country. Swamps or jh\u012bls are used as long as there is any water left in them; but they dry up by December, and then wells take their place. The wells are usually worked by bullocks, which raise water in leathern buckets. Many of the tanks are artificial, but all are of small size. In the rice tracts water is held up by small field embankments. Irrigation is required for the spring crops in all parts, except in the black soil and the alluvial tract.\n\nKankar is found throughout the District, except in the alluvial deposits of the Ganges, and is used for metalling roads and making lime. Saltpetre and carbonate of soda are extracted from saline efflorescences or reh.\n\nThere are few manufactures. Sugar is refined, and coarse cotton cloth is woven in small quantities for local use. Gh\u0101zipur Town, however, contains two important industries\u2014the preparation of opium for export, and the distillation of otto of roses and other perfumes.\n\nThe District exports sugar, oilseeds, hides, perfumes, opium, and occasionally grain; and imports piece-goods, yarn, cotton, salt, spices, and metals. Gh\u0101zipur town was once the chief trading centre in the eastern portion of the Ganges-Gogra Do\u0101b, and also traded with the Districts north of the Gogra and with Nep\u0101l. The opening of the Bengal and North-Western Railway through Gorakhpur deprived it of the trans-Gogra trade, and the Do\u0101b traffic has been largely diverted by other branches. River traffic has now decreased considerably, and only bulky goods, such as grain and Mirz\u0101pur stone, are carried by boat. Saidpur, Zam\u0101nia, and Gh\u0101zipur are the chief trading centres; but the recent-railway extensions are changing the direction of commerce.\nGh\u0101zipur is now well supplied with railways. For many years the main line of the East Indian Railway, which crosses the District south of the Ganges, was the only line; a branch was subsequently made from Dildarnagar to T\u0101r\u012b Gh\u0101t on the Ganges opposite Gh\u0101zipur town, as a Provincial railway. Between 1898 and 1904 the tract lying north of the Ganges was opened up by the Bengal and North-Western Railway (metre gauge), one line running north and south from Benares to Gorakhpur, while another passes east and west from Jaunpur to Balli\u0101, the junction being at Aunrih\u0101r. Communications by road are also good. There are 587 miles of roads, of which 96 are metalled. The latter are in charge of the Public Works department, but the cost of maintenance of all but 21 miles is charged to Local funds. The main lines are those from Gh\u0101zipur town to Gorakhpur (with a branch to Azamgarh), to Benares, and to Buxar. Avenues of trees are maintained on 91 miles.\n\nThe District has suffered from no serious famine since the commencement of British rule. In 1783 there was great scarcity in the province of Benares, and Warren Hastings described a scene of desolation from Buxar to Benares. Distress was felt in 1873\u20134 and more severely in 1877\u20138; but although relief works were opened, few people came to them. The District suffered from an excess of rain in 1894, and a deficiency in 1895 and 1896. Prices rose very high; but the spring crop of 1897 was abundant and the cultivators sold their crops at high prices, while the labouring classes are accustomed to seek employment in distant parts of India.\n\nThe Collector is usually assisted by a member of the Indian Civil Service, and by five Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. An officer of the Opium department is responsible for operations in the District, in addition to the large staff of the factory. A tahsild\u0101r is posted at the head-quarters of each tahsil.\n\nThere are three District Munsifs, a Sub-Judge, and a District Judge for civil work. The District of Balli\u0101 is included in the Civil and also in the Sessions Judgeship of Gh\u0101zipur. The people of Ch\u0101zipur are exceedingly litigious and rather quarrelsome, while the excessive subdivision of land and the large area subject to alluvion and diluvion are the causes of many disputes. Offences against the peace are thus common, and even serious crimes, such as arson, occur frequently. On the other hand, professional dacoity is almost unknown.\n\nThe District was ceded to the British in 1775 as part of the province of Benares, and its revenue administration was included in that of Benares District up to 1818, when a separate District of Gh\u0101zipur was formed. This comprised the present District of Balli\u0101, which was not separated till 1879. The land revenue was permanently settled between 1787 and 1795; and the changes made subsequently have been\ndue to the resumption of revenue-free land, to the assessment of land which had previously escaped, and to alluvion and diluvion. The permanent settlement was made without any survey, and did not include the preparation of a record-of-rights. The necessity for both of these operations was obvious, and between 1839 and 1841 a survey was made, on the basis of which a record-of-rights was drawn up. At the same time land which had escaped at the permanent settlement was assessed. As the papers prepared between 1840 and 1842 were not periodically corrected, they soon fell into confusion, and an attempt was made in 1863 to revise them. In 1879, however, a complete revenue resurvey was carried out, and a revised record was subsequently prepared which has had a very beneficial effect in settling disputes. Annual papers are now maintained by the patw\u0101ris, as in the rest of the Provinces. The revenue assessed in 1795 was 8.5 lakhs; and the demand for 1903\u20134 was 10.3 lakhs, falling at the rate of Rs. 1.4 per acre over the whole District, and varying from Rs. 1 to Rs. 2 in different parganas.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880\u20131 | 1890\u20131 | 1900\u20131 | 1903\u20134 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 10,51  | 10,48  | 10,37  | 10,14  |\n| Total revenue  | 14,00  | 16,49  | 16,01  | 16,41  |\n\nThere is only one municipality, Gh\u0101zipur Town, but five towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. Outside the limits of these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which had in 1903\u20134 a total income of Rs. 98,000, of which Rs. 42,000 was derived from local rates. The expenditure was a lakh, including Rs. 56,000 spent on roads and buildings.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police has a force of 3 inspectors, 77 subordinate officers, and 313 constables, distributed in 15 police stations, besides 130 municipal and town police, and 1,653 rural and road police. The District jail, which also accommodates prisoners from Balli\u0101, had a daily average of 435 inmates in 1903.\n\nThe population of Gh\u0101zipur compares fairly well with other Districts as regards literacy, 3.2 per cent. (6.2 males and 0.2 females) being able to read and write in 1901. In the case of Musalm\u0101ns, the proportion rises to 4.3 per cent. The number of public schools increased from 123 with 5,133 pupils in 1880\u20131 to 182 with 8,712 pupils in 1900\u20131. In 1903\u20134 there were 202 such schools with 10,449 pupils, of whom 447 were girls, besides 50 private schools with 257 pupils. One of the public schools is managed by Government, and 102 by the District and municipal boards. Out of a total expenditure on education of Rs. 46,000, Local funds provided Rs. 40,000, and fees Rs. 3,100.\nThere are 8 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 72 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 59,000, including 1,400 in-patients, and 3,500 operations were performed. The total expenditure was Rs. 11,000, from Local funds.\n\nAbout 24,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, representing a proportion of 26 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipality of Gh\u0101zipur.\n\n[W. Oldham, Memoir on Ghazeepoor District (1870 and 1876); District Gazetteer (1884, under revision); W. Irvine, Report on Revision of Records (Ghazipur, 1886).]\n\n**Gh\u0101zipur Tahsil.**\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of Gh\u0101zipur District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Gh\u0101zipur, Pachotar, and Sh\u0101di\u0101b\u0101d, and lying north of the Ganges, between 25\u00b0 23' and 25\u00b0 53' N. and 83\u00b0 16' and 83\u00b0 43' E., with an area of 391 square miles. Population fell from 319,385 in 1891 to 266,871 in 1901, the rate of decrease being nearly 20 per cent. There are 824 villages and only one town, GH\u0100ZIPUR (population, 39,429), the District and tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,66,000, and for cesses Rs. 49,000. The density of population, 683 persons per square mile, is slightly above the District average. Besides the Ganges, the G\u0101ng\u012b, Bes\u016b, and Mangai drain the tahsil, flowing across it from north-west to south-east. In the northern portions rice is largely grown, and there are considerable tracts of barren \u016bsar land from which carbonate of soda (sajj\u012b) is collected. The area under cultivation in 1903-4 was 236 square miles, of which 143 were irrigated. Wells supply nine-tenths of the irrigated area, and tanks the remainder.\n\n**Gh\u0101zipur Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of the same name, United Provinces, situated in 25\u00b0 35' N. and 83\u00b0 36' E., on the left bank of the Ganges, and on a branch of the Bengal and North-Western Railway, and also connected by a steam ferry with the terminus of a branch of the East Indian Railway on the opposite side of the river. Population (1901), 39,429. The town was founded, according to Hindu tradition, by R\u0101j\u0101 G\u0101dh, an eponymous hero, from whom it took the name of G\u0101dhipur; but it more probably derives its name from the Saiyid chief, Mas\u016bd, whose title was Malik-us-S\u0101d\u0101t Gh\u0101zi. Mas\u016bd defeated the local R\u0101j\u0101 and founded Gh\u0101zipur about 1330. For its history and Mutiny narrative see GH\u0100ZIPUR DISTRICT.\n\nThe town stretches along the bank of the Ganges for nearly 2 miles, with a breadth from north to south of about three-quarters of a mile. The massive walls of the old palace, called the Chahal Sit\u016bn or 'forty pillars,' the numerous masonry gh\u0101ts, and a mud fort form striking features in the appearance of the river front. Mas\u016bd's tomb and that of his son are plain buildings; and the only other antiquities are the tank and tomb of Pah\u0101r Kh\u0101n, governor in 1580, and the garden.\ntank, and tomb of Abdullah, governor in the eighteenth century. Abdullah's palace, which was still intact at the time of Bishop Heber's visit, is now in ruins, though a gateway still remains. The tomb of Lord Cornwallis, who died here in 1805, consists of a domed quasi-Grecian building with a marble statue by Flaxman. Gh\u0101zipur is the head-quarters of the Opium Agent for the United Provinces, and the opium factory is situated here, to which are consigned the poppy products, opium leaf, and trash of all the Districts in the United Provinces. The factory occupies an area of about 45 acres, and its main function is to prepare opium for the Chinese market, where it is known as Benares opium. Opium for consumption in the United Provinces, the Punjab, Central Provinces, and part of the supply for Bengal, Assam, and Burma are also prepared here, besides morphia and its salts, and codeia for the Medical department in all parts of India. During the busy season, from April to June, about 3,500 hands are employed daily; while at other times the number varies from 500 to 2,000. Gh\u0101zipur was constituted a municipality in 1867. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 40,000 and Rs. 39,000 respectively. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 45,000, chiefly from octroi (Rs. 31,000) and rents (Rs. 6,000). The expenditure in the same year was Rs. 46,000. The town is no longer an important trade centre, as the tract north of the Ganges, which it formerly served, is now traversed by railways. Besides the manufacture of opium, the chief industry is that of scent-distilling. Roses are grown close to the town, and rose-water and otto of roses are largely manufactured. There are about 14 schools, attended by 1,400 pupils. Gh\u0101zipur is the head-quarters of the Lutheran Mission in the District, and contains male and female dispensaries.\n\nGh\u0101zipur Tahsil.\u2014South-central tahsil of Fatehpur District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Gh\u0101zipur, Ay\u0101 S\u0101h, and Mutaur, and lying between 25\u00b0 41' and 25\u00b0 55' N. and 80\u00b0 31' and 81\u00b0 4' E., with an area of 277 square miles. Population fell from 92,389 in 1891 to 91,222 in 1901. There are 151 villages, but no town. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,95,000, and for cesses Rs. 31,000. The density of population, 329 persons per square mile, is the lowest in the District. The tahsil lies along the Jumna, and the soil for some distance from that river resembles the poorer soils of Bundelkhand. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 158 square miles, of which 39 were irrigated. The Fatehpur branch of the Lower Ganges Canal supplies nearly half the total irrigation, but in the northern part tanks or jhils are used. Irrigation from wells is insignificant.\n\nGhazni.\u2014Chief town of the district of the same name in the K\u0101bul province of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, situated in 33\u00b0 44' N. and 68\u00b0 18' E., 92 miles from K\u0101bul, and 221 from Kandah\u0101r; 7,279 feet above the sea.\nGhazni is celebrated in Indo-Afghan history as the seat of the Ghaznivid dynasty which furnished the first Muhammadan ruler of a united and aggressive Afghanistan. The dynasty dates from Alptagin, a Turkish slave who had risen to high office under the Samanids; but its real founder was Sabuktagin, a former slave of Alptagin and the husband of his daughter. Under Sabuktagin's son, the famous Mahmud of Ghazni, who reigned from 998 to 1030, and made many expeditions into India, the dominion of the Ghaznivids stretched from Lahore to Samarkand and Ispahan, and Ghazni was adorned with splendid buildings and a university. After Mahmud's death the usual process of decline set in; and Ghazni was destroyed in 1153 by Al\u00e2-ud-din Husain, of the Afghan house of Ghor (hence styled Jal\u00e2'\u00een soz, the 'world incendiary'), who spared only the tombs of Sultan Mahmud and two of his descendants. From this time Ghazni lost its pristine importance, and in the subsequent historic vicissitudes of Afghanistan it was generally connected with Kabul.\n\nIn the first Afghan War Ghazni was stormed by the British troops in July, 1839, and occupied till December, 1841, when, concomitantly with the disasters in Kabul, the garrison was forced to surrender. In 1842 it was again occupied by General Nott, who, after dismantling the fort, carried off the celebrated gates\\(^1\\), which Mahmud is said to have removed from the Somnath temple in Gujar\u00e2t in 1024, and which still closed the entrance to his tomb. Ghazni was twice visited by a British force in 1880: namely, in April by Sir Donald Stewart, on his march from Kandahar to Kabul; and in August by Lord Roberts, on his march from Kabul to Kandahar. On the former occasion an Afghan force was defeated in the vicinity of the town. Ghazni is now a decayed town of no military strength, and contains only about 1,000 inhabited houses. It is situated on the left bank of the Ghazni river, on the level ground between the river and the termination of a spur which here runs east and west from the Gul Koh range. It may be described as an irregular square, having a total circuit of about \\(1\\frac{1}{4}\\) miles. It is surrounded by a wall, about 30 feet high, built on the top of a mound in part natural and in part artificial, and flanked by towers at irregular intervals. The city is composed of dirty, irregular streets of houses several storeys high. The inhabitants are Afghans, Hazaras, and a few Hindu traders. The chief trade is in corn, fruit, madder, and the sheep's wool and camel's-hair cloth brought from the adjoining Hazara country. Postins are its sole manufacture. The climate of Ghazni is very cold, snow often lying on the ground from November to February. During the summer and autumn fevers of a typhoid type are very prevalent and fatal.

See Vijayadurg.\n\n**Ghod.**\u2014Village in the Khed taluka of Poona District, Bombay, situated in 19\u00b0 2' N. and 73\u00b0 53' E., about 25 miles north of Khed town. Population (1901), 5,720. Ghod is the head-quarters of the Ambegaon petha, and contains an old mosque, with a Persian inscription recording that it was built about 1580 by one Mir Muhammad. In 1839 a band of Kolis threatened the petty divisional treasury at Ghod. Mr. Rose, Assistant Collector, gathered a force of peons and townspeople, and successfully resisted the repeated attacks of 150 insurgents who besieged them the whole night. The town contains two schools with 350 boys and 75 girls.\n\n**Ghodbandar.**\u2014Port in the Salsette taluka of Thana District, Bombay, situated in 19\u00b0 17' N. and 72\u00b0 54' E., on the left bank of Bassein creek, 10 miles north-west of Thana, and supposed to be the Hippokura of Ptolemy. Population (1901), 646. The customs division called after Ghodbandar comprises five ports: namely, Rai Utan, Manori, Bandra, Vesava, and Ghodbandar. The total trade of these five ports in 1903-4 was 7\u00bd lakhs, of which 2\u00bd lakhs represents imports and 5\u00bd lakhs exports, the last consisting of rice, stone, lime, sand, coco-nuts, salt, fish, and firewood. The imports are hardware, cloth, groceries, rice, oil, molasses, butter, tobacco, gunny-bags, san-hemp, and timber. Under the Portuguese, Ghodbandar stood a siege by the Maratha Sivaji, who appeared before it in 1672. In 1737 it was captured by the Marathas, and the Portuguese garrison put to the sword. Fryer (1675) calls the town Grebondel. A resthouse on the shore has accommodation for 50 travellers. There are some Portuguese architectural remains. The traders in Ghodbandar are Agris, Kohs, Muhammadans, and Christians, and most of them trade on borrowed capital.\n\n**Ghodn\u0101.**\u2014One of the Simla Hill States, Punjab.

See Ghusuri.\n\n**Ghor.**\u2014A ruined city in Afghanistan, situated in a valley never visited by any European, about 120 miles south-east of Herat in the Taimani country, of which the Ghorat forms a large part. The Ghorat, which is so called from the two valleys of the Ghor-i-Taiwara and the Ghor-i-Moshkan, has an area of about 7,000 square miles.\nIt is divided from the Northern Taimani country by the watershed of the Farrah Rud. The general elevation is about 7,000 feet. It is inhabited by Taimanis, Moghals, and Tajiks, of whom the Taimanis are the most numerous. The total population has been roughly computed at 8,000, but this number is at least doubled during the summer months by the influx of Durr\u0101nis from the Pusht-i-R\u016bd and Sabzawar. The climate of the Ghorat in winter is severe, but the summer and autumn are delightful. The inhabitants trade in wool, ghi, cheese, grain, hides, horses, sheep, cattle, woollen blankets, and barak or woollen cloth. There are no manufactures.\n\nGhor is celebrated as the seat of the Afgh\u0101n family who, after a long and bitter feud with the Sult\u0101ns of Ghazni, eventually overthrew them (1153), and later extended their conquests over the whole of Northern India as far as the delta of the Ganges. The origin of this dynasty has been much discussed. The prevalent, and apparently the correct, opinion is that both they and their subjects were Afgh\u0101ns. In the time of Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni, Ghor was held by a prince whom Firishta calls Muhammad S\u016bri Afgh\u0101n. The territory of Ghor was treacherously seized by Mahm\u016bd and converted into a dependency. Later, Kutb-ud-din S\u016br, the chief of Ghor, who had married a daughter of Sult\u0101n Bahr\u0101m of Ghazni, was put to death by the Sult\u0101n. His death was avenged by his brother Saif-ud-d\u012bn, who captured Ghazni. Bahr\u0101m fled, but soon returned at the head of an army, and, having taken Saif-ud-d\u012bn prisoner, put him to death by torture. The quarrel was then espoused by a third brother, Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn, who defeated Bahr\u0101m and gave up Ghazni, at that time perhaps the noblest city in Asia, to flame, slaughter, and devastation. All the superb monuments of the Ghaznivid kings were demolished, except the tombs of Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd and two of his descendants.\n\nAfter Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn had satiated his fury at Ghazni, he returned to Ghor, where he died in 1156, and was succeeded by his son Saif-ud-d\u012bn, whose reign lasted for only one year. At his death the throne passed to the elder of his cousins, Ghiy\u0101s-ud-d\u012bn, who associated his brother, Muhammad Shah\u0101b-ud-d\u012bn, better known as Muhammad Ghori, in the government. Ghiy\u0101s-ud-d\u012bn retained the sovereignty during his life, but he seems to have left the conduct of military operations almost entirely to Shah\u0101b-ud-d\u012bn. Under these two princes Ghor reached the zenith of its greatness, and on their death rapidly sank into insignificance. The conquests of Muhammad Ghori far exceeded those of Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni, but he had neither the culture nor the general talents of that great prince. Accordingly, while the name of Mahm\u016bd is yet one of the most celebrated in Asia, that of Muhammad of Ghor is scarcely known beyond the countries over which he ruled. The whole of Northern India was brought under subjugation by\nMuhammad Ghori and his generals. The empire of Ghor during his lifetime extended from Khor\u0101s\u0101n and Seistan on the west to the delta of the Ganges on the east; from Khw\u0101rizm, the Kh\u0101nates of Turkist\u0101n, the Hindu Kush, and the Him\u0101layas on the north to Baluchist\u0101n, the Gulf of Cutch, Gujar\u0101t, and M\u0101lw\u0101, on the south. Chiy\u0101s-ud-d\u012bn died in 1202, and his more famous brother was murdered on the banks of the Indus in 1200 by a band of Ghakhars. Muhammad of Ghor was succeeded by his nephew, Mahm\u016bd; but though the latter\u2019s sovereignty was acknowledged by all, the kingdom broke at once into practically separate states, which were scarcely held together even in name by his general supremacy. The most important and lasting of these was the kingdom of Delhi, which started into independent existence under the Slave dynasty. On Mahm\u016bd\u2019s death five or six years later, there was a general civil war throughout all his dominions west of the Indus, and these countries were soon subdued by the kings of Khw\u0101rizm. Ghazni was taken in 1215, and Firoz Koh at an earlier period. The Ghorids appear, however, to have partially recovered from this temporary extinction, for there is evidence that in the fourteenth century Her\u0101t was defended by Muhammad S\u0101m Ghori against a successor of Chingiz Kh\u0101n. At a later period Tim\u016br in his memoirs mentions a certain Ghiy\u0101s-ud-d\u012bn as ruler of Khor\u0101s\u0101n, Ghor, and Ghirjist\u0101n, and in many places calls him Ghori. The famous Sher Sh\u0101h, who temporarily expelled Hum\u0101y\u016bn from India and introduced many of the administrative reforms popularly ascribed to Akbar, was possibly connected with this house.\n\nThe most important ruins, of which the country is full, are those at Yakh\u0101n Pain, a short march south-west of Taiw\u0101ra. These have been described as the remains of an ancient city covering a large extent of ground, and comprising massive ruins of forts and tombs. This was probably the Ghor taken by Mahm\u016bd of Ghazn\u012b, and the seat of the Ghorid princes. Ruins of less note are everywhere numerous; among these there would appear to be some of Buddhist origin in Yaman.\n\n**Ghora.\u2014State in Central India. See Jobat.**\n\n**Ghor\u0101b\u0101ri.\u2014T\u0101luka of Kar\u0101chi District, Sind, Bombay, lying between 23\u00b0 55\u2032 and 24\u00b0 34\u2032 N. and 67\u00b0 22\u2032 and 68\u00b0 2\u2032 E., with an area of 566 square miles. The population rose from 30,518 in 1891 to 34,736 in 1901. The t\u0101luka contains one town, Ket\u012b (population, 2,127), and 93 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 78,000. It includes the Ket\u012b mah\u0101l, the population of which is 8,499. The head-quarters are at Kotri Allahrakhio. The soil of the t\u0101luka, which is narrow and straggling in shape, is alluvial; and in the south, below the town of Ket\u012b Bandar, there is a wide expanse of mud flats, liable to frequent flooding by the sea. Irrigation is provided by the Baghiar, Ghar, Marho, Nasir Wah, and Makri Wah.**\ncanals. The principal crop is rice; *bajra*, barley, and sugar-cane are also grown.\n\n**Ghora Dakka.**\u2014Small cantonment in Haz\u0101ra District, North-West Frontier Province, situated in $34^\\circ 2'$ N. and $73^\\circ 25'$ E., on the road between Dung\u0101 Gali and Murree, 3 miles from the former and 15 from the latter place. During the summer months it is occupied by a detachment of British infantry.\n\n**Ghor\u0101gh\u0101t.**\u2014Ruined city in the head-quarters subdivision of Din\u0101jpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $25^\\circ 15'$ N. and $89^\\circ 18'$ E., on the west bank of the Karatoy\u0101 river. Some ruins are connected by legend with Vir\u0101t R\u0101j\u0101 of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, in whose court Yudhishthira with his four brothers and wife found exile. There are also the remains of a strong military and administrative outpost established under Muhammadan rule at the end of the fifteenth century by Al\u0101-ud-din Husain.\n\n[Martin (Buchanan), *Eastern India*, vol. ii, pp. 678\u201381.]\n\n**Ghor\u0101sar (Ghod\u0101sar).**\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\n**Ghos\u012b.**\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Azamgarh District, United Provinces, lying between $25^\\circ 57'$ and $26^\\circ 19'$ N. and $83^\\circ 21'$ and $83^\\circ 52'$ E., with an area of 368 square miles. The tahsil was formed in 1904 by transferring the *parganas* of Nath\u016bpur and Ghos\u012b from Sagri tahsil, and portions of the *pargana* of Muhammad\u0101b\u0101d from the tahsil of that name. Population according to the Census of 1901 is 260,840, and the density is about the District average. There are 519 villages and two towns: Dohr\u012bgh\u0101t (population, 3,417) and Kop\u0101ganj (7,039). The demand for land revenue is Rs. 2,72,000, and for cesses Rs. 46,000. The tahsil lies between the Gogra and the Chhot\u012b Sarj\u016b and Tons, and thus includes a considerable area of low-lying *kachh\u0101r* land, which is subject to fluvial action.\n\n**Ghotki T\u0101luka.**\u2014T\u0101luka of Sukkur District, Sind, Bombay, lying between $27^\\circ 40'$ and $28^\\circ 11'$ N. and $69^\\circ 4'$ and $69^\\circ 35'$ E., with an area of 518 square miles, including the Pano Akil mah\u0101l (168 square miles). The population rose from 67,743 in 1891 to 72,019 in 1901. The t\u0101luka contains one town, Ghotki (population, 3,821), the headquarters; and 129 villages. The density, 139 persons per square mile, is much above the District average. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 2\u00b72 lakhs. The t\u0101luka is liable to floods, and depends for the irrigation of its *jow\u0101r* and wheat upon small canals leading direct from the Indus. The zamind\u0101rs are mostly small holders and impoverished. Much forest land fringes the banks of the river.\n\n**Ghotki Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in Sukkur District, Sind, Bombay, situated in $28^\\circ$ N. and $69^\\circ 21'$ E., on the North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 3,821. The Muham-\nGIDHAUR\n\nmadan residents are chiefly Path\u00e3ns, Malaks, Saiyids, Muchis, and Loh\u00e3rs, and the Hindus principally Bani\u00e3s. Ghotki was founded about 1747. The mosque of Pir Musan Sh\u00e3h, the founder of the place, 113 feet long by 65 feet broad, and decorated with coloured tiles, is the largest in Sind, and of great sanctity. Local trade is chiefly in cereals, indigo, wool, and sugar-cane. The Loh\u00e3rs (blacksmiths) of Ghotki are famed for their metal-work; wood-carving and staining are also very creditably executed. The municipality, constituted in 1855, had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 8,045. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 7,500. The town contains a dispensary and two schools, attended by 172 boys and 6 girls.\n\nGhund.\u2014A fief of the Keonthal State, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 2' and 31\u00b0 6' N. and 77\u00b0 27' and 77\u00b0 33' E., with an area of 28 square miles. The population in 1901 was 1,927, and the revenue is about Rs. 2,000. A tribute of Rs. 250 is paid to the Keonthal State. The present chief, Th\u00e3kur Bishan Singh, exercises full powers, but sentences of death require the confirmation of the Superintendent, Simla Hill States.\n\nGhur\u00e3m (Kuhr\u00e3m, or R\u00e3nggarh).\u2014Ancient town in the Ghanaur tahsil, Pinjaur niz\u00e3mat, Pati\u00e3la State, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 7' N. and 76\u00b0 33' E., 26 miles south of R\u00e3jpura. Population (1901), 798. Tradition avers that it was the abode of the maternal grandfather of R\u00e3ma Chandra, king of Ajodhya. In historical times Kuhr\u00e3m is first mentioned as surrendering to Muhammad of Ghor in 1192. It remained a fief of Delhi during the early period of the Muhammadan empire, but fell into decay. Extensive ruins mark its former greatness.\n\nGhusuri.\u2014Northern suburb of Howrah city in Howrah District, Bengal, containing jute and cotton-mills, jute-presses, and rope-works. The last, founded a century ago, forms the oldest factory industry in the town. Ghusuri is a permanent market, with a large trade in agricultural produce.\n\nGidar Dhor.\u2014River in Baluchist\u00e3n. See HINGOL.\n\nGidhaur.\u2014Village in the Jam\u00fbi subdivision of Monghyr District, Bengal, situated in 24\u00b0 51' N. and 86\u00b0 12' E. Population (1901), 1,780. Gidhaur is the present seat of one of the oldest of the noble families of Bih\u00e3r. Their original home was at the foot of the hills near the village of Khaira; and the ruins of an old stone fort and other buildings may still be traced in the scrub jungle there. Close by are the remains of a large masonry fort, known as Naulakhagarh, the erection of which is by local tradition ascribed to Sher Sh\u00e3h, but which may once have been the seat of the family. The founder was Bir Bikram Singh, a R\u00e3jput who emigrated from his home in Central India about the thirteenth century, and, after slaying a local Dos\u00e3dh ruler who held sway over large estates in the neighbourhood, estab\nlished the Gidhaur R\u0101j. R\u0101j\u0101 P\u016bran Mal, eighth in descent from B\u012br Bikram Singh, built the great temple of Baidyan\u0101th. The present head of the family is Sir R\u0101vaneswar Pras\u0101d Singh, K.C.I.E.\n\nGigas\u0101ran.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nGilgit.\u2014Head-quarters of a scattered district or waz\u0101rat of the Kashmir State, situated in $35^\\circ 55'$ N. and $74^\\circ 23'$ E., at an elevation of 4,890 feet above sea-level. The waz\u0101rat stretches south to Astor and the northern slopes of the Burzil, follows the Astor river to its junction with the Indus, and then runs north along the Indus to Bunji. It was once a flourishing tract, but never recovered from the great flood of 1841, when the Indus was blocked by a landslip below the Hatu Pir, and the valley was turned into a lake. Opposite Bunji is the valley of Sai, and 6 miles farther up the Gilgit river falls into the Indus. Gilgit is about 24 miles from the Indus, and has a considerable area of fertile irrigated land. The waz\u0101rat now includes the tract known as Haramush on the right bank of the Indus, and numerous valleys leading down to the Gilgit river. To the north the boundary reaches Guach Pari on the Hunza road, and up the Kargah nullah as far as the Bhaldi mountain to the south in the direction of Darel. From Gilgit itself mountain roads radiate into the surrounding valleys, and its geographical position now, as in ancient times, renders the fort on the right bank of the Gilgit river an important place. A suspension bridge connects Gilgit with the left bank, which is here as barren as the right bank is fertile. The ancient name of the site under its Hindu R\u0101s was Sargin. Later it was known as Gilit, which the Sikhs and Dogr\u0101s corrupted into Gilgit, but to the country people it is familiar still as Gilit or Sargin Gilit. It lies in the most mountainous region of the Him\u0101layas. Within a radius of 65 miles there are eleven peaks ranging from 18,000 to 20,000 feet; seven from 20,000 to 22,000 feet; six from 22,000 to 24,000 feet; and eight from 24,000 to 26,600 feet. At their bases the mountains are barren and repellent, but at 7,000 feet there are fine forests of juniper and fir. Above these are the silver birch, and above all vegetable growth lie sweep after sweep of glacier and eternal snow.\n\nThe pencil cedar is found from 14,400 feet down to 6,000 feet, and sometimes reaches a girth of 30 feet. *Pinus excelsa* grows between 9,500 and 12,000 feet. The edible pine is common in Astor, and ranges from 7,000 to 10,000 feet. The useful birch-tree is common, and grows as high as 12,500 feet. The tamarisk does well in the barren valleys up to 6,000 feet. Roughly speaking, the upper limit of vegetation around Gilgit is 16,200 feet; above this the rocks are stained with lichens.\n\nHere are found the wild goats (*Capra sibirica* and *C. falconeri*), he ibex and *markhor* and their deadly foe, the beautiful snow ounce.\n(Felis uncia), and occasionally the wild dog (Cyon rufus). The red bear (Ursus isabellinus), the snow-cock (Tetraogallus himalayanus), and the grey partridge are common; and many of the migratory birds of India\u2014wild geese, duck, and quail\u2014pass up and down in the autumn and spring. Below the forest on the lower and more barren hills, numerous flocks of wild sheep (Ovis vignei and O. nathura) are met with.\n\nThe climate is healthy and dry. At Gilgit itself it is never very cold and snow seldom lies for more than a few hours. In the summer it is hot owing to the radiation from the rocky mountains, but it is cool compared with the climate of Northern India. The rainfall is very light.\n\nThe remains of ancient stone buildings and Buddhist carvings suggest that Gilgit was once the seat of a Hindu kingdom, or a Buddhist dynasty, while traces of abandoned cultivation point to the fact that the population in early times was far larger than it is at present. For many centuries the inhabitants of Gilgit have been Muhammadans, and nothing definite is now known of their Hindu predecessors. Tradition relates that the last of the Hindu R\u0101s, Sri Badat, known as Adam-Khor, the \u2018man-eater,\u2019 was killed by a Muhammadan adventurer, who founded a new dynasty known as Trakhane. Sri Badat\u2019s rule is said to have extended to Chitr\u0101l, and the introduction of Isl\u0101m seems to have split up the kingdom into a number of small states carrying on a fratricidal warfare and incessant slave-raiding. The Trakhane dynasty is now extinct, though it is claimed that the present titular R\u0101 of Gilgit has a slight stain of Trakhane blood. In the early part of the nineteenth century we find Y\u0101sin giving a R\u0101 to Gilgit. He was killed by the ruler of Puni\u0101l, who in turn was killed by Tair Sh\u0101h, chief of Nagar. Tair Sh\u0101h was succeeded by his son, who was killed by Gauhar Aman, ruler of Y\u0101sin. For the subsequent history of Gilgit see Kashmir. The history of Astor, or, as the Dogr\u0101s call it, Hasora, is intimately connected with that of Sk\u0101rd\u016b. More than 300 years ago Gh\u0101zi Mukhpun, a Persian adventurer, is said to have married a princess of the Sk\u0101rd\u016b reigning family. The four sons born of this union became R\u0101s of Sk\u0101rd\u016b, Astor, Rondu, and Kharmang respectively, and from them are descended the families of the present chiefs of those places. The independence of Astor ceased at the Dogr\u0101 conquest. The present titular R\u0101 of Astor is the lineal descendant of Gh\u0101zi Mukhpun. The Dogr\u0101 rule has secured peace to the country, but it will be long before the country recovers entirely from the desolating slave-raids of Chil\u0101s.\n\nThe waz\u0101rat contains 264 villages, with a population, according to the Census of 1901, of 60,885. The pressure on the cultivated area is great, the density being 1,295 per square mile. The people of Astor and Gilgit would be surprised if they were told that they were Dards\nliving in Dardistan, and their neighbours of Hunza-Nagar and Yasin would be equally astonished. If consulted, they would probably describe their country as Shinaka, or the land of the Shins, where Shin\u0101 is the spoken language. They are an Aryan people, stoutly built, cheery, honest, frugal, and sober. They are devoted to polo, and are fond of dancing. The inhabitants of Astor wear a peculiar head-dress, a bag of woollen cloth, half a yard long, which is rolled up outwards at the edges until it gets to the size to fit comfortably to the head, round which the roll makes a protection from cold or from sun nearly as good as a turban. Their houses are small, with very small doors, and are usually built out from the mountain-side. Warmth is the one consideration. The Astoris have some very peculiar customs. Drew notices that they hold the cow in abhorrence. They will not drink cow\u2019s milk, nor will they burn cow-dung, the universal fuel of the East, and in a pure Shin village no one will eat fowls or touch them. They practise inoculation for small-pox, their one epidemic. The people of Astor are Musalmans, two-thirds being of the Sunni persuasion, and the rest being either Shiahs or Maulais. There is no religious intolerance among them.\n\nDrew mentions the following caste divisions: Ronu, Shins, Yashkun, Kremins, and Dums. As regards the Ronu caste, he says that there are a small number of families in Gilgit. Biddulph, in his Tribes of the Hindu Koosh, says that it forms 6 per cent. of the Gilgit population, and that it is the most honoured caste of all, ranking next to Mukhpuns or the Raj\u0101 caste of Dardistan.\n\nThe majority of the Astoris belong to the Yashkun caste, and the Shins are few in number, under 3,000. They are more numerous in Gilgit, the total number of Shins being, according to the last Census, 7,733. The Shins are regarded with great respect by the Yashkuns and the other castes. The Yashkuns claim the Shins as their forefathers. The Shins give their daughters to Ronus and to Saiyids, but take wives from the Yashkuns.\n\nFar away in Central Ladakh in the Hanu valley live other Dards of the Buddhist religion. They have retained the Aryan type of the country whence they came, and its Shin\u0101 dialect, but they wear the pigtail and the Ladakh cap. It is said that, though Buddhist by name, they really worship local spirits and demons. They practise polyandry, but they will not eat with Tibetan Buddhists, and, like the Shins in Dardistan, they hold the cow in abhorrence.\n\nIn Gilgit, as in Astor, there are few social subdivisions, for the people are forced to depend on themselves for most wants of life. The language spoken is Shin\u0101, though only a small percentage of the population is Shin. The religion is Muhammadan, Shiahs preponderating. There is an entire absence of fanaticism. The national\ncharacter is mild, and the men are unwarlike. The Gilgiti is attached to his home and his family, and is an industrious cultivator. Both men and women are strongly built, of a fairer complexion than the people of India. The women paint their faces with a kind of thin paste, to keep the skin soft and to prevent sun-burn. They are fond of flowers, and decorate their caps with irises and roses.\n\nThe cultivation is of a high character. The fields are carefully tilled, heavily manured, and amply irrigated. In Gilgit itself good rice is grown, and crops of wheat, barley, maize, millet, buckwheat, pulses, rape-seed, and cotton are raised, while fruit is plentiful. There is very little grazing land, and cattle are scarce. Lucerne grass is largely cultivated for fodder.\n\nIn the cold dry climate of Astor cultivation is carried on up to an elevation of 9,000 feet. It depends entirely on irrigation by little channels known as kul. The chief crops are wheat, barley, peas, maize, millet, and buckwheat. The people pay great attention to fodder and cultivate lucerne grass. Cultivation is precarious in Astor, as the crops frequently do not ripen owing to the cold, and there are several vegetable pests in the shape of worms.\n\nMany of the streams are rich in gold, especially those which flow from Hunza and Nagar and from the Indus above Chilas. Gold-washing is carried on in the winter chiefly by the poorer members of the population, though the work is often remunerative. At Chilas entire families live by the work. The gold is of fair quality, the best being twenty carats. The Bagrot valley is celebrated for gold-washing, and contains many signs of mineral wealth.\n\nThe only manufacture is the weaving of woollen cloth (pattu), but this is for home use, and not for sale. Trade does not flourish. The local wants are few, and the only chance of Gilgit becoming an important commercial centre lies in the opening of a trade route to Yarkand. The chief staple of trade is salt. Russian chintz is brought down from Yarkand, and is said to be more durable than the English article.\n\nThe most important roads are those leading to India. The ten-foot road over the Burzil and Raj Diangan passes is described in the article on Kashmir. By that route Gilgit lies at a distance of 390 miles from the present railway base at Rawalpindi. An alternative line has been opened over the Babusar pass, which brings Gilgit within 250 miles of the railway at Hasan Abdal. This line, besides being shorter, has the advantage of only crossing one snow pass, instead of two, or practically three, if the winter snow at Murree is taken into consideration. The routes to the north are mere tracks when the military roads connecting Gilgit with the outposts at Gupis and Hunza have been passed.\n\nThere is a daily postal service with India by the Burzil pass and\nKashmir, and the telegraph line follows the same route. Both services work well in spite of heavy snow and destructive avalanches, and are maintained by the Government of India. There is a weekly postal service from Gilgit to Chilas and Gupis, and a fortnightly post between Gilgit and Kashghar, via the Kilik pass in the summer, and the Mintaka in the winter.\n\nThe Gilgit waz\u0101rat is in charge of a Wazir Waz\u0101rat. Crime is slight; there is no jail and no police organization. Police duties are carried out by the levies and a few soldiers of the Kashmir regular troops. There is little litigation, and the chief preoccupation of the Wazir is the question of supplies to the garrison at Gilgit, provided by an excellent system of transport from Kashmir. In 1891-2, at the time of the Hunza-Nagar expedition, the garrison had a force of 2,451; in 1895, when the Chitr\u0101l disturbances broke out, it consisted of 3,373 troops; and the present garrison numbers 1,887, including a mountain battery and two infantry regiments, and sappers and miners. A school is maintained at Gilgit.\n\nA land revenue settlement of Astor and Gilgit has been made. It was impossible to introduce a purely cash assessment owing to the State's requirements in grain, but many inequalities and abuses were removed, and, on the whole, the condition of the villagers is satisfactory.\n\nA British Political Agent resides at Gilgit. He exercises some degree of supervision over the Wazir of the Kashmir State, and is directly responsible to the Government of India for the administration of the outlying districts or petty States of Hunza, Nagar, Ashkuman, Y\u0101sin, and Ghizar, the little republic of Chilas, and also for relations with Tangir and Darel, over which valleys the Puni\u0101l R\u0101s and the Mehtarjaos of Y\u0101sin have partially acknowledged claims. These States acknowledge the suzerainty of Kashmir, but form no part of its territory. They pay an annual tribute to the Darb\u0101r: Hunza and Nagar in gold; Chilas in cash (Rs. 2,628); Askuman, Y\u0101sin, and Ghizar in grain, goats, and ghi. The relations of the Political Agent with the outlying States are eminently satisfactory. No undue interference takes place in the administrations, and the people are encouraged to maintain their customs and traditions intact. Besides the military garrison, furnished by the Kashmir State, there is a small but extremely efficient force of local levies armed with Snider carbines. They are drawn from Hunza, Nagar, Puni\u0101l, Sai, and Chilas.\n\nGingee (Gingi). -A famous rock-fortress in the Tindivanam t\u0101luk of South Arcot District, Madras, situated in 12\u00b0 15' N. and 79\u00b0 25' E., on the road from Tindivanam to Tiruvann\u0101malai. The interest of the place is chiefly historical. The existing village is a mere hamlet, with a population (1901) of only 524. The fortress consists of three strongly\ndefended hills\u2014R\u0101jagiri, Kistnagiri, and Chandr\u0101ya Drug\u2014connected by long walls of circumvallation. The most notable is R\u0101jagiri, on which stands the citadel. It is about 500 or 600 feet high, and consists of a ridge terminating in a great overhanging bluff facing the south, and falling with a precipitous sweep to the plain on the north. The citadel is on the summit of this bluff. At the point where the ridge meets the base of the bluff, a narrow and steep ravine gives a difficult means of access to the top. On every other side it is quite inaccessible, the sides of the rock rising sheer from the base to a great height. Across this ravine the Hindu engineers built three walls, each about 20 or 25 feet high, and rising one behind the other at some little distance, which rendered an attack by escalade in that direction almost impracticable. The way to the summit leads through the three walls by several gateways; but at the very top this portion of the rock is divided by a narrow chasm 24 feet wide and 60 feet deep from the main mass of the hill, and the only way into the citadel is across this chasm. The fortifiers of the rock artificially prolonged and heightened it, threw a wooden bridge across, and made the only means of ingress into the citadel through a narrow stone gateway facing the bridge and about 30 yards from it, which was fortified on the side of the citadel with flanking walls, fitted with embrasures for guns and loopholed for musketry. It has been said with truth that in the conditions of warfare then existing this gateway could have been held by ten men against ten thousand.\n\nIt is not known with certainty who constructed the fort, but historical accounts and the nature of the buildings point to the conclusion that the credit of building it belongs mainly, if not entirely, to the ancient Vijayanagar dynasty. The round towers and cavaliers show traces of European supervision, and some of the more modern embrasures were the work of the French. The great lines of fortifications which cross the valley between the three hills, enclosing an area of 7 square miles, were evidently built at different periods. In their original form, each consisted of a wall about 5 feet thick, built up of blocks of granite and filled in with rubble; but subsequently a huge earthen rampart, about 25 or 30 feet thick, has been thrown up behind these walls, and revetted roughly on the inside with stone, while at intervals in this rampart are barracks or guard-rooms.\n\nSeveral ruins of fine buildings are situated within the fort. Of these the most remarkable are the two temples, the Kaly\u0101na Mahal, the gymnasium, the granaries, and the idg\u0101h. There are various picturesque mantapams, or buildings supported on stone pillars, on each of the hills, and a large granary on the top of Kistnagiri. The most attractive ruin of all, perhaps, is the Kaly\u0101na Mahal, which consists of a square court surrounded by rooms for the ladies of the governor's household. In the\nmiddle of this court is a square tower of eight storeys, about 80 feet high, with a pyramidal roof. The first six storeys are all of the same size and pattern: namely, an arcaded veranda running round a small room about 8 feet square, and communicating with the storey above by means of small steps. The room on the seventh storey has now no veranda, but there are indications that one formerly existed. The topmost room is of smaller size than the others.\n\nThe principal objects of interest in the fort are the great gun on the top of R\u0101jagiri; the R\u0101j\u0101's bathing-stone, a large smooth slab of granite, 15 square feet and about a foot thick, which lies near the spot where the palace is said to have stood; and the prisoners' well. This last is a singular boulder about 15 or 20 feet high, poised on a rock near the Chakrakulam reservoir, and surrounded by a low circular brick wall. It has a natural hollow passing through it like a well; and the bottom having been blocked up with masonry, and the upper edges smoothed with a little masonry work plastered with lime, a natural dry well was formed. Into this prisoners are said to have been thrown and allowed to die of starvation. The top of the boulder can be reached only by means of a ladder, and the hollow in it has now been filled in with rubbish. The metal of which the gun is made shows little or no rust. It has the figures 7560 stamped on the breech. A little to the south of R\u0101jagiri is a fourth hill called Chakkili Drug. The summit is strongly fortified, but these defences are not connected with those of the other hills.\n\nGingee is familiar to the Tamil population throughout Southern India by means of a popular ballad still sung by wandering minstrels, which has for its object the story of the fate of the genius loci, Desing R\u0101j\u0101. According to the ballad, this Desing was an independent ruler of Gingee who paid no tribute to any power. The emperor Aurangzeb had remitted all payment, as a reward for his skill in managing a horse that no one else could ride. The Naw\u0101b of the Carnatic was jealous of the R\u0101j\u0101's independence, and on his refusing to pay tribute invaded his territory. In the fight that followed Desing R\u0101j\u0101, though at first apparently successful owing to supernatural interference, was eventually defeated and killed. His wife the R\u0101n\u012b committed sat\u012b, and the Naw\u0101b, out of respect for her memory, built and named after her the town of R\u0101n\u012bpet in North Arcot District. As mentioned above, Gingee was a stronghold of the Vijayanagar dynasty, which was at the height of its prosperity at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and was finally overthrown by the allied Muhammadan Sult\u0101ns of the Deccan in 1565 at the battle of T\u0101likot\u0101. It was not till 1638, however, that Banda-ullah Kh\u0101n, the Bijapur general, with the assistance of the troops of Golconda, captured the fort. The division of the Bijapur army which effected this capture was commanded by Sh\u0101hji, father of the famous\nSivaji. In 1677 the fort fell to Sivaji by stratagem, and remained in Mar\u0101th\u0101 hands for twenty-two years. In 1690 the armies of the Delhi emperor under Zulfik\u0101r Kh\u0101n were dispatched against Gingee, the emperor being bent upon the extirpation of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 power. The siege was prolonged for eight years, but the fort fell in 1698, and afterwards became the head-quarters of the Musalm\u0101n standing army in the province of Arcot. In 1750 the French under M. Bussy captured it by a skilful and daringly executed night surprise, and held it with an efficient garrison for eleven years. Captain Stephen Smith took the place after a five weeks\u2019 siege in 1761. In 1780 it was surrendered to Haidar \u0100l\u012b, and it played no part of importance in the subsequent campaigns.\n\nGingee long enjoyed the reputation of being one of the most unhealthy localities in the Carnatic. The French are said by Orme to have lost 1,200 European soldiers during their eleven years\u2019 tenancy of it. There is no trace, however, of any burial-ground where these men were interred. The spread of cultivation and attention to sanitary improvements seem to have made the locality more salubrious, for its character for malaria is not now considered remarkable. The fortress is entirely deserted. The Government has made an annual grant for the preservation of the ruins, and has recently issued orders for the preparation of estimates for the complete repair and restoration of some of the main buildings in the fort.\n\n**G\u012br.**\u2014Range of hills in K\u0101th\u012b\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay, extending over 40 miles in length, commencing from a point about 20 miles north-east of Diu island. Captain Grant of the Indian Navy was captured in 1813 by an outlaw named B\u0101w\u0101-V\u0101la, who kept him a prisoner on these hills for two and a half months. The region consists of a succession of rugged ridges and isolated hills covered with forest. It has long been famous as the haunt of a particular variety of lion which some few years ago was in danger of extermination. Latterly, however, they have been protected to such an extent that their numbers have risen to about seventy, and they have on many occasions killed cattle and even attacked solitary villagers.\n\n**Giri\u0101.**\u2014Site of battle-field in the Jangipur subdivision of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d District, Bengal, situated in 24\u00b0 30\u2032 N. and 88\u00b0 6\u2032 E., to the south of S\u016bt\u012b. It is famous as the scene of two important battles: the first in 1740, when Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n defeated Naw\u0101b Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n, and won for himself the government of Bengal; the second in 1763, when Naw\u0101b M\u012br K\u0101sim, after declaring war on the East India Company, was finally defeated and the governorship was conferred for the second time on M\u012br Jafar.\n\n**Giriak.**\u2014Village in the Bih\u0101r subdivision of Patna District, Bengal, situated in 25\u00b0 2\u2032 N. and 85\u00b0 32\u2032 E., on the Panch\u0101na river, and connected with Bih\u0101r town by a metalled road. Population (1901), 243.\nSouth-west of the village, and on the opposite side of the river, stands the peak at the end of the double range of hills commencing near Gay\u0101, which General Cunningham identifies with Fa Hian\u2019s solitary mountain, suggesting at the same time that its name is derived from Ekigri, or \u2018one hill\u2019; but his views have not met with universal acceptance. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton has described the ruins of Giriak, which are full of archaeological interest. They were originally ascended from the north-east, and remains still exist of a road about 12 feet wide, paved with large blocks, and winding so as to procure a moderate gradient. At the west end of the ridge, a steep brick slope leads up to a platform, on which are some granite pillars, probably part of an ancient temple. East of the ridge is an area 45 feet square, called the chabutra of Jar\u0101sandha, the centre of which is occupied by a low square pedestal, supporting a solid brick column 68 feet in circumference and 55 feet in height. It is popularly believed that Krishna crossed the river at this point on his way to challenge Jar\u0101sandha to combat, and a bathing festival is held at the spot annually in the month of K\u0101rtik to commemorate the event.\n\n[M. Martin, Eastern India, vol. i, pp. 78-80; and Archaeological Survey of India Reports, vol. i, pp. 16-34, and vol. viii.]\n\n**Giridih Subdivision.**\u2014Eastern subdivision of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh District, Bengal, lying between 23\u00b0 44\u2032 and 24\u00b0 49\u2032 N. and 85\u00b0 39\u2032 and 86\u00b0 34\u2032 E., with an area of 2,002 square miles. The northern portion of the subdivision consists of hilly country and undulating uplands, which merge in the valley of the Bar\u0101kar on the south and of the Sakri river on the north. To the south there is a second hilly tract, in which Parasn\u0101th Hill is situated, and along the southern boundary is the valley of the D\u0101modar. The population in 1901 was 417,797, compared with 401,811 in 1891, the density being 209 persons per square mile. It contains one town, G\u012br\u012bd\u012bh (population, 9,433), the head-quarters; and 3,408 villages. Important coal-fields belonging to the East Indian Railway are situated in the neighbourhood of Giridih town. Parasn\u0101th Hill is a well-known place of pilgrimage for the Jains.\n\n**Giridih Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh District, Bengal, situated in 24\u00b0 10\u2032 N. and 86\u00b0 22\u2032 E. Population (1901), 9,433. Giridih is connected by a branch with the main line of the East Indian Railway at Madhupur, and is the centre of the Karharb\u0101ri coal-field (see Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh District). Giridih was constituted a municipality in 1902. The average income since its constitution has been Rs. 3,000, and the expenditure Rs. 2,900. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 5,600, mainly derived from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 5,200. The town contains the usual subdvisional offices, and a sub-jail with accommodation for 21 prisoners.\nGiri R\u0101j ('The royal hill'; called Annak\u016b\u1e6d in early Sanskrit literature).\u2014A sandstone hill, about 4 or 5 miles long, near the town of Gobardhan, in Muttra District, United Provinces, between $27^\\circ 28'$ and $27^\\circ 31'$ N. and $77^\\circ 26'$ and $77^\\circ 29'$ E. The rock rises abruptly from the alluvial plain, and runs north-east and south-west with an average elevation of 100 feet. On the north, it ends in the M\u0101nas\u012b Gang\u0101 tank at Gobardhan. According to Hindu fable, Indra, enraged at being deprived of his usual sacrifices, caused violent storms to pour down on the people of Braj, who were protected by Krishna by means of this hill, which he held aloft on the tip of his finger for seven days and nights. Pious pilgrims may still be seen measuring their length in the dust the whole way round it, while the hill is reckoned so holy that the main road, which crosses it at its lowest point, is carried over by a paved causeway.\n\nGirishk.\u2014An old fort in the Kandah\u0101r province of Afghanistan, situated in $31^\\circ 45'$ N. and $64^\\circ 37'$ E., on the right bank of the Helmand river, 78 miles from Kandah\u0101r and 329 from Her\u0101t (via Farrah); 3,641 feet above the sea. The town is insignificant, and owes all its importance to being the head-quarters of the H\u0101kim of the Pusht-i-R\u016bd district. A small Afghan garrison lives outside the fort. Girishk was occupied by the British from 1839 till 1842, and for the last nine months of that period amid great difficulties, by a native force of 200 Sindhis, Punjabis, and Hindustanis, under a fine Indian soldier named Balwant Singh. This small garrison held their own against from 10,000 to 15,000 Durr\u0101nis, and the defence was one of the most brilliant exploits of the campaign. Girishk was again occupied for a short period by a British force in the beginning of 1879.\n\nGirn\u0101r.\u2014Sacred hill, with ruined temples, in K\u0101thiaw\u0101r, Bombay, situated in $21^\\circ 30'$ N. and $70^\\circ 42'$ E., about 10 miles east of Jun\u0101garh town. The hill rises to about 3,500 feet above sea-level and has five principal peaks: Amb\u0101 M\u0101ta, which is crowned by the temple of that goddess; Gorakhn\u0101th, the highest of all, which is 3,666 feet above the sea; Oghad Shikhar; Guru Dattatraya; and K\u0101lka's peak, which till quite recently was the resort of Aghoris or Mardikhors, a degraded order of ascetics who profess to recognize no distinctions in the purity of food and have been known to eat human flesh. The fortress and part of the old palace of the Chud\u0101s\u0101mas is still standing. There are three famous kunds or reservoirs, the Gau Mukhi, Hanum\u0101n Dh\u0101ra, and Kamandal Kund. The great rock Bhairav Jap forms a most picturesque feature of the hill. A little distance from the foot of the hill lies V\u0101mansthali, the ancient capital, while Balisth\u0101n, the modern Bilkha, lies immediately at its base. The ancient name of the hill was Ujjayanta or Girvar. It forms one of the sacred seats of the Jains, only second in importance to P\u0101lit\u0101na. A rock at the foot of the hill\nis covered with a set of Asoka's inscriptions, 250 B.C. Another inscription (A.D. 150) relates how the local monarch Rudra D\u0101man defeated the king of the Deccan; while a third (A.D. 455) records the bursting of the embankment of the Sudarsana tank and the rebuilding of a bridge which was destroyed by the flood. There are, however, no remains of any ancient city, temples, or ruins of a corresponding age to these inscriptions, and but for their dates the place would have seemed to be unknown before the tenth century.\n\nThere are six parahs or resthouses on the ascent to the temple of Nemin\u0101th. The temple of Amb\u0101 M\u0101ta, which crowns the first peak of the hill, is much resorted to by newly-married couples of the different subdivisions of the Br\u0101hman caste. The bride and bridegroom have their clothes tied together, and, attended by their male and female relatives, present coco-nuts and other offerings to the goddess, whose favour is sought to secure a continuance of wedded felicity. The Jun\u0101garh State has recently erected a fine flight of steps to the top of the hill. Mr. James Fergusson, in his History of Indian and Eastern Architecture (1876, pp. 230-232), thus described the architectural features of Girn\u0101r:\n\n'The principal group of temples at Girn\u0101r, some sixteen in number, is situated on a ledge about 600 feet from the summit and nearly 3,000 feet above the level of the sea. The largest and possibly the oldest of these is that of Nemin\u0101th. An inscription upon it records that it was repaired in A.D. 1278, and unfortunately a subsequent restorer has laid his heavy hand upon it, so that it is difficult now to realize what its original appearance may have been. The temple stands in a courtyard measuring 195 feet by 130 feet over all. Around the courtyard are arranged 70 cells with a covered and enclosed passage in front of them, each of which contains a cross-legged seated figure of the T\u012brthankar to whom the temple is dedicated (Nemin\u0101th), and generally with a bas-relief or picture representing some act in his life. Immediately behind the temple of Nemin\u0101th is a triple one, erected by the brothers Tejp\u0101la and Vastup\u0101la, who also erected one of the principal temples in Abu.'\n\nGirw\u0101.\u2014A branch of the Kauri\u0101la river in Nep\u0101l and Oudh. The Kauri\u0101la bursts through a gorge in the Him\u0101layas called Shish\u0101 P\u0101ni, or 'glass water,' and a little below this point divides into two, the western branch retaining the name Kauri\u0101la, while the eastern is called Girw\u0101. The latter is now the more considerable, though it was formerly the smaller of the two. In its upper course the Girw\u0101 is a rapid stream with a pebbly bed; but it becomes navigable at Dhanaura before entering British territory, and grain, timber, ginger, pepper, and gh\u012b are carried down it from Nep\u0101l. It reunites with the Kauri\u0101la a few miles below Bharth\u0101pur in Bahraich District.\n\nGirw\u0101n.\u2014Tahsil of Band\u0101 District, United Provinces, conterminous\nwith *pargana* Sihonda, lying between $24^\\circ 59'$ and $25^\\circ 28'$ N. and $80^\\circ 17'$ and $80^\\circ 34'$ E., with an area of 334 square miles. Population fell from 85,528 in 1891 to 77,706 in 1901. There are 179 villages and one town, K\u0101linjar (population, 3,015). The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,19,000, and for cesses Rs. 19,000. The density of population, 233 persons per square mile, is the highest in the District. In the west flows the Ken, which is fringed with ravines; but the *tahsil* is on the whole fertile. In 1903\u20134 only 2 square miles were irrigated, out of 168 square miles under cultivation. The Ken Canal, when completed, will serve a large area in this *tahsil*.\n\n**Goa Settlement.**\u2014Portuguese Settlement on the western coast of India, within the limits of the Bombay Presidency, lying between $14^\\circ 53'$ and $15^\\circ 48'$ N. and $73^\\circ 45'$ and $74^\\circ 24'$ E., with an area of 3,370 square kilometres or 1,301 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the river Terekhol or Araundem, separating it from the S\u0101vantv\u0101di State; on the east by the range of the Western Gh\u0101ts, separating it from the Districts of Belgaum and North Kanara; on the south by North Kanara; and on the west by the Arabian Sea. Extreme length from north to south, 62 miles; greatest breadth from east to west, 40 miles. Goa forms a compact block of foreign territory on the coast of the Bombay Presidency surrounded by British Districts. It comprises the island of Goa or Ilhas, acquired in 1510, and the provinces of Salsette and B\u0101rdez, acquired in 1543. These three form the Velhas Conquistas or \u2018old conquests.\u2019 The districts of Pernem, Bicholim or Batagram, Sat\u0101ri, Ponda or Antruz, Zambaulim or Panchmal, Canacona or Advota, are called the Novas Conquistas or \u2018new conquests,\u2019 and were acquired in the latter half of the eighteenth century. The island of Anj\u016bm\u0101n, situated opposite the port of K\u0101rw\u0101r in the British District of North Kanara, forms administratively a portion of the province of Goa. It was acquired by the Portuguese in 1505.\n\nGoa is a hilly country, especially that portion which was most recently acquired, known as the Novas Conquistas. Its distinguishing feature is the Western Gh\u0101ts, or Sahy\u0101dri mountains, which, after skirting a considerable portion of the north-eastern and south-eastern boundaries, branch off westwards across the territory into numerous spurs and ridges. Of the isolated peaks with which these ranges of mountains are studded, the most conspicuous are: on the north, Sons\u0101gar, 3,827 feet above sea-level; Catlanchimauli, 3,633 feet; Vaguerim, 3,500 feet; Morlemchogor, 3,400 feet, all in the Sat\u0101ri mah\u0101l or district; on the east and west, Sidnato at Ponda, Chandarnate at Chandrowadi, Consid at Astagr\u0101r, and Dudsagar at Embarb\u0101cem.\n\nThe territory is intersected by numerous rivers, which are generally\nnavigable. The eight principal rivers are as follows. The Terekhol or Araundem, so called from the fortress of that name guarding its estuary, has its source in the Western Gh\u0101ts in the S\u0101vantv\u0101di State, flows south-west for $14\\frac{1}{2}$ miles, and, after forming the northern boundary of the district of Pernem, and also of the territory of Goa, discharges its waters into the Arabian Sea. The Ch\u0101por\u0101 or Colvalle, 18 miles long, rises at the R\u0101m gh\u0101t, and, after separating the districts of B\u0101rdez, Bicholim, and Sanquelim from Pernem, takes a zigzag direction to the south-west through the villages of Salem, Revora, and Colvalle, and empties itself into the sea close to the village of Ch\u0101pora. The B\u0101ga, only 1 mile long, rises in B\u0101rdez, and passes a redoubt of the same name. The Sinquerim, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles long, also rises in B\u0101rdez close to the village of Pilerne, and, after describing almost a right angle, westwards and southwards, and forming the peninsula of Aguada, falls into the bay of the same name. The Mand\u0101vi, $38\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in length, is the most important stream in the territory, both the ancient and modern metropolis being situated on its banks. It rises at the Parvar gh\u0101t in the district of Sat\u0101ri, runs first north-west of Ponda, and then south-west of Bicholim and B\u0101rdez, and, after forming several islands and passing Panjim or New Goa, discharges its waters into the Bay of Aguada; its principal offshoots pass the villages of Mapu\u00e7a, Tivim, and Assonora, watering the districts of Bicholim, Sanquelim, and Zambaulim, and are locally known by those names. The Ju\u0101ri, 39 miles in length, rises at the foot of the Dighy gh\u0101t in the district of Embarb\u0101cem, runs northwards, separating Salsette from Ponda, and falls into the Bay of Marmagao; like the Mand\u0101vi, it has numerous offshoots, one of which joins the former river between Marcaim and S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, after forming the island of Tissuadi. The S\u0101l, 15 miles long, runs close to the town of Margao, and discharges itself into the sea near the fort of Betul. The Talpona, 7 miles long, rises at the Amba gh\u0101t in the district of Astrag\u0101r, and, running westwards through the district of Canacona, falls into the sea near the small fort of Talpona. The boats by which these rivers are navigated are called tonas, and the ferries across them are designated passagens.\n\nThe territory of Goa possesses a fine harbour, formed by the promontories of B\u0101rdez and Salsette. Half-way between these extremities projects the cabo ('cape') from the island of Goa, dividing the harbour into two anchorages, known as Aguada and Marmagao. Both are capable of accommodating safely the largest shipping from September to May. Aguada is virtually closed to navigation during the south-west monsoon, owing to the high winds and sea, and the formation of sand-banks in the estuary of the Mand\u0101vi at that period; but Marmagao is accessible at all times. A consequence of the intersection of numerous rivers is the formation of many islands, of which the larger number 18.\nLaterite is the stone most abundant throughout the territory. The geological resources of Goa have not yet been scientifically explored.\n\nThe climate is hot, and the rainfall for the ten years ending 1902, as registered by the Meteorological department, averaged 90 inches. The prevailing diseases are intermittent and remittent fevers, diarrhoea, and dysentery.\n\nCertain inscriptions corroborate the evidence of the Pur\u0101nas that Goa was in ancient times known under the various names of Gomanchala, Gomant, Goapuri, Gopakapur, and Gopakapatanua. The accounts handed down from antiquity teem with legendary tales, on which little reliance can be placed. In the Sahy\u0101dri Khanda of the Skanda Pur\u0101na it is recorded that at an early period the Aryans settled in Goa, having been brought by Parasu R\u0101ma from Trihotrapur or Mithila, the modern Tirh\u016bt. Some of the inscriptions referred to above show that Goa afterwards passed under the sway of the Kadambas of Banav\u0101si, whose first king, Trilochana Kadamba, is supposed to have flourished in about A.D. 119-20. This dynasty continued to rule until 1312, when Goa fell for the first time into the hands of the Muhammadans, under Malik K\u0101f\u016br. They were, however, compelled to evacuate it in 1370, having been defeated by Vidy\u0101ranya M\u0101dhav, the prime minister of Harihara of Vijayanagar, under whose successors Goa remained for about a hundred years.\n\nIn 1470 it was conquered by Mahm\u016bd Gawan, the general of Muhammad II, the thirteenth Bahmani Sult\u0101n of the Deccan, and incorporated into the dominions of that sovereign. Goa became subject to the Adil Shahi dynasty reigning at Bij\u0101pur about the time that Vasco da Gama landed at Calicut in 1498. This dynasty retained possession until February 17, 1510, when Goa was captured by Affonso de Albuquerque.\n\nThe Portuguese fleet, consisting of 20 sail of the line, with a few small vessels and 1,200 fighting men, hove in sight of the harbour. A holy mendicant or j\u0101gi had lately foretold its conquest by a foreign people from a distant land, and the disheartened citizens rendered up the town to the strangers. Eight leading men presented the keys of the gates to Albuquerque on their knees, together with a large banner which was unfurled only on state occasions. Mounted on a richly caparisoned steed, Albuquerque entered the city in a triumphal procession, drums beating, trumpets sounding, with the Portuguese banners carried by the flower of the Lisbon nobility and clergy at the head, amid the acclamations of an immense multitude, who showered upon the conqueror filigree flowers of silver and gold. Albuquerque behaved well to the inhabitants, but was shortly afterwards expelled by the Bij\u0101pur ruler. Y\u016bsuf Adil Sh\u0101h, Sult\u0101n of Bij\u0101pur, marched against the place with a considerable force, and after several sanguinary\ncontests, retook it from the Portuguese on August 15 of the same year. Reinforced, however, by the large armament which opportunely arrived from Portugal about this time, Albuquerque hastened back to Goa with his fleet, and conquered it a second time on November 25. With 28 ships, carrying 1,700 men, he forced his way into the town after a bloody assault, in which 2,000 Musalmans fell. For three days the miserable citizens were given over as a prey to every atrocity. The fifth part of the plunder, reserved for the Portuguese crown, amounted to two lakhs of rupees. Albuquerque promptly occupied himself in fortifying the place, embellishing the city, and establishing the Portuguese rule on a firm basis.\n\nFrom this time Goa rapidly rose in importance, and eventually became the metropolis of the Portuguese Empire in the East, which is said to have comprehended an area of about 4,000 square leagues. In 1543, during the governorship of Martim Affonso, who came to India together with the celebrated St. Francis Xavier, the two important districts or mah\u0101ts of B\u0101rdez and Salsette were ceded to the Portuguese by Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Adil Sh\u0101h, who, however, not long afterwards, attempted to regain them, but was foiled in his endeavours by the intrepidity of Dom Jo\u00e3o de Castro. To provide against any future invasion on the part of the Muhammadans, the eastern part of the island of Goa was protected by means of a long wall. In 1570 Ali Adil Sh\u0101h besieged the city with an army of 100,000 men; but it was so bravely defended by the little garrison under the Viceroy, Dom Luiz de Athaide, that the Muhammadan army, greatly thinned in numbers, retreated precipitately after a tedious siege of ten months' duration. About this period the Portuguese were alarmed by the appearance on the coast of India of a new enemy. The Dutch, having shaken off the Spanish yoke, assumed a warlike attitude towards the Portuguese, owing to the intimate connexion between Portugal and Spain.\n\nThe subsequent history of the town has been one of luxury, ostentation, and decay. After enduring a siege by the Sult\u0101n of Bij\u0101pur, and suffering from a terrible epidemic, Goa reached the summit of its prosperity at the end of the sixteenth century. In the early years of the English Company, Goa Dourada, or 'golden Goa,' seemed a place of fabulous wealth to the plain merchants who were destined to be the founders of British India. 'Whoever hath seen Goa, need not see Lisbon,' said a proverb of that day. Indeed, if the accounts of travellers are to be trusted, Goa presented a scene of military, ecclesiastical, and commercial magnificence which has had no parallel in the British capitals of India. The descriptions that have been recorded of Calcutta in the eighteenth and during the first quarter of the nineteenth century, leave behind them a feeling of insignificance compared with the accounts of Goa, written nearly three hundred years\nago. To find a parallel, we must go to the travellers' tales regarding Agra and Delhi during the zenith of the Mughal prosperity. The brilliant pomp and picturesque display of Goa was due to the fact that it was not only a flourishing harbour, but also the centre of a great military and ecclesiastical power. The Portuguese based their dominion in India on conquest by the sword. They laboured to consolidate it by a proselytizing organization, which throws the missionary efforts of every other European power in India into the shade. The result has proved how rotten was this basis, and how feebly cemented was the superstructure reared upon it. But during the greatness of Goa it had all the splendours which the Church and a powerful military court could cast around it.\n\nAfter the genius of Albuquerque and the energies of the early viceroys had spent themselves, their armaments constituted a vast idle population in the capital. The work of conquest was over, and it left behind it a gay and wealthy society of conquerors who had nothing to do. Every Portuguese in India, says a traveller, set up as a 'Fidalgo' (sic). These gentlemen had to be amused. There were no hotels or inns in the city, but many boarding houses and gambling saloons. The latter, writes a voyager in the seventeenth century, were sumptuously furnished, and paid a heavy tax to the Government. People of all classes frequented them, and entertainments were provided for the lookers-on by jugglers, dancing-girls, musicians, wrestlers, and native actors or buffoons. 'Those who were inordinately fond of gambling stayed there sometimes for days together, and were provided with board and lodging.' Such gambling-houses were not places for respectable women, and while the male society thronged their saloons, the Portuguese ladies were rigorously shut up at home. The family income was derived from the labour of slaves; and as no 'Fidalgo' (sic) could follow a trade or calling without disgrace, so neither could his wife busy herself in domestic affairs without losing her social importance. The society of Goa, therefore, divided itself into two idle populations\u2014an idle population of men in the streets and gambling-houses, and an idle population of women in the seclusion of their own homes. This was one of the first results of the intensely military spirit, with its contempt for peaceful forms of industry, on which rested the Portuguese power in India. The ladies of Goa soon obtained an unenviable notoriety in books of travel. Excluded from male society, they spent their time in indolence, quarrelling, and frivolous pursuits. A European zan\u0101ma life grew up, and brought with it some very ugly consequences. A lady valued herself in her female coterie upon the number and the daring of her intrigues. Almost every traveller who visited Goa during its prime tells the same curious story regarding the rashness with which the Portuguese matrons pursued their amours. Both Pyrard and Linschoten relate, in\nnearly the same words, how the ladies of Goa were wont to stupefy their husbands with dhatura, and then admit their lovers. The perils of such interviews became almost necessary to give a zest to their profligacy, and the Goanese became a byword as the type of an idle, a haughty, and a corrupt society. Strangers are inclined to laugh at Englishmen for adhering in India to the British costumes devised for a more temperate zone. There can be no doubt that the Dutch in Java have adapted their clothing much better to the climate than the English in Calcutta. But the very rigidity with which English society in India insists upon matters of dress is not without its value. It forms a perpetual check upon the tendency to fall into the slipshod habits of Oriental domestic life. In Goa these habits were carried to an extreme length. At home, both ladies and gentlemen dressed very much like the natives, except for the large rosaries which they wore round their necks. While untidy and careless in their dress at home, they made an ostentatious display when they stirred abroad. When a gentleman rode out, he was attended by a throng of slaves in gay and fanciful liveries, some holding large umbrellas, others bearing richly inlaid arms; while the horse itself was loaded with gold and silver trappings, the reins studded with precious stones, with jingling silver bells attached, and the stirrups wrought into artistic shapes in gilt silver. The poor followed the example of the rich, and resorted to amusing makeshifts to maintain an air of dignity and grandeur. The gentlemen who lived together in a boarding-house had a few suits of silk clothes between them in common. These they used by turns when they went out and hired a man to hold an umbrella over them as they strutted through the streets.\n\nHolland, having thrown off the Spanish yoke, began to assert herself in the East. While the British East India Company was struggling into existence during the last years of Elizabeth, the Dutch was preparing to dispute with the Portuguese for the supremacy in the Indian Ocean. In 1603 they blockaded Goa. The attempt proved abortive; but it left behind it a struggle between the two nations which, during the next seventy years, shattered and dismembered the Portuguese power in India. One by one the Portuguese possessions fell into the hands of the Dutch; their fleets were captured, or driven within the shelter of their forts, and their commerce was swept from the seas. Goa suffered not only from these disasters, but also from a return of the fever which had afflicted the city in the preceding century. It broke out again in 1635 and raged for several years. Towards the end of this visitation the Dutch once more blockaded Goa in 1639, but were again compelled to withdraw.\n\nA period of pride and poverty followed, during which the splendour of the previous century was replaced by shabby devices to conceal the decay that had blighted the Portuguese power. In 1648 Tavernier\nadmired the architectural grandeur of Goa, but was struck with the indigence of several Portuguese families whom he had seen in affluence and prosperity during his first visit. He says that many who had six years previously enjoyed an ample income, were now reduced to the necessity of secretly begging alms.\n\n'Yet they did not put aside their vanity. The ladies were particularly observed going in palanquins to seek charitable relief, attended by servants who conveyed their messages to the persons whose assistance they implored.'\n\n'The city,' says Thevenot in 1666, 'is great and full of beautiful churches and convents, and well adorned with palaces. There were few nations in the world so rich as the Portuguese in India; but their vanity is the cause of their ruin.'\n\nIn 1675 Dr. Fryer described Goa as 'Rome in India':\n\n'looks well at a distance\u2014stands upon seven hills; everywhere colleges, churches, and glorious structures: but many houses disgracing it with their ruins.'\n\nThe Portuguese, indeed, were becoming unable to hold their capital even against the native banditti. In 1683 it narrowly escaped falling into the hands of Sambhaji at the head of his roving Marathas, who plundered up to the very gates of the city. All hopes of resistance were abandoned, when a powerful Mughal force suddenly made its appearance from the Ghats, and compelled the Marathas to come to terms. This unexpected deliverance was ascribed to the miraculous interposition of St. Francis Xavier. Subsequently the Bhonslas from the State of Savantvadi invaded Goa territory; but though at the outset they obtained partial successes, they were eventually defeated by the Portuguese, who conquered from them the islands of Corjuem and Ponelem, and destroyed their fortress at Bicholim. To defend the place against future inroads, the Viceroy, Vasco Fernandes Cesar de Menezes (1712-7), built a fortress on the frontiers of Bardez, and another at Chapor\u00e1. During the administration of the Count of Sandomil (1732-41), the Portuguese became once more involved in a war with the Marathas and lost some of their most important possessions towards the north of Goa. In 1741 the Marathas invaded the peninsulas of Bardez and Salsette, and threatened the city of Goa itself. At the same time the Bhonslas of Savantvadi availed themselves of the opportunity to overrun the settlement. At that critical period a new Viceroy arrived at Goa, the Marquis of Louri\u00e7al, bringing with him from Europe a reinforcement of 12,000 men. With this army he encountered and defeated the Marathas at Bardez with great slaughter, captured the celebrated fortress of Ponda and other minor forts, and compelled them to retire from Goa. He then marched against the Bhonslas, and forced them to sue for peace, making their chief, Khem Savant, a\ntributary of the Portuguese. Shortly afterwards, however, the Bhonslas renewed hostilities, but were defeated by the Marquis of Castello Novo, who conquered Alorna (whence his later title), Tiracol, Neutim, Rarim, and Sanquelim or Sat\u0101ri.\n\nIn 1750 the Marathas attacked the fortress of Neutim, which they closely invested both by sea and land. The Viceroy, the Marquis of Tavora, hastened to the relief of the place with all his available forces, and compelled the enemy to raise the siege, after which he turned his arms against the king of Sonda, and captured the fortress of Piro (Sad\u0101sivgarh). His successor, the Count of Alva, prosecuted successfully for a time the war against the Marathas, but eventually lost Rarim and Neutim, and was killed at the siege of one of the fortresses which had fallen into the hands of the enemy. About this period the Court of Lisbon sent peremptory orders to the Viceroy, the Count of Ega, to restore the fortresses of Piro and Ximpem to the king of Sonda, and Bicholim, Sanquelim, and Alorna to Khem S\u0101vant III. Subsequently, however, the former allowed the Portuguese to possess themselves of Ponda, with the adjacent territory of Zambaulim, Cabo de R\u0101ma, and Canacona, during the time that his dominions were invaded by Haidar Ali. After some years of repose, Khem S\u0101vant again attempted to disturb the Portuguese; but being defeated, he had to surrender to them Bicholim, Sanquelim or Sat\u0101ri, Alorna, and Pernem.\n\nThe decay of the capital had become so notorious that the Portuguese Government in Europe determined to rebuild it at a great cost. After a century of fruitless efforts and foolish expenditure, Old Goa still lay in ruins, and the remnants of the population drew themselves together at Panjim or New Goa, at the mouth of the river. The changes in the river itself had contributed to render Old Goa still more unhealthy than before, and to make the navigation of its channels dangerous even for the comparatively small class of ships which the Portuguese employed. During the eighteenth century the decayed settlement, instead of being a centre of military pomp and courtly display, had become a burden on the Home Government, and cost Portugal a considerable sum of money annually. It required a force of 2,000 European soldiers to protect it from the Marathas, the privates receiving a miserable subsistence of rice and fish, and the captains drawing a salary of Rs. 6 a month. Such commerce as survived was in the hands of the Jesuits. This fraternity still preserved the traditions, and something of the energy, of the proselytizing era. Alexander Hamilton, early in the eighteenth century, declared that he counted from a neighbouring hill nearly eighty churches and convents. He gives the number of Roman Catholic priests at 30,000 for the city and settlement. The native merchants had been driven away by oppressions and insults; and during the first half of the last century\nthe Jesuits monopolized the remnants of the trade which still clung to the capital. In 1739, when the territory was overrun by the Marathas, the nuns and monks had streamed forth in panic to the refuge of Marmagao. Nevertheless, high offices and military commands were still lavished among the poverty-stricken remnants of the Portuguese in India. All the talk at Goa was about fine titles. 'A post which would be filled by a small tradesman everywhere else needed a general.'\n\nFrom 1794 to 1815 the Government of Goa and other Portuguese settlements in India received little attention from the Court of Lisbon, owing to various causes, the chief of which was the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula by the French. To protect Goa against any contingency, an English auxiliary force garrisoned the two fortresses commanding the port, until the general peace in Europe after the battle of Waterloo. In 1817 the Viceroy, the Count of Rio Pardo, repelled the inroads of the predatory forces from the Savantvadi State, capturing the fortresses of Uspa and Rarim. This Governor was, however, deposed in consequence of a revolution which took place in Goa in 1821. In 1835 a native of the place, named Bernardo Peres da Silva, was appointed Governor and Prefect of the Portuguese State of India by Dona Maria II, in reward for his adherence to the House of Braganza during the usurpation of Dom Miguel. But his reforms in Goa during the seventeen days of his government ended in an \u00e9meute and his flight to Bombay.\n\nFor about sixteen years after this event Goa was undisturbed by either external foes or internal dissensions, except for a brief military revolt, which resulted in the deposition of the Governor, Lopez de Lima. During the administration of Pestana, in 1844, the disturbances at Savantvadi, and the shelter afforded at Goa to the rioters who had fled thither, threatened for a time to bring about a rupture with the British Government of Bombay. In 1852 the Ranis of Satari, headed by Dipaji, revolted. In 1871 a rebellion broke out among the native army at Goa, in consequence of the Portuguese authorities making a stand against its exorbitant demands. To suppress this insurrection the Court of Lisbon dispatched a reinforcement, accompanied by the king's own brother, Dom Augusto. On the restoration of peace the native regiments that had revolted were disbanded. The former army has not been reorganized, as native regiments could only be dangerous to the handful of European troops, and the peace maintained throughout India by the British supremacy renders them unnecessary for any practical purposes. In 1895, in consequence of the Government failing to comply with the demands of some Goa troops, who were being dispatched to Mozambique to quell the revolted Kaffirs, a mutiny broke out among the infantry.\nThe R\u0101nis of Sat\u0101ri joined the mutineers, and peace was not restored until the arrival of an expedition from Lisbon under the command of His Highness the Infante, Dom Affonso Henriques. A general amnesty was finally granted in 1897. In 1901 the R\u0101nis again broke out, the revolt commencing with the murder of an officer at Valpoy in Sat\u0101ri on November 6. The murderers and many of the leading R\u0101nis were secured and punished, the R\u0101nis being transported to Timor with any members of their families who were willing to share their exile.\n\nThe population of Goa proper in 1800, i.e. the Velhas without the Novas Conquistas, was 178,478. The whole population of the Velhas and Novas Conquistas, according to the Census of 1851, was 363,788, giving a density of 343 persons per square mile. The population of the territory of Goa in 1881 was 445,449, which had increased to 475,513, or by 6 per cent., in the twenty years ending 1900. The number of towns and villages, and population of the districts, in 1900, are given in the following tables:\n\n| Districts          | Towns | Villages | Population |\n|--------------------|-------|----------|------------|\n|                    |       |          | Males      | Females | Total     |\n| Old Conquests:     |       |          |            |         |           |\n| Ilhas              | 1     | 35       | 27,522     | 27,018  | 54,540    |\n| Salsette           | 1     | 60       | 54,750     | 60,305  | 115,061   |\n| Bardez             | 1     | 39       | 45,247     | 60,090  | 105,337   |\n| New Conquests:     |       |          |            |         |           |\n| Pernem             | 27    |          | 18,559     | 19,455  | 38,014    |\n| Sanguelim          | 30    |          | 15,513     | 15,597  | 31,110    |\n| Sat\u0101ri             | 85    |          | 10,285     | 9,330   | 19,615    |\n| Ponda              | 28    |          | 22,788     | 22,664  | 45,452    |\n| Sanguem            | 51    |          | 15,263     | 12,991  | 28,254    |\n| Quepem             | 44    |          | 10,848     | 10,538  | 21,386    |\n| Canacona           | 7     |          | 10,648     | 10,177  | 20,825    |\n| Island of Anjidiv  | 1     | 24       | 25         |         | 49        |\n| Total              | 3     | 407      | 227,393    | 248,120 | 475,513   |\n\nThe towns in the territory of Goa are Nova Goa or Panjim (see Goa City) with a population of 9,325; Marg\u00e3o, population 12,126; and Mapu\u00e7\u00e3, population 10,733.\n\nThe distribution by religion is: Christians, 262,648; Hindus, 200,144; Musalm\u0101ns, 8,431. In the Velhas Conquistas, Christians form 91 per cent. of the population; in the Novas Conquistas, the Hindus are about equally numerous. The Christians of Goa still very largely adhere to caste distinctions, claiming to be Br\u0101hmans, Charados, and low castes, which do not intermarry. The Hindus are largely Mar\u0101th\u0101, and do not differ from those of the adjacent Konkan Districts of Bombay.\n\nAll classes of the people, except Europeans, use the Konkani dialect.\nof Marathi, with some admixture of Portuguese words. But the official language is Portuguese, which is commonly spoken in the capital and the principal towns, as well as by all educated persons.\n\nDetails of population (so far as available).\n\n| Districts       | Europeans and Americans | Africans and others | Natives of India | Age | Civil condition |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------|-----|----------------|\n|                 |                         |                     |                  | Under 12 years | Above 12 years | Unmarried | Married | Widower and widows |\n| Old Conquests   |                         |                     |                  |                |                |           |         |                   |\n| Ilhas           | 132                     | 74                   | 34,284           | 14,751         | 39,788         | 26,986     | 21,478  | 6,046              |\n| Salsette        | 14                      | 26                   | 11,301           | 32,603         | 80,352         | 59,767     | 40,026  | 13,089             |\n| B\u00e4rdez         | 16                      | 6                    | 15,270           | 20,705         | 75,800         | 54,113     | 38,417  | 11,271             |\n| New Conquests   |                         |                     |                  |                |                |           |         |                   |\n| Pernem          | 1                       |                     | 38,015           | 12,480         | 25,534         | 16,049     | 17,441  | 4,511              |\n| Sanquelim       | 4                       | 7                    | 31,060           | 9,440          | 21,260         | 13,380     | 13,832  | 3,072              |\n| Satari          | 3                       | 4                    | 19,618           | 6,342          | 13,277         | 8,016      | 8,875   | 2,799              |\n| Ponda           | 8                       | 4                    | 45,440           | 14,044         | 31,400         | 20,337     | 19,337  | 5,635              |\n| Sanquem         | 4                       | 2                    | 30,610           | 7,742          | 22,868         | 11,188     | 10,838  | 2,720              |\n| Quepem          | 3                       | 1                    | 21,382           | 6,666          | 14,716         | 10,040     | 8,576   | 2,720              |\n| Canacona        |                         |                     | 20,825           | 6,214          | 14,610         | 9,637      | 8,562   | 2,524              |\n| Island of Anjidiv |                       |                     | 48               | 15             | 34             | 26          | 14      |                   |\n| Total           | 236                     | 183                  | 475,048          | 140,572        | 334,880        | 225,705    | 188,829 | 60,746             |\n\nNearly all the Christians profess the Roman Catholic religion and are subject in spiritual matters to an Archbishop, who has the titles of Primate of the East and Patriarch of the East Indies, and exercises ecclesiastical jurisdiction also over a great portion of British India. His nomination rests with the King of Portugal, subject to confirmation by the Pope. The Christians of Dam\u0101n and Diu are subject to a bishop, who bears the titles of Bishop of Dam\u0101n and Archbishop of Cranganore. There are numerous Christian churches in Goa, mostly built by the Jesuits and the Franciscans prior to the extinction of the religious orders in Portuguese territory. The chief of these is the cathedral or metropolitan church, called the S\u00e9 Primacial e Patriarchal de Goa. The religious orders have been abolished in Portuguese India, and the churches are under the charge of secular priests, all of whom are natives of Goa. The Catholics of Goa are very regular in the fulfilment of religious duties, and celebrate the chief festivals sanctioned by the Catholic Church with much devotion and pomp. Hindus and Muhammadans now enjoy perfect liberty in religious matters, and have their own places of worship. The chief Hindu temples are those of Mangesh, M\u0101lsh\u0101, S\u0101nt\u0101durga, Kapleshwar, N\u0101gesh, and Ramn\u0101th, all of which are situated in the Novas Conquistas. In the early days of Portuguese rule the observance of Hindu usages and the worship of Hindu gods in public were rigorously suppressed.\n\nAt the conquest of Goa by Affonso de Albuquerque in 1510 the\nvillage communities, among which the inhabitants were distributed, were found to be in the enjoyment of certain immunities from taxation and other privileges. Albuquerque carefully maintained the constitution of the villages, and avoided all appearance of fresh taxation. The same policy was followed by his successors; and in 1526 a register was compiled, called *foral dos usos e costumes*, containing the peculiar usage and customs of the communities, and the privileges enjoyed by them from time immemorial. This register served as a guide-book to subsequent administrators. But in time the communities were burdened with additional imposts, and placed under certain restrictions. At present they are under the supervision of the Government, which appoints in each district (*concelho*) of the Velhas Conquistas an officer called Administrador das Communidades, to watch rigidly over their proceedings. They are precluded from spending even the smallest sum without Government sanction, and have to pay certain contributions to the parish churches. Each village community has a tax-collector (*sacador*) and a clerk (*escriv\u00e3o*). There is, however, no village headman. On questions affecting the interests of a whole village, a sort of *panchayat* or council is held, composed of one or more members of each clan (*vangor*), and the decisions are determined by the majority of votes. In the Velhas Conquistas a great portion of the land is held by the village communities, which, after paying the rent and other Government taxes, divide the annual produce among themselves; while in the Novas Conquistas the lands are distributed among the *vangors*, who cultivate them and enjoy their net produce. The total number of village communities is 222.\n\nOf the entire territory of Goa one-third is said to be under cultivation. A regular land survey is at present in progress, pending the completion of which statistical details of cultivation and crops are not available. The soil is chiefly argillaceous, but also contains light sand and more or less decayed vegetable matter. In many parts it is full of stone and gravel. Its fertility varies according to quality and situation in reference to the supply of water. Manure, consisting of ashes, fish, and dung, is largely employed. As a rule, the Velhas Conquistas are better cultivated than the Novas Conquistas. In both these divisions of the Goa territory a holding of fifteen or sixteen acres would be considered a good-sized farm, though the majority of holdings are of smaller extent.\n\nThe staple produce of the country is rice, of which there are two harvests: the winter crop, called *soradio*; and the summer crop or *vangana*, raised by means of artificial irrigation from the rain-water accumulated in reservoirs, ponds, and wells. For the *soradio* crop the field is ploughed before the commencement of the monsoon, the seed scattered in May or June, and the crop harvested in September; while\nas regards the *vangana*, the ploughing operations begin in October, the sowing in November, and the harvesting in February. Rice is cultivated in low lands (*cazana* or *cantor*) situated near the banks of rivers, slopes of hills (*molloy*), stiff grounds (*dulpan* or *dulip*), and sandy soils (*quer\u00f3*). The quantity of rice produced is barely sufficient to meet the local demand for two-thirds of the year. Next to rice, the culture of coco-nut palms is deemed most important, from the variety of uses to which the products are applied. They grow in luxuriant groves on all lands not hilly or serviceable for the production of rice, and along the sea-coast. Areca palms are chiefly cultivated in the Novas Conquistas on lands irrigated from rivulets. Hilly places and inferior soils are set apart for the cultivation of such cereals as *nachinim* (*Dolichos biflorus*), *urd* (*Phascolus radiatus*), *kulita* (*Dolichos uniflorus*), *orio* (*Panicum italicum*), *m\u00e2ng* (*Phaseolus Mungo*), *tori* (*Cytisus Cajan*). Of fruit trees, the most important are mango, jack, and cashew. Among the various kinds of vegetables are potato, radishes, yams, melons, cucumber, *bendes* (*Abelmoschus esculentus*), &c. Besides these, chillies, ginger, turmeric, onion, and certain vegetables of daily consumption are extensively cultivated in some villages.\n\nThe condition of the agricultural classes in the Velhas Conquistas has improved during the last thirty years, owing partly to the general rise in price of all kinds of agricultural produce, and partly to the current of emigration to British territories. In the Novas Conquistas, however, the cultivators are said to have been reduced to great want and misery through the oppression of the landowners.\n\nThere is a branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino of Lisbon at Panjim. Money can be borrowed from wealthy proprietors or religious confraternities at five per cent. In districts inhabited by Hindus, however, the current rate of interest is about ten per cent. Landowners not unfrequently advance petty sums, or their equivalent in kind, without interest, to such of the cultivators or labourers as are their dependents or live in their 'oarts' (*palmares*), deducting the debt by monthly instalments from the wages due. In the Novas Conquistas the rate of interest charged for an advance of grain is generally half as much as the value of the advance.\n\nStately forests are found in the Novas Conquistas. The 'reserved' and other forests scattered over an area of 30,000 hectares or 116 square miles have an aggregate value of 70 lakhs, according to the Report of the Forest Committee. The wasteful practice of *kumri* or shifting cultivation has denuded them of valuable trees, but this form of tillage is now kept under strict control by the state. In 1903\u20134 the total revenue derived from the forests, excluding timber supplied to Government for state works, was Rs. 24,500, while the expenditure amounted to Rs. 10,500.\nIron is found at Satari, Pernem, and especially in the province of Zambaulim. Two claims to work mines in the Sanghem district have been registered, but have not yet been definitely allowed.\n\nIn the days of its glory Goa was the chief entrep\u00f4t of commerce between the East and West, and was especially famous as the centre of the trade in horses with the Persian Gulf. But with the downfall of the Portuguese empire it lost its commercial importance, which began to decline after the fall of Vijayanagar, and its trade has now dwindled into insignificance. Few manufacturing industries of any importance exist; but the country is not devoid of skilful artisans, such as goldsmiths, carpenters, blacksmiths, shoemakers, &c. Some of the articles produced are disposed of privately, while others are exposed for sale at the annual and weekly fairs held in various places. The principal exports are coconuts, betel-nuts, mangoes, water-melons, jack and other fruits, cinnamon, pepper, salted fish, gum, coir-work, firewood, fowls, and salt. Of these, the last forms one of the principal sources of profit, the numerous salt-pans that exist yielding a large quantity of salt over and above the local demand. The chief articles imported are: rice, cloth, refined sugar, wines, tobacco, glass-ware, hardware, and other miscellaneous goods. The total imports by land and sea into Goa in 1903\u20134 were valued at 50 lakhs, and the exports at 14 lakhs. The value of the imports largely exceeds that of the exports, thus causing a drain of money which would certainly have materially affected the financial condition of Goa, had not a stream of coin flowed constantly into the country from the savings of those of its inhabitants who reside temporarily in British territory. In 1903\u20134 the customs revenue amounted to 5 lakhs. The total number of vessels of every kind that entered the port of Goa in the same year was 2,874, while the number of those that left was 2,814.\n\nA line of railway now connects Marmagao with the Southern Mahratta Railway, the length of line to Castle Rock being 51 miles, of which 49 miles lie in Goa territory. Several new roads have recently been made, and others are in course of construction. There are 19 roads, complete and incomplete. Of these, the chief runs northwards from Verei, opposite Panjim, through the villages of Pilerne, Saligao, Parra, Mapu\u00e7a, and Assonora, meeting at Sankarwalle the road constructed in British territory. There are also several municipal roads.\n\nThere is one telegraph office in Goa, at Panjim, maintained jointly by the British and Portuguese Governments. The head-quarters of the post office are also at Panjim, with branches at Margao, Mapu\u00e7a, Ponda, Bicholim, Chinchinim, and Pernem.\n\nGoa is seldom subject to great floods, though some of its districts\noccasionally suffer from partial inundation during heavy rainfall. In times of drought the agricultural classes sustain heavy loss, but the people at large are supplied, though at great cost, with rice from British territory. It is only when a general famine occurs beyond the frontier that signs of extreme distress are visible among the inhabitants of Goa. Formerly the country was frequently subject to famine. The years 1553, 1579, and 1682 are said to have been seasons of great scarcity. In subsequent years the constant incursions of the Marathas occasioned much distress.\n\nGoa is regarded as an integral portion of the Portuguese empire, and, with Dam\u0101n and Diu, forms, for administrative purposes, one province subject to a Governor-General, who is appointed directly by the King of Portugal, and holds his office for five years. Besides his civil functions, he is invested with the supreme military authority in the province. His personal staff consists of two aides de camp, and a secretary styled the Chief Secretary of the Governor-General of Portuguese India, and likewise appointed by the King. Although he is the chief executive functionary, the Governor-General cannot, except in cases of emergency, impose new taxes, or abolish the existing ones, contract loans, create new appointments, or reduce the old ones, retrench the salaries attached to them, or generally incur any expenses not sanctioned by law; nor can he, under any circumstances, leave the province without the special permission of the Home Government.\n\nIn his administration the Governor-General is aided by a Council composed of the Chief Secretary, the Archbishop of Goa (or, in his absence, the chief ecclesiastical authority exercising his functions), the Judges of the High Court, the two highest military officers in Goa, the Attorney-General, the Inspector da Fazenda, the Health Officer, and the President of the municipal chamber or corporation of the capital (Camara Municipal das Ilhas). As a rule, all the members give their opinions, and vote in every matter on which they are consulted by the Governor-General. There are also five other Juntas or councils, called the Junta Geral da Provincia (general council of the province), the Conselho da Provincia (the council of the province), the Conselho Technico das Obras publicas, the Conselho-inspector de Instruc\u00e7\u00e3o publica, and the Conselho da Agricultura. The first of these is composed of the Chief Secretary, the Archbishop or his substitute, the Attorney-General, the Inspector da Fazenda, the Director of Public Works, the Health Officer, a Professor of the Medico-Surgical College, a Professor of the Lyceum, a Professor of the Normal School, and a representative from each of the municipal corporations of the province. This Junta discusses and decides all questions relating to public works, and the expenses necessary for their execution, the\npreservation of public health, the establishment of schools, the alteration of customs duties, &c. The Governor-General is empowered to suspend the operation of any resolution passed by this Junta, pending a reference to the Home Government. The other councils are of inferior importance.\n\nIn addition to this machinery of administration, there are subordinate agencies for the local government of the different districts. In connexion with these agencies, the entire territory of Goa is divided into two tracts, known as the Velhas and Novas Conquistas (old and new conquests). The former tract is subdivided into three districts (concelhos), namely, the Ilhas, Bardez, and Salsette; and each of these again into parishes, of which there are 85 in all. Every district has a municipal corporation, and is placed under the charge of a functionary called Administrador de Concelho. This officer is appointed by the Governor-General, and is entrusted with duties of an administrative character, besides those connected with the public safety and health. Every parish has likewise a minor council, called Junta da Parochia, presided over by a magistrate, called regedor, whose duties are to inspect and direct the police establishments of the parish, keep a strict surveillance over liquor-shops, gaming-houses, &c., open wills and testaments, and report generally every important occurrence to the Administrador. Similarly in each of the seven divisions into which the Novas Conquistas are subdivided there is an officer called Administrador de Concelho. Of the above-named seven divisions, the first is Pernem; the second, Sanquelim; the third, Ponda; the fourth, Sanguem, or Astagr\u00e3r and Embarb\u00e3cem; the fifth, Quepem, or Bally, Chandrowadi, and Cacora; the sixth, Canacona with Cabo de R\u00e3ma; and the seventh Sat\u00e3ri, which forms a military command and is administered by the military commandant in the same way as other divisions by the Administrador. Each of the subdivisions of the Velhas and Novas Conquistas is also known by the name of 'province.' The offices of Governor, Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, and some other important ones are almost invariably filled by Europeans. As stated above, there are three municipalities in the Velhas Conquistas, the chief being that of the Ilhas. The municipal receipts in 1903-4 amounted to 1\u00bd lakhs.\n\nGoa and its dependencies in India, namely, Dam\u00e3\u00f1 and Diu, together with Ma\u00e7ao and Timor, constitute for judicial purposes but one judicial district. This district is divided into Comarcas, which are subdivided into Ju\u00edzados municipaes and Ju\u00edzes populares. In each of the five Ju\u00edzados of Portuguese India there is a judge, with an establishment consisting of a sub-delegate of the Attorney-General, one clerk, two or more bailiffs, and a translator or interpreter. All these officials are paid by Government, and are besides entitled to fees, except the clerks.\nwho receive fees only. The judge holds his sitting twice a week for the purpose of deciding civil and criminal cases within his jurisdiction.\n\nThere are 111 Ju\u00edzes populares, and 6 Ju\u00edzes de direito de comarca. The Ju\u00edzes de direito have a staff composed of a delegate of the Attorney-General, three clerks, one interpreter and translator, an accountant, four or five bailiffs, all of whom, except the clerks and accountant, receive, in addition to certain fees, fixed salaries. A judge of this class exercises ordinary and extraordinary jurisdiction in matters both civil and criminal. He is required to go on circuit annually to the Julgados, where he hears complaints against subordinate functionaries, examines their proceedings and registers, and sometimes tries those suits within his jurisdiction which may not have been submitted to his tribunal by the ordinary judges. The jurisdiction and duties of the Ju\u00edzes de direito and Ju\u00edzes municipaes e populares are regulated by special laws.\n\nThe supervision of all judges is entrusted to a High Court (Tribunal da Rela\u00e7\u00e3o), whose seat is in Nova Goa (New Goa), in consequence of which it is sometimes called Rela\u00e7\u00e3o de Nova Goa. This court consists of a chief justice (Presidente) and four puisne judges. The High Court has jurisdiction, both ordinary and extraordinary, in all cases, whether civil or criminal, and is invested with appellate powers. Its decisions are final in all suits except those relating to property exceeding in value Rs. 1,500, in which an appeal lies to the Supreme Tribunal of Portugal.\n\nThe total revenue in 1903-4 was over 20 lakhs and the expenditure nearly 20 lakhs. The sources of revenue are: land tax, customs and postal dues, seal and stamp duties, tobacco licences, taxes on liquor-shops, &c. Goa contains no mint; and the only revenue from salt is very trifling, derived from eight pans at Diu.\n\nPrevious to 1871 Goa possessed a comparatively large native army; but owing to the rebellion which broke out in that year it was disbanded, and a battalion composed wholly of Europeans was obtained from Portugal. The force consisted in 1904 of 2,730 men of all ranks. The strength of the police is 390 men. The total expenditure on the military and police forces is about one lakh.\n\nOf late years education has made considerable progress in Goa. In 1900 10 per cent. of the total population were literate. In 1903-4 there were 121 primary schools, of which 98 were public and 23 private, with 4,945 pupils, of whom 1,255 were girls. The number of pupils in the National Lyceum or college at New Goa and several other schools of secondary education was 305. The Medico-Surgical College was attended by 88 pupils. Besides these, several other schools are under ecclesiastical jurisdiction. In addition to the Government Gazette, called Boletim Oficial, there are twelve periodicals: namely, O Heraldio, A India Portuguesa, O Ultramar, O Crente, Noticias, Voz do Poivo,\nThere are 3 hospitals, where 2,631 in-patients were treated in 1904. There are also 3 military hospitals, at Goa, Dam\u00e3o, and Diu. The most important charitable institutions are: the Santa Casa de Miseric\u00f3rdia (Holy House of Mercy) at Panjim; Hosp\u00edcio do Sagrado Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Maria (Asylum of the Sacred Heart of Mary) at Margao; and Asylo de Nossa Senhora dos Milagres (Asylum of our Lady of Miracles) at Mapu\u00e7\u00e1. The first dates from the conquest of Goa by the Portuguese, and maintains the hospital at Ribandar and two establishments for the reformation and education of females at Chimbol.\n\n[D. L.

Capital of the Portuguese territory of the same name, situated in $15^\\circ 30' \\text{N.}$ and $73^\\circ 57' \\text{E.}$, near the mouth of the river Mandav\u00ed. Population of Old Goa (1900), 2,302, dwelling in 500 houses; of Panjim or New Goa, 9,325, dwelling in 1,735 houses. Goa is properly the name of three cities, which represent successive stages in the history of Western India. The earliest of the three was an ancient Hindu city, before the invasion of the Muhammadans; the second, known as Old Goa, was the first capital of the Portuguese, and is still the ecclesiastical metropolis of Roman Catholic India; the third, commonly called Panjim, is the present seat of Portuguese administration. The original city of Goa (Goa Velha), built by the Kadambas, was situated on the banks of the river Juari. No traces of buildings exist at this day. The next town of Goa (Velha Cidade de Goa), generally known to foreigners as Old Goa, situated about 5 miles to the north of the Hindu capital, was built by the Muhammadans in 1479, nineteen years before the arrival of Vasco da Gama in India. This famous city, conquered by Albuquerque in 1510, became the capital of the Portuguese empire in Asia; as such, it was once the chief emporium of commerce between the East and the West, and enjoyed the same privileges as Lisbon. It reached the climax of its splendour during the sixteenth century; but with the decline of the Portuguese power in the following century, it gradually began to lose its significance in every respect, save as an ecclesiastical metropolis.\n\nThe frequent plagues by which the population was repeatedly thinned, together with the removal of the seat of Government to Panjim, and the suppression of the religious orders, contributed finally to effect its complete downfall. Instead of the 200,000 inhabitants which once formed its population, hardly 2,000 poverty-stricken creatures remain to haunt the few ecclesiastical edifices still standing. Foremost among\nthe surviving edifices is the cathedral dedicated to St. Catherine by Albuquerque, in commemoration of his entry into Goa on the day of her festival. Built as a parochial church in 1512, it was reconstructed in 1623 in its present majestic proportions, having been about a century before elevated to the rank of a primatial see, which it has ever since retained. Service is regularly held every day by the canons attached to the cathedral. The Convent of St. Francis, originally a Muhammadan mosque, converted into a church by the Portuguese, was the first structure consecrated to Christian worship in Goa. Its chief portal, curious as being the earliest of its kind in Portuguese India, has been preserved intact to this day, though the convent itself was rebuilt in 1661. The Chapel of St. Catherine was erected in 1551 on the site of the gate of the Muhammadan city through which Albuquerque entered. The Church of Bom Jesus, commenced in 1594, and consecrated in 1603, is a splendid edifice, enjoying a wide renown for the magnificent tomb holding the remains of the apostle of the Indies, St. Francis Xavier, the events of whose life are represented around the shrine. The Convent of St. Monica, commenced in 1606 and completed in 1627, was constructed for a community of nuns, the last of whom died in 1885. The Convent of St. Cajetan, erected in the middle of the seventeenth century by the Order of the Theatines, is noted for its resemblance to St. Peter's at Rome, and is in excellent preservation.\n\nOf the other historical edifices with which Old Goa was formerly embellished, few traces remain to give a conception of their pristine beauty and magnificence. The once renowned palace of the viceroys, the spacious custom-house, and many other public buildings, have been completely destroyed. The College of St. Roque, belonging to the Order of Jesus, the Senate-house, the once famous Palace of the Inquisition, the Church of the Miraculous Cross, the College of St. Paul, the Hospital of St. Lazarus, the Church and Convent of St. Augustine, as well as the college of the same name close by, the arsenal, the chapel of the Cinco Chagas (the 'five wounds'), and the ecclesiastical jail, are all in ruins. The sites of the vanished buildings have been converted into coco-nut plantations, the ruins are covered with shrubs and moss, and the streets are overrun with grass. But though Old Goa has long since lost its civil importance, forming at present only a suburb of Panjim, its ecclesiastical influence as the see of the Primate of the East still remains; and, as long as it can boast of its noble monuments of Christian piety, and retains the shrine of the great Eastern evangelist, it will not cease to attract pilgrims from the most distant parts of the Catholic world.\n\nThe history of Goa city has been given in the article on Goa Settlement. As far back as 1759, the ruin of the old city was complete. The Governor changed his residence to Panjim, near the mouth of the\nriver, and in the same year the Jesuits were expelled. With them went the last sparks of commercial enterprise. In 1775 the population, which at the beginning of the century had numbered nearly 30,000, was reduced to 1,600, of whom 1,198 were Christians. Goa remains in ruins to this day. Every effort to repeople it has failed, and Old Goa is now a city of fallen houses and of streets overgrown with jungle. Almost the only buildings which survive are the convents and churches, with miserable huts attached. In 1827 the Superior of the Augustinian Convent thus wrote: 'Il ne reste plus de cette ville que le sacr\u00e9: le profane en est enti\u00e8rement banni.' The stately mansions and magnificent public buildings of Old Goa are now heaps of bricks covered with rank grass, and buried in groves of coco-nut palms.\n\n'The river,' wrote Dr. Russell in 1877, 'washes the remains of a great city\u2014an arsenal in ruins; palaces in ruins; quay walls in ruins; churches in ruins; all in ruins. We looked and saw the site of the Inquisition, the bishop's prison, a grand cathedral, great churches, chapels, convents, religious houses, on knolls surrounded by jungle. We saw the crumbling masonry which once marked the lines of streets and enclosures of palaces, dockyards filled with weeds and obsolete cranes.'\n\nNew Goa, the present capital of Portuguese India, comprehends Panjim and Ribandar, as well as the old city of Goa, and is 6 square miles in extent. It is situated on the left bank of the river Mandavi, at a distance of about 3 miles from its mouth. The suburb of Ribandar is connected with the central quarter of Panjim by a causeway about 300 yards long, through which lies the main road leading to Old Goa. Panjim occupies a narrow strip, enclosed by the causeway on the east, the village of St. Ignez on the west, the river on the north, and a hill which walls it on the south. In the last century it was a miserable village, inhabited by a few fishermen dwelling in cadjan huts, and remarkable only for the fortress built by Yusuf Adil Shah, which is now transformed into a viceregal palace. As in the case of Bombay City, the surface has been gradually formed by filling up hollows and reclaiming large tracts of marshy land.\n\nPanjim was selected as the residence of the Portuguese Viceroy in 1759, and in 1843 it was formally raised by royal decree to rank as the capital of Portuguese India. From the river the appearance of the city, with its row of public buildings and elegant private residences, is very picturesque; and this first impression is not belied by a closer inspection of its neat and spacious roads bordered by decent houses. Of public structures, the most imposing are the barracks, an immense quadrangular edifice, the eastern wing of which accommodates the Lyceum, the Public Library, and the Government Press. The square facing this wing is adorned with a life-size statue of Albuquerque.\nstanding under a canopy. The other buildings include the cathedral, the viceregal palace, the high court, the custom-house, the municipal chamber, the military hospital, the jail, the accountant-general's office, and the post office.

District of Eastern Bengal and Assam, forming the entrance to the upper valley of the Brahmaputra. It lies on both sides of the great river, extending from $25^\\circ 28'$ to $26^\\circ 54'$ N. and from $89^\\circ 42'$ to $91^\\circ 6'$ E., with an area of 3,961 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the mountains of Bhutan; on the south by the Garo Hills; on the east by Kamrup; and on the west by the Districts of Rangpur and Jalpaiguri and the State of Cooch Behar. The permanently settled portion of the District (as distinguished from the Eastern Duars, which lie under the Bhutan hills) occupies the valley of the Brahmaputra, at the corner where the river leaves Assam proper and turns due south to enter the wide plain of Bengal. It is very irregularly shaped, extending for 65 miles along the northern bank of the Brahmaputra, and for 120 miles along its southern bank. The level land on the south bank forms but a narrow strip, in some parts not more than 8 miles across, being shut in by the ridges of the Garo Hills. On the north, the country is much broken up by low ranges of hills running north and south, and exhibits a pleasing diversity of forest, lake, and marsh, interspersed with rice-fields and villages surrounded by groves of fruit trees and bamboos. The largest sheets of water are the Tamranga and Dhalni bils, two picturesque lakes lying at the foot of the Bhirab hills in the east of the District, and the Dhir and Diple bils a little to the west of that range. The Eastern Duars consist of a flat strip of country lying beneath the Bhutan mountains. The only elevated tract in these Duars is the Bhumeswar hill, which rises abruptly out of the plains to the height of nearly 400 feet; but to the north they are shut in by the ranges of the Bhutan hills. The total area of the Duars is 1,570 square miles, nearly the whole being covered with sal forest and high grass jungle, among which are scattered the patches of cultivation that surround the villages of the Mechs, who inhabit this tract.\n\nThe principal rivers on the north bank of the Brahmaputra are the Manas, with its tributary the Al, the Champamati, the Saralehanga or Gaurang, the Gangia, and the Sankosh. All these rise in the Bhutan hills and are navigable by country boats for a portion of their course throughout the year. Several other minor streams become navigable during the rainy season. A peculiar tract of pebbles, gravel, and sand, resembling the Bhadar tract in the Western Himalayas,\nborders the hills. The water of all the minor streams sinks into this during the greater part of the year, and does not again appear above ground till it reaches the alluvial clay. On the south bank the largest rivers are the Jinjir\u0101m and Krishn\u0101i, which rise in the G\u0101ro Hills.\n\nGeologically, the District consists of an alluvial plain composed of a mixture of clay and sand, with numerous outliers of gneissic rock.\n\nAs in the rest of Assam, enormous stretches of country are covered with high grass and reeds. The principal varieties are ikra (*Saccharum arundinaceum*), nal (*Phragmites Roxburghii*), and khagari (*Saccharum spontaneum*). S\u0101l (*Shorea robusta*) is common, and khair (*Acacia Catechu*) and sissu (*Dallergia Sissoo*) are found in the west of the District, while evergreen forest clothes the foot of the hills.\n\nThe larger fauna include elephants, rhinoceros, bison (*Bos gaurus*), buffaloes, tigers, leopards, and bears, and various kinds of deer. Wild animals still do much damage; in 1904 they were responsible for the deaths of 685 animals and 12 human beings, though rewards were paid for the destruction of 257 tigers and leopards. Small game consists of partridges, jungle-fowl, florican, wild duck, quail, and peafowl.\n\nFogs are not common, and the winter is milder and the spring hotter than in Upper Assam. In January, the coldest month of the year, the mean temperature is $63^\\circ$. The rainy season, on the other hand, is comparatively cool, and in no month does the mean temperature exceed $83^\\circ$. The Eastern Du\u0101rs and the tarai at the foot of the G\u0101ro Hills are excessively malarious, but the centre of the District is fairly healthy.\n\nNear the Brahmaputra the average annual rainfall is from 80 to 90 inches; but in the Eastern Du\u0101rs, which are near the hills and covered with dense forest, it is 60 or 70 inches higher. Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, like the rest of Assam, is subject to earthquakes. At the beginning of the nineteenth century a village near Go\u0101lp\u0101ra town is said to have been swallowed up in one of these convulsions of nature, and the great earthquake of 1897 did much damage. The town of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra was wrecked and the masonry buildings at Dhubri were injured. The houses in the interior are, however, usually made of reeds and bamboos; and the majority of the people, especially on the south bank of the Brahmaputra, suffered more from the floods which followed than from the earthquake itself. The causes of these floods are somewhat obscure; but it is believed that in places the level of the country sank, and that the silting up of the river-beds obstructed the natural drainage of the country. In 1900 a cyclone of extraordinary violence swept over a portion of the south bank. The path of the storm was only about 10 miles long and a quarter of a mile wide, but within this area everything was levelled with the earth, and 118 persons were killed or injured.\nLittle is known of the history of the earlier Hindu dynasties that reigned in the Assam Valley, and none of them was closely connected with Go\u0101lp\u0101ra. At the beginning of the sixteenth century the Koch race rose to power under Biswa Singh, whose son Nar N\u0101r\u0101yan waged war successfully against the Ahoms, and the R\u0101j\u0101s of Cach\u0101r, Jainti\u0101, Sylhet, and Tippera. Before his death the kingdom was divided; and Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, with K\u0101mr\u016bp and Darrang, was made over to his nephew, Raghu Rai, who is claimed as the ancestor of the present Bijni family. Raghu Rai\u2019s son, Parikshit, was defeated by the Muhammadans in 1614, and the District was then incorporated in the Mughal empire, though the struggle between the Muhammadans and the Ahoms went on for some years longer. After the English obtained the div\u0101n\u012b of Bengal in 1765, Go\u0101lp\u0101ra town continued to be a frontier outpost, and a considerable trade was carried on from there, and from Jogighop\u0101 on the opposite bank of the Brahmaputra, between European merchants and the Assamese.\n\nOn both the north and south the District has been exposed to trouble from the tribes inhabiting the hills that form its boundaries. The country south of the river was continuously raided by the G\u0101ros, and hundreds of lives were taken, till the tribe was pacified by the posting of a European officer in the centre of the hills in 1866. The Eastern Du\u0101rs originally formed part of the territories of the Hindu R\u0101j\u0101s: but during the conflicts between the Ahoms and the Muhammadans the Bhoti\u0101s succeeded in establishing their sovereignty over this territory, and it was only ceded to the British after the Bhut\u0101n War of 1865. The permanently settled portions of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra originally formed part of the District of Rangpur, but were transferred to Assam after the annexation of the valley in 1826. In 1867 the whole of what is now Go\u0101lp\u0101ra District was included in the Commissionership of Cooch Beh\u0101r, but in the following year it was placed for judicial purposes under the Judicial Commissioner of Assam. Finally, it was transferred to that Province when it became a separate Administration in 1874. There are hardly any objects of archaeological interest in the District.\n\nThe population of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra at each of the last four enumerations was: (1872) 387,341, (1881) 446,700, (1891) 452,773, and (1901) 462,052. The large apparent increase in 1881 was chiefly due to the inaccuracy of the first Census, and since that date the population has advanced but slowly. This has been chiefly due to the ravages of a peculiarly malignant form of malarial fever known as kal\u0101 az\u0101r. The District is divided into two subdivisions, Dh\u016bbri and Go\u0101lp\u0101ra; and in the last named, the greater part of which lies south of the Brahmaputra, the population in 1901 was only about four-fifths of that recorded twenty years before. There are two towns in the District, Dh\u016bbri and Go\u0101lp\u0101ra; and 1,461 villages. The\nfollowing table gives particulars of area, towns and villages, and population according to the Census of 1901:\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|---------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Dhubri      | 2,959               | 1              | 1,076   | 329,102    | 111                       | + 3.4                                           | 7,474                                    |\n| Go\u0101lp\u0101ra    | 1,002               | 1              | 385     | 132,950    | 133                       | - 1.1                                           | 4,869                                    |\n| District total | 3,961             | 2              | 1,461   | 462,052    | 117                       | + 2.0                                           | 12,343                                   |\n\nAt the Census of 1901, 44 per cent. of the population returned themselves as Hindus, 28 per cent. as Muhammadans, and 27 per cent. professed various forms of Animism. Go\u0101lp\u0101ra is not a part of Assam proper; and 69 per cent. of the population speak Bengali, while 18 per cent. speak Bodo or plains K\u0101ch\u0101ri, the people in the Eastern Du\u0101rs being exceptionally faithful to their tribal tongue.\n\nMore than half the Hindu population are R\u0101jbansis (115,800), but this is only a high-sounding name for the Hinduized section of the Koch or Bodo tribe. Br\u0101hmans and other respectable castes are not strongly represented. The principal unconverted tribes are the Mech (73,800), the Rabh\u0101s (27,100), and the K\u0101ch\u0101ris and G\u0101ros. All of these are descended from the Bodo stock, and resemble one another closely in appearance, manners, and customs. Agriculture is the staple occupation, supporting 84 per cent. of the population in 1901.\n\nA branch of the American Baptist Mission is located at Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, and two-thirds of the native Christians in 1901 (3,429) were members of this sect. A colony of Christian Sant\u0101ls has also been planted by missionary enterprise near Dingding\u0101 H\u0101t, about 18 miles north of Dhubri.\n\nThe soil consists of clay mixed in varying proportions with sand. In the submontane tract it assumes an ochreous shade, due to the presence of iron. There is a considerable difference between the conditions prevailing in the north and the south of the District. In the Eastern Du\u0101rs the rice-fields are invariably irrigated from the hill streams, and, though the soil is sandy, the crop is generally a bumper one and is beyond all risk of flood. The permanently settled estates near the Brahmaputra are exposed to much injury from flood, and the harvest is far less certain; but famine and scarcity are unknown over the whole District. The area under different crops in the permanently settled estates is not known; but in 1903\u20134 it was estimated that the District contained 541 square miles under rice, 81 square miles under mustard, 41 square miles under jute, 33 square miles under pulse, and 16 square miles under wheat. Rice is of three\nvarieties\u2014s\u0101li, which is transplanted and yields a large out-turn of good grain; \u0101su, which is usually sown broadcast and reaped before the floods rise; and loa, which is grown in marshy tracts, and sometimes has a stem nearly 20 feet in length. Wheat is raised in the east of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, but is only grown by foreigners in small patches in the other Districts of Assam. Garden crops include tobacco, vegetables, the p\u0101n or betel-vine, and the areca palm.\n\nIn 1903\u20134 the total area of the District was distributed as follows: Settled, 2,634 square miles; unsettled, 1,327 square miles; cultivated, 670 square miles; forests, 787 square miles.\n\nGo\u0101lp\u0101ra has never been exploited in the interests of the tea industry. The Eastern Du\u0101rs have an abundant rainfall, but the soil is rather sandy and the climate is said to be fatal to foreigners, while a large proportion of the land is covered with \u2018reserved\u2019 forest. In 1904 there were only four tea gardens in the District, with 700 acres under cultivation, which yielded 213,000 lb. of tea and gave employment to 2 Europeans and 508 natives.\n\nIt is impossible to trace the progress or decline of agriculture with any degree of accuracy: but it is believed that the area under jute, tobacco, and wheat has considerably extended in recent years, whereas mustard has suffered from the floods, which leave the soil too wet and cold to allow the seed to germinate properly.\n\nThe buffaloes are of a fairly powerful stock, but the farm bullocks are undersized and generally in poor condition. The villagers disregard all the laws of breeding and pay little attention to their animals; and, though there is plenty of grazing ground on every side, the grass in the rainy season is very rank.\n\nAlmost the whole of the rice crop in the Eastern Du\u0101rs is artificially irrigated. The cultivators combine to dig channels, sometimes several miles in length, through which they bring the water to their fields. No irrigation works have, however, been constructed by Government, and for assessment purposes no distinction is drawn between irrigated and unirrigated land.\n\nThe Go\u0101lp\u0101ra forests are of considerable commercial importance. The Government Reserves in 1903\u20134 covered an area of 787 square miles, about 163 square miles of which are stocked with pure s\u0101l (Shorea robusta). The principal forests, those of Ripu, Chirang, Bengtol, and Bijni, are situated at the foot of the Bhut\u0101n hills, about 36 miles from Dhubri. The Reserves are worked departmentally, as well as by private purchasers. The latter are usually local men, who take out permits for one or two hundred trees, which are logged in the forests, and towards the end of the rains brought down the various rivers to the Government d\u00e9p\u00f4t at Bagrib\u0101r\u012b and to other places on the Brahmaputra. The difficulties of transport\nare considerable, but they have been to some extent overcome by the purchase of 6 miles of portable tramway. The experiment has proved a success, and the length of line will probably be increased. Most of the timber is purchased by traders from Bengal, where it is largely used for boat-building. Much difficulty is experienced in obtaining the labour required for departmental working and for the clearance of fire lines, though forest villages have been established and trees are granted free in return for work done. In addition to the regular Reserves, there were in 1903-4 558 square miles of 'unclassed' state forest, managed by the Revenue officials. Few good trees are left in this area, owing to the wasteful practice, formerly in vogue, of levying revenue on the axe and not on the amount of timber extracted. A big trade in timber is also carried on by the zamind\u0101rs, as their forests, though containing fewer large trees, are more accessible than the Government Reserves. Other trees found in the District are khair (Acacia Catechu) and sissu (Dalbergia Sissoo); but they are, as a rule, only of sporadic growth, and are thus of little value from a commercial point of view.\n\nNo minerals have been found in the District, except a little coal of inferior quality on the border of the G\u0101ro Hills.\n\nThe manufactures of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra are not of much importance, and consist of brass and bell-metal vessels, rough pottery, and basket-work. Cotton and silk cloths are also woven by the women of the family, but not to the extent usual in Assam proper. The silk cloths are sometimes sold, but the products of the loom are often insufficient for home requirements, and have to be supplemented by European goods. Gold and silver ornaments are also made, but only to order.\n\nThe bulk of the trade of the District is carried on direct with Calcutta. The principal exports are mustard seed, jute, timber, hides, fish, unhusked rice, silk cloth, betel-nuts, and cotton and lac obtained from the G\u0101ro Hills. The articles received in exchange are European piece-goods, salt, hardware, oil, tobacco, pulse, and mats. The chief centres of trade are Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, Gauripur, Dhubri, and Manikarchar. Bil\u0101sip\u0101ra, on the north bank of the Brahmaputra, about 27 miles east of Dhubri, is a large timber d\u00e9p\u00f4t; and a good deal of jute is exported from P\u0101t\u0101m\u0101ri, a village nine miles south of that town. The principal markets to which the G\u0101ros come down to exchange their goods are Jir\u0101, Nib\u0101ri, and Damr\u0101. The natives of the District have little aptitude for commerce, and most of the business is in the hands of merchants from R\u0101jput\u0101na or Bengal. The railway is not largely used for commercial purposes, owing to the necessity for transhipment at Sar\u0101 Gh\u0101t; and the bulk of the traffic is by steamer or in country boats, which come up in large numbers to Go\u0101lp\u0101ra. Internal trade is carried on at weekly markets, of which there are a large number, and at fairs\nheld on the occasion of religious festivals. The Bhotias bring down a few ponies and a little rubber, but the total value of this transfrontier trade is very small.\n\nThe main artery of trade is the Brahmaputra, which flows through the District and receives numerous tributaries on either bank. At four stations on the river\u2014namely, Dhubri, Bilasipara, Goalpara, and Dalgom\u2014a passenger steamers call daily, and these are periodically visited by large cargo boats. The vessels are owned and managed by the India General Steam Navigation Company and the Rivers Steam Navigation Company, Limited. Country boats are largely used during the rains to bring produce from the interior. The Eastern Bengal State Railway opened a line to Dhubri in 1902, and the railway is being continued through the north of the District to a point opposite Gauhati, the terminus of the Assam-Bengal Railway. Both the north and south trunk road run through the District, but the bulk of the land traffic goes by the local board road from Gauripur to Rahat in Barpetta. Speaking generally, Goalpara is well supplied with means of communication. Altogether 464 miles of unmetalled roads were maintained in 1903-4, of which 225 miles were in the charge of the Public Works department. The larger rivers flowing from the Bhutan hills are still unbridged, and are crossed by ferries; and steam ferries ply across the Brahmaputra between Dhubri and Fakirganj, and Jogighopa and Goalpara.\n\nThe District is divided into two subdivisions: Dhubri, which is under the immediate charge of the Deputy-Commissioner; and Goalpara, which is usually entrusted to a native magistrate. In addition to the Deputy-Commissioner, the District staff includes three Assistant Magistrates, a Forest officer, and an Executive Engineer, who is also in charge of the Garo Hills District.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner exercises the powers of a Sub-Judge, and the subordinate magistrates act as Munsifs. Appeals lie to the Judge of the Assam Valley, and from him to the High Court at Calcutta. Special arrangements have been made for the administration of civil justice in the Eastern Duars, suited to the simple and uncivilized character of the inhabitants. Whenever possible, disputes are decided by panchayat, and the chief appellate authority is the Commissioner. The people of the District are of a peaceful and law-abiding character, and there is little serious crime.\n\nFor revenue purposes, Goalpara consists of two distinct tracts: the area covered by the jurisdiction of the three thanas of Goalpara, Dhubri, and Karaihari as that jurisdiction stood in 1822; and the Eastern Duars. After the failure of Mir Jumla's expedition in 1663, Goalpara was the frontier District held by the Mughal government, and only a nominal tribute was taken from the border chieftains. This tribute was origin-\nally paid in kind; but shortly before the Decennial Settlement of 1793 it had been commuted to a cash payment, which was accepted, when the settlement was made permanent, as the land revenue demand of the estates from which it was drawn. The result is that an area of more than 2,373 square miles pays a revenue of only Rs. 11,411, which is less than half a farthing per acre, and probably does not exceed one-sixtieth part of the zamindars' receipts. The Eastern Du\u0101rs, which lie at the foot of the Bhutan hills, and cover an area of 1,570 square miles, were acquired from Bhutan in 1865, and are settled direct by Government with the ryots. Owing to the unhealthiness of the climate and the sparseness of the population, there is little demand for land in the Du\u0101rs. The rates assessed are lower than those in force in Assam proper, and over the greater part of this area the revenue demand is Rs. 1-8 per acre for homestead and winter rice land and 12 annas for high land. The R\u0101j\u0101s of Bijni and Sidli are entitled to settlement of estates covering 130,000 and 170,000 acres respectively, in the Du\u0101rs that bear their names, as they were held to have acquired rights over this land when under the Bhutan government.\n\nThe land revenue and total revenue of the District, in thousands of rupees, is shown in the following table:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 94     | 94     | 1,12   | 1,10   |\n| Total revenue  | 3,63*  | 4,79   | 5,52   | 4,82   |\n\n* Exclusive of Forest receipts.\n\nOutside the municipalities of Dhubri and Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, the local affairs of each subdivision are managed by boards under the chairmanship of the Deputy-Commissioner and Subdivisional officer. The expenditure of these boards in 1903-4 was a little over one lakh, rather more than one-half of which was devoted to public works and one-fourth to education. The chief sources of income were the local rate and a substantial grant from Provincial revenues.\n\nFor the purposes of the prevention and detection of crime the District is divided into nine investigating centres, the force in 1904 consisting of 41 officers and 210 men, with 896 chaukid\u0101rs, or village watchmen. There is a jail at Dhubri which can accommodate 28 males and 6 females, and a magistrate's lock-up at Go\u0101lp\u0101ra.\n\nEducation is still very backward in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra. The number of pupils under instruction in 1880-1, 1890-1, 1900-1, and 1903-4 was 2,922, 4,931, 7,241, and 6,801 respectively. During the past twenty-nine years the cause of education has, however, made some progress, and the number of pupils in 1903-4 was nearly three times that in 1874-5. At the Census of 1901, 2.7 per cent. of the population (4.9 males and\n0.2 females) were returned as literate. There were 215 primary and 18 secondary schools in the District in 1903-4. The number of female scholars was 345. The enormous majority of the pupils under instruction were only in primary classes, and the number of girls who have advanced beyond that stage is insignificant. Of the male population of school-going age 14 per cent. are in the primary stage of instruction, and of the female population of the same age less than one per cent. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 60,000, of which Rs. 11,000 was derived from fees.\n\nThe District possesses 3 hospitals and 11 dispensaries, with accommodation for 59 in-patients. In 1904 the number of cases treated was 93,000, of whom 600 were in-patients, and 1,400 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 19,000, the greater part of which was met from Local and municipal funds.\n\nAbout 34 per 1,000 of the population were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, but this figure was much below the average for previous years. Vaccination is compulsory only in the towns of Dhubri and Goalpara.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, *A Statistical Account of Assam*, vol. ii (1879); E. A.

The subdivision consists of a narrow strip of land between the Garo Hills and the Brahmaputra, with the southeastern portion of that part of the District which lies on the north bank of the great river. Low hills project into the plains from the Garo range, and even appear on the other side of the Brahmaputra in the Salmara thana, where they reach a height of nearly 1,700 feet. Much of the country lies low, and there are numerous swamps and marshes, and some sheets of water, like the Kumarakata and Tamranga bils, which even in the dry season are of considerable size. The annual rainfall at Goalpara town averages 91 inches, but it is heavier towards the north. The subdivision was one of the first places in the Assam Valley to be attacked by kal\u0101 az\u0101r, and between 1881 and 1891 the population decreased by 18 per cent. The population in the latter year was 134,523, and by 1901 it had fallen to 132,950, a further decrease of one per cent. The density of population is 133 persons per square mile, as compared with 117 in the District as a whole. Mustard and long-stemmed rice are grown on the marshes near the river, but much injury is done by floods, which have been particularly severe since the earthquake of 1897. Goalpara (population, 6,287) is the principal town and head-quarters of the subdivision, the magistrate\nin charge being usually a native of India. For administrative purposes the subdivision is divided into the th\u0101nas of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, Dudhnai, Lakhipur, and North S\u0101lm\u0101ra, and contains 385 villages. The whole of the subdivision is permanently settled.\n\nGo\u0101lp\u0101ra Town.\u2014Town in the District of the same name, Assam, situated in 26\u00b0 10' N. and 90\u00b0 38' E., on the south bank of the Brahmaputra. Population (1901), 6,287. Prior to the annexation of Assam, Go\u0101lp\u0101ra was a frontier station of the Company's territories, and a colony of Europeans who settled there forcibly acquired a monopoly of the Bengal trade, and then engaged in lucrative transactions with the natives, who enjoyed a similar monopoly of the trade of Assam. The first attempt by the British to interfere in the internal affairs of the Assam kingdom was made by a salt-farmer named Raush, who in 1788 dispatched 700 sepoys from Go\u0101lp\u0101ra to aid the R\u0101j\u0101 against his revolted subjects, but not one of these soldiers is said to have returned. A pile of masonry, the size of a small cottage, which covers the remains of Raush's two infant children, stands on the side of a low hill overlooking the river. A magnificent view is obtained from this spot over the valley of the Brahmaputra, which is here much broken by low forest-clad hills and is bounded on the north by the snow-capped Him\u0101layas. Most of the public offices stand on the hill, and have been rebuilt since the earthquake of 1897, which destroyed all masonry buildings and caused the native town, which stands on the plain at the west, to sink below flood-level. Embankments fitted with sluice-gates have recently been constructed to protect the town from the floods of the Brahmaputra; but the lower parts are waterlogged by accumulations of rain-water, which cannot be drained off till the river falls, and the shops and houses present a very dilapidated appearance. In 1879 the head-quarters of the District were removed from Go\u0101lp\u0101ra to Dhubri, and since that date it has been a subdivisional station.\n\nGo\u0101lp\u0101ra was constituted a municipality in 1878. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 6,000, the chief source of income being house tax, and the main items of outlay conservancy and public works. In 1903-4 the income and expenditure were Rs. 7,200 and Rs. 6,300 respectively. In addition to the magistrate's court and lock-up, the public buildings include a high school with an average attendance of 106 boys, and a dispensary with 18 beds. A branch of the American Baptist Mission is located in the town. Go\u0101lp\u0101ra is connected by road with Gauh\u0101ti and Dhubri, and is a port of call for steamers plying on the Brahmaputra. There is a considerable export trade in jute, mustard, cotton, lac, and s\u0101l timber. The chief imports are salt, grain, oil, and cotton goods and twist. The wholesale trade is in the hands of M\u0101rw\u0101ri merchants, but the majority of the retail shopkeepers are Muhammadans from Dacca.\nGoalundo Subdivision.\u2014Western subdivision of Faridpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between $23^\\circ 32'$ and $23^\\circ 55'$ N. and $89^\\circ 19'$ and $89^\\circ 49'$ E., with an area of 428 square miles. The population in 1901 was 319,285, compared with 351,620 in 1891; the number of villages is 1,178, including Rajbari, the head-quarters. The subdivision, which is bounded on the north and east by the Padma, is a fertile alluvial tract possessing a rich, light loamy soil. The surface is high compared with that of the other subdivisions, but the climate is very unhealthy, malarial fever being prevalent, and the density of population (7.46 persons per square mile) is consequently less than elsewhere in the District. The subdivision is served by the eastern section of the Eastern Bengal State Railway, and by steamers. Goalundo Village is an important railway and steamer station and the focus of several trade routes; other trade centres are Pangsa and Belgachi.\n\nGoalundo Village.\u2014Village in the subdivision of the same name in Faridpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $23^\\circ 51'$ N. and $89^\\circ 46'$ E., near the junction of the main streams of the Padma, as the Ganges is here called, and the Brahmaputra. Population (1901), 5,036. Goalundo is the terminus of the Eastern Bengal State Railway and of several important steamer routes, and is a mart through which an enormous volume of trade passes. Daily services of steamers connect it with the railway systems at Narayanganj and Chandpur, and with the steamer services to Madaripur, Barisal, Sylhet, and Cachar. There are also daily services of steamers up the Padma to Digha Gh\u00e2t in the dry season, and Buxar in the rains, and up the Brahmaputra to Dibrugarh. Formerly Goalundo was situated exactly at the junction of the Padma and Brahmaputra, and an enormous sum was expended in protecting the site from erosion. But in 1875 the spur was washed away; and since that date the terminus, though still called Goalundo, has shifted twice annually, the present site being 7 miles south of the former one. The subdivisional and railway head-quarters, which were formerly at Goalundo, have been removed inland to Rajbari. Goalundo contains a very large bazar and the railway and steamer officers\u2019 quarters, which follow the terminus in its wanderings. The trade is one of transhipment, the principal commodities dealt with being jute, oilseeds, and food-grains. An enormous quantity of hilsa fish is exported to Calcutta. The trade is mainly in the hands of Marwari and Bengali merchants. Coolies travelling to the Assam tea gardens pass through Goalundo, and an Emigration officer is stationed here.\n\nGobardanga.\u2014Town in the Barasat subdivision of the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 53'$ N. and $88^\\circ 45'$ E., on the east bank of the Jamuna river, with a station on the Eastern Bengal State Railway. Population (1901), 5,865. Tradition points to this place as the spot where Krishna tended his flocks; and the name of\nthe adjoining village, Gaipur, is said to be abbreviated from Gopipur, and to denote the city of gopinis or milkmaids, mistresses of Krishna. Sugar factories are numerous, and raw jute and molasses are exported. Gobardanga was constituted a municipality in 1870. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 3,600, and the expenditure Rs. 3,100. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 3,500, mainly from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 3,400.\n\nGobardhan.\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Muttra, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 30' N. and 77\u00b0 28' E., on the road from Muttra city to Dig (Bharatpur State). Population (1901), 6,738. It lies in a recess in the sacred hill called Giri Raj, and is built round a fine tank lined with masonry steps, called the Manasi Gang\u00e2. At the Dew\u00e2li festival in autumn the steps and fa\u00e7ade of the surrounding buildings are outlined with rows of small lamps, producing a beautiful effect. Gobardhan is famous in tradition as one of the favourite residences of Krishna, and is also remarkable for its architectural remains. The oldest is the temple of Hari Deva, originally built about 1560 and restored by a Bani\u00e2 in 1872. Two stately cenotaphs of richly carved stone commemorate Randhir Singh and Baldeo Singh, Rajas of Bharatpur; they are crowned by domes, the interiors of which are adorned with curious paintings. A third cenotaph is being constructed in memory of Raja Jaswant Singh. North of the town, on the bank of the beautiful artificial lake called Kusum Sarovar, stands a group of buildings built in memory of S\u00fbraj Mal by his son, Jaw\u00e2hir Singh, soon after S\u00fbraj Mal's death near Gh\u00e2zi\u00e2bad in 1763. Gobardhan is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 2,200. There is little or no trade. The primary school has about 140 pupils.\n\nGobardhangiri.\u2014Hill in Shimoga District, Mysore. See Govardhangiri.\n\nGobindpur Subdivision.\u2014Northern subdivision of M\u00e2nbh\u00fbm District, Bengal, lying between 23\u00b0 38' and 24\u00b0 4' N. and 86\u00b0 7' and 86\u00b0 50' E., with an area of 803 square miles. The subdivision consists of a triangular strip of country between the D\u00e2m\u00f4dar and Bar\u00e2kar rivers; to the west the land rises to the Chot\u00e2 N\u00e2gpur plateau, but to the north and east the country is open and consists of a series of rolling downs, with a few isolated hills. The population in 1901 was 277,122, compared with 221,434 in 1891, the density being 345 persons per square mile. It contains 1,248 villages, of which Gobindpur is the head-quarters; but no town. The Jherri\u00e2 coal-field lies within the subdivision, and the great growth of the population during the last decade is due to the rapid development of the mining industry.\nGobindpur Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name, M\u0101nbh\u016bm District, Bengal, situated in $23^\\circ 50' N.$ and $86^\\circ 32' E.$ Population (1901), 1,293. Gobindpur contains the usual subdivisional offices, and a sub-jail with accommodation for 32 prisoners.\n\nGod\u0101g\u0101ri.\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of R\u0101jshahi District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $24^\\circ 28' N.$ and $88^\\circ 19' E.$, in the extreme west of the District, near the junction of the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 with the Padm\u0101. Population (1901), 235. It possesses an important river trade extending as far as the United Provinces, and is a station on the steamer route from D\u0101mukd\u012ba to M\u0101lda. A scheme is under consideration to connect God\u0101g\u0101ri by railway with Katihar.\n\nGod\u0101v\u0101ri District.\u2014District on the north-east coast of the Madras Presidency, lying between $16^\\circ 19' N.$ and $18^\\circ 4' N.$ and $80^\\circ 52'$ and $82^\\circ 36' E.$, with an area of 7,972 square miles. It is bounded on the north-east by Vizagapatam District; on the north by the same District and the Central Provinces; on the west by the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Dominions; and on the south-west by Kistna District. It consists of three very dissimilar natural divisions: namely, the Agency tract in the north-west, the delta of the God\u0101v\u0101ri river along the coast, and the upland t\u0101lukas which lie midway between these two areas.\n\nThe north-western angle of the District, known as the Agency tract from the administrative system there in force, is almost entirely occupied by a portion of the range of the Eastern Gh\u0101ts, which here consists of a series of broken and scattered hills and spurs rising from the lower uplands. The highest peak is Peddakonda, \u2018big hill\u2019 (4,476 feet).\n\nThe great river God\u0101v\u0101ri, which gives its name to the District and forms its most distinctive feature, enters the Bhadr\u0101chalam t\u0101luk west of the Gh\u0101ts, and, until it begins to wind its way through the P\u0101pikonda range, forms the boundary between British territory on the left bank and Hyder\u0101b\u0101d on the right. Emerging from the Gh\u0101ts into a gently undulating plain broken here and there by a few small hill ranges, it runs right through the centre of the District proper. Forty miles from the sea, opposite Dowlaiswheram, it divides into two branches, enclosing between them the Amal\u0101puram t\u0101luk, and flows through a wide delta which its own silt has formed. At the head of this, at Dowlaiswheram, is the famous anicut, or dam, which has been constructed to render its\n\n---\n\n1 While this work was passing through the Press the limits of the old God\u0101v\u0101ri District were altered, the t\u0101lukas of Yernagudem, Ellore, Tanuku, Bhinnavaram, and Narasapur (less Nagaram Island) being transferred to Kistna District. The transfer of the Nugar, Albaka, and Cherla tahsils (about 600 square miles) from the Central Provinces to God\u0101v\u0101ri District is under consideration. The present account deals with the District as it was before these alterations occurred.\n\n2 See the article on Ganjam District.\nwaters available for irrigation; and from this point to the sea the country is a vast expanse of rice-fields dotted with gardens and villages. During the rains the greater part of this tract becomes one sheet of water, only village sites, canal banks, roads, and field boundaries appearing above it. Later in the year, as the rice grows higher, the dividing boundaries are hidden; and the whole country looks like a single rice-field, only the palm-trees along the edges of the fields, the groves round the villages, the road avenues, and the white sails of the boats gliding along the main canals breaking the uniform sea of waving green crops.\n\nBy common usage the alluvial tracts along the left and right banks of the river are designated the Eastern and Western Deltas, while to the delta proper, the Amalapuram taluk, is given the name of Central Delta. The Eastern Delta extends east from Dowlaishweram as far as S\u0101makot, including the greater part of the R\u0101m\u0101chandrapuram and Cocan\u0101da taluks. The Western Delta extends westward from the river to Ellore and thence southward along the Colair Lake, and its outlet the Upputeru stream, to Narasapur. It includes the taluks of Tanuku, Narasapur, and Bhimavaram.\n\nThe upland taluks form the third natural division of the District. Vernagudem and Ellore are an undulating plain broken by low ranges. East of the God\u0101vari river, Tuni consists of stony soil with small hills, covered, despite their steepness, with forest; Pith\u0101puram teems with fruit trees and is watered by many channels and tanks; and in R\u0101jahmundry and Pedd\u0101puram 'wet' land alternates with long stretches of stony waste.\n\nThe District has a seaboard of about 172 miles. The coast is low and sandy, interspersed with tidal swamps and creeks. Its general trend is in a north-eastern direction; but the greater part is within the influence of the God\u0101vari river and is continually changing its contour. The only port with any trade is Cocan\u0101da, and even there, owing to shoal-water, vessels are obliged to anchor in the roadstead 4\u00be miles from the shore. There are lighthouses at Vakalapudi, 4 miles north of Cocan\u0101da, and on the Sacramento Shoal; while the abandoned light at Cocan\u0101da port, that on Hope Island, and the obelisk 45 feet high on Narasapur Point form conspicuous sea-marks.\n\nBesides the God\u0101vari and its tributary the S\u0101bari, there are no rivers of any size in the District. But several minor streams drain the upland taluks and are more or less used for irrigation. Of these, the Yeleru, running through the Pedd\u0101puram taluk and the Pith\u0101puram tahsil, and the Yerrak\u0101lva, which under the name of Wayyeru becomes merged in the Western Delta canal system, are the most important.\n\nThe Archaean gneissic rocks of the District are confined to its north-west portion, on each side of the Lower Gondw\u0101nas which are found there. The Lower Gondw\u0101na basin of Permo-carboniferous to Triassic\nfresh-water arenaceous deposits lies at gentle angles on the gneissic floor, comprising a basal boulder-bed of glacial origin, a lower (Bar\u0101kar) coal-bearing stage, and an upper (Kamptee) stage of barren sandstones. From this basin upwards the Lower Gondw\u0101nas and Archaeans are levelled away towards the 3,000 feet plateaux, as if by a series of planes of marine denudation. On one of these lie the Upper Gondw\u0101nas, which run in a low escarpment south-west and north-east from R\u0101jahmundry. Finally above this and the other rock groups lie the slightly older Cuddalore sandstones, on which in turn rest the deposits of the plains and of the God\u0101vari Valley.\n\nThe physical conformation of the District permits the existence of several distinct floras; and the native plants have been more carefully studied here than elsewhere, owing to the residence of the botanist Roxburgh for some time at S\u0101nalkot. The delta teems with weeds of cultivation, the uplands yield the plants of the dry scrub forest, while the hill tracts present an entirely different series. The deep ravines near Bison Hill afford the nearest approach to a moist evergreen forest to be met with in this part of India. Among the interesting plants of the God\u0101vari gorge may be noted Barleria strigosa, Oldenlandia nudicaulis, and Sauropus quadrangularis. Bordering the stream and in the rapids Euphorbia Laxii flourishes, while on the banks such exotic ferns as Luffa echinata and Melilotus parviflora are found\u00b9.\n\nThe Agency tract possesses the larger fauna usual to such wild and remote regions. Bison (gaur) frequent the table-lands of the P\u0101pikonda range, and wild buffalo are occasionally met with on the banks of the S\u0101bari. Nilgai have been shot in the Bhadr\u0101chalam t\u0101luk. In the plains antelope, spotted deer, and wild hog are to be found in several localities. The District is rich in bird life, and among the rarer birds may be mentioned the imperial pigeon, pied myna, and bhimara\u1e6d. The large sable-fish is caught in considerable quantities at the anicut across the God\u0101vari.\n\nThe District is on the whole a healthy one, but fever is very prevalent, especially during the cold season. The Agency tracts in particular are notorious in this respect, and the malaria peculiar to the Guditeru valley is of a virulent type. The natives consume considerable quantities of opium as a prophylactic against the disease. Beri-beri is common along the coast. The mean temperature at R\u0101jahmundry, in the centre of the District, averages 82\u00b0, with a mean range of 18\u00b0; but the humidity of the atmosphere renders the heat oppressive. In Bhadr\u0101chalam and the hill tracts generally the temperature has a much wider range.\n\nThe first four months of the year are practically rainless. The south-west monsoon, which sets in about the middle of June, brings\n\n\u00b9 Roxburgh's Coromandel Plants.\nnearly two-thirds of the annual fall. It naturally breaks more heavily in the Bhadr\u0101chalam taluk beyond the Gh\u0101ts than in the rest of the District. Conversely the north-east monsoon is hardly felt in that taluk. The annual fall for the whole District averages 31 inches. The coast is much exposed to north-easterly cyclones, and in 1787, 1832, and 1839 immense loss was caused by them. In the first two of these more than 20,000 persons are said to have perished, and the last was even more destructive of property. Floods in the God\u0101vari have also been a frequent source of damage. Although embankments were very early raised for the protection of the country, six villages in the Vennagudem taluk were swept away in 1886, and there were extensive inundations in 1891 and 1900.\n\nIn early times the District was included within the two ancient kingdoms of Kalinga and Vengi. The frontier between these two was a varying one, but it was never farther south than the God\u0101vari river, and generally lay far to the north of the District, in Vizagapatam or even Ganjam. The southern border of Vengi seems never to have been farther north than the Kistna, and that kingdom often extended many miles to the south and west. The earliest rulers of the country of whom we have any knowledge were the Andhras. These were conquered by Asoka in 260 B.C., but subsequently ruled for about 400 years independently over a wide empire extending nearly to Bombay and Mysore. They were followed in the early part of the third century A.D. by Pallava chieftains, two of whom had their capitals at Vengi near Ellore and Pithapuram. In the seventh century the country passed under the Eastern Ch\u0101lukyas, who extended their rule far into Vizagapatam and made R\u0101jahmundry their capital. Asoka, the Andhras, and the Pallavas had been Buddhists; the Ch\u0101lukyas were Vaishnavites. The last became the feudatories (in A.D. 999) of the great Chola empire; and the kingdoms were united till the middle of the twelfth century, when the Chola power began to decline and Vengi came first under a number of petty chiefs, and (at the end of the thirteenth century) under the Ganpati dynasty of Warangal. This fell before the Muhammadans, who obtained a brief foothold in the country in 1324; but the invaders were soon driven back, and the Vengi country passed to the Reddi kings of Kondavid and R\u0101jahmundry. About the middle of the fifteenth century the Vengi and Kalinga countries were united under the rule of the Gajapatis of Orissa. The Muhammadans now reappear on the scene. In 1470 R\u0101jahmundry and Kondapalli were ceded to the Sult\u0101n of Gulbarga in return for his assistance, and a few years later he subdued the whole of the Gajapati dominions; but the dismemberment of the Gulbarga kingdom a few years later restored the power of the Gajapatis before the end of the century. At this point\nKrishna Deva, the greatest of the Vijayanagar kings, overran the country (1515) and made it for a short time feudatory to himself; but this had no lasting effect, and before 1543 the first Sult\u0101n of Golconda had quarrelled with the Gajapati princes and had extorted a cession of all the country between the Kistna and the God\u0101v\u0101ri. Revolts in these provinces and assistance offered by the Gajapati prince of R\u0101jahmundry to the rebels provoked the Muhammadans to cross the God\u0101v\u0101ri and extend their rule farther to the north-east. R\u0101jahmundry fell in 1572, and a few years later the whole of the country north of the God\u0101v\u0101ri came under the Sult\u0101ns of Golconda, and was held by them till their overthrow by Aurangzeb in 1687. The power of Delhi was little felt so far from the centre of the empire, and the great zamind\u0101rs now made themselves practically independent. Then came the disintegration of that empire, and Asaf Jah, Subahd\u0101r of the Deccan, restored order with a firm hand.\n\nEuropeans had by this time been long established in the District. Palakollu, near Narasapur, was the first settlement, founded by the Dutch in 1652. They next formed a station at Jagann\u0101thapuram, now part of Cocan\u0101da. The English followed with settlements at Madapollam, now included in the Narasapur Union, and at V\u012braV\u0101saram (Virasheroon), a few miles north-west of the former. In 1708 a third factory was founded at Injaram, and later a fourth at Bandam\u016brlanka. About the same time the French possessed themselves of Yanam, which they still hold. In 1750 the Subahd\u0101r of the Deccan granted Narasapur, and in 1753 the rest of the Northern Circ\u0101rs, to the French, who in 1757 seized the English factories within this District. The following year an expedition under Colonel Forde from Bengal defeated the French at Condore\u00b9 (Chandurti) near Pith\u0101puram. By the subsequent operations English supremacy in the Circ\u0101rs was secured; and when these were ceded in 1765 the God\u0101v\u0101ri District, which was included in the Sark\u0101rs of R\u0101jahmundry and Ellore, passed to the English. At first it was leased to the Faujd\u0101r Husain Ali Kh\u0101n, but in 1769 it was placed under the direct administration of the Chief and Council at Masulipatam. The latter proved incapable of coping with the turbulence of the zamind\u0101rs, and in 1794 Collectorate were established at Cocan\u0101da, R\u0101jahmundry, and Mogalturru. Several changes were made in this arrangement until, in 1859, the Districts of R\u0101jahmundry, Masulipatam, and Guntur were re-formed into the God\u0101v\u0101ri and Kistna Districts. The factories which were the original cause of the acquisition of the Sark\u0101rs were abolished in 1830. The sudden cessation of a large industry, concurring with a period of scarcity, caused a great deterioration in the District. It was partly in consequence of this that the plan for building an anicut across the\n\n\u00b9 Orme describes in detail this decisive engagement.\nriver finally took shape. The effect of this project (completed in 1850) on the prosperity of the District has been enormous. In 1874 the taluks of Bhadrachalam and Rekapalli (since amalgamated) were transferred from the Central Provinces. In 1879 these taluks and the Rampa hill country were constituted an Agency under the Scheduled Districts Act of 1874. By this enactment the Collector, as Agent to the Governor, has extended powers within such areas. The limits of the Agency have since been changed considerably from time to time. In 1879 the serious disturbances known as the Rampa rebellion broke out in the hill country. They were not finally quelled till 1881, and were the last disturbance of the kind in the Presidency in which the help of troops has been required.\n\nThe mounds at Pedda Vegi and Denduluru near Ellore are supposed to mark the site of the capital of the Buddhist dynasty of Vengi. At Guntupalli, 24 miles north of Ellore, is a remarkable series of Buddhist remains; and at Arugollu in the Yernagudem taluk excavations in laterite have disclosed the foundations of similar buildings. Near K\u0101mavarapukota (in the Ellore taluk) and at Korukonda are rock-cut figures of Hindu origin. Some inscriptions of value are to be found in the numerous temples of the District, notably at Dr\u0101k\u1e63h\u0101r\u0101ma; while the mosque at R\u0101jahmundry possesses a Muhammadan record, dated A.D. 1324, one of the earliest of that religion in Southern India. In the Bhadrachalam taluk there are rude stone monuments, under which remains indicating a primitive civilization have been found. At P\u0101lakollu, Narasapur, and Jagann\u0101thapuram are interesting relics of the early European settlements.\n\nThe population of God\u0101v\u0101ri District in 1871 was 1,592,939; in 1881, 1,791,512; in 1891, 2,078,782; and in 1901, 2,301,759. It has increased at the abnormally high rate of 45 per cent. during the last thirty years. The District contains 2,678 towns and villages: but of these 1,141 are in the Agency tract, where there are no towns and the villages are exceptionally small. It is divided into twelve taluks and tahsils in the plains and four in the Agency tract, for which statistical particulars, based on the Census of 1901, are given on the next page.\n\nThe head-quarters of these taluks and tahsils (except of Yernagudem and Yellavaram, which are at Kovv\u016bru and Addatigala respectively) are situated at the places from which each takes its name. The chief towns are the three municipalities of Cocanada, R\u0101jahmundry, and Ellore; and the Unions of S\u0101malakot, Pith\u0101puram, Pedd\u0101puram, and P\u0101lakollu. Of the total population, Hindus number 2,236,283, or 97 per cent.; Muhammadans, 43,481; Christians, 16,795; Animists, 4,139; and \u2018others,\u2019 1,061. Immigration (chiefly from Vizagapatam) is a marked feature of the District, and sets mainly towards the delta. This forms\nthe most densely populated area north of Madras, in strong contrast to\nthe Agency tract, which, with 51 persons to the square mile, is the most\nsparsely peopled area in the Presidency. Telugu is the language of\n96 per cent. of the people. In the Bhadrachalam taluk, however,\nabout one-half, and in Polavaram about one-fourth, of the people speak\nKoyi, the language of the Koyi hill tribe.\n\n| Taluk or Taluks | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Number of Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population from 1871 |\n|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Agency Tract    |                     |               |                   |            |                          |                                   |\n| Polavaram       | 304                 | 292           | 58,274            | 193        | +14.6                    | 1,183                             |\n| Yellavaram      | 950                 | 297           | 29,681            | 31         |                          | 174                               |\n| Chodavaram      | 715                 | 232           | 23,229            | 32         |                          | 211                               |\n| Bhadrachalam    | 911                 | 320           | 48,158            | 53         | +15.0                    | 1,183                             |\n| Cocanada        | 294                 | 99            | 213,758           | 727        | +16.5                    | 12,213                            |\n| Tuni            | 216                 | 48            | 58,762            | 272        | +2.3                     | 1,938                             |\n| Pithapuram      | 191                 | 48            | 84,080            | 440        | +0.3                     | 3,125                             |\n| Peddapuram      | 594                 | 200           | 167,020           | 331        | +3.2                     | 4,500                             |\n| K\u0101machandrapuram| 290                 | 117           | 220,356           | 744        | +11.0                    | 8,839                             |\n| R\u0101jahmundry     | 350                 | 85            | 161,070           | 460        | +14.1                    | 9,642                             |\n| Amalapuram      | 506                 | 169           | 277,445           | 548        | +8.3                     | 12,568                            |\n| Ellore          | 778                 | 206           | 181,035           | 233        | +5.5                     | 9,866                             |\n| Yernagudem      | 568                 | 115           | 140,948           | 247        | +8.6                     | 4,308                             |\n| Naraapur        | 433                 | 129           | 254,961           | 589        | +11.2                    | 12,764                            |\n| Tanuku          | 371                 | 174           | 238,758           | 644        | +17.0                    | 11,471                            |\n| Bhimavaram      | 325                 | 134           | 144,615           | 445        | +17.5                    | 8,027                             |\n\nDistrict total * 7,972 1,3 2,665 2,301,759 289 +10.7 102,012\n\n* The area of the remodelled Godavari District is 5,044 square miles, and its population 1,445,901.\n\nThe Koyis make up about a third of the whole population of the\nAgency, where they number more than 50,000. In the adjoining\nMalkangiri taluk of Vizagapatam District there are also some 11,000\nof them. They are a simple, unsophisticated race, who subsist by a\nshifting cultivation called podu, and are a prey to the malaria endemic\nin these regions. In the plains almost the whole population con-\nsists of Telugu castes. Of these, the most numerous are the K\u0101pus\n(457,000) and M\u0101las (391,000). Next come the Idigas (toddy-drawers),\nnumbering 167,000, or seven-tenths of the total strength of the caste in\nthe Presidency; the M\u0101digas (114,000); and the Kamma cultivators\n(110,000). Br\u0101hmans, who are more numerous than usual, form nearly\n5 per cent. of the Hindu population.\n\nThe Agency tract forms the most exclusively agricultural area in the\nPresidency. The low country differs little from the normal. As usual,\nthe great majority of the people are dependent on the land, though the\nproportion subsisting by transport is increased by the large number of boatmen working on the canals.\n\nThe number of Christians in the District increased from 9,064 in 1891 to 16,795 in 1901; the advance during the past twenty years has exceeded 300 per cent. Of the total, 15,836 are natives of India. Lutherans (6,510) and Baptists (5,129) are the two most numerous sects. Four Protestant missions are at work: the Canadian Baptist, the American Evangelical Lutheran, the Anglican, and the Plymouth Brethren (Delta Mission). The work of these is chiefly confined to the plains; but the Anglican Mission has a branch at Dummagudem in the Bhadrachalam taluk, where work is carried on among the Koys. These missions combine educational with evangelical aims. The native Roman Catholics number 688, mainly in the large towns.\n\nThe upland and delta taluks differ widely in their agricultural conditions. Of the 1,173 square miles of occupied land in Government villages in the delta, 73 per cent. was classed as silt at the resettlement. The sandy tracts along the sea-coast and the black cotton soil which occurs mainly in the tract round the Colair Lake account for the remainder. And, although the delta contains a certain amount of 'dry' land, almost the whole of this is commanded by the Godavari irrigation system. The lankas, as the islands formed by the river deposits are termed, deserve special mention on account of their great fertility. They consist of loam covered in places with deep layers of sand; and, being submerged in times of flood, they fluctuate in position and area. Their total extent is about 15,000 acres. Lanka tobacco is famous.\n\nIn the upland taluks red soils predominate, the sandy red variety being the most prevalent. The fertile Yeleru valley in the Yellavaram and Peddapuram taluks and the cotton-soil tracts of Rajahmundry are noticeable exceptions. In the Agency tract, where the country is covered with hills and forests, podu or nomadic cultivation is practised. A clearing is made in the jungle, the trees are burned, and the crop sown in the ashes. The following year a fresh site is chosen.\n\nOf the total area of Godavari District only 3,897 square miles are Government land, the remaining 4,075 square miles being held on zamindari or inam tenure. The area in 1903-4 for which particulars are available is given on the next page, in square miles.\n\nAbout a fifth of the total area is forest, and another fourth is otherwise not available for cultivation. The margin of cultivable waste is unusually small. Of the cultivated area, 464 square miles, mainly in the delta taluks, are cropped more than once within the year. Rice is grown on 1,156 square miles, or 52 per cent. of the gross area cropped, and is pre-eminently the staple food-grain of the District. Next come cholam (Sorghum vulgare), with 144 square miles; and pulses, chiefly\nhorse-gram and green gram, with 270 square miles. Rice is the principal crop in all the plains taluks except Yernagudem, while cholam and r\u00fcgi (Eleusine coracana) are grown in the upland taluks and the Agency. Of industrial crops, oilseeds (among which gingelly takes the first place) are the most important. Tobacco is raised throughout the District, except in the Bhimavaram taluk, and mainly on the lankas in R\u0101machandrapuram, Amal\u0101puram, and R\u0101jahmundry. Sugar-cane is of importance in R\u0101machandrapuram, Cocan\u0101da, and Narasapur, but a disease which has attacked the canes during the past few years has caused a great contraction in its cultivation. A large area is under orchard and garden crops, chiefly in Amal\u0101puram and Narasapur, where more than 32,000 acres are devoted to coco-nut plantations. Indigo, formerly cultivated on an extensive scale, is now practically confined to Amal\u0101puram. Narasapur, with the gardens of P\u0101lakollu, stands unique in the cultivation of the Batavian orange and pummelo, introduced by the Dutch settlers.\n\n| Taluk or Tahsil | Area shown in accounts | Forest | Cultivable waste | Cultivated | Irrigated |\n|-----------------|------------------------|--------|-----------------|------------|-----------|\n| Agency Tract    |                        |        |                 |            |           |\n| Polavaram       | 413                    | 112    | 32              | 65         | 1         |\n| Yellavaram      | 501                    | 165    | 11              | 60         | 3         |\n| Chodavaram      | 3                      | ...    | ...             | 2          | ...       |\n| Bhadrachalam    | 751                    | 460    | 29              | 26         | ...       |\n| Cocan\u0101da        | 186                    | 86     | 1               | 87         | 70        |\n| Tuni            | 2                      | ...    | ...             | 2          | ...       |\n| Pith\u0101puram      | ...                    | ...    | ...             | ...        | ...       |\n| Peddapuram      | 467                    | 72     | 9               | 252        | 55        |\n| R\u0101machandrapuram| 231                    | ...    | ...             | 203        | 144       |\n| R\u0101jahmndry      | 364                    | 34     | 25              | 236        | 49        |\n| Amal\u0101puram      | 342                    | 13     | 10              | 232        | 96        |\n| Ellore          | 508                    | 44     | 103             | 206        | 100       |\n| Yernagudem      | 310                    | 13     | 12              | 238        | 24        |\n| Narasapur       | 389                    | 16     | 26              | 283        | 198       |\n| Tanuku          | 274                    | 6      | 3               | 235        | 198       |\n| Bhimavaram      | 238                    | 7      | 23              | 185        | 148       |\n| Total           | 4,979                  | 1,028  | 284             | 2,400      | 1,086     |\n\nDuring the last thirty years the cropped area has increased by more than 50 per cent. and now exceeds a million acres. In the District proper it is only in the northern part of Ellore and in the swamps bordering the Upputeru in the Western Delta that any considerable extent of arable land remains unoccupied. In the uplands, however, much is yearly left fallow for the sake of pasturage. Various attempts have been made from time to time to improve the industrial crops, but little perceptible influence has so far been exercised. The area under valuable orchard and garden crops is, however, rapidly increasing.\nGovernment experimental farm has been started at S\u0101makot, and a nursery garden at Kadiam in the Eastern Delta. Practically no advantage is taken of the Loans Acts in this District.\n\nThere are no distinctive breeds of cattle. Mortality among stock is high in the delta, where the conditions prevent a large number being maintained, and in the cultivation season they are sent to the upland t\u0101lukas to graze. In these latter large flocks of sheep and goats are kept; but the Kurumba sheep, bred for the sake of its wool in the villages round Ellore, is the only variety calling for remark.\n\nOf the total area of ryotw\u0101ri and in\u0101m lands under cultivation in 1903\u20134, 1,086 square miles, or 62 per cent., were irrigated. The greater part of this (938 square miles) was supplied from Government canals, and almost all the remainder from tanks or artificial reservoirs. The canals are mainly those fed by the God\u0101vari anicut, a great masonry dam thrown across the God\u0101vari river opposite Dowlaisweram. A canal takes off from either flank, and a third, supplying the Central Delta, from the centre. The area commanded by the system is 1,980 square miles, of which 1,207 square miles are cultivable. The area actually irrigated at present is about 1,034 square miles; but including both first and second-crop cultivation, water was supplied to 1,254 square miles in 1903\u20134. As the God\u0101vari is independent of the local rainfall, the irrigated area fluctuates little from year to year. In the Ellore t\u0101luk there is a considerable area (about 20,000 acres) under the Kistna anicut system. The number of tanks in repair in the District is 1,183. Of these, the most important are the chain in the Pedd\u0101puram t\u0101luk and the Lingamparti tank, which latter irrigates 5,000 acres. The little Yeleru river waters a large area, principally in the Pith\u0101puram Estate and the adjoining zam\u012bnd\u0101ris. The Yerrak\u0101lya in Vernag\u016bdem and the Tammileru and Ramileru in Ellore are also utilized. Only 1,392 wells are used for irrigation.\n\nThe forests of God\u0101vari, owing to their diversity and the facility with which they can be exploited, are of great value. The District possesses 952 square miles of actual \u2018reserved\u2019 forest and 76 square miles of \u2018reserved\u2019 land, the latter lying entirely within the Cocan\u0101da t\u0101luk. The forests proper are situated chiefly within the Agency limits. Here the destructive practice of shifting cultivation (podu) formerly caused great damage, and its results are very apparent in some localities. It has now been prohibited within \u2018reserved\u2019 forests; but it is still permitted without check in the Rampa country, to which, for political reasons, the Forest Act has not been extended.\n\nThe principal \u2018reserved\u2019 forests are those of Bhadr\u0101chalam, Yellavaram, and Polavaram. The first named contains three ranges: Rekapalli, Marrig\u016bdem, and Bhadr\u0101chalam. Of these, Rekapalli con-\ntains, as its dominant species, large quantities of *Xylia dolabriformis*; and as the timber can be sawn into sleepers and floated down the river direct to the railway, this growth is of great value. With *Xylia* are associated *Terminalia*, *Pterocarpus Marsupium*, *Dalbergia latifolia*, and bamboos. The principal tree in the Marrigudem range is teak, and in Bhadrachalam *Hardwickia binata*. The Yellavaram and Polavaram forests resemble generally those in the Rekapalli range. In the western part of the Agency, *Diospyros melanoxylon* also flourishes. Myrabolams and tamarind are the principal items of minor produce. Along the coast are large tracts of mangrove swamp, and there are three casuarina plantations. The total revenue from forests in 1903\u20134 was about 1\u00be lakhs, and the expenditure about 1 lakh. A second District Forest officer has recently been appointed, with head-quarters at Kunavaram.\n\nProspecting for coal has been carried on for some years in the Upper Gondwana belt, running from Bhadrachalam through Polavaram and Vernagudem to Ellore. Two outcrops of the Bar\u0101kar stage occur, one at Ratsagampalle in Bhadrachalam and the other at Bedadan\u016bru in Polavaram. At the former place mining was begun, but was stopped by an upthrow fault; and the shaft, which was in the river bed, was found to lie beyond the limits of the Presidency. At the latter the outcrop extends over 5\u00bd square miles, and forms the only coal-field lying entirely within Madras. No paying seam has, however, as yet been discovered. Graphite of a good quality is worked by the Godavari Coal Company at Perakonda in the Bhadrachalam taluk, and the same mineral occurs in small quantities in several places in Chodavaram. Traces of old iron workings are to be found scattered throughout the Agency tract, and there are two small deposits of sulphur in the delta.\n\nEllore is noted for its woollen carpets. The dyes and wool for these are prepared locally, and well-woven carpets of old design can still be obtained, though several of the weavers now work on European patterns for the big firms in London. Coarse woollen blankets are made in several villages round Ellore, and at Undi in the Bhimavaram taluk. The fine cotton cloths for which the District was once famous are now made only at a few villages round Cocan\u0101da and P\u0101lakollu. Coarse cotton cloths are, however, still woven at many places.\n\nThe largest factory in the District is the sugar refinery and distillery at S\u0101makot, where the Deccan Sugar and Abk\u0101ri Company employs 520 persons daily. This factory has created a demand for jaggery (coarse sugar) made from the unfermented juice of the palmyra palm, and more than 400,000 trees in the District are tapped for toddy to be converted into this substance. There are rice-husking factories at Nilapalli, Nidadavolu, and Cocan\u0101da. Several small castor-oil factories\nare at work at Cocan\u0101da, and two tanneries at Ellore. Cocan\u0101da also possesses a small iron foundry, and the Public Works department workshops at Dowlaishweram employ a large number of hands. In the Amal\u0101puram taluk are several indigo factories, the principal being at Ainavilli. Of the three salt factories in the District, one (at Cocan\u0101da) belongs to a private firm, while those at Penugud\u016bru and Mogalturru are worked by Government. Three fish-curing yards also exist. A small cheroot factory has been opened at Cocan\u0101da.\n\nThe exports from the District consist almost entirely of agricultural produce. The chief items are rice, other grain, tobacco, oilseeds, gh\u012b, coco-nuts, hides, and fruit. The natural outlet for this trade is the port of Cocan\u0101da, though the railways and canals have diverted an increasing proportion to other ports. In addition to these commodities, cotton, brought from the Deccan, figures largely in the exports from Cocan\u0101da. It is shipped principally to the United Kingdom, Belgium, and France. Rice goes chiefly to Ceylon and Mauritius, oilseeds to France, Burma, and the United Kingdom, and tobacco to Burma, where it is made up into cheroots. The total value of the export trade from Cocan\u0101da in 1903\u20134 was about 167 lakhs, of which 84 lakhs was sent to foreign countries. The imports in the same year were valued at 39 lakhs. The principal are cotton twist and yarn, piece-goods, grain and pulses, kerosene oil, gunny-bags, and sugar. Cotton goods are imported coastwise or by canal and rail from Bombay and Madras, gunny-bags from Bengal, and kerosene oil from America. A prominent trading caste are the M\u0101rw\u0101ris, who are numerous at R\u0101jahmundry and Amb\u0101jipeta, the old centres of trade. Amb\u0101jipeta used to be the great opium market of the District, and the M\u0101rw\u0101ris probably chose these towns as convenient places for disposing of that drug in exchange for cloth. Opium is still a noteworthy article of import, the annual consumption in this District being about 11 lb. per 1,000 of the population, compared with an average of 1\u00bd lb. for the Presidency as a whole. As has been mentioned, it is used as a prophylactic against malaria. The retail trade of the District is largely in the hands of the Komatis. The chief centres of internal commerce are R\u0101jahmundry, where there are large d\u00e9p\u00f4ts for the timber floated down the God\u0101vari; Ellore, P\u0101lakollu, and Amb\u0101jipeta. The last named is the centre of the coco-nut trade of the delta, and all these places carry on an extensive business with tracts beyond the District. There are also numerous weekly markets, at which retail trade is conducted. They are controlled by the local boards, which in 1903\u20134 derived an income of Rs. 32,000 from the fees collected at them. The most important are those at Tuni, Jaggammapeta, and Pentap\u0101du. At Dr\u0101ksh\u0101r\u0101ma, Amb\u0101jipeta, and Pith\u0101puram large cattle fairs are held weekly.\n\nThe East Coast section of the Madras Railway (standard gauge)\nenters the District about 10 miles west of Ellore, and running along the fringe of the delta crosses the God\u0101v\u0101ri river at R\u0101jahmundry on one of the finest bridges in the Presidency. This work is built of steel girders laid on masonry piers, which are sunk from 48 to 100 feet below low-water level and stand $44\\frac{3}{4}$ feet above it. It has a total length of 9,000 feet, or over $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles, between abutments, and consists of 56 spans of 150 feet each. It was opened to traffic in 1900. From R\u0101jahmundry the line runs on to S\u0101makot, where a branch 10 miles long takes off to Cocan\u0101da port, and thence north-eastwards until it leaves the District at Tuni on the Vizagapatam border.\n\nThe total length of metalled roads is 918 miles, and of unmetalled roads 299 miles. Five miles of metalled roads are maintained by the Public Works department, and the remainder by the local boards. There are avenues of trees along 814 miles of them. The District proper is well supplied with metalled roads; but in the Agency tract the only lines are those leading to Addatigala and Chodavaram, and a few miles in Polavaram. No tolls are levied along the roads, except in the municipalities.\n\nMost important means of communication are the 493 miles of navigable canals in the delta, and above the anicut the God\u0101v\u0101ri river itself, which affords the easiest approach to the interior. The canals are closed for clearance and repair for two months during the hot season every year. Ferry steamers ply from R\u0101jahmundry to the opposite shore of the river, and up to Polavaram and across the river at Narasapur.\n\nSince the construction of the God\u0101v\u0101ri irrigation system, the District has been immune from severe famine. The last serious distress was in 1833, but in 1896-7 a part of the Agency tract was affected.\n\nFor administrative purposes the District proper is divided into four subdivisions, two of which are usually in charge of members of the Covenanted Service, and the others in charge of Deputy-Collectors. These subdivisions are Cocan\u0101da, which comprises the t\u0101luks of Cocan\u0101da and Pedd\u0101puram and the zamind\u0101ri tahsils of Pith\u0101puram and Tuni; R\u0101jahmundry, comprising the three t\u0101luks of R\u0101jahmundry, R\u0101machandrapuram, and Amal\u0101puram; Ellore, comprising the three t\u0101luks of Ellore, Tanuku, and Yernag\u016bdem; and Narasapur, comprising the Narasapur and Bh\u012bmavaram t\u0101luks. The Agency forms a fifth division, usually in charge of a European Deputy-Collector. It consists of the Bhadr\u0101chalam t\u0101luk and the minor t\u0101luks of Yellavaram, Chodavaram,\n\n---\n\n1 Their limits have been changed since the alteration in the boundaries of the District above referred to, and the new distribution is given in the article on each subdivision.\nand Polavaram. There is a tahsildar at the head-quarters of each taluk, and, except at Bhadrachalam, a sub-magistrate also. In the minor taluks the deputy-tahsildars exercise both revenue and criminal jurisdiction. The superior staff consists of the usual officers, except that (owing to the importance of the public works in this District) there are three Executive Engineers, one in charge of each of the three Delta systems mentioned above; and there are also two District Forest officers.\n\nFor the administration of civil justice District Munsifs' courts are held at the head-quarters of every taluk, except Ramachandrapuram and Vernagudem, in the District proper. The District Judge sits at Rajahmundry, and a Sub-Judge at Cocanada. In the Agency tract, the tahsildar of Bhadrachalam and the deputy-tahsildars have limited civil jurisdiction within their charges. From them appeals lie to the Agency Deputy-Collector, who himself tries the more important cases and is in turn subordinate to the Collector as Agent. Crime presents no salient features, but the total number of cases reported is higher than in any other District in the Presidency. This is specially noticeable as regards ordinary theft. Organized crime is attributable chiefly to a local tribe of Yanadis called Nakkalas, and to wandering gangs from the Ceded Districts.\n\nUnder the Muhammadans the District, with the exception of the haveli land (or land in the vicinity of military posts required for the support of troops), was parcelled out into zamindaris. The yearly rent from these was settled in an arbitrary manner, and the zamindars had in theory no other claim to them but the favour and policy of their rulers. Gradually, however, they arrogated to themselves a proprietary and hereditary title, which, in spite of a brief period of dispossession under Asaf Jah, obtained recognition in the end. The zamindars collected their revenues through agents or by sub-renting in their turn. 'By ancient and original establishment' the cultivators were entitled to half the gross produce. Unless, however, fortunate enough to have obtained a grant as mokhasa or inam, they had no right in the soil; and after the customary fees had been paid and the rapacity of the zamindars' servants satisfied, only a fifth share usually remained for them. At the time of harvest the crop was valued, threshed, and measured; and the zamindar then took his share in money or grain.\n\nAfter the cession of the Northern Circars (Sarkars) no change was at first made in the mode of revenue administration. But soon some of the estates began to fall into Government possession, either through the rebellion of their owners or because the revenue on them was not paid. Such lands were as a rule rented out again by Government. In 1802-3 a permanent settlement on the model of that in Bengal was introduced. By this the estates of the zamindars were conferred on\nthem in perpetuity, subject to a *peshkash* fixed at two-thirds of the estimated collections; while the Government lands were divided into similar estates and sold to the highest bidder. From 1803 to 1844 the downfall of these proprietary estates rapidly progressed, till in the latter year a large part of the District had reverted to Government. The revenue systems then adopted for the Government lands were the *asara* and *visab\u0101di*. The leading principle of the former was the ascertainment of the Government share by actual measurement; of the latter, the imposition of a lump assessment on each village, the incidence on particular holdings being settled by the cultivators among themselves. These were superseded in 1846 by the joint revenue system, under which, when the annual demand on a village had been settled, there was no further interference on the part of Government, and the cultivators were jointly and severally responsible for the whole demand.\n\nThe completion of the God\u0101v\u0101ri irrigation works rendered imperative the introduction of a more definite method for the realization of the land revenue. Accordingly in 1862 a field survey and settlement were commenced. These operations were completed in 1866, in which year the *ryotw\u0101ri* system was extended to practically the whole of the District proper. In 1891 sanction was given for a resurvey, which was completed in 1896. A resettlement was also taken in hand in 1894 and completed in 1899. By the latter the rates in the uplands were enhanced about one-third, without reclassification of the soils. In the delta a reclassification was made to permit the consolidation of the land tax and water rate, all land which had been continuously irrigated during the previous five years being classed as \u2018wet.\u2019 The result of the resettlement was an addition of 4\u00bd lakhs, or about 14 per cent., to the revenue from Government land. The average rates of assessment in the delta and the uplands for \u2018wet\u2019 land are respectively Rs. 7\u20139\u20134 and Rs. 4\u201310\u20132 per acre; and for \u2018dry\u2019 land Rs. 3\u20136\u20138 and R. 0\u201312\u20139.\n\nThe course of events in the Rampa country and the Bhadr\u0101chalam *t\u0101luk* was different. A few villages in the Agency tract were settled in 1899\u20131900, but in Polavaram and Yellavaram the majority of them are still farmed out annually. In the Government villages of the Bhadr\u0101chalam *t\u0101luk* the hillmen used to pay 4 annas for the area one axe can clear, or about three acres, but now they pay 4 annas an acre.\n\nThe revenue from land and the total revenue in recent years are given below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 46.84  | 56.64  | 77.34  | 70.01  |\n| Total revenue  | 57.02  | 74.24  | 1,02.37| 1,07.35|\nOwing to the transfer of part of the District to Kistna, the land revenue demand is now about Rs. 43,20,000.\n\nOutside the three municipalities of Cocan\u0101da, R\u0101jahmundry, and Ellore, local affairs are managed by the District board and the five t\u0101luk boards, the areas under which correspond respectively with those of the five administrative subdivisions mentioned above. The expenditure of these boards in 1903\u20134 was about 10 lakhs. More than half of this was laid out on the maintenance and construction of roads and buildings. The chief source of income is the land cess. Twenty-five of the smaller towns are managed by Union panch\u0101yats, constituted under Madras Act V of 1884.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police has his head-quarters at R\u0101jahmundry. He has an Assistant Superintendent to help him. There are 84 police stations in the District; and the regular force, inclusive of a reserve of one inspector and 103 men, numbers 1,075, working under 19 inspectors, besides 835 rural police.\n\nIn addition to the Central jail at R\u0101jahmundry there are 20 subsidiary jails, which can collectively accommodate 186 male and 121 female prisoners.\n\nIn the matter of elementary education God\u0101vari was the pioneer in the Madras Presidency, several villages having submitted to a voluntary cess for this purpose as early as 1855. Yet it now stands only sixteenth among the Districts as regards the literacy of its people. The percentage of those able to read and write is little more than 4 (8 males and 0\u00b77 females); and the Agency tract, where the percentage is less than 2, is naturally far more backward than the rest. But progress in recent years has been considerable. In 1880\u20131 the total number of pupils under instruction was 21,787; in 1890\u20131, 32,255; in 1900\u20131, 52,258; and in 1903\u20134, 61,510. On March 31, 1904, there were 1,740 educational institutions in the District, of which 1,518 were classed as public and 222 as private. Of the former, 1,442 were primary, 70 secondary, and 3 training schools; and Arts colleges are maintained at R\u0101jahmundry and Cocan\u0101da, and a training college at the former of these places. These institutions contained altogether 13,939 girls. Of the total, 37 were managed by the Educational department, 445 by local boards, and 22 by the municipalities; while 586 were aided from public funds, and 428 were unaided but conformed to the rules of the department. As usual, the great majority of the pupils were in primary classes. This is specially marked in the case of female education. Of the male population of school-going age, 22\u00b76 per cent. were in the primary stage, and of the female 7\u00b78 per cent. Among Muhammadans the corresponding percentages were 105\u00b75 and 34\u00b77, far exceeding those in any other District. There were 308 schools for Panchamas, with 4,661 pupils. These are maintained principally by the missionary bodies.\nThe total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,90,000, of which Rs. 1,62,000 was derived from fees. Of the total, 58 per cent. was devoted to primary instruction.\n\nThe District possesses 10 hospitals and 20 dispensaries maintained from Local funds, with accommodation for 163 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 310,114, of whom 1,936 were in-patients, and 8,520 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 67,000, of which all but 6 per cent. was derived from Local and municipal funds. Of private institutions the most important is the Killock Home for Lepers, opened at R\u0101machandrapuram in 1900 by the Canadian Baptist Mission. It has now 70 inmates.\n\nDuring 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 35\u00b71 per 1,000 of the population, or slightly above the average for the Presidency. Vaccination is compulsory in the three municipalities and in ten of the Unions.\n\n[Further particulars will be found in the District Manual by H. Morris (1878), and the District Gazetteer (1906).]\n\nGod\u0101vari River.\u2014A great river of Southern India, which runs across the Deccan from the Western to the Eastern Gh\u0101ts; for sanctity, picturesque scenery, and utility to man, surpassed only by the Ganges and the Indus; total length about 900 miles; estimated area of drainage basin, 112,000 square miles. The source of the river is on the side of a hill behind the village of Trimbeak, in N\u0101sik District, Bombay, only about 50 miles from the shore of the Indian Ocean. At this spot is an artificial reservoir reached by a flight of 690 steps, into which the water trickles drop by drop from the lips of a carved image, shrouded by a canopy of stone. From first to last the general direction of the river is towards the south-east. It passes by N\u0101sik town, and then separates Ahmadnagar District from the State of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, its total course in the Bombay Presidency being about 100 miles. Above N\u0101sik it flows along a narrow rocky bed, but farther east the banks are lower and more earthy. Fifteen miles below N\u0101sik it receives, on the right, the D\u0101rna from the hills of Igatpuri, and 17 miles farther down, on the left, the K\u0101dva from Dindori. At the latter confluence, at Nander, the stream is dammed for irrigation. Near Nev\u0101sa it receives on the right bank the combined waters of the Pravara and Mula, which rise in the hills of Akola, near Harischandragarh.\n\nAfter passing the old town of Paithan on its left bank, the God\u0101vari now runs for a length of about 176 miles right across the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, receiving on its left bank the Purna, which flows in near Kararkher in Parbhani District, and on the right the M\u0101njra near Kondalw\u0101di in Nander, while near Dharm\u0101gar in the Chinn\u016br taluk of Adil\u0101b\u0101d District it receives, again on the right, the M\u0101ner. Below Sironch\u0101 it is joined by the Pranhita, conveying the united waters of the Wardha\nand Wainganga: and from this point it takes a marked south-easterly bend, and for about 100 miles divides Chanda District and the Bastar Feudatory State of the Central Provinces from the Karimnagar and Warangal Districts of Hyderabad. Thirty miles below the confluence of the Pranhita, the Godavari receives the Indravati river from Bastar State and lower down the Tal. The bed of the Godavari where it adjoins the Central Provinces is broad and sandy, from one to two miles in width, and broken by rocks at only two points, called the First and Second Barriers, each about 15 miles long. In 1854 it was proposed to remove these barriers, and a third one on the Pranhita, with the object of making a waterway from the cotton-growing Districts of Nagpur and Wardha to the sea; but in 1871, after very considerable sums had been expended, the project was finally abandoned as impracticable. One of the dams erected in connexion with this project still stands, with its locks and canal, at Dummagudem in the north of the Godavari District of Madras. Although the Godavari only skirts the Central Provinces, it is one of the most important rivers in their drainage system, as it receives through the Wardha and Wainganga the waters of a portion of the Satpura plateau and of the whole of the Nagpur plain.\n\nSome distance below Sironcha the Godavari leaves the Central Provinces behind, and for a while forms the boundary between the Godavari District of the Madras Presidency and the Hyderabad State; and in this part of its course it is joined on the left bank by a considerable tributary, the Sabari. Thence it flows to the sea through the centre of the old Godavari District, which has recently been divided, mainly by the course of the river, into the two Districts of Godavari and Kistna. At the beginning of its course along Madras territory, the river flows placidly through a flat and somewhat monotonous country, but shortly afterwards it begins to force its way through the Eastern Ghats and a sudden change takes place. The banks become wild and mountainous, the stream contracts, and at length the whole body of the river pours through a narrow and very deep passage known as 'the Gorge,' on either side of which the picturesque wooded slopes of the hills rise almost sheer from the dark water. Once through the hills, the river again opens out and forms a series of broad reaches dotted with low alluvial islands (laukas), which are famous for the tobacco they produce. The current here is nowhere rapid. At Rajahmundry, where the river is crossed by the East Coast line of the Madras Railway on a bridge more than 1\u00bd miles in length, it varies from 4 to 11 feet a second. In floods, however, the Godavari brings down an enormous volume of water, and embankments on both of its banks are necessary to prevent it from inundating the surrounding country.\n\nA few miles below Rajahmundry the river divides into two main\nstreams, the Gautami God\u0101v\u0101ri on the east and the Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha God\u0101v\u0101ri on the west, which run down to the sea through a wide alluvial delta formed in the course of ages by the masses of silt which the river has here deposited. It is in this delta that the waters of the God\u0101v\u0101ri are first utilized on any considerable scale for irrigation. At Dowlaiswheram, above the bifurcation, a great 'anicut' or dam has been thrown across the stream, and from this the whole delta area has been irrigated. See God\u0101v\u0101ri Canals.\n\nThe God\u0101v\u0101ri is navigable for small boats throughout the God\u0101v\u0101ri District. Vessels get round the anicut by means of the main canals, of which nearly 500 miles are also navigable, and which connect with the navigable canals of the Kistna delta to the south. Above the anicut there are several steamboats belonging to Government; but, as already observed, the attempts to utilize the Upper God\u0101v\u0101ri as an important waterway have proved a failure.\n\nThe coast of the God\u0101v\u0101ri delta was the scene of some of the earliest settlements of Europeans in India, the Dutch, the English, and the French having all established factories there. The channels of the river which led to these have now greatly silted up. The little French settlement of Yanam still remains, but the others\u2014Bandamurlanka, Injaram, Madapollam, and P\u0101lakollu now retain none of their former importance.\n\nThe peculiar sacredness of the God\u0101v\u0101ri is said to have been revealed by R\u0101ma himself to the rishi Gautama. The river is sometimes called God\u0101, and the sacred character especially attaches to the Gautami mouth. According to popular legend, it proceeds from the same source as the Ganges, by an underground passage; and this identity is preserved in the familiar name of Vriddha-Gang\u0101. But every part of its course is holy ground, and to bathe in its waters will wash away the blackest sin. The great bathing festival, called Pushkaram, celebrated in different years on the most sacred rivers of India, is held every twelfth year on the banks of the God\u0101v\u0101ri at R\u0101jahmundry. The spots most frequented by pilgrims are\u2014the source at Trimbak; the town of Bhadr\u0101chalam on the left bank, about 100 miles above R\u0101jahmundry, where stands an ancient temple of R\u0101machandra, surrounded by twenty-four smaller pagodas; R\u0101jahmundry itself; and the village of Kotipalli, on the left bank of the eastern mouth.\n\nGod\u0101v\u0101ri Canals.\u2014The head of the delta of the God\u0101v\u0101ri is at Dowlaiswheram, in God\u0101v\u0101ri District, Madras, 40 miles as the crow flies from the Bay of Bengal. At this point the river bifurcates into two main streams, the Gautami God\u0101v\u0101ri on the east and the Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha God\u0101v\u0101ri on the west, which flow through a wide fan-shaped area of alluvial soil, cutting it into three portions called respectively the Eastern, Western, and Central Deltas, the land in which falls gradually to the\nsea at the rate of about a foot a mile. Above the bifurcation a great masonry dam has been thrown across the main stream, and from this are led to the three deltas irrigation canals which branch and branch again so as to command every portion of them. The proposal thus to utilize the water of the river for irrigation was taken in hand by Sir Arthur (then Major) Cotton in 1845, and begun under his supervision in 1847. The work was practically completed in two years. It consists of a dam running straight across the river, composed of four sections, connected by islands in the bed of the stream, which are altogether 3,982 yards, or $2\\frac{1}{4}$ miles, in length. The dam is formed of two parallel walls, 42 feet apart from centre to centre, which are built on brick wells. The upper wall is 10 feet high and the lower 7 feet; and the intervening space is filled in with sand covered by a rubble masonry apron, 20 feet of which is horizontal and the remainder curved to meet the lower wall. The top of this apron is faced with cut stone, and along the crest are automatic iron shutters 2 feet high. Below the lower wall is a loose stone apron 150 to 250 feet wide.\n\nThree separate canal systems take off from this dam\u2014one on either flank and one in the centre for the Central Delta. Together, these supply water to 662,000 acres and comprise 493 miles of main canals, which are all navigable, and 1,929 miles of smaller distributary channels. The capital cost of all the delta works to the end of 1903-4 has been 135 lakhs, and the gross revenue in that year was 33 lakhs. Deducting working expenses, the net revenue due to the scheme returns a profit of between 17 and 18 per cent. on the capital outlay. Next to the dam, the most important engineering work in the system is the Gunnavaram aqueduct, which extends the irrigation and navigation systems of the Central Delta across a branch of the river called the Vainateyam God\u0101vari to the Nagaram island on the seaward face of the delta. Full particulars of the whole scheme will be found in Mr. G. T. Walch's Engineering Works of the God\u0101vari Delta (Madras, 1896).\n\nGodd\u0101 Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of the Sant\u0101l Parganas District, Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 30' and 25\u00b0 14' N. and 87\u00b0 3' and 87\u00b0 36' E., with an area of 967 square miles. The subdivision comprises two distinct portions: to the west and south is a hilly country with rolling uplands covered with rock and jungle, and to the east is an alluvial plain of great natural fertility. Its population in 1901 was 399,323, compared with 384,971 in 1891. It contains 1,274 villages, one of which, Godd\u0101, is the head-quarters; but no town. In the east the subdivision, which has a density of 404 persons per square mile, contains part of the sparsely inhabited D\u0101man-i-koh Government estate, but the Mah\u0101gam\u0101 and Godd\u0101 th\u0101nas to the west form one of the most fertile and densely populated tracts in the District.\n\nGodd\u0101 Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same\nname in the Sant\u0101l Parganas District, Bengal, situated in $24^\\circ 50'$ N. and $87^\\circ 17'$ E. Population (1901), 2,208.\n\n**Godhra Taluka.**\u2014Northern taluka of the western portion of Panch Mah\u0101ls District, Bombay, lying between $22^\\circ 42'$ and $23^\\circ 6'$ N. and $73^\\circ 22'$ and $73^\\circ 58'$ E., with an area of 585 square miles. It has one town, Godhra (population, 20,915), the head-quarters; and 225 villages. The population in 1901 was 96,406, compared with 107,567 in 1891, the decrease being due to famine. The density, 165 persons per square mile, is nearly equal to the District average. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 92,000. The taluka is chiefly a roughly tilled plain, covered with brushwood and forest; but to the north its surface is broken by patches and peaks of granite rock. The westerly portion is well wooded and well tilled. The climate is unhealthy. The annual rainfall averages 40 inches. The Mahi and the P\u0101nam flow through the taluka. Maize is the staple of cultivation.\n\n**Godhra Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Panch Mah\u0101ls District, Bombay, and also head-quarters of the District, situated in $22^\\circ 46'$ N. and $73^\\circ 37'$ E., on the Godhra-Ratlam Railway, 319 miles from Bombay. Population (1901), 20,915; Hindus number 10,028, Muhammadans 10,083, and Jains 635. Formerly it was the residence of a provincial governor under the Muhammadan kings of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d. Godhra is now the head quarters of the Rew\u0101 K\u0101ntha Political Agency, which was transferred from Baroda to the Collector of the Panch Mah\u0101ls in 1880. The Godhra municipality, constituted in 1876, had an average income of Rs. 19,000 during the decade ending 1901. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 20,104. There are two tanneries doing a moderate business. Godhra is the centre of the trade in timber and firewood extracted from the forests of the District and neighbouring States, and exported to the rest of Gujar\u0101t. Near the town is an embanked lake 70 acres in area. The town contains a Sub-Judge's court, a civil hospital, and an English high school with 154 pupils; also 5 vernacular schools for boys and 2 for girls, with 194 and 315 pupils respectively.\n\n**Godn\u0101.**\u2014Town in S\u0101ran District, Bengal. See Revelganj.\n\n**Gogha.**\u2014Town in the Dhandhuka taluka of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d District, Bombay, situated in $21^\\circ 41'$ N. and $72^\\circ 17'$ E., in the peninsula of Kathiaw\u0101r, on the Gulf of Cambay, 193 miles north-west of Bombay City. Population (1901), 4,798. About three-quarters of a mile east of the town is an excellent anchorage, in some measure sheltered by the island of Piram, which lies still farther east. It appears to have been known as the port of Gundigar in the days of the Vallabhi kingdom, and was mentioned by Friar Jordanus in 1321 as Caga. The natives of this town are reckoned the best sailors or lascars in India; and ships touching here may procure water and supplies, or repair\ndamages. The roadstead is a safe refuge during the south-west monsoon, or for vessels that have parted from their anchors in the Surat roads, the bottom being a uniform bed of mud, and the water always smooth. There is a lighthouse on the south side of the entrance, visible for 10 miles. When the Dutch raised Surat to be the chief port of Gujar\u0101t, the Cambay ports were more or less injured. Gogha has of late years lost its commercial importance. During the American Civil War it was one of the chief cotton marts of K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. It is now deserted, its cotton-presses idle, and its great storehouses ruinous and empty. Its rival, Bhaunagar, is 11 miles nearer to the cotton districts, and has the advantage of railway communication. North of the town is a black salt marsh, extending to the Bhaunagar creek. On the other sides undulating cultivated land slopes to the range of hills, 12 miles off. South of the town is another salt marsh. The land in the neighbourhood is inundated at high spring-tides, which renders it necessary to bring fresh water from a distance of a mile. The town contains a Sub-Judge's court, a dispensary, and four boys' schools, of which one is an English middle school with 18 pupils and three are vernacular schools with 230 pupils, including one girl. The municipality, established in 1855, had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 4,000. In 1903-4 its income was Rs. 5,800. The sea-borne trade of Gogha in 1903-4 was valued at Rs. 1,87,000: exports, Rs. 81,000; imports, Rs. 1,06,000.\n\n**Gogr\u0101 (Gh\u0101gra; Skt. gharghara = 'rattling' or 'laughter'; other names, Sarj\u016b or Saray\u016b (the Sarabos of Ptolemy), and in the lower part of its course Deoh\u0101 or Dehw\u0101).\u2014The great river of Oudh. Rising in Tibet (30\u00b0 40' N. and 80\u00b0 48' E.), it flows through Nep\u0101l under the name Karn\u0101li or Kauri\u0101la, piercing the Him\u0101layas at Shish\u0101 P\u0101ni, and shortly after throws off a branch to the east called the Girw\u0101, which now brings down the main stream. The Kauri\u0101la enters British territory between Kher\u012b and Bahraich, and forms the boundary between those Districts. It receives the Girw\u0101 not many miles from the border, and just below this the Suheli, one of the three branches of the S\u0101rd\u0101. The main branch of the S\u0101rd\u0101, called Dah\u0101war, joins it at Mall\u0101npur, a few miles below Katai Gh\u0101t, near which place the Sarj\u016b is received. The Sarj\u016b formerly joined the Gogr\u0101 in Gond\u0101, but early in the nineteenth century a European timber merchant diverted its course into an old bed. At Bahr\u0101mgh\u0101t a third branch of the S\u0101rd\u0101, named Chauk\u0101, adds to its volume, and from this point the united stream is regularly called Gogr\u0101 or Sarj\u016b, though these names are sometimes applied at Mall\u0101npur. From the name Sarj\u016b is derived the appellation of an important tribe of Br\u0101hmans called Sarwaria, a contraction of Sarj\u016bp\u0101ria, meaning those who 'dwell beyond' (i.e. on the north side of) the Sarj\u016b. The Gogr\u0101 now turns east and divides Gond\u0101 on its north bank from\nB\u0101ra Banki and Fyz\u0101b\u0101d on the south. After passing Ajodhy\u0101 city, it separates Bast\u012b and Gorakhpur from Fyz\u0101b\u0101d, and then from Azamgarh and Balli\u0101, and receives the R\u0101pt\u012b and Little Gandak from the north. After being joined by the Chauk\u0101 it receives little drainage from the right bank, and is in fact higher than the valley of the Gumti which lies south of it. In Azamgarh a branch is given off, called the Chhot\u012b ('lesser') Sarj\u016b, which was apparently an old bed of the river, and joins the Ganges after a long course through Azamgarh, Gh\u0101zipur, and Balli\u0101. East of Gorakhpur District the Gogr\u0101 forms the boundary between S\u0101ran District of Bengal and Balli\u0101 District of the United Provinces for about 40 miles. It falls into the Ganges in $25^\\circ 44' N.$ and $84^\\circ 42' E.$\n\nThe Kauri\u0101la and Girw\u0101 are both navigable for a short distance before entering British territory; and until the opening of the Bengal and North-Western Railway, within the last twenty years, trade on the Gogr\u0101 was of great importance. Many years ago a pilot service existed for a short time, and steamers plied as far as Bahr\u0101mgh\u0101t in B\u0101ra Banki District. The traffic is still considerable, and large quantities of timber, grain, and spices come down from Nep\u0101l, or are carried in the lower reaches. At Bahr\u0101mgh\u0101t saw-mills used to be worked by the Forest department, but have recently been sold. The most important place on the banks of the river is Fyz\u0101b\u0101d, with Ajodhy\u0101, the sacred birthplace of R\u0101ma, adjoining it. T\u0101nd\u0101 in Fyz\u0101b\u0101d and Barhaj in Gorakhpur are also towns of some size, engaged in trade. The chief mart on the banks of the Gogra in Bengal is Revelganj in S\u0101ran District. The trade of Naw\u0101bganj in Gond\u0101, which stands some miles from the river, is now largely carried by rail. River steamers from Patna ply as high as Ajodhy\u0101, calling at many places and competing with the railways for both goods and passenger traffic.\n\nThe river is spanned by two fine railway bridges: the Elgin Bridge near Bahr\u0101mgh\u0101t (3,695 feet long), and a bridge at Turtip\u0101r (3,912 feet). The variability of its course is shown by the method of construction of the first-named bridge, which was built on dry land, the river being then trained under it. The height above sea-level is 350 feet at Bahr\u0101mgh\u0101t and 193 feet at Turtip\u0101r; and the flood discharges are 877,000 and 1,111,000 cubic feet per second respectively. At Ajodhy\u0101 a bridge of boats is maintained, except during the rains, when a steamer plies. Another important ferry is at Dohrigh\u0101t on the road from Azamgarh to Gorakhpur.\n\nGog\u016bnda.\u2014Chief town of an estate of the same name in the State of Udaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $24^\\circ 46' N.$ and $73^\\circ 32' E.$, in the Ar\u0101valli Hills, 2,757 feet above the sea, about 16 miles north-west of Udaipur city. Population (1901), 2,463. The estate, which consists of 75 villages, is held by one of the first-class nobles of Mew\u0101r, who is styled R\u0101j. He is a Jh\u0101la R\u0101jput and descended from the Delwara\nhouse. The income of the estate is about Rs. 24,000, and a tribute of Rs. 2,040 is paid to the Darb\u0101r.\n\n**Gohad.**\u2014Town in the Tonwargh\u0101r district of Gwalior State, Central India, situated in 26\u00b0 26' N. and 78\u00b0 27' E. Population (1901), 5,343. The town dates from the beginning of the eighteenth century, when it was seized by the Jat family whose descendants now rule at Dholpur. From 1707 to 1739, however, it was held by the Bhadauria Rajputs, but was recovered by R\u0101n\u0101 Bh\u012bm Singh in the latter year. The R\u0101n\u0101 in 1779 concluded a treaty with the British by which he was confirmed in possession of this place, while by the fourth article of the Treaty of S\u0101lbai Sindhia was bound not to molest him. The R\u0101n\u0101, however, soon failed in carrying out the terms of his treaty; and on the withdrawal of our support Gohad was seized by Mah\u0101dji Sindhia in 1784. Sindhia placed Amb\u0101j\u012b Inglia in charge, who in 1803 concluded a treaty, without reference to Sindhia, surrendering Gohad to the British. The Treaty of Sarji Anjangaon with Sindhia in the same year left it uncertain whether Gohad should be restored to Sindhia, and it was made over to the R\u0101n\u0101 in 1804. Lord Cornwallis, on succeeding as Governor-General in 1805, reversed this policy and, under a treaty concluded in that year, withdrew his support of the R\u0101n\u0101. Sindhia at once seized the fort, which has since remained a part of Gwalior.\n\nThe town stands on the right bank of the Vaisali river, a tributary of the Sind, and is surrounded by three walls, within the innermost of which stands a massive fort. The latter was built by the Jat chief R\u0101n\u0101 Bh\u012bm Singh in 1739, and contains a large palace built by R\u0101n\u0101 Chhatrapati Singh, now used as an office, and several other buildings, all profusely covered with carving, which is, however, of no great merit. To the south of the palace is a large tank, the Lachman T\u0101l, with a small temple in the centre. A school, a resthouse, and a police station are situated in the town.\n\n**Goh\u0101na Tahsil.**\u2014Tahsil of Rohtak District, Punjab, lying between 28\u00b0 57' and 29\u00b0 17' N. and 76\u00b0 29' and 76\u00b0 52' E., with an area of 336 square miles. The population in 1901 was 147,295, compared with 138,555 in 1891. It contains the three towns of Goh\u0101na (population, 6,567), its head-quarters, Barauda (5,836), and But\u0101na (7,509); and 78 villages, including Mundl\u0101na (5,657). The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 2.6 lakhs. The tahsil is flat and well wooded, and ample means of irrigation are available.\n\n**Goh\u0101na Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Rohtak District, Punjab, situated in 29\u00b0 8' N. and 76\u00b0 42' E., on the Western Jumna Canal, 20 miles north of Rohtak town. Population (1901), 6,567. The town is said to have been the site of a fort belonging to Prithwi R\u0101j, afterwards destroyed by Muhammad of Ghor. A yearly fair is held here at the shrine of Sh\u0101h Zia-ud-din Muhammad.\na saint who accompanied Muhammad of Ghori to India. There are also two temples in honour of the Jain Arhat Parasnath, at which an annual festival takes place. The municipality was created in 1873. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 9,300, and the expenditure Rs. 9,500. The income in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 8,300, chiefly derived from octroi, and the expenditure to Rs. 8,200. The town is of no commercial importance. The municipality maintains a dispensary and an Anglo-veracular middle school.\n\nGohelwar (Gohilwad). Prant or division of Kathiawar, Bombay. It takes its name from the Gohel Rajputs who own the greater part, and includes, among others, the chiefships of Bhaunagar and Palitana. It lies along the Gulf of Cambay, with an area of 4,210 square miles. The population in 1901 was 581,079. The revenue in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 55,27,787.\n\nGohn\u0101 (Gaun\u0101).\u2014A lake of recent formation situated near the small village of the same name in the Garhwal District of the United Provinces, in 30\u00b0 22' N. and 79\u00b0 29' E. Towards the end of the rains in 1893 two landslips took place on the right bank of the Birahi Ganga, a tributary of the Alaknand\u0101 (see Ganges). The side of a steep hill, towering 4,000 feet above the level of the stream, crashed down into the valley, hurling large blocks of limestone against the opposite cliff to the distance of a mile in places, and forming a dam more than two miles long at the base and one-third of a mile along the top, which completely blocked the valley to a height of 850 to 900 feet. It has been estimated that the dam contained 9 billion cubic feet of dolomite and detritus, weighing 800 million tons. Special arrangements were successfully made to avoid the damage to life and property to be expected when the water should reach the top of this dam and commence to cut it away. The pilgrim road to the shrines in the Upper Himalayas lies close along the line of escape, and bridges were dismantled and diversions constructed. At Hardwar it was necessary to protect the head-works of the Ganges Canal. In December, 1893, the area of the lake was about one square mile and its depth 450 feet. By July, 1894, the lake had become a large sheet of water, nearly 4 miles long and half a mile broad, and the level of the water had risen nearly 170 feet, while percolation was freely taking place. A month later the water was rising about 4 feet a day, and on the morning of August 25 water began to trickle over the dam, which was rapidly cut away. It was found next day that the level of the lake had fallen 390 feet, leaving a stretch of water 3,900 yards long with an average breadth of 400 yards. The depth near the dam was 300 feet, and the bed had already silted up about 85 feet. Immediately below the dam the flood rose 280 feet, but its height rapidly decreased as the channels of the rivers which carried it off widened. At Rudraprayag, 51 miles away, the rise was\n140 feet; at Beasghat, 99 miles, 88 feet; and at Hardwar, 149 miles, only 11 or 12 feet. The total damage caused to public property was valued at more than Rs. 95,000, but no lives were lost except those of five persons who insisted on remaining just below the dam. At Hardwar the head-works of the Ganges Canal were slightly damaged, but beyond this point the flood had no appreciable effect. The outlet of the lake now appears to have a stable bed.\n\n[Selections from Records, Government of India, Public Works Department, No. CCCXXIV.]\n\nGojra.\u2014Town in the Toba Tek Singh tahsil of the new Lyallpur District, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 9' N. and 72\u00b0 42' E., 20 miles north of the tahsil head-quarters. Population (1906), 2,589. The business done in this rising mart on the railway, which has sprung into existence in the last six years owing to the extension of the Chenab Canal to the surrounding country, bids fair to rival in importance that of Lyallpur itself. The town contains two cotton-ginning factories, one cotton-press, one combined ginning and pressing factory, and one combined ginning factory and flour-mill. The total number of hands employed in 1904 was 250. It is administered as a 'notified area.'\n\nGokak Taluka.\u2014Eastern taluka of Belgaum District, Bombay, lying between 15\u00b0 57' and 16\u00b0 30' N. and 74\u00b0 38' and 75\u00b0 18' E., with an area of 671 square miles. It contains one town, Gokak (population, 9,860), the head-quarters; and 113 villages, including Konnur (5,667). The population in 1901 was 116,127, compared with 118,556 in 1891. The density, 173 persons per square mile, is below the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 1.5 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 13,000. Gokak has the worst climate in Belgaum, being malarious during the cold months and oppressive during the hot season. In the monsoon, however, it is pleasant, and free from the excessive rains of Belgaum town, the average fall being 25 inches. The sandstone hills in Gokak intercept the monsoon showers from the west, rendering the plain beyond especially liable to drought. The two sections of the Gokak Canal irrigate about 28 square miles. The source of supply is from the Ghatprabha river, on which are situated the famous Gokak Falls.\n\nGokak Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Belgaum District, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 10' N. and 74\u00b0 49' E., 8 miles from Gokak Road station on the Southern Mahratta Railway. Population (1901), 9,860. The town was formerly the seat of a large dyeing and weaving industry, not yet extinct, and was also known for its manufacture of toys representing figures and fruits, made of light wood and of a particular earth found in the neighbourhood. The municipality, established in 1853, had an average income of Rs. 12,500 during the decade ending 1901. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 8,500.\nA fort, standing on an isolated peak behind the town, is said to have been built by one of the Adil Shahi Sultans of Bijapur. The earliest mention of Gokak is probably as Gokage, which occurs in an inscription dated 1047. In 1685 the town was the head-quarters of a district or sarkar. Between 1717 and 1754 it fell to the Nawabs of Savanur, who built the mosque and Ganji Khana. In 1836, on the death of Govind Rao Patvardhan, the town and taluka lapsed to the British. The town contains a Subordinate Judge's court, a dispensary, a municipal English school, and five other schools with 427 pupils, of which one with 25 pupils is a girls' school.\n\nAbout 3\u00bd miles north-west of Gokak town and 3 miles from Dhupdal station on the Southern Mahratta Railway are the Gokak Falls, where the Ghatprabha takes a mighty leap of 170 feet over a sandstone cliff into a picturesque gorge. In the monsoon the falls well repay a visit. On the right bank of the river close to the falls is a cotton-mill, established in 1887. The mill employs daily 2,038 hands, and produces annually 17,000,000 lb. of yarn and 2,000,000 lb. of cloth. To supply motive power, as well as for irrigation purposes, the Gokak storage works were constructed in 1889-1902, whereby 907,000,000 cubic feet of water are impounded. The cost of the works was 17 lakhs.\n\nGokalpura.\u2014Petty State in Mahi Kantha, Bombay.\n\nGokarn.\u2014Town in the Kunta taluka of North Kanara District, Bombay, situated in 14\u00b0 32' N. and 74\u00b0 19' E., 10 miles north of Kunta town. Population (1901), 4,834. Gokarn is a place of pilgrimage frequented by Hindu devotees from all parts of India, especially by wandering pilgrims and ascetics who go round the principal shrines of the country. The Mahabaleshwar temple here is built in the Dravidian style, and is famed as containing a fragment of the original lingam given to Ravana by Siva\u2014one of the twelve famous lingams of all India. Upwards of a hundred lamps are kept perpetually alight from funds supplied by devotees. A fair is held annually in February, at which from 2,000 to 8,000 people assemble. Gokarn is mentioned in both the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The municipality, established in 1870, had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 1,300. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 1,600. Besides the great temple of Mahabaleshwar, twenty smaller shrines, thirty lingams, and thirty holy bathing-places are held in special reverence by Smartas and Lingayats.\n\nGola.\u2014Town in the Bansgaon taluk of Gorakhpur District, United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 21' N. and 83\u00b0 27' E., on the left bank of the Gogra. Population (1901), 4,944. The town is one of the most important in the south of the District, but its trade has suffered from the competition of Barhaj, which is now on the railway. Potatoes\nare largely cultivated in the neighbourhood. Gol\u0101 is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,200. It contains a town school with 112 pupils, and a girls' school with 22.\n\n**Gol\u0101.** Town in the Muhamdi tahsil of Kheri District, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 5' N. and 86\u00b0 28' E., on the Lucknow-Bareilly State Railway. Population (1901), 4,913. The place is of great antiquity, and carvings and terra-cotta figures of Buddhist types have been found in the neighbourhood. It is picturesquely situated near a sal forest. To the east lies the celebrated temple of Gokaran\u0101th, round which are situated many smaller temples, dharmas\u0101las, and monasteries inhabited by gosains. The temple is esteemed one of the most sacred in the whole of Oudh, and contains a lingam, of which several tales are told. It is said to have been brought by R\u0101vana, king of Ceylon. Aurangzeb attempted to pull it up with chains and elephants; but flames burst forth, and the emperor was induced to endow the shrine. Gol\u0101 is one of the chief trading centres in the District, and grain and sugar are exported in considerable quantities. The town contains a branch of the American Methodist Mission, a dispensary, and a school with 90 pupils.\n\n**Gol\u0101gh\u0101t Subdivision.**\u2014The most westerly subdivision of Sibs\u0101gar District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 25\u00b0 49' and 26\u00b0 55' N. and 93\u00b0 3' and 94\u00b0 11' E., with an area of 3,015 square miles. The eastern portion is a level plain, which supports over 200 persons per square mile. Rice is grown on the low land, and tea and sugar-cane on land which is too high for rice. West of Gol\u0101gh\u0101t town there is comparatively little population. The upper valley of the Dhansiri is for the most part covered with dense jungle, and north of this river lie the forest-clad Mikir Hills. The density for the whole subdivision is thus only 55 persons per square mile, compared with 120 for the District as a whole. The population in 1901 was 167,068, or nearly 20 per cent. more than in 1891 (139,203). The subdivision contains one town, Gol\u0101gh\u0101t (population, 2,359); the head-quarters; and 792 villages. The annual rainfall at Gol\u0101gh\u0101t averages 82 inches, but at Dimapur, on the southern border, less than 60 inches. The tea industry has contributed to the development of the subdivision. In 1904 there were 47 gardens, with 20,324 acres under plant, which gave employment to 15 Europeans and 23,883 natives. In the Mikir Hills and the Dhansiri valley are extensive forest Reserves, which in 1903-4 covered an area of 780 square miles. The assessment for land revenue and local rates in 1903-4 was Rs. 4,18,000.\n\n**Gol\u0101gh\u0101t Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Sibs\u0101gar District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 26\u00b0 31' N. and 93\u00b0 59' E., on the right bank of the Dhansiri river. The town had a population in 1901 of 2,359, and is administered as\na Union under (Bengal) Act V of 1876, the expenditure in 1903-4 amounting to about Rs. 6,000. There is a flourishing bazar, the principal shops in which are owned by M\u0101rw\u0101ri merchants, who do a large business with the tea gardens in the neighbourhood. The chief articles of export are cotton, which is brought down by the N\u0101g\u0101s, mustard seed, and molasses. The chief imports are cotton piece-goods, grain and pulse, kerosene and other oils, and salt. During the rains feeder steamers come up the Dhansiri as far as Gol\u0101gh\u0101t, but in the dry season the nearest steamer gh\u0101t is at Shikar\u012bgh\u0101t, 18 miles away. The nearest railway station is at Kamarband Ali, about 8 miles south of the town. The Subdivisional Officer is almost invariably a European. Besides the usual offices, Gol\u0101gh\u0101t has a small jail, a dispensary with fourteen beds, and a high school under private management.\n\nGolconda.\u2014Fortress and ruined city in the Atr\u0101f-i-balda District of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 17\u00b0 23' N. and 78\u00b0 24' E., 5 miles west of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d city. The fort was originally constructed by the R\u0101j\u0101 of Warangal, who ceded it in 1364, together with its dependencies, to Muhammad Sh\u0101h Bahmani of Gulburga. For a time it was known as Muhammadnagar. In 1512 the place passed from the Bahmanis to the Kutb Sh\u0101his, who had their capital here till the foundation of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. In 1687 the city was taken by Aurangzeb after a siege of eight months, and the last of the Kutb Sh\u0101his was deported to Daulat\u0101b\u0101d. The fortress, which is situated on a rocky ridge of granite, is extensive, and contains many enclosures. It is surrounded by a strong crenellated stone wall, over 3 miles in circumference, with 87 bastions at the angles; some of these still contain large pieces of ordnance bearing Persian inscriptions. Inside the walls are ruins of numerous palaces, mosques, and dwellings, scattered everywhere, while the citadel or b\u0101l\u0101 his\u0101r is in good preservation. There are eight gates to the fort, of which four are now in use. The moat which surrounds the fort is choked with rubbish in most places. About half a mile to the north of the fort are the tombs of the Kutb Sh\u0101hi kings. These buildings, though constructed of granite, have suffered from the ravages of time and the damage done by the siege guns of Aurangzeb, while the enamelled tiles which once adorned them have been stolen. In shape the tombs are oblong or square, the lower portion being an arcade of pointed arches on a raised terrace, and the whole crowned by a dome. The actual sarcophagus is usually of black basalt or greenstone, beautifully carved. Golconda is now garrisoned by a few Arabs and by the Golconda Brigade, consisting of a battery and one regiment each of cavalry and infantry. The river M\u016bs\u012b flows south of the fort. In English literature Golconda has given its name to the diamonds which were found at many places within the dominions of the Kutb Sh\u0101hi dynasty.\nThere are no diamond mines within the immediate neighbourhood of Golconda itself.\n\n**Gold Fields.**\u2014Municipal area in Kol\u0101r District, Mysore. *See Kol\u0101r Gold Fields.*\n\n**Goler.**\u2014Estate in the Dera tahsil of Kangra District, Punjab, with an area of 25 square miles. Legend says that Hari Chand, the Katoch R\u0101j\u0101 of Kangra, fell into a dry well when hunting. He was missed by his companions, and believed to have been killed, so his heir was proclaimed king. When rescued from the well Hari Chand could not reclaim his throne, but he founded Haripur as the capital of a separate principality, called Goler. Under Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, R\u0101j\u0101 R\u016bp Chand was employed in subduing a Katoch rebellion; and under Akbar, Kunwar M\u0101n Singh and his son Jagat Singh played a great part, the fief of Kabul being bestowed on the former in 1585. Under the Sikhs, R\u0101j\u0101 Bh\u016bp Singh was at first an ally of Ranjit Singh against the Katoch kings, but in 1812 his territory was confiscated. On the British annexation, his son, Shamsher Singh, obtained a j\u0101g\u012br of 20 villages. This grant is now held by his nephew, R\u0101j\u0101 Raghun\u0101th Singh, and its revenue amounts to about Rs. 26,000.\n\n**Golconda.**\u2014T\u0101luk in the south-west of Vizagapatam District, Madras, lying between 17\u00b0 22' and 18\u00b0 4' N. and 82\u00b0 and 82\u00b0 50' E., with an area of 1,263 square miles (of which 738 square miles are in the Agency tract). The population in 1901 included 123,507 persons in the ordinary and 33,929 in the Agency tract; total, 157,436, compared with 147,841 in 1891. The head-quarters are at Narasapatanam (population, 10,589), and there are 517 villages. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,02,000. The Agency part of the t\u0101luk is exceedingly hilly and is situated on both slopes of the Gh\u0101ts, the drainage of the northern part passing into the Machkund river and thence to the God\u0101vari. The hills are, as a rule, covered with fine forests, and considerable areas of these (about 260 square miles) have been 'reserved,' forming the most important of the Government forests in the District. The t\u0101luk was one of the sixteen ancient zamind\u0101ris which existed in Vizagapatam at the time of the permanent settlement, the zamind\u0101r being a relation and feudatory of the Jeypore R\u0101j\u0101; but disturbances arose caused by the incapacity of the zamind\u0101r, and in 1837 the estate was sold at auction for arrears of revenue and bought in by Government. To it were added the Kottakota and Vemulap\u016bdi estates, which had been similarly purchased by Government in 1833 and 1831, and this tract forms the ryotw\u0101ri portion of the t\u0101luk; the southern part is still zamind\u0101ri. In 1845-8, and again in 1857-8, extensive risings took place among the hill chiefs, but since 1858 no trouble has occurred. The eastern part of the plains portion of the t\u0101luk is under continuous cultivation, irrigated from\nthe Komaravolu Ava lying on the V\u012bravilli tahsil boundary. From Kondasantha and Krishnadevipeta, gh\u0101t roads run up into the hills, and along the latter there is considerable traffic in jungle produce, grain, and salt.\n\nGomal.\u2014River and mountain pass in the South Wazirist\u0101n Agency, North-West Frontier Province. See Gumal.\n\nGond.\u2014Tribe in Central Provinces. See Gondw\u0101na.\n\nGond\u0101 District.\u2014North-eastern District of the Fyz\u0101b\u0101d Division, United Provinces, lying between $26^\\circ 46'$ and $27^\\circ 50'$ N. and $81^\\circ 33'$ and $82^\\circ 46'$ E., with an area of 2,813 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the lower range of the Him\u0101layas, separating it from Nep\u0101l; on the east by Basti; on the south by the Gogra, which divides it from Fyz\u0101b\u0101d and B\u0101ra Bank\u012b; and on the west by Bahraich. The District forms a level plain with slight inequalities, and is well wooded. During the fine clear months at the end of the rainy season the range of the Him\u0101layas, with the snowy peak of Dhaul\u0101giri in the centre, forms a magnificent background to the north. The people live in small hamlets scattered about the village lands. There are three natural divisions. In the north is situated a moist tract of tarai land extending a little south of the R\u0101pt\u012b. The centre forms a level upland area or \u0101parh\u0101r, and south of it lies a broad low tract extending to the alluvial soil in the bed of the Gogra. The Gogra and R\u0101pt\u012b, the principal streams, flow from north-west to south-east. In the tarai a number of small streams flow from north to south to meet the B\u016brh\u012b (or 'old') R\u0101pt\u012b. The remaining rivers have a course from north-west to south-east, and are, in order: the Suw\u0101wan, Kuw\u0101n\u0101, Bis\u016bhi, Chammai, Manw\u0101r, Tirhi, and Sarj\u016b or Suheli. Most of these are only small streams in the hot season. The whole District is studded with small shallow lakes or jhils, the water of which is largely used for irrigation.\n\nIn the north limestone boulders are found in the beds of the torrents rushing down from the Outer Him\u0101layas. Elsewhere the formation is the ordinary alluvium, which in places contains calcareous limestone or kankar.\n\nForests are 'reserved' in the north of the District and in a small area in the centre. There is also a large tract of forest on the banks of the Kuw\u0101n\u0101, which is private property. These contain s\u0101l (Shorea robusta), asna (Terminalia tomentosa), dhau (Anogeissus latifolia), khair (Acacia Catechu), &c. Mango, mahua (Bassia latifolia), shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo), and various kinds of fig are the commonest trees in other parts.\n\nTigers and bears are found in the northern forests, and leopards are common there and are occasionally met with farther south. Several\nkinds of deer are found, and antelope, m\u0101gai, wolves, and jackals are common. Snipe, water-fowl, jungle-fowl, pea fowl, quail, partridges, and ortolans are the chief game-birds. Fish abound in the rivers and lakes, and crocodiles are also common.\n\nThe damp submontane tract is very unhealthy, and fever is also prevalent in all parts of the District. The proximity of the mountains and the heavy rainfall make the climate comparatively cool, the average monthly temperature ranging from about $62^\\circ$ in January to $91^\\circ$ in May.\n\nThe annual rainfall over the whole District averages 44 inches, ranging from 51 in the north to 40 in the south. Extreme fluctuations occur from year to year; the fall amounted to 75 inches in 1894 and to only 22 inches in 1874. In 1901 nearly 17 inches of rain fell in twenty-four hours at Tarabganj, one of the heaviest falls ever recorded in the plains of the United Provinces.\n\nThe District formed part of the great kingdom of Kosala, ruled over by the kings of the Solar race from Ajodhya. At the death of R\u0101ma the northern portion fell to his son, Lava, with the capital city of Sravast\u012b, which is identified by some writers with Set Mahet. Ancient remains show that many sites were inhabited during the palmy days of Buddhism: but when the Chinese pilgrims visited the holy places in the fifth and seventh centuries the country had relapsed into jungle. Many traditions are related of the young warrior of Isl\u0101m, Saiyid S\u0101l\u0101r, who died fighting the chiefs of this tract near Bahraich, and many tombs are pointed out as those of his warriors. The history during the Muhammadan period is chiefly that of the varying fortunes of the R\u0101jput clans who seized it from the Doms. The Muhammadan governor resided at Bahraich, but often had no authority outside his own fort. The rise of the Rajputs, according to their own traditions, dates from the fourteenth century. The Kalhans clan was the first to attain importance: but it fell at the end of the fifteenth century, owing to the curse of a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, whose daughter had been carried off by the R\u0101ja. The Janw\u0101rs spread over the north of the District, and finally the Bisens acquired a great territory covering 1,000 square miles. When Oudh was granted to Sa\u0101dat Kh\u0101n early in the eighteenth century, the local R\u0101j\u0101s north of the Gogra were virtually independent. The R\u0101ja of Gond\u0101 slew Naw\u0101b Al\u0101wal Kh\u0101n, the first of the new governors of Bahraich, but was later so far conquered that he undertook to pay a fixed tribute. It was not, however, till the close of the eighteenth century that the Oudh government was able to break up the Bisen power and to collect revenue direct from the village headmen. The chiefs in the north and east of the District retained a partial independence still longer. Gond\u0101 suffered much from misrule in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, during which several great talukas were\nacquired by bankers and officials. Annexation in 1856 passed off quietly; but Colonel Boileau, the Deputy-Commissioner, lost his life in attempting to arrest a notorious freebooter.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Mutiny, the R\u0101j\u0101 of Gond\u0101 threw in his lot with the rebels and joined the standard of the Begam of Oudh at Lucknow. The R\u0101j\u0101 of Balr\u0101mpur remained loyal throughout. He steadily declined to recognize the rebel government, received and protected Sir C. Wingfield, the Commissioner of Gond\u0101 and Bahraich, together with other English officers in his fort, and afterwards forwarded them safely under a strong escort to Gorakhpur. The R\u0101j\u0101 of Gond\u0101, after the relief of Lucknow, fixed his camp at Lampti on the Channai river, with a force said to amount to 20,000 men, who were, however, dispirited at the English successes elsewhere. After only a feeble resistance the broken remnants of his force were swept across the R\u0101pti and over the lower range of the Him\u0101layas into Nep\u0101l. Most of the rebel tahsild\u0101rs accepted the amnesty; but neither the R\u0101j\u0101 of Gond\u0101 nor the R\u0101n\u012b of Tulsipur could be induced to surrender (although the conduct of the former throughout the Mutiny had been free from overt crime), and their estates were accordingly confiscated and conferred as rewards upon Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101s Sir Drigbijai Singh of Balr\u0101mpur and Sir M\u0101n Singh of Ajodhy\u0101.\n\nSet Mahet is the only site which has been excavated; but ruins are known to exist at many other places, among which may be named B\u0101nsdil\u0101, Paltipur, Lodh\u0101 Dih, Ray\u0101-ke-th\u0101n, and Par\u0101s. There are no striking buildings of the Muhammadan period. The chief Hindu shrines are at De\u0113\u012b P\u0101tan and Chhapi\u0101.\n\nThe District contains 8 towns and 2,760 villages. At the last four enumerations the numbers were as follows: (1869) 1,168,462, (1881) 1,270,926, (1891) 1,459,229, and (1901) 1,403,195.\n\nThere are three tahsils\u2014Gond\u0101, Tarabganj, and Utraula\u2014each named from its head-quarters. The principal towns are the municipalities of Balr\u0101mpur and Gond\u0101, and the 'notified areas' of Nawabganj and Utraula. The following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Gond\u0101      | 619                  | 3               | 784      | 384,921    | 620                       | - 5.0                                                        | 12,369                                 |\n| Tarabganj  | 627                  | 3               | 546      | 364,993    | 582                       | - 2.3                                                        | 16,884                                 |\n| Utraula    | 1,567                | 2               | 1,430    | 654,181    | 417                       | - 2.5                                                        | 14,892                                 |\n| District total | 2,813              | 8               | 2,760    | 1,403,195  | 499                       | - 3.8                                                        | 43,745                                 |\nHindus number nearly 85 per cent. of the total, and Muhammadans 15 per cent. The District is thickly populated, except in the north, where there is a large area of forest. The decrease between 1891 and 1901 was chiefly due to the effects of excessive rain in 1894, and to a smaller extent to the drought of 1896. Many emigrants go from Gond\u0101 to the West Indies, Fiji, and Natal. Eastern Hindi of the Awadh\u012b dialect is spoken almost universally.\n\nBr\u0101hmans are the most numerous of the Hind\u016b castes, numbering about 214,000, or 18 per cent. of the total. Other castes found in large numbers are the Ahirs (graziers and cultivators), 140,000; Koris (weavers and labourers), 126,000; Kurmis (agriculturists), 105,000; R\u0101jputs, 55,000; Kah\u0101rs (servants and cultivators), 49,000; Muraos (market-gardeners), 47,000; and Bani\u0101s, 32,000. The Barw\u0101rs, who number 2,218, are a small caste of criminals who have been settled here in the hope of reformation. A few Th\u0101rus, who appear to be of Mongolian origin, are the only people who can survive in the most fever-stricken parts of the tarai. Among Musalm\u0101ns, R\u0101jputs number 41,000; Shaikhs, 23,000; Path\u0101ns, 22,000; and Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers), 19,000. Agriculture supports 64 per cent. of the total population, and general labour 9 per cent. Br\u0101hmans cultivate 29 per cent. of the total area held by tenants, and R\u0101jputs 12 per cent. Kurmis, Muraos, and K\u0101chh\u012bs, who are the best tenants, hold about 14 per cent.\n\nIn 1901 there were 175 native Christians, of whom 61 were Methodists. The American Methodist Mission was opened at Gonda in 1859.\n\nThe agricultural conditions are closely connected with the physical features already described. The tarai is pre-eminently a rice country, but is very unhealthy, and is liable to heavy floods.\n\nAgriculture. South of it lies the \u016bparh\u0101r or upland area, in which the soil is usually a rich loam, which deteriorates to sand in the west and on the high banks of the streams. Wheat and rice, varied by gram and arhar, are the staples here. Sugar-cane and poppy are grown near the village sites, and near the swamps the valuable jarhan or late rice is cultivated. In the tarhar or lowlands the subsoil is sand, and fertility depends on the composition and thickness of the surface layer. This tract requires little irrigation, but is subject to floods, and the chief crops are maize in the autumn and peas or barley in the spring. Poppy is grown in all parts and is a very valuable crop. In the neighbourhood of the Tikri forest much damage is done to cultivation by wild beasts.\n\nThe ordinary tenures of the Province of Oudh are found. Taluk\u0101r\u012b estates include about 60 per cent. of the total area, and nearly 15 per cent. is sub-settled. There is also a large area held in small plots on\ncomplicated tenures by under-proprietors. The main agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are given below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Gond\u0101   | 619   | 422        | 187       | 103              |\n| Tarabganj | 627   | 367        | 93        | 127              |\n| Utraula | 1,567 | 1,006      | 221       | 233              |\n| **Total** | **2,813** | **1,795** | **501** | **463** |\n\nRice is the staple most largely grown, occupying 732 square miles, or 41 per cent. of the net area cultivated. Wheat (463 square miles), maize (489), gram (247), peas and mas\u016br (241), and barley (118) are also important food-crops, while poppy covered 37 square miles, sugar-cane 28, and oilseeds 12.\n\nThere has been a considerable increase in the cultivated area since the first settlement; but this has chiefly taken place in the single tahsil of Utraula, where population has grown rapidly, large tracts of jungle have been reclaimed, and the extension of the railway has made markets more accessible. Few changes have occurred in methods of cultivation. The area under poppy and sugar-cane has risen, and more land is under the valuable late rice than formerly. The prevailing feature of the cultivation is mediocrity, which is due to the large proportion of high-caste tenants, who are obliged by social custom to employ labourers instead of working with their own hands. Very few advances are taken under the Agriculturists' Loans Act, and none has been given under the Land Improvement Act except in 1896-7. Out of a lakh advanced during the ten years ending 1900, Rs. 28,000 was lent in the wet year 1894-5, and Rs. 33,000 in the drought of 1896-7. The loans in the next four years amounted to only Rs. 250.\n\nThe cattle bred locally are of poor quality, and animals of a better class are usually imported from the neighbouring District of Bahraich. Ponies are used to a large extent as pack-animals. Sheep and goats are fairly numerous, but no particular breeds are recognized.\n\nIn 1903-4 tanks and swamps supplied irrigation for 248 square miles and wells for 240, while rivers were used to serve only 13 square miles. Few Districts have better natural advantages. In the tarhar irrigation is little required in ordinary years, and the uparhar is provided with numerous tanks and wells. The number of wells is steadily increasing, and they can be made at a comparatively small cost. Water is usually raised from wells by means of a long lever, to which a pot is attached by a rope. The swing-basket is used to distribute water from jhils. Only a few crops are flooded, and the ordinary method of irrigation is to scatter water from small channels with a wooden shovel. In the tarai the rain-water is held up by small embankments to keep the rice-fields moist.\n'Reserved' forests cover an area of 162 square miles. The most important is a tract of 142 square miles, lying along the base of the hills with a width varying from three to six miles. Near the east this forest contains valuable sal (Shorea robusta) and asna (Terminalia tomentosa). Towards the west the sal gives place to dhan (Anogeissus latifolia) and haldu (Adina cordifolia). A little shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo) is found in the moister tracts near the mountain torrents. The Tikri forest has an area of about twenty square miles, chiefly in the Tarabganj tahsil near the centre of the District. It supplies sal timber and fuel to Gond\u0101 and Ajodhy\u0101. In 1903-4 the forests yielded a revenue of Rs. 50,000, the chief items being firewood and charcoal.\n\nThe only mineral product is kankar or nodular limestone, which is used for metalling roads and for making lime.\n\nThe District has few industries besides agriculture. Coarse cotton cloth is woven for local use at several places, but no fine tissues are produced. At Utraul\u0101 there is a small manufacture of ornamental pottery. No other articles are produced locally except those of use in agriculture or in domestic life, which can be made by the blacksmith, the carpenter, and the potter.\n\nThe export trade consists almost entirely of agricultural produce. Rice, peas, maize, opium, timber, and fuel are the chief exports, while piece-goods, salt, metals, and refined sugar are imported. Naw\u0101bganj and Colonelganj attract most of the trade in the south of the District, and Utraul\u0101 and Tulsipur are the chief centres for the export of the rice tracts in the north. Smaller but flourishing bazars have grown up at most of the villages near stations on the railway. Some traffic is still carried by the Rapti and Gogra, especially the latter; but the railway is now the chief means of transport. There is a small trade with Nep\u0101l, which supplies grain in exchange for piece-goods and sugar; but it is hampered by the absence of roads.\n\nGond\u0101 is better supplied with communication by rail than with roads, but the latter have recently been improved and added to. The main line of the Bengal and North-Western Railway crosses the south of the District. From Gond\u0101 town one branch strikes off to the north-west, leading to Bahraich, while another leads north and north-east towards the Nep\u0101l border. The latter till recently terminated at Tulsipur, but has now been continued to Usk\u0101 B\u0101z\u0101r in Bast\u012b, and gives off a short line to the Nep\u0101l frontier. A third branch runs south from the main line at Mank\u0101pur to the bank of the Gogra opposite Ajodhy\u0101. Out of 606 miles of road, only 110 are metalled. The latter are in charge of the Public Works department, but the whole cost is charged to Local funds. Avenues of trees are maintained on 388 miles. The chief routes are from Gond\u0101 town to Fyz\u0101b\u0101d and Balr\u0101mpur and towards Utraul\u0101.\nScarcity was experienced in 1865, 1869, and 1874, and in the latter year relief works were required, and distress was severe. In 1878-9 relief works were again opened, but only for about two and a half months. The drought of 1896 followed a succession of bad years in which the crops had been injured by excessive rain, and the health of the people had been severely affected. Relief works and poorhouses were opened, but the proportion of the population relieved was not high.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner is usually assisted by a member of the Indian Civil Service, and by four Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. There are two officers of the Opium department, and a tahsildar is stationed at the head-quarter of each tahsil.\n\nCivil cases are heard by three Munsifs and a Subordinate Judge, and the District and Sessions Judge of Gond\u0101 has civil and criminal jurisdiction also in Bahaich. Crime is of the ordinary type. Dacoity is very rare. The Barw\u0101rs commit their crimes far beyond the limits of the District. The complicated tenures on which land is held give rise to much litigation, and the Br\u0101hmans of Gond\u0101 have a bad reputation for perjury and forgery.\n\nA large area in the south-east of the District was ceded to the British in 1810, but was restored to the Naw\u0101b of Oudh at the close of the Nep\u0101lese War in 1816, in return for land acquired elsewhere and in extinction of a loan. At annexation in 1856, a summary settlement was made, by which the revenue was fixed at 9.7 lakhs. On the restoration of order after the Mutiny the same demand was again levied. Owing to the backward state of the District the regular settlement was postponed for some years. It was preceded by a survey and was commenced in 1868, the first assessment being completed in 1873. This assessment was based on estimates of the annual value of each village. In forming the estimates the rent-rolls were used, but they were corrected by applying what were found to be prevailing rates, and still more reliance was placed on rates obtained by estimating the value of agricultural produce. No allowance was made for the great difference between the rents paid by high-caste and low-caste tenants, and a succession of bad seasons soon showed that the revenue fixed could not be paid. A revision was at once undertaken and was completed by 1876, the 'assets' being now calculated on the basis of the actual rent-rolls, and allowances being made for the low rents paid by high castes. The revenue demand thus fixed amounted to 15.3 lakhs. The latest revision of settlement was made between 1897 and 1902, the first two years being occupied in a resurvey. An area of 860 square miles, or almost the whole of the tarai, is held by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Balr\u0101mpur on a permanent settlement, as a reward for services in the Mutiny,\nand was thus excluded. The revision in the rest of the District was based as usual on the corrected rent-rolls, and the new revenue demand amounted to 45.5 per cent. of the rental 'assets.' In 1903-4 the land revenue demand for the whole District was 16.6 lakhs, the incidence being R. 1 per acre, varying from R. 0.7 to Rs. 1.4 in different parganas.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 15.09  | 15.93  | 15.73  | 16.63  |\n| Total revenue  | 18.11  | 20.32  | 21.96  | 23.17  |\n\nThere are two municipalities, Gond\u0101 and Balr\u0101mpur, and two 'notified areas,' Naw\u0101bganj and Utraul\u0101, besides four towns administered under Act XX of 1856. Beyond the limits of these places, local affairs are managed by the District board, which had an income of 1.7 lakhs in 1903-4, chiefly derived from rates. The expenditure was 1.6 lakhs, including a lakh spent on roads and buildings.\n\nGond\u0101 contains 17 police stations; and the District Superintendent of police has under him a force of 3 inspectors, 91 subordinate officers, and 361 constables, besides 112 municipal and town police, and 2,911 rural and road police. The District jail contained a daily average of 446 prisoners in 1903.\n\nThe population of the District is not remarkable for its literacy. Three per cent. of the total (6 males and 0.1 females) could read and write in 1901. The number of public schools increased from 137 with 4,361 pupils in 1880-1 to 150 with 6,955 pupils in 1900-1. In 1903-4 there were 191 such schools with 9,390 pupils, of whom 248 were girls, besides 35 private schools with 445 pupils. Only 437 pupils had advanced beyond the primary stage. Two schools are managed by Government and 144 by the District board. The total expenditure on education was Rs. 46,000, of which Local funds provided Rs. 30,000, and fees Rs. 6,000.\n\nThere are 16 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 148 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 143,000, including 2,237 in-patients, and 4,687 operations were performed. The expenditure in the same year amounted to Rs. 16,000, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nAbout 33,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, representing the low proportion of 24 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipalities.\n\n[H. R. C. Hailey, Settlement Report (1903); H. R. Nevill, District Gazetteer (1905).]\n\nGond\u0101 Tahsil.\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of Gonda District, United\nProvinces, comprising the parganas of Gonda and Pah\u0101rapur, and lying between $27^\\circ 1'$ and $27^\\circ 26'$ N. and $81^\\circ 38'$ and $82^\\circ 19'$ E., with an area of 619 square miles. Population fell from 404,172 in 1891 to 384,021 in 1901. There are 784 villages and three towns, including Gond\u0101 (population, 15,811), the District and tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 491,000, and for cesses Rs. 50,000. The density of population, 620 persons per square mile, is the highest in the District. The tahsil lies chiefly in the central upland area, which forms the most fertile portion. It is bounded on the north by the Kuwan\u0101, along which stretches a belt of jungle, while the Tirhi flows across the south and the Bisuhi across the centre. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 422 square miles, of which 187 were irrigated. In ordinary years tanks or swamps supply almost as large a proportion as wells.\n\n**Gond\u0101 Town.** \u2014Head quarters of Gond\u0101 District and tahsil, United Provinces, situated in $27^\\circ 8'$ N. and $81^\\circ 58'$ E., at the junction of several branches of the Bengal and North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 15,811. The name of the town is popularly derived from gonth\u0101 or goth\u0101n, a 'cattle pen,' and its foundation is ascribed to M\u0101n Singh, a Bisen Rajput, who possibly lived in the early years of Akbar's reign. The last R\u0101ja of Gond\u0101 threw in his lot with the mutineers in 1857, and his estates were forfeited and conferred on the owner of the Ajodhy\u0101 Estate. The town is of mean appearance, but is adorned with two large tanks. The chief public buildings, besides the usual courts, are the male and female hospitals, the District school, and a literary institute with a library. Gond\u0101 has been administered as a municipality since 1869. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 18,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 22,000, including octroi (Rs. 11,000) and rents (Rs. 3,600); and the expenditure was also Rs. 22,000. There is a considerable trade in agricultural produce, but no manufacturing industry. Eight schools have 260 pupils.\n\n**Gondal State.** Native State in the K\u0101thi\u0101war Political Agency, Bombay, lying between $21^\\circ 42'$ and $22^\\circ 8'$ N. and $70^\\circ 3'$ and $71^\\circ 7'$ E., with an area of 1,024 square miles. With the exception of the Osam hills, the country is flat. Several streams intersect the State, the largest, the Bhadar, being navigable by small boats during the rains. The climate is good, and the annual rainfall averages 25 to 30 inches.\n\nThe chief of Gondal is a Rajput of the Jadeja stock, with the title of Th\u0101kur Sahib. Gondal is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari and the Mirat-i-Ahmad\u012b as a V\u0101ghela holding in sark\u0101r Sorath. The founder of the State was Kumbhoji I, who received Ardoi and other villages in the seventeenth century from his father Mer\u0101manji. Kumbhoji II, fourth of the line, raised the State to its present position, by acquiring\nthe rich pargana of Dhoraji and Upleta as well as Sarsai, &c. The ruler entered into engagements with the British in 1807. The family holds a sanad authorizing adoption; the succession follows the rule of primogeniture. The chief is entitled to a salute of 11 guns. The present chief, H.H. Thakur Sahib Sir Bhagvat Sinhji, was created a K.C.I.E. in 1887, and a G.C.I.E. in 1897. He has also received the degrees of LL.D. and D.C.L.\n\nThe population at the last four enumerations was: (1872) 137,217, (1881) 135,604, (1891) 161,036, and (1901) 162,859. There are 5 towns and 169 villages. In 1901 Hindus numbered 125,397, Musalmans 30,442, and Jains 6,811. The capital is Gondal Town.\n\nFor purposes of irrigation, water is drawn in leathern bags from wells and rivers by means of bullocks. A new water-works scheme for both irrigation and water-supply has recently been completed at a cost of 5\u00bd lakhs. The net revenue realized by the end of 1904 showed a return of 1.14 per cent. on irrigation outlay and 1.04 per cent. on water-supply outlay. Out of the total area of 1,024 square miles, 612 were returned in 1903\u20134 as cultivated. The total irrigated area is 53 square miles. An experimental farm and four public gardens are maintained. Horse-breeding is carried on with four stallions, and cattle-breeding with two bulls. The chief products are cotton and grain; and the chief manufactures are cotton and woollen fabrics, gold embroidery, brass and copper utensils, wooden toys, and ivory bangles. The State contains six ginning factories and one cotton-press. There are 11\u00bd miles of first-class metalled road between Gondal and Rajkot. Gondal has always been pre-eminent amongst the States of its class for the vigour and success with which public works have been prosecuted. The produce of the State is exported from Mangrol, Veraval, and Jodiya. In 1903\u20134 the exports were valued at more than 8 lakhs, and the imports at 22\u00bd lakhs. The Bhavnagar-Gondal-Junagarh-Porbandar Railway passes through the State, which has a share in the line, and also a branch of it, the Jetalsar-Rajkot Railway, in which the State has a three-eighths share.\n\nGondal ranks as a first-class State in Kathiawar. The chief has power to try his subjects for all offences, the trial of British subjects for capital offences, however, requiring the previous permission of the Agent to the Governor. The estimated gross revenue in 1903\u20134 was more than 15 lakhs, chiefly derived from land (12 lakhs); and the expenditure was 13 lakhs. The State pays a tribute of Rs. 1,10,721 to the British Government, the Gaikwar of Baroda, and the Nawab of Junagarh. Of the five municipalities, the largest is Gondal. The police force consists (1905) of 400 mounted and foot police, and there is an armed irregular force of 203 men. Eleven courts administer civil and criminal justice; and there are two jails and two lock-ups, which had\na daily average of 93 prisoners in 1903-4. Besides a Gir\u0101\u015bia college at Gondal, the State contains 85 schools with 6,803 pupils. In 1903-4 there were 2 hospitals and 4 dispensaries, affording relief to 46,000 persons, of whom 1,300 were in-patients. In the same year 3,800 persons were vaccinated.\n\n**Gondal Town.**\u2014Capital of the State of the same name in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay, situated in 21\u00b0 57' N. and 70\u00b0 53' E., on the western bank of the Gondali river. Population (1901), 19,592, including 12,995 Hindus, 4,289 Musalm\u0101ns, and 2,239 Jains. Gondal is connected with R\u0101jkot, Jetpur, Jun\u0101garh, Dhor\u0101j\u012b, Upleta, and M\u0101nekw\u0101ra by good roads. It is a railway station on the branch line between R\u0101jkot-Jetalsar on the Bhavnagar-Gondal-Jun\u0101garh-Porbandar Railway. The town is fortified. It contains two public gardens, an orphanage, an asylum, a hospital, and a Gir\u0101\u015bia college.\n\n**Gondi\u0101.**\u2014Village in the Tiror\u0101 tahsil of Bhand\u0101ra District, Central Provinces, situated in 21\u00b0 28' N. and 80\u00b0 13' E., on the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway, 81 miles from N\u0101gpur and 601 from Bombay. Gondi\u0101 is the junction for the new S\u0101tpur\u0101 narrow-gauge railway which runs to Jubbulpore across the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau. Population (1901), 4,457. It is one of the two leading goods stations in Bhand\u0101ra District, receiving the produce of the surrounding area of Bhand\u0101ra and of the lowlands of the adjoining B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t District. A large weekly grain market is held here. The greater part of the town stands on Government land, and the ground rents realized are credited to a fund for sanitary purposes, which is supplemented by a house rate. A branch station of the American Pentecostal Mission at R\u0101j-N\u0101ndgaon has recently been established. Gondi\u0101 contains Hind\u012b and Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b primary schools, and a dispensary.\n\n**Gondw\u0101na.**\u2014A name given by the Muhammadans to a tract of country now in the Central Provinces and Central India. Abul Fazl describes Gondw\u0101na or Garh\u0101 Katank\u0101 as bounded on the east by Ratanpur, a dependency of Jh\u0101rkhand or Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, and on the west by M\u0101lw\u0101, while Pann\u0101 lay north of it, and the Deccan south. This description corresponds fairly closely with the position of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau, as the Chhatt\u012bsgarh plain on the east belonged to the Ratanpur kingdom, incorrectly designated as a dependency of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, while part of the Narbad\u0101 valley was included in the old Hindu kingdom of M\u0101lw\u0101. Little or nothing was known of Gondw\u0101na at this time; and indeed as late as 1853 it was stated before the Royal Asiatic Society that 'at present the Gondw\u0101na highlands and jungles comprise such a large tract of unexplored country that they form quite an oasis in our maps.' Gondw\u0101na to the Muhammadans signified the country of the Gonds, the Dravidian tribe at present bearing that name. How they obtained it is a question which has\nbeen discussed by General Cunningham\\(^1\\). As pointed out by him, the Gonds do not call themselves by this name, but commonly by that of Koitur. He considers that Gond probably comes from Gauda, the classical name of part of the United Provinces and Bengal. A Benares inscription relating to one of the Chedi kings of Tripura or Tewar (near Jubbulpore) states that he was of the Haihaya tribe, who lived on the banks of the Narbad\u0101, in the district of the western Gauda in the province of M\u0101lw\u0101. Three or four other inscriptions also refer to the kings of Gauda in the same locality. The hypothesis can scarcely be considered as more than speculative; but, if correct, it shows that the name Gond has simply a local signification, the Gonds being the inhabitants of western Gauda, and the name being derived from the same source as that of the Gaur Br\u0101hmans and R\u0101jputs.\n\nMore than \\(2\\frac{1}{4}\\) millions of Gonds were enumerated at the Census of 1901, of whom nearly 2 millions belong to the Central Provinces, and the remainder to Bengal, Madras, and Ber\u0101r. Large numbers of them live on the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau, the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, and the hills of Bastar between the Mah\u0101nad\u012b and God\u0101vari, while they are less numerous on the Vindhyan Hills. The Gonds are among the most important of all the Dravidian tribes, and were formerly a ruling race, the greater part of the Central Provinces having been held by three or four Gond dynasties from about the fourteenth to the eighteenth century. Such accounts of them as remain, even allowing for much exaggeration, indicate the attainment of a surprising degree of civilization and prosperity. So far back as the fifteenth century we read in Firishta that the king of Kherl\u0101 sumptuously entertained Ahmad Sh\u0101h Wali, the Bahmani Sult\u0101n, and made him rich offerings, among which were many diamonds, rubies, and pearls. Under the Garh\u0101-Mandl\u0101 dynasty the revenues of Mandl\u0101 District are said to have amounted to 10 lakhs of rupees. When the castle of Chaur\u0101garh was sacked by one of Akbar's generals in 1564, the booty found, according to Firishta, comprised, independently of jewels, images of gold and silver and other valuables, no fewer than a hundred jars of gold coin, and a thousand elephants. Of the Ch\u0101nda rulers the Settlement officer who has recorded their history wrote that 'they left, if we forget the last few years, a well-governed and contented kingdom, adorned with admirable works of engineering skill, and prosperous to a point which no after-time has reached.'\n\nThese States were subverted by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s in the eighteenth century, and the Gonds were driven to take refuge in the inaccessible highlands, where the Mar\u0101th\u0101s continued to pillage and harass them, until they obtained an acknowledgement of their supremacy and the promise of an annual tribute. Under such treatment the hill Gonds\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Records of the Archaeological Survey, vol. ix, p. 150.\nsoon lost every vestige of civilization, and became the cruel treacherous savages depicted by travellers of this period, when they regularly plundered and murdered stragglers and small parties passing through their hills, while from their strongholds, built on the most inaccessible spurs of the S\u0101tpur\u0101s, they would make a dash into the rich plains of Ber\u0101r or the Narbada valley, and after looting and killing all night, return straight across country to their jungle fortresses, guided by the light of a bonfire on some commanding peak. With the pacification of the country and the introduction of a strong and equable system of government by the British, these wild marauders soon settled down and became the timid and inoffensive labourers which they now are.\n\nOwing to their numbers and wide distribution, the internal structure of the Gond tribe is somewhat complex. In Ch\u0101nda and Bastar especially are found a number of sub-tribes, as the M\u0101rias, Parij\u0101s, and Koy\u0101s, of whom it may at least be surmised that the name of Gond, as applied to them, has rather a local than a tribal signification, and that they are as distinctly separate tribes as the other branches of the Dravidian stock. A number of occupational groups have also come into existence, which are endogamous, and sometimes occupy a lower position in the social scale than the Gonds proper. Such are the Pardh\u0101ns or bards and minstrels, Ojh\u0101s or soothsayers, Agari\u0101s or iron-workers, Gow\u0101ris or graziers, Naiks or those who were formerly soldiers, and Koil\u0101bh\u016btis or dancers and prostitutes. The Pardh\u0101ns, Ojh\u0101s, and Koil\u0101bh\u016btis will eat from a proper Gond\u2019s hand, but a Gond will not eat with them. These professional groups, though included among Gonds by common usage, form practically separate castes. The tribe proper has two main divisions: the R\u0101j Gonds, who form the aristocracy; and the Dh\u016br, or \u2018dust\u2019 Gonds, the people. The latter are also called by the Hindus R\u0101vanvansi or descendants of the demon R\u0101vana, who was destroyed by R\u0101ma. The R\u0101j Gonds, who include the majority of the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs, may roughly be taken to be the descendants of Gond landed proprietors who have been formed into a separate subdivision and admitted to Hinduism with the status of a cultivating caste, Br\u0101hmans taking water from them. The elevation is justified by the theory that they have intermarried with R\u0101jputs, but this has probably occurred only in a few isolated instances. Some R\u0101j Gonds wear the sacred thread, and outdo Br\u0101hmans in their purificatory observances, even having the wood which is to cook their food washed before it is burnt. But many of them are obliged once in four or five years to visit their god B\u016bra Deo, and to place cow\u2019s flesh to their lips wrapped in a cloth, lest evil should befall their house. The Khatulh\u0101 Gonds, found principally in the north, also have a somewhat higher status than the ordinary Gonds, and appear to have belonged to the old Khatol\u0101 State in Bundelkhand.\nThe exogamous divisions of the Gonds are somewhat complicated. The primary classification is according to the number of gods worshipped. The worshippers of 7, 6, 5, and 4 gods form different divisions, within which marriage is prohibited: that is, worshippers of the same number of gods may not intermarry. Each division also has a totem\u2014that of the 7-god worshippers being a porcupine, of the 6-god worshippers a tiger, of the 5-god worshippers a crane, and of those of 4 gods a tortoise. But each of these divisions is further split up into a number of totemistic septs, and members of a sept may not marry those of a sept having the same totem in another division though worshipping a different number of gods. In many cases also particular septs with different totems in different divisions may not intermarry, the explanation being that a relationship exists between these septs. The whole system is somewhat confused, and the rules are indefinite, while the divisions according to numbers of gods worshipped appear to be absent in the northern Districts of the Central Provinces.\n\nThe marriage ceremony is performed in several ways. The R\u0101j Gonds have adopted the Hindu ceremonial. On the other hand, in Bastar and Ch\u0101nda, the primitive form of marriage by capture is still in vogue, though the procedure is now merely symbolical. The most distinctive feature of a Gond wedding is that the procession usually starts from the bride\u2019s house and the ceremony is performed at that of the bridegroom, in contradistinction to the Hindu practice. When a Gond wishes to marry his children he first looks to his sister\u2019s children, whom he considers himself to be entitled to demand for his own, such a marriage being called \u2018bringing back the milk.\u2019 Among the poorest classes the expectant bridegroom serves the bride\u2019s father for a period varying from three to seven years, at the end of which the marriage is celebrated at the latter\u2019s expense. In Khair\u0101garh the bridal pair are placed in two pans of a balance and covered with blankets. The caste priest lifts up the bridegroom\u2019s pan and the girl\u2019s relatives the other, and they walk round with them seven times, touching the marriage-post at each turn. After this they are taken outside the village without being allowed to see each other. They are placed standing at a little distance with a screen between them, and liquor is spilt on the ground to make a line from one to the other. After a time the bridegroom lifts up the screen, rushes on the bride, gives her a blow on the back, and puts the ring on her finger, at the same time making a noise in imitation of the cry of a goat. All the men then rush indiscriminately upon the women, making the same noise, and indulge in bacchanalian orgies, not sparing their own relations. The M\u0101ria Gonds consider the consent of the girl to be an essential preliminary to the marriage. She gives it before a council of elders, and if\nnecessary is allowed time to make up her mind. For the marriage ceremony the couple are seated side by side under a green shed, and water is poured on them through the shed in imitation of the fertilizing action of rain. Some elder of the village lays his hands on them, and the wedding is over. In the M\u0101ria villages, as in Chhattisgarh, there are gotalghars, or two houses or barracks in which all the youths and maidens respectively of the village sleep. They sing and dance and drink liquor till midnight, and are then supposed to separate, and each sex to retire to its own house. Marriage is adult, and divorce and widow marriage are freely allowed.\n\nThe funeral ceremonies of the Gonds are interesting. The corpse is usually buried with its feet to the south; the higher classes burn their dead, this honour being particularly reserved for old men on account of the expense involved in cremation. Formerly the dead were buried in the houses in which they died, but this practice has now ceased. On the fifth day after death the ceremony of bringing back the soul is performed. The relations go to the river-side and call aloud the name of the dead person, and then enter the river, catch a fish or an insect, and taking it home, place it among the sainted dead of the family, believing that the spirit of the dead person has in this manner been brought back to the house. In some cases it is eaten, in the belief that it will thus be born again as a child. The good souls are quickly appeased, and veneration for them is confined to their descendants. But the bad ones excite a wider interest because their evil influences may extend to others. A similar fear attaches to the spirits of persons who have died a violent or unnatural death.\n\nThe religion of the Gond is simply animistic. He deifies ancestors, who are represented by small pebbles kept in a basket in the holiest part of the house, that is, the kitchen, where he regularly worships them at appointed intervals. His greatest god is Bura Deo; but his pantheon includes many others, some being Hindu gods, and others animals or implements to which Hindu names have been attached. Among them may be mentioned Bhimsen, one of the P\u0101ndava brothers; Pharsi Pen, the battle-axe god; Ghangr\u0101, the bell on a bullock's neck; Chawar, the cow's tail; B\u0101gh Deo, the tiger; D\u016blha Deo, a young bridegroom who was carried off by a tiger; P\u0101lo, the cloth covering for spear-heads; and others. In Chhindw\u0101ra are found deo khal\u0101s, or 'gods' threshing-floors,' at which collections of the gods reside, and where gatherings are held for worship several times a year.\n\nThe Gonds are principally engaged in agriculture, and the majority of them are farm servants and labourers. The more civilized are also police constables and chapr\u0101sis, and the Mohp\u0101ni coal-miners are mainly Gonds. They work well, but like the other forest tribes are improvident and lazy when they have got enough for their immediate\nwants. 'A Gond considers himself a king if he has a pot of grain in his house,' says a proverb. The Gonds are of small stature and dark in colour. Their bodies are well proportioned, but their features are ugly, with a round head, distended nostrils, a wide mouth and thick lips, straight black hair, and scanty beard and moustache. The Marias are taller and have more aquiline features than the other tribes.\n\nAbout half of the Gonds in the Central Provinces speak a broken Hindi, while the remainder retain their own Dravidian language, popularly known as Gondi. This has a common ancestor with Tamil and Kanarese, but little immediate connexion with its neighbour Telugu. Gondi has no literature and no character of its own; but the Gospels and the Book of Genesis have been translated into it, and several grammatical sketches and vocabularies have been compiled.\n\n**Goomsur Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of Ganjam District, Madras, consisting of the taluk of Goomsur and the zamindari tahsils of Surada and Aska.\n\n**Goomsur Taluk.**\u2014Northernmost Government taluk in the plains of Ganjam District, Madras, lying between $19^\\circ 35'$ and $20^\\circ 17'$ N. and $84^\\circ 8'$ and $84^\\circ 59'$ E., with an area of 1,141 square miles. The population in 1901 was 200,357, compared with 185,870 in 1891. The number of villages is 697. The head-quarters are at Russellkonda (population, 3,493). The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 3,28,000. More than half of the taluk consists of forest, and this is the most important timber-growing area in the District, the sal (Shorea robusta) being especially fine. The land is fertile and much of it is irrigated by the Rushikulya Project and several large streams, but a considerable area is still unoccupied. Sugar-cane is grown in the centre and south. The patiks, who hold about 10,000 acres of land at favourable rates on condition of performing service if called upon, are an interesting remnant of the old feudal system. They are now generally employed as guards at public offices.\n\n**Goomsur-Udayagiri.**\u2014Agency taluk of Ganjam District, Madras. See Udayagiri.\n\n**Goona.**\u2014Town and military station in Central India. See Guna.\n\n**Gooty Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of Anantapur District, Madras, consisting of the Gooty and Tadpatri taluks.\n\n**Gooty Taluk.**\u2014Northern taluk of Anantapur District, Madras, lying between $14^\\circ 47'$ and $15^\\circ 14'$ N. and $77^\\circ 6'$ and $77^\\circ 49'$ E., with an area of 1,054 square miles. The population in 1901 was 156,155, compared with 142,917 in 1891. There are 142 villages and three towns: Gooty (population, 9,682), the head-quarters of the taluk and subdivision, famous for its ancient rock-fortress; Uravakonda (9,385), the head-quarters of the deputy-tahsildar; and Pammidi (10,657), noted for its hand-printed chintzes. The demand for land revenue and cesses\nin 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 3,16,000. In the south and west of the taluk are large plains of fertile black cotton soil. A soft limestone is generally found from 5 to 10 feet below this, which is partially soluble in water. Trees planted here grow well for three or four years, but as soon as their roots strike the limestone strata they cease to flourish. In the north and east the soil is red and gravelly; in many places rocky and stony. The Penner is the only river in the taluk. Small channels are dug from it by the villagers and are renewed year by year. The custom is that each ryot contributes a day\u2019s labour (personal or hired) towards the clearing of the channels for every acre irrigated from them which he possesses. The tanks in the taluk are insignificant and only two of them supply more than 200 acres each. The principal crops are cholam and cotton on the \u2018dry,\u2019 and rice and ragi on the \u2018wet\u2019 soil.\n\nGooty Town (Gutti).\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision and taluk of the same name in Anantapur District, Madras, situated in 15\u00b0 7\u2032 N. and 77\u00b0 39\u2032 E., on the Madras Railway, 30 miles from Anantapur town, 47\u00bd miles from Bellary, and 258 miles from Madras. Population (1901), 9,682.\n\nThe centre of the place is its famous old hill-fortress. A roughly circular cluster of steep, bare, rocky hills, each connected with the next by lower spurs, encloses in its midst a considerable area of level ground. Within this enclosure is the original town of Gooty. Round the outside of the cluster of hills runs a strong wall or rampart, built of stone pointed with chunam, which is guarded by frequent round towers or bastions. On the north and on the west, where the connecting spurs are lowest, two openings through this wall lead into the town. In former days these were fortified and provided with gates. Two small sally-ports in the wall also lead to paths across the outer circle of hills. The westernmost hill of this circle is a huge, precipitous mass of bare rock, which towers hundreds of feet above all the others. On this is built the citadel. It is approached by a paved path which leads first to an outlying spur of considerable extent, itself strongly fortified, and known formerly as Mar Gooty, then passes through the fortifications on this spur, winds upwards round the steep sides of the great rock above it, and at length reaches the summit of the fortress, 2,105 feet above sea-level and about 1,000 feet above the surrounding country. This rock commands the whole of the other fortifications, and also the town in their centre; it is defended by a series of walls perched one above the other along its precipitous sides and connected with re-entering gateways flanked by bastions, forming a citadel which famine or treachery could alone reduce. It is supplied with water from a number of reservoirs made in the clefts of the rock to catch the rain. One of these is traditionally declared to be connected with a stream at its foot. The fort contains no buildings or remains of architectural\ninterest. On the top are two erections which were apparently a gymnasium and a powder-magazine; and on the edge of a cliff some 300 feet high stands a small pavilion of polished chun\u0101m, called Mor\u0101ri Rao's Seat, which commands an excellent view of the town below. Here, it is said, Mor\u0101ri Rao used to sit and play chess or swing himself, varying the monotony by now and again watching a prisoner hurled from the top of the adjoining rock. Many other buildings are in ruins, and some of these were used by Munro as state prisons for refractory polig\u0101rs. In 1838 the hill chiefs who had been concerned in the rebellions in Ganjam were confined here. Within Mar Gooty are the barracks at one time occupied by the detachment of Native infantry which was posted here when the place was ceded to the Company. The fort and the buildings are on the list of constructions specially maintained by Government.\n\nThe old town of Gooty in the hollow within the circle of hills is very crowded and, owing to its situation, unpleasantly warm in the hot season. Consequently the place is now extending on the level ground to the west of the hills, outside the fortifications. Here are the divisional and taluk offices, the travellers' bungalow, and the buildings belonging to the London Missionary Society. The only public office still within the fort is the District Munsif's court.\n\nAt the foot of the path leading to the citadel is the European cemetery. Here rested for a short time the body of Sir Thomas Munro, who died at Pattikonda in Kurnool on July 6, 1827, when on a farewell tour, as Governor of the Presidency, through his beloved Ceded Districts. His remains now lie in St. Mary's Church in the Fort at Madras, but a cenotaph stands in the Gooty cemetery. At Pattikonda, Government planted a grove and constructed a reservoir to his memory; and at Gooty it built at a cost of Rs. 33,000 the Munro Chatram (in which hangs an engraving of Archer Shee's full-length portrait of Munro now in the Banqueting Hall at Madras), and also the tank facing the hospital and adjoining the road to the station. For the upkeep of these an endowment in land and money of Rs. 2,045 per annum was granted. Part of this was originally expended in feeding travellers in the chatram, and part in the maintenance of a dispensary in the veranda. In 1869 the dispensary was removed to the building now occupied by the hospital, which was erected from the endowment, the feeding of travellers was discontinued, and Rs. 1,500 out of the endowment was transferred to the upkeep of the dispensary in its new quarters. In 1884 the institution was handed over to the management of the taluk board, and it is now known merely as the hospital, few people seeming to remember that it ever had any connexion with the Munro memorials.\n\nMaterials for a complete history of the fort are not available. In-\nscriptions on the rocks on the summit show that it was a place of importance as far back as the eleventh century. It was one of the chief strongholds of the Vijayanagar kings, and the Musalmans did not succeed in taking it until some years after they had finally defeated that dynasty. About 1746, Mor\u0101ri Rao, the famous Marath\u0101 warrior whose exploits figure so largely in South Indian history, established himself here, and he repaired its fortifications. In 1775 Haidar Al\u012b of Mysore captured the place after a long siege. The water-supply ran out and the garrison were dying of thirst, and Mor\u0101ri Rao was obliged to capitulate. Haidar sent him to a prison on the Kabbaldurga hill in Mysore, from which he never emerged again. Haidar and his son Tip\u016b held the fort until 1799, when, on the latter's death at the storm of Seringapatam, it fell to the Niz\u0101m. It was captured by Colonel Bowser on the Niz\u0101m's behalf in the same year from a rebel who had seized it, and since 1800 it has been a British possession. A garrison of two companies was maintained in it until about 1860.\n\nGop\u0101lganj Subdivision.\u2014Northern subdivision of S\u0101ran District, Bengal, lying between 26\u00b0 12' and 26\u00b0 39' N. and 83\u00b0 54' and 84\u00b0 55' E., with an area of 788 square miles. The subdivision consists of a level alluvial plain, bounded on the east by the river Gandak. The population in 1901 was 635,047, compared with 634,630 in 1891. This is the least crowded part of the District, supporting only 806 persons per square mile. It contains one town, M\u012brganj (population, 9,698), and 2,148 villages; the head-quarters are at Gop\u0101lganj Village.\n\nGop\u0101lganj Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in S\u0101ran District, Bengal, situated in 26\u00b0 28' N. and 84\u00b0 27' E. Population (1901), 1,614. It contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for 18 prisoners.\n\nGop\u0101lpur.\u2014Chief port of Ganjam District, Madras, situated in 19\u00b0 16' N. and 84\u00b0 53' E., 9 miles south-east of Berhampur. Population (1901), 2,150. It is a port of call for the coasting steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and for many other vessels. The principal exports are grain and pulse, hides and skins, s\u0101l timber, hemp, coir manufactures, oilseeds, myrabolams, and dried fish; while the chief imports are sugar, piece-goods, apparel, jute manufactures, liquors, matches, kerosene oil, cotton twist, and metals. In 1903\u20134 the exports were valued at Rs. 14,32,000 and the imports at Rs. 2,57,000; and 7,400 passengers proceeded to and 8,300 returned from Burma. The port light (fixed white) is exhibited from a platform on the flagstaff at a height of 54 feet above high water, and is visible for 10 miles in clear weather. There is also a small red light on the extreme end of the pier-head, 25 feet above high water, and visible about 3 miles. The port is an open roadstead with no shelter whatever, but landing and shipping operations are possible throughout the year, except\noccasionally when the surf is very high. An iron screw-pile pier, 860 feet in length, is useless to the shipping, as it does not extend outside the line of surf. It is undergoing rapid deterioration; but the Government has decided not to incur any further expenditure upon it, as the trade of the port has greatly diminished since the construction of the railway. The best anchorage (sand and mud) is found in 6 to 7 fathoms about 1\u00bd miles from the shore. The sandhills in the vicinity have been planted with casuarina trees to stop further encroachment.\n\n**Gop\u0101lsw\u0101mi Betta.**\u2014Hill in the Gundalpet t\u0101luk of Mysore District, Mysore, situated in 11\u00b0 43\u2032 N. and 76\u00b0 35\u2032 E.; 4,770 feet high. The base is about 16 miles in circuit and the ascent is about 3 miles. The hill is generally enveloped in clouds and mist, whence its name of Himavad Gop\u0101lsw\u0101mi, but when clear it commands an extensive view over Mysore and the Wynnaad. The Pur\u0101nic name is Kamal\u0101dri, or Dakshina Govardhangiri. It abounds in springs. About the eleventh century it was fortified by the Nava Dan\u0101yaks, and from the end of the fifteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century was the stronghold of the Kote or Bettadakote chiefs, who were also rulers of the Nilgiris. The temple of Gop\u0101lsw\u0101mi (Vishnu), inside the fort, is visited by pilgrims.\n\n**Gop\u0101mau.**\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Hardoi, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 32\u2032 N. and 80\u00b0 18\u2032 E., near the Gumti. Population (1901), 5,656. According to tradition, it was founded in the eleventh century by an Ahban chief, named R\u0101j\u0101 Gopi, who drove out the Thather\u0101s from what was then a clearing in the forest. The Muhammadan invasion is said to date from the invasion of Oudh by Saiyid S\u0101l\u0101r, but the first authentic occupation was in the thirteenth century. The town flourished under native rule and sent out numbers of distinguished soldiers and men of letters, who returned to adorn their native place with mosques, wells, and large buildings. It is now a place of small importance and has little trade; but silver thumb-rings made locally, in which small mirrors are set, have some artistic merit. There is a school with 112 pupils.\n\n**Gopichettip\u0101laiyam.**\u2014Head-quarters of the Satyamangalam t\u0101luk in Coimbatore District, Madras, situated in 11\u00b0 27\u2032 N. and 77\u00b0 26\u2032 E., 25 miles north-west of Erode railway station. Population (1901), 10,227. It contains the best \u2018wet\u2019 land in the t\u0101luk, and is inhabited by well-to-do ryots and traders. It has therefore recently supplanted Satyamangalam as the chief town of the t\u0101luk. Corundum has been found here in fair quantities.\n\n**Gor\u0101gh\u0101t.**\u2014Ruined city in Din\u0101jpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See Ghor\u0101gh\u0101t.\n\n**Gorai.**\u2014River of Bengal and Eastern Bengal and Assam. See Garai.\nGorakhpur Division.\u2014Division in the north-east of the United Provinces, extending from the borders of Nep\u0101l to the south of the Gogra, and lying between $25^\\circ 38'$ and $27^\\circ 30'$ N. and between $82^\\circ 13'$ and $84^\\circ 26'$ E. The northern portion includes a damp alluvial tract in Gorakhpur District, containing forests. It is crossed by the R\u0101pt\u012b, and skirted on the north-east by the Great Gandak. The headquarters of the Commissioner are at Gorakhpur City. Population increased rapidly from 1872 to 1891, but received a check in the next decade, owing to mortality from an epidemic of fever, increased emigration, and the effects of the famine of 1896\u20137. The numbers at the four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 4,810,016, (1881) 5,852,386, (1891) 6,508,526, and (1901) 6,333,012. The total area is 9,534 square miles, and the density of population is 664 persons per square mile, compared with 445 for the whole of the United Provinces. This Division, though it contains a smaller area than any other, ranks second in population. In 1901 Hindus formed 87 per cent. of the total, and Musalm\u0101ns nearly 13 per cent. Christians numbered 1,721 (1,197 being natives), and Sikhs 1,646. The Division contains three Districts, as shown in the following table:\n\n| District     | Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Land revenue and cesses, 1903\u20134, in thousands of rupees |\n|--------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Gorakhpur    | 4,535                | 2,938,176        | 29,38                                                    |\n| Basti        | 2,792                | 1,846,153        | 23,21                                                    |\n| Azamgarh     | 2,207                | 1,548,683        | 20,69                                                    |\n| Total        | 9,534                | 6,333,012        | 73,28                                                    |\n\nGorakhpur and Basti are situated north of the Gogra, and Azamgarh south of that river. The Division contains 19,135 villages, but only 34 towns, and is remarkable for the manner in which houses are scattered about in small hamlets, instead of being collected in central sites, as in the western portions of the United Provinces. The only town with a population exceeding 20,000 is Gorakhpur (64,148, with a small area which was till lately a cantonment). Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Barhaj, Barhalganj, Usk\u0101, Padraun\u0101, and Gol\u0101 are at present the chief trading centres, but the recent improvements in railway communications are changing the former conditions. The site of Kapilavastu, where Gautama Buddha was born, is now known with some degree of certainty to lie close to the northern border of Basti District, and both Basti and Gorakhpur contain many ruins dating from Buddhist times. The site near Kasi\u0101 is especially interesting. Maghar is connected with the life of the great reformer, Kabir.\n\nGorakhpur District.\u2014Eastern District in the Division of the same\nname, United Provinces, lying between $26^\\circ 5'$ and $27^\\circ 29'$ N. and $83^\\circ 4'$ and $84^\\circ 26'$ E., with an area of 4,535 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Nep\u0101l territory; on the east by the Champ\u0101ran and S\u0101ran Districts of Bengal; on the south by the Gogra, which divides it from Balli\u0101 and Azamgarh; and on the west by Bast\u012b. The District lies a few miles from the most southern slopes of the lower range of hills in Nep\u0101l, but no greater elevation than a few sandhills breaks the monotony of its level surface. It is, however, intersected by numerous rivers and streams, and dotted over with lakes and marshes. The water-supply is abundant, and the moisture of the soil gives a verdant appearance to the country which contrasts strongly with the arid aspect of the Districts south of the Gogra. In the north and centre extensive tracts of sal forest diversify the scene, though the trees are not as a rule of any great size. In the south the general expanse of close cultivation is diversified by shady mango groves or intersected by frequent small lakes. The west and south-west are low-lying plains subject to extensive inundations. In seasons of heavy rain the water collects in the valley of the Am\u012b, and, joining the lakes to the east, forms an immense inland sea. The District is drained chiefly into the Gogra, a large and rapid river which forms the southern border. Its main tributary is the R\u0101pt\u012b, which winds across the west with a very tortuous and shifting channel, and receives a number of affluents, including the Rohini and Am\u012b. West of the R\u0101pt\u012b flows the Kuw\u0101n\u0101, and east of it the Little Gandak. The eastern border is skirted in places by the Great Gandak or N\u0101r\u0101yan\u012b, a large and rapid stream which receives very little drainage from Gorakhpur. The chief perennial lakes are the Nadaur, Ramgarh, Narhar, Chilla, Rama Bhar, Amiar, and Bheor\u012b T\u0101ls.\n\nThe District exposes nothing but alluvium. As is usual in the submontane tract, even the calcareous limestone commonly found throughout the Gangetic valley is rare.\n\nThe flora of the District resembles that found in the submontane tract of Northern India. Outside the forests, which are described separately, the principal trees are mango, various kinds of fig, shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo), mahua (Bassia latifolia), guava, jack-fruit, and j\u0101mun (Eugenia Jambolana).\n\nTigers and leopards are fairly common in the north of the District, and a few wild buffaloes and a single rhinoceros have been shot within the last few years. Spotted deer and hog deer, and occasionally sloth bears, are found in the same locality. Wild hog, nilgai, wolves, and jackals occur all over the District. The numerous lakes are the homes of an immense variety of water-birds. Snakes are found everywhere, and the python is sometimes seen in the forest. Fish are plentiful in\nboth rivers and lakes, and form an important article of food. The crocodile and the *ghari\u0101l* are common, and the former often causes loss of life.\n\nThe District is not subject to intense heat, being secured from extremes by its vicinity to the hills and the moisture of its soil. The climate is, however, relaxing, and there is no bracing cold; temperature seldom rises above $92^\\circ$ in the hot season or falls below $60^\\circ$ in the winter. The southern and eastern portions, where the jungle has been cleared, are as healthy as most parts of the Provinces; but the damp *tarai* and the forest tracts are still subject to malaria.\n\nThe annual rainfall over the whole District averages 45 inches; but the north receives more than 54 inches, while the south-east receives only 44. Variations from year to year are considerable. In 1890 the fall was 87 inches, and in 1868 only 25.\n\nThe history of the District up to a comparatively recent date is chiefly to be gathered from the uncertain and contradictory traditions current among the inhabitants. The birthplace of Gautama Buddha is situated close to the north-east border, and for many years the remains near Kasi\u0101 were believed to mark the spot at which he died; but the identification is now disputed\\(^1\\). In the fifth century the south of Gorakhpur was probably included in the Gupta kingdom of Magadha. The Chinese pilgrim in the seventh century A.D. describes the north of the District or the tract on its border as waste and desolate, though many ruins were found. Local tradition declares that the Bhars ruled in the District, and were gradually displaced by the Rajput clans which now hold it. During the twelfth century it appears to have been included in the great kingdom of Kanauj. The Musalmans for long obtained no hold of Gorakhpur, which continued to be governed by petty Rajas. In the fifteenth century one of these founded a small kingdom, which extended over a considerable area in both Gorakhpur and Champaran. Under Akbar an expedition was sent across the Gogra for the first time in pursuit of Khan Zaman, the rebel governor of Jaunpur. Other expeditions followed, and a sarkar of Gorakhpur was formed, and included in the Subah of Oudh. The Muslim yoke was, however, shaken off in the early part of the seventeenth century, and it was not till the accession of Aurangzeb that the Mughal power was really felt. About 1680 prince Muazzam (afterwards Bahadur Shah) visited Gorakhpur, and a new division, called Muazzamabad, was formed in his honour, which included part of Saran. Under the Nawabs of Oudh a firmer grasp of the country was taken. Intestine quarrels between the Rajas and the incursions of the Banjaras in the early part of the eighteenth century led to a decline in prosperity, and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) V. A. Smith, *The Remains near Kasi*, 1896.\nin 1750 the Naw\u0101b of Oudh sent a large army under Al\u012b K\u0101sim Kh\u0101n. The submission of the R\u0101j\u0101s was obtained and tribute was collected from them; but no regular government was carried on by the Muhammadans. After the battle of Buxar in 1764 a British officer was lent to the Oudh government, who exercised almost supreme power over the south of the District; but in the north the local R\u0101j\u0101s and a few officials were employed to collect the revenue, which was exceedingly precarious. Extortion and internecine quarrels had reduced the District to great misery, when in 1801 it was ceded to the British. In the next few years the Nep\u0101lese encroached on the northern border, and remonstrances being fruitless war was declared in 1814. The contest ended in 1816, and small concessions were made in this District to the Nep\u0101lese. On the outbreak of the Mutiny in 1857 disturbances occurred, and most of the troops at Gorakhpur mutinied. In August the station was abandoned and a rebel government under Muhammad Hasan was established; but in January, 1858, a Gurkha force under Jang Bah\u0101dur marched in from the north and Colonel Rowcroft\u2019s troops from the south. Muhammad Hasan was driven away and order was soon re-established.\n\nMemorials of the time when Buddhism was the prevailing religion are found in the shape of ruined brick st\u016bpas and monasteries in all parts of the District; but few of these have been excavated. The best known is the st\u016bpa near K\u0101\u015b\u012b, and the temple containing a stone figure of the dying Buddha. An inscription dated A.D. 460\u20131, in the reign of Skanda Gupta, was found on a pillar in the south of the District. A number of copperplate grants of the last Hindu kings of Kanauj have been dug up from time to time. There are no Muhammadan buildings of interest.\n\nGorakhpur District contains 18 towns and 7,544 villages. Population increased considerably between 1872 and 1891, but decreased in the next decade. The numbers at the four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 2,019,361, (1881) 2,617,120, (1891) 2,994,057, and (1901) 2,957,074. The District supplies many emigrants to other parts of India and abroad. In 1894 an epidemic of fever caused great mortality, and drought in 1896 increased emigration, especially to Nep\u0101l. There are six tahsils\u2014B\u0101nsgaon, Mah\u0101rajanj, Padraun\u0101, H\u0101t\u0101, Deori\u0101, and Gorakhpur\u2014each named from its head-quarters. The only municipality is Gorakhpur City, the administrative head-quarters of the District. The table on the next page gives the chief statistics of population in 1901.\n\nIn 1904 an area of 52 square miles belonging to the B\u0101nsgaon tahsil in the south of the District was transferred to Azamgarh, with a population of 18,898. Hindus form nearly 90 per cent. of the total and Musalm\u0101ns 10 per cent. In the northern part the density of population\nis comparatively low, owing to the presence of forests and large areas of uncultivated land; but in the south it is exceedingly high. The northern portion suffered from the fever epidemic of 1894, while in the south famine was experienced in 1896 and 1897. More than 94 per cent. of the population speak Bih\u0101r\u012b.\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of Persons able to read and write |\n|------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| B\u0101nsgaon   | 614                 | 4              | 1,667    | 438,364    | 714                       | -2.9                                          | 17,907                                 |\n| Mah\u0101r\u0101jganj | 1,239               | 1              | 1,265    | 504,325    | 407                       | -1.4                                          | 9,969                                  |\n| Padraun\u0101   | 928                 | 3              | 1,285    | 595,706    | 642                       | -1.6                                          | 10,879                                 |\n| H\u0101t\u0101       | 571                 | 2              | 950      | 428,846    | 751                       | -0.3                                          | 8,415                                  |\n| Deor\u0101      | 583                 | 6              | 1,287    | 493,822    | 847                       | -4.6                                          | 10,930                                 |\n| Gorakhpur  | 652                 | 2              | 1,090    | 496,011    | 761                       | +3.9                                          | 19,186                                 |\n| District total | 4,587             | 18             | 7,544    | 2,957,074  | 645                       | -1.2                                          | 83,292                                 |\n\nThe most numerous Hindu castes are: Cham\u0101rs (leather-workers and labourers), 353,000; Ahirs (graziers and cultivators), 342,000; Br\u0101hmans, 263,000; Kurm\u012bs (agriculturists), 198,000; Koiris (cultivators), 152,000; R\u0101jputs, 141,000; Kawats (cultivators), 123,000; Bani\u0101s, 86,000; Bhars (labourers), 70,000; and Luni\u0101s (navvies), 66,000. The Bhuinh\u0101rs (agriculturists), 32,000, are important in the east of the District. The Bhars, who once held the land, and the Bhuinh\u0101rs and Kurm\u012bs are most numerous in the east of the Provinces. The damp submontane tract is inhabited by a few Th\u0101rus, who seem fever-proof, and number 2,700. Among Muhammadans, the most numerous classes are Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers), 73,000; Shaikhs, 48,000; Path\u0101ns, 39,000; and Behn\u0101s (cotton-carders), 29,000. The District is essentially agricultural, 72 per cent. of the population being supported by agriculture. More than half the land is held by Br\u0101hmans, Bhuinh\u0101rs, and R\u0101jputs, and the same three castes occupy about a fourth of the cultivated area.\n\nThe District contained 1,040 native Christians in 1901, of whom 731 belonged to the Anglican communion. The Church Missionary Society, which has laboured here since 1823, has three branches in the District. In 1890 a Zan\u0101na Mission was established.\n\nThe ordinary soils of the United Provinces are found, varying from sand and loam to clay. The loam is most prevalent in the south and west, and clay in the north. In the centre and east is found a peculiar calcareous soil, called bh\u0101t, which is extremely fertile and very seldom requires irrigation owing to its power of retaining moisture. The clay tract in the north-west chiefly produces rice, while kodon, a small millet, is largely grown in the northeast. Along the chief rivers tracts of low-lying alluvial soil are found, Agriculture.\nwhich are flooded during the rains, and for the most part produce spring crops.\n\nAt the last settlement 4,061 villages were held on zam\u012bnd\u0101ri, 4,552 on pattid\u0101ri, and thirty-four on bhaiy\u0101ch\u0101r\u0101 tenures. There are also a few talukas which, as is usual in the Province of Agra, are settled with the under-proprietors or birti\u0101s, who pay the Government demand plus a fee of 10 per cent. which is refunded to the talukd\u0101r. The main agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown in the following table, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| B\u0101nsgaon   | 614   | 429        | 199       | 53               |\n| Mah\u0101r\u0101jganj | 1,239 | 740        | 173       | 175              |\n| Padraun\u0101   | 928   | 675        | 86        | 132              |\n| H\u0101t\u0101       | 571   | 457        | 234       | 42               |\n| Deori\u0101     | 583   | 456        | 243       | 37               |\n| Gorakhpur  | 652   | 480        | 197       | 78               |\n| **Total**  | **4,587** | **3,237** | **1,132** | **517**          |\n\nThe principal food-crops, with the area under each in square miles, are: rice (1,358), or 42 per cent. of the net area cropped; barley (558); kodon and small millets (446); wheat (523); peas (462); gram (251); and maize (196). Oilseeds covered 336 square miles, sugar-cane 118, poppy 27, and indigo 15.\n\nAttempts have been made from time to time to introduce new staples, such as hemp, cotton, and various kinds of rice, but without success. Indigo was started about 1830 by European planters, and a better class of dye is produced here than in any other part of the United Provinces. The relief afforded by a settled government and freedom from war had marked effects in the reclamation of waste land and the introduction of the valuable crops, sugar-cane and poppy. Since 1870 the net area cultivated has increased by about 16 per cent., while the area bearing two crops in a year has nearly doubled. Maize is much more largely grown than formerly, and occupies twice as large an area as it did twenty years ago. Very few advances are taken under the Agriculturists' Loans or Land Improvement Acts. Out of a total of 2.3 lakhs advanced during the ten years ending 1900, as much as 1.9 lakhs was advanced in the famine year 1896-7, chiefly for the construction of temporary wells. There have been practically no advances since 1900.\n\nA few attempts have been made to improve the breed of cattle, but without any marked success. The north contains large grazing-grounds to which cattle are driven in the hot season. The ponies are very inferior; a stallion was kept for some years in the east, but no horse-breeding operations are carried on now. The richer landholders own elephants, of which about 400 are kept in the District. Sheep are bred\nfor wool and meat, and goats for milk, manure, and meat; but all are of a poor type.\n\nIn 1903-4, 1,132 square miles were irrigated, of which 475 were supplied from wells, 489 from tanks, and 168 from other sources. Well-irrigation is commonest in the south-east of the District, but it is increasing rapidly in the centre and north-east. Elsewhere tanks are more important. They include a large number of artificial excavations, which are, however, of small size. The large rivers have beds too low to supply irrigation except to the alluvial land on the border of their channels, and this is generally so moist as not to require watering. The small streams are, however, largely used, and in the north of the District they are dammed so as to flood the adjacent rice tracts. Regular channels for the distribution of water have been made on the estates of some European zamind\u0101rs. The spring-level is so high that water is raised from wells over a large part of the District by means of a lever with an earthen pot attached. In the south bullocks work the wells. The commonest method of irrigation is, however, the swing-basket worked by men or women. Fields are not flooded as in the western Districts, but water is scattered over the land from small channels with a wooden shovel.\n\nThe District contains 173 square miles of 'reserved' forests, which extend along the Nep\u0101l frontier and down the river Rohini to Gorakhpur city. The most valuable products are s\u0101l timber (*Shorea robusta*) and fuel; but catechu is also extracted. In the north the 'reserved' land includes a large area under grass, which affords valuable grazing and also produces thatching-grass. In 1903-4 the total receipts were Rs. 88,000. The forests form the Gorakhpur division of the Oudh Circle, and are in charge of a Deputy-Conservator. About 100 square miles of jungle land are owned by private individuals, but in most of this area the valuable timber has been cut down.\n\n*Kankar* or calcareous limestone is used for metalling roads and for making lime, but is scarce. The chief mineral product is saltpetre, extracted from saline efflorescences by Luni\u0101s.\n\nThe principal industry is sugar-refining, which is carried on in all parts of the District, especially in the centre and south-east. The methods usually adopted are those of the country, but a large sugar refinery, worked on European lines, was opened in 1903. The manufacture of indigo still survives, especially in the Padraun\u0101 *tahsil*, where a number of factories are owned and managed by Europeans. A little coarse cotton cloth is woven for local use, and a peculiar cloth of mixed wool and cotton is also produced.\n\nThe most important export trade is that in agricultural produce, especially rice, barley, wheat, and sugar. Coarse rice is exported to\nDistricts south of the Gogra, while the finer kinds and wheat are sent to the western Districts and the Punjab. Sugar is exported to Cawnpore for distribution to Central India and R\u0101jput\u0101na, and the trade with Eastern Bengal is growing. Timber is supplied to the neighbouring Districts, and oilseeds are exported to Calcutta. The chief imports are piece-goods, obtained from Calcutta and Cawnpore; and salt, metals, and kerosene oil, from Calcutta. Traffic is now largely carried by rail; but the commerce of the Gogra still survives, and in particular rice and wood are carried by rail to Barhaj and Turtip\u0101r, and then distributed by boat. Within the last few years a steamer service from Patna has been revived. There is a considerable trade with Nep\u0101l across the frontier. Grain\u2014especially rice\u2014gh\u012b, and spices are imported, and salt and piece-goods exported. There are no large commercial centres, and the trade of the District is carried on at numerous small towns and markets, among which Barhaj is the most important.\n\nThe main line of the Bengal and North-Western Railway crosses the southern portion of the District, and a branch leaves Gorakhpur city and passes north. Another branch from Bhatn\u012b gives through communication with Benares, and has a short line from Salempur to Barhaj. A branch has been sanctioned which will connect Gorakhpur city through the north of the District with Bettia. The roads are not good. Only 93 miles are metalled, while 923 are unmetalled. The former are in charge of the Public Works department, but the cost of all but 51 miles of metalled roads is charged to Local funds. Avenues of trees are maintained on 100 miles. The chief lines of road are those from Gorakhpur city to Gh\u0101zipur and Fyz\u0101b\u0101d, and the road from Barhaj to Padraun\u0101, which is to be metalled throughout. The scarcity of kankar and the absence of stone render the metalling of roads difficult and expensive.\n\nGorakhpur has usually escaped severe famine. Tradition tells of a great dearth in the reign of Aurangzeb, and of another in the eighteenth century, when tigers could find no other prey and killed 400 of the inhabitants of a town named Bhau\u0101p\u0101r.\n\nDroughts caused slight scarcity in 1803, 1809, and 1814; but even in 1837 the District escaped lightly. In 1860 there was an increase in crime; but both in that year and in 1868\u20139 distress was not severe. The effects of the drought of 1873\u20134 were aggravated by a rise in prices due to immense exports of grain to Bengal, and relief works were opened, but were only resorted to by labourers. In 1896 the rains ceased prematurely and the autumn crops suffered. Advances were freely given for seed and for the construction of wells. Relief works were opened in January, 1897, and in February more than 30,000 workers were employed on roads and tanks. The spring harvest was\ngood and works were closed when the rains fell, after a total expenditure of 2.9 lakhs on this form of relief.\n\nThe Padraun\u0101 tahsil forms a separate subdivision in charge of a member of the Indian Civil Service stationed at Kasi\u0101. The Deori\u0101 and H\u0101t\u0101 tahsils form another subdivision in charge of a Deputy-Collector, whose head-quarters have recently been transferred from Majhaul\u012b to Deori\u0101. The posting of a Civilian to Deori\u0101 has recently been sanctioned. The remaining officers of the District staff, including two members of the Indian Civil Service and four Deputy-Collectors, reside at Gorakhpur city. Besides the ordinary District officials, two officers of the Opium department, one of the Salt department, and a Deputy-Conservator of Forests are stationed at Gorakhpur. There is a tahsildar at the head-quarters of each tahsil.\n\nThere are three District Munsifs and a Subordinate Judge. The District and Sessions Judge has civil jurisdiction throughout both Gorakhpur and Bast\u012b, but hears Sessions cases in the former only. Crime is distinctly heavier in the south than in the north, but is chiefly confined to thefts and burglaries, dacoity being very rare. Cattle-poisoning and arson are more common than usual.\n\nThe District of Gorakhpur, as formed at the cession in 1801, included the present District and also Bast\u012b, Azamgarh, parts of Gond\u0101, and the lowlands of Nep\u0101l. The last two tracts were made over to the Naw\u0101b of Oudh and to the Nep\u0101lese respectively in 1816. The Azamgarh parganas were removed in 1820, and after the Mutiny a further cession to Nep\u0101l took place. Bast\u012b was formed into a separate District in 1865. The early revenue administration was difficult. A long period of misrule had made the large landholders independent and the peasantry timid. The demand fixed was only 3.5 lakhs on the present area; and although this was a reduction on the nominal demand of the Oudh Government, it was collected with difficulty. Short-term settlements were made as usual, and the revenue rose a little. In 1882 a survey was commenced, and more detailed inquiries into the agricultural capabilities of the District and the rights of the people became possible. Regulation VII of 1822, however, laid down a procedure which could not be carried out with the existing staff. In 1830 the first jungle grant was made to a European, and this was followed by other grants. The first regular settlement under Regulation IX of 1833 was carried out between 1834 and 1839, and the revenue had then risen to 10.9 lakhs. This settlement was based on a valuation of crops; and it was further marked by the setting aside of the talukd\u0101rs, who now became merely pensioners in respect of the villages held by under-proprietors. Preparations for the next settlement were interrupted by the Mutiny, but were resumed in 1859 and completed in 1867. The\noperations were carried out by several successive Collectors and their Assistants. Rent rates were assumed on various principles and applied to the areas ascertained at survey. The revenue was fixed at half the rental 'assets' so obtained, and amounted to 15.5 lakhs, rising to 17.3. The last revision was carried out between 1883 and 1890. In two tahsils it was based on rent rates found to be prevalent, while in the remainder the actual rent-rolls were the basis of the assessment. The demand fixed was 23.1 lakhs, rising to 24.4, which amounted to 48 per cent. of the rental 'assets.' The demand in 1903-4 was 25.1 lakhs, the incidence being R. 0.9 per acre, varying from R. 0.3 to Rs. 1.2 in different parganas.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 17.02  | 23.02  | 26.43  | 25.23  |\n| Total revenue  | 21.12  | 34.92  | 39.50  | 39.93  |\n\nIn 1904 the revenue demand was reduced by Rs. 18,000, owing to the transfer of 115 villages from the Bansgaon tahsil to Azamgarh.\n\nGorakhpur City is the only municipality, but twelve towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. Outside of these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which had an income of 3.3 lakhs in 1903-4, chiefly derived from local rates. The expenditure was 3.2 lakhs, including 2.3 lakhs spent on roads and buildings.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police has 2 Assistants and 5 inspectors, besides a force of 147 subordinate officers, 748 constables, 192 municipal and town police, and 2,340 rural and road police. There are 34 police stations. The District jail contained a daily average of 408 prisoners in 1903, and the small jail at Kasia 23 more. The latter is only used for prisoners under trial or sentenced to short terms.\n\nThe District is backward as regards education, only 2.8 per cent. of the population (5.5 males and 0.1 females) being able to read and write in 1901. Hindus (2.8) are more advanced than Muhammadans (2.3). There has, however, been a considerable improvement in recent years, and the number of public schools increased from 222 with 8,592 pupils in 1880-1 to 334 with 23,574 pupils in 1900-1. In 1903-4 there were 339 public institutions with 18,023 pupils, of whom 463 were girls, besides 70 private schools with 1,042 pupils. A normal school and college are situated at Gorakhpur city, and sixteen of the public schools are classed as secondary; but the great majority of the pupils are in primary schools. Three schools are managed by Government, and 171 are under the District or municipal boards. Out of\na total expenditure on education of Rs. 84,000, Local funds supplied Rs. 59,000, and the receipts from fees were Rs. 14,000.\n\nThere are 13 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 98 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 143,000, including 1,300 in-patients, and 7,473 operations were performed. The expenditure in the same year was Rs. 20,000, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nAbout 87,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903\u20134, giving an average of 29 per 1,000 of population, which is below the Provincial average. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipality of Gorakhpur.\n\n[District Gazetteer (1881, under revision); A. W. Cruickshank, Settlement Report (1891).]\n\nGorakhpur Tahsil.\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of Gorakhpur District, United Provinces, comprising the par\u0161anas of Bhau\u0101p\u0101r, Haveli, and Maghar, and lying between 26\u00b0 29' and 27\u00b0 N. and 83\u00b0 12' and 83\u00b0 38' E., with an area of 652 square miles. Population increased from 477,588 in 1891 to 496,011 in 1901, this being the only tahsil which did not show a decrease. There are 1,090 villages and two towns, including Gorakhpur City (population, 64,148), the District and tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 3,94,000, and for cesses Rs. 65,000. The density of population, 761 persons per square mile, is considerably above the District average. The tahsil is divided unequally by the winding course of the R\u0101pt\u012b, and is also crossed by its tributaries, the Ami and Rohini, and by several smaller streams. After heavy rain a large area in the south-west becomes a continuous sheet of water. S\u0101l forests clothe the left bank of the Rohini and extend to the neighbourhood of Gorakhpur city, but most of the rest is highly cultivated. The area under cultivation in 1903\u20134 was 480 square miles, of which 197 were irrigated. Wells supply about one third of the irrigated area, and small streams, tanks, and swamps the remainder.\n\nGorakhpur City.\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of the same name, United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 45' N. and 83\u00b0 22' E., on the Bengal and North-Western Railway, 506 miles by rail from Calcutta and 1,056 from Bombay. The city lies near the left bank of the R\u0101pt\u012b, and at the junction of roads to Gh\u0101zipur and Fyz\u0101b\u0101d. Population is increasing. The numbers at the four enumerations were: (1872) 51,117, (1881) 59,908, (1891) 63,620, and (1901) 64,148. These figures include a small area with a population of 771, which was administered as a cantonment up to 1904, and is now a 'notified area.' Of the total in 1901, 41,451 were Hindus and 21,829 Musalm\u0101ns. The town is believed to have been founded about 1400 by a branch of the Sat\u0101s\u012b family, and takes its name from a shrine of\nGorakhn\u0101th. During the reign of Akbar it became the head-quarters of a sark\u0101r in the S\u016bbah of Oudh. In 1610 the Muhammadan garrison was driven away, and the place was held by the Hindus till 1680. A few years later prince Muazzam visited Gorakhpur, which was thenceforward called Muazzam\u0101b\u0101d in official documents. In the eighteenth century the city and District were included in Oudh, and the later history has been given in that of Gorakhpur District.\n\nThe city consists of a number of village sites clustered together, and often divided by considerable areas of garden or cultivated land. The drainage is very defective, and the place has a mean appearance. East of the native quarters is a spacious civil station and the old cantonment, and a large area occupied by the head-quarters of the Bengal and North-Western Railway. The most imposing public building is the town hall built recently and called Campier Hall, after a European zamind\u0101r, who left money for its construction. It is surrounded by a fine park laid out in 1903, as a memorial to the Queen-Empress. Gorakhpur is the head-quarters of the Commissioner of the Division, of an Executive Engineer, of the Bengal and North-Western Railway Volunteers, and of a squadron of Light Horse, besides the District staff. It also contains the principal station of the Church Missionary Society and Zan\u0101na Mission in the District, and male and female dispensaries.\n\nThe municipality was constituted in 1873. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 68,000 and Rs. 67,000 respectively. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 72,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 51,000) and rents and fees (Rs. 15,000). The expenditure was Rs. 77,000, including conservancy (Rs. 23,000), public safety (Rs. 12,000), administration and collection (Rs. 11,000), and education (Rs. 11,000). The small area which was formerly a cantonment had an income and expenditure of about Rs. 3,000. There has been no garrison for some years past, but in the cold season a d\u00e9p\u00f4t is opened for the recruitment of Gurkhas. Gorakhpur has very little trade, and its inhabitants are largely agriculturists. It is noted for its carpenters and turners, but has no manufactures. A bank has recently been started by native enterprise. The municipality maintains 11 schools and aids 18 others, attended by 1,026 pupils. The Church Missionary Society carries on a useful educational work. St. Andrew's College, which teaches up to the First Arts examination, had 32 students in 1904. There is also a normal school under the Educational department.\n\nGoramur.\u2014Place of religious interest in Sibs\u0101gar District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See Garamur.\n\nGoribidn\u016br,\u2014North-western taluk of Kol\u0101r District, Mysore, lying\nbetween $13^\\circ 25'$ and $13^\\circ 47'$ N. and $77^\\circ 22'$ and $77^\\circ 43'$ E., with an area of 343 square miles. The population in 1901 was 83,296, compared with 71,990 in 1891. The taluk contains one town, Goribidnur (population, 2,441), the head-quarters; and 268 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,60,000. The Penner flows through the taluk from south-east to north, and is joined beyond the northern border by the Kumadvati or Kundar, running parallel with it through the west. The Penner is flanked by the Nandidroog range on the east, and by the hills from Makali-durga on the west. The level of the taluk is much lower than that of the neighbouring parts. The soil is loose and fertile, especially near the chief town. Shallow wells, which never fail, are found here, the sides being protected from falling in by wicker baskets. Sugar-cane, rice, turmeric, and ground-nuts are extensively grown, with coco-nut and areca-nut palms in the south-east. The wild custard-apple is abundant on the hills, where also iron ore is plentiful.\n\nGotardi.\u2014Petty State in Rewa Kantha, Bombay.\n\nGothra.\u2014Petty State in Rewa Kantha, Bombay.\n\nGour.\u2014Ruined city in Malda District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See Gaur.\n\nGovardhangiri.\u2014Fortified hill, 1,720 feet high, in the Sagar taluk of Shimoga District, Mysore, situated in $14^\\circ 10'$ N. and $74^\\circ 40'$ E., on the crest of the Ghats overlooking the village of Gersoppa, which gives its name to the famous Gersoppa Falls. The original fort is said to have been erected in the eighth century by Jinadatta Raya, who named it after the celebrated hill (see Giriraj) near the northern Muttra, whence he came. It is now quite deserted and overgrown with jungle. In front of a Jain temple is a metal pillar, with a long inscription of the sixteenth century, giving an account of the merchants of Gersoppa who erected it.\n\nGovindgarh (or Bhatinda).\u2014Western tahsil of the Anahadgarh nizamat, Patiala State, Punjab, lying between $29^\\circ 33'$ and $30^\\circ 30'$ N. and $74^\\circ 41'$ and $75^\\circ 31'$ E., with an area of 868 square miles. The population in 1901 was 142,413, compared with 123,592 in 1891. The tahsil contains the town of Bhatinda (population, 13,185), the head-quarters; and 196 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 2.7 lakhs.\n\nGovindgarh Town (1).\u2014Town in the Huzur tahsil of Rewah State, Central India, situated in $24^\\circ 23'$ N. and $81^\\circ 18'$ E., on the edge of the Kaimur scarp, 1,200 feet above sea-level. Population (1901), 5,022. Govindgarh is a favourite resort, on account both of its fine position on the edge of the range, affording a magnificent view over the forest-clad region below, and of the sport to be had in the adjoining forest Reserve. The chief has a palace in the town. It contains a post office, a school, and a dispensary.\nGovindgarh Town (2).\u2014Head-quarters of a tahsil of the same name in the State of Alwar, Rajputana, situated in $27^\\circ 30' N.$ and $77^\\circ E.$, 25 miles east of Alwar city. Population (1901), 4,932. The fort, which is about half a mile to the north of the town, was built by Maharao Raja Bakhtawar Singh in 1805, and is remarkable for the extent of its moat. The town possesses a well-paved bazar, a post office, and a vernacular school. The lighting and sanitary arrangements are in the hands of a municipal committee, the average income, chiefly derived from octroi, and expenditure being about Rs. 3,000 and Rs. 1,700 respectively. The Govindgarh tahsil is the smallest in the State, and is situated in the east, forming a peninsula almost entirely surrounded by Bharatpur territory. In 1901 it contained the town and 50 villages, and had a population of 20,646, of whom nearly one-third were Meos. The tahsil lies in Mewat, and was consequently, under Mughal rule, included in the Subah of Agra. At the beginning of the nineteenth century the Khanzadas were in possession; but in 1803 they were ousted by Maharao Raja Bakhtawar Singh with the aid of the Marathas, and the tahsil has since belonged to Alwar.\n\nGovindpur.\u2014Subdivision and village in Manbhum District, Bengal. See GOBINDPUR.\n\nGowhatty.\u2014Subdivision and town in Kamrup District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See GAUHATI.\n\nGr\u00e2ma.\u2014Village in the east of the Hassan taluk of Hassan District, Mysore, situated in $12^\\circ 59' N.$ and $76^\\circ 13' E.$, 7 miles east of Hassan town. Population (1901), 1,936. The place was founded in the twelfth century by S\u00e2ntala Devi, queen of the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana, and called at first S\u00e2ntigr\u00e2ma. A municipality formed in 1893 was converted into a Union in 1904. The income and expenditure during the eight years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 800 and Rs. 700. In 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 800 and Rs. 2,000.\n\nGrey Canals.\u2014A system of inundation canals in the Punjab, taking off from the south bank of the Sutlej and irrigating the low-lying tracts of Ferozepore District. They take their name from Colonel L. J. H. Grey, under whose orders, as Deputy-Commissioner of the District, they were constructed. The work was begun in 1875\u20136, when 11 canals were made; the number was increased to 13 in 1883; and in 1885, after the incorporation of the F\u00e2zilka tahsil in Ferozepore District, two of the canals were remodelled and extended so as to irrigate that tahsil. In addition to these, a new canal, named Kingw\u00e2h, has just been completed at a cost of 1.7 lakhs. The 14 canals as they now exist vary in length from 28 to 107 miles, in bed-width from 30 to 80 feet, and in discharge from 283 to 640 cubic feet per second. Their total length is 1,034 miles, and their aggregate discharge 6,340 cubic feet per second. Being inundation canals, they run only when the Sutlej is at a sufficient\nheight. Up to and including 1905-6 the total cost on original works has been 11.6 lakhs (exclusive of the 1.7 lakhs spent on the new King-w\u0101h Canal), and on repairs and establishment 23.4 lakhs. The average area irrigated during the five years ending 1905-6 was 277 square miles. The canals are remarkable as being constructed and maintained on the co-operative system without any direct aid from Government, except a small grant towards the cost of establishment in F\u0101zilka which has been stopped since the last settlement (1902). The excavation work was performed by the agriculturists whose lands the canal was to benefit, supervised by the ordinary revenue staff of the District. Since 1881 the special establishment required for their upkeep has been met by a charge of 3 to 4 annas per ghumao (five-sixths of an acre); and the annual silt clearance and other works have been carried out at the expense of the irrigators at the average rate of 8 to 10 annas per irrigated ghumao. In addition to these charges for maintenance, a royalty of 12 annas per ghumao of superior, and 6 annas per ghumao of inferior crops is taken by Government.\n\nGubbi T\u0101luk.\u2014Central t\u0101luk of Tumk\u016br District, Mysore, lying between 13\u00b0 2' and 13\u00b0 36' N. and 76\u00b0 42' and 77\u00b0 0' E., with an area of 552 square miles. The population in 1901 was 87,468, compared with 73,570 in 1891. The t\u0101luk contains two towns, Gubbi (population, 5,593), the head-quarters, and Kadaba (1,385); and 421 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,92,000. The Shimsha flows south through the middle of the t\u0101luk, forming the large Kadaba tank. In the north-west are the bare H\u0101galv\u0101di hills, part of the Chik-nayakanhalli auriferous band. The rest of the t\u0101luk is generally open and well watered. The soil is mostly a red mould, shallow and gravelly.\n\nGubbi Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Tumk\u016br District, Mysore, situated in 13\u00b0 18' N. and 76\u00b0 57' E., on the Southern Mahratta Railway, 13 miles west of Tumk\u016br town. Population (1901), 5,593. Gubbi is said to have been founded about the fifteenth century by the hereditary chief of the Nonaba Wokkaligas. It is an important trading place, inhabited by Komatis and Ling\u0101yat Banajigas. It is the entrep\u00f4t of the areca-nut trade between the Nagar Maln\u0101d and W\u0101l\u0101j\u0101pet in North Arcot District. Kopra, or dried coconut, and areca-nuts produced in the surrounding country are largely sold at the fair, together with cotton cloths, blankets, grain, and a variety of other articles, even from distant places, for which a ready market is found. The Wesleyan Mission has a station here. The municipality dates from 1871. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 2,300. In 1903-4 they were Rs. 3,300 and Rs. 4,100.\n\nG\u016bdal\u016br T\u0101luk.\u2014Western t\u0101luk of the Nilgiri District, Madras,\nlying between $11^\\circ 23'$ and $11^\\circ 40'$ N. and $76^\\circ 14'$ and $76^\\circ 36'$ E., at a much lower elevation than the rest of the District. It comprises the South-east Wynaad, which was transferred from Malabar in 1877, and the coffee-growing area called the Ouchterlony Valley. It now contains twelve revenue villages, including G\u016bdal\u016br, the headquarters; but most of the land is held on tenures similar to those in Malabar under the Tirumalp\u0101d of Nilamb\u016br in that District. The inhabitants chiefly talk Malay\u0101lam or an admixture of that language and Tamil. The t\u0101luk has lost its importance since the decline of the coffee and gold- and mica-mining industries, and is now rapidly reverting to jungle, except in a few areas like Nellakotta and Ouchterlony Valley, where coffee and tea still hold their own against the insidious lantana. Pandal\u016br and Cherumb\u0101di, which, with Dev\u0101la, were once important mining settlements, have now dwindled to a few native huts. The t\u0101luk is most sparsely inhabited, containing on an area of 280 square miles a population (1901) of 21,139, or only 75 persons per square mile. In 1891 the population was 25,397, the decline being due to the restriction of the industrial enterprises above mentioned. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 53,000.\n\nG\u016bdal\u016br Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in the Nilgiri District, Madras, situated in $11^\\circ 30'$ N. and $76^\\circ 30'$ E., at the foot of the G\u016bdal\u016br gh\u0101t, on the road from Ootacamund to Calicut and at the junction of the main roads from Mysore and Malabar. Population (1901), 2,558. G\u016bdal\u016br is the head-quarters of the deputy-tahs\u012bld\u0101r, who is also a District Munsif, and of a sheristad\u0101r magistrate, who is also sub-registrar. When the coffee and gold-mining industries were flourishing the place was of considerable importance, but with their decline it has rapidly decayed. The weekly market is, however, well attended, most of the articles sold being imported from Mysore, and a good deal of traffic between Mysore and Ootacamund passes through it. The place contains Protestant and Roman Catholic churches, a hospital with a European ward, post and police offices, and two travellers' bungalows.\n\nGuddgudd\u0101pur (or Devargud).\u2014Town and place of pilgrimage in the R\u0101mbennur t\u0101luka of Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District, Bombay, situated in $14^\\circ 40'$ N. and $75^\\circ 35'$ E. Population (1901), 947. The fair held in October in honour of Mall\u0101ri or Siva is attended by between 5,000 and 10,000 pilgrims. There is a temple of Mall\u0101ri, who is reputed to have become incarnate as Bhairav and thus to have slain the demon Malla. His attendants, known as V\u0101ggyas, are alleged to be descended from dogs incarnate as men. They receive the pilgrims dressed in tiger- or bear-skins, perform numerous antics, and receive gifts of a few pies from each pilgrim. In 1878 Guddgudd\u0101pur was constituted\na temporary municipality. The income, derived from a pilgrim and a shop tax, averaged Rs. 662 during the decade ending 1901. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 174.\n\nGudiy\u0101ttam.\u2014T\u0101luk and town in North Arcot District, Madras. See Gudiy\u0101ttam.\n\nGudiv\u0101da.\u2014Subdivision and t\u0101luk of Kistna District, Madras, lying between 16\u00b0 16' and 16\u00b0 47' N. and 80\u00b0 55' and 81\u00b0 23' E., and comprising within its limits the greater part of that curious depression between the alluvial deposits of the Kistna and God\u0101vari rivers which is known as the Colair Lake. It has an area of 595 square miles. The population in 1901 was 151,916, compared with 118,310 in 1891. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 10,19,000. Most of the t\u0101luk is under cultivation, being irrigated from the canals of the Kistna system. Gudiv\u0101da Town, the head-quarters, is a Union with a population of 6,719, and there are 212 villages. A deputy-tahs\u012bld\u0101r is stationed at Kaikalur on the southern edge of the Colair Lake.\n\nGudiv\u0101da Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Kistna District, Madras, situated in 16\u00b0 27' N. and 81\u00b0 E. Population (1901), 6,719. It is a place of great antiquity. A ruined Buddhist st\u016bpa is to be seen in the middle of it, in which four caskets are said to have been found. To the west is a fine Jain statue in good preservation. Farther west is a mound, the old site of the town. Here massive pottery, beads of all kinds in metals, stone, and glass, and Andhra lead coins have been found.\n\nGudiy\u0101ttam T\u0101luk. T\u0101luk in the south of North Arcot District, Madras, lying between 12\u00b0 42' and 13\u00b0 5' N. and 78\u00b0 35' and 79\u00b0 16' E., with an area of 447 square miles. It contains one town, Gudiy\u0101ttam (population, 21,335), the head-quarters; and 183 villages. Population rose from 176,709 in 1891 to 195,665 in 1901. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 3,27,500. The t\u0101luk is a long strip of land lying on the northern bank of the P\u0101l\u0101r, opposite to the Vellore t\u0101luk on the other side of the river. The Eastern Gh\u0101ts throw many spurs into its western portion, which is thus mainly composed of hills interspersed with valleys. The soil is generally good, being a mixture of sand and red clay.\n\nGudiy\u0101ttam Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in North Arcot District, Madras, situated in 12\u00b0 58' N. and 78\u00b0 53' E., 3 miles north of the P\u0101l\u0101r and about the same distance from the railway station, which is 96 miles from Madras and 318 from Calicut. Population (1901), 21,335. Gudiy\u0101ttam was constituted a municipality in 1885. The municipal receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 16,600 and Rs. 16,000 respectively. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 21,200, the chief source being the house\nand land taxes; and the expenditure was Rs. 21,400. A scheme for providing a water supply is under consideration. Gudiyattam is a clean, well-arranged town, most of the houses being tiled and the streets well laid out. The chief industry is weaving; but Labbais and Kanarese merchants carry on a brisk trade, the former in jaggery, hides, tamarinds, tobacco, and gh\u012b, and the latter in petty shopkeeping and money-lending. Every Tuesday a large cattle fair takes place which rivals that of R\u0101nipet. Some 500 head of cattle are usually exposed for sale, besides the goods found in all ordinary markets.\n\nG\u016bd\u016br Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of Nellore District, Madras, consisting of the t\u0101lukks of G\u016bd\u016br and R\u0101p\u016br and the zamind\u0101ri tahsils of Venkatagiri and Pol\u016br.\n\nG\u016bd\u016br T\u0101luk.\u2014T\u0101luk of Nellore District, Madras, lying between 13\u00b0 29' and 14\u00b0 25' N. and 79\u00b0 43' and 80\u00b0 16' E., with an area of 910 square miles. The population in 1901 was 144,209, compared with 136,009 in 1891. It contains one town, G\u016bd\u016br (population, 17,251), the head-quarters; and 144 villages. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 4,39,000. Included in it is S\u1e5b\u012bharikoti Island, formerly part of Madras District. On the shore stands Armagon, the site of one of the earliest English settlements on the Coromandel coast. The t\u0101luk is low-lying, being nowhere more than 400 feet above the sea. The coast villages contain many palmyra trees, large casuarina plantations, and wide areas of swampy land. In the west, towards R\u0101p\u016br and Venkatagiri, the soil becomes hard and rocky; but in the east, along the shore, it consists of a sandy subsoil, with either clay or black soil at the surface. The Swarnamukhi, Kandleru, and Saidapuram are the chief rivers. Indigo was manufactured to a considerable extent, but the industry has now greatly declined owing to the fall in the price of the natural dye.\n\nG\u016bd\u016br Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision and t\u0101luk of the same name in Nellore District, Madras, situated in 14\u00b0 9' N. and 79\u00b0 52' E., at the junction of the Madras and South Indian Railways. The population, according to the Census of 1901, was 17,251; but the three villages (Chenn\u016br, Vind\u016br, and Manubolu) then included in its Union have since been separated and Chillak\u016br included instead. The population of G\u016bd\u016br proper may be taken at about 9,000. Agriculture is the chief occupation of the people. Mats are made to a small extent in Virareddipalli, one of its hamlets. Rice and chillies are exported in small quantities.\n\nGugera Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of Montgomery District, Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 39' and 31\u00b0 33' N. and 72\u00b0 59' and 73\u00b0 45' E., on both sides of the R\u0101vi, with an area of 824 square miles. The population in 1901 was 119,622, compared with 113,447 in 1891. It contains 341 villages, including Gugera, the tahsil head-quarters, which was from\n1852 to 1865 the head-quarters of the District. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 1,33,000. On the south, the tahsil includes portions of the Sutlej valley, rising abruptly into the desert plateau of the Ganji B\u0101r, which lies between the old bank of the Be\u0101s on the south and that of the R\u0101vi on the north. Below the latter lies a strip of jungle, with patches of cultivation. Farther north come the riverain tracts on both sides of the R\u0101vi, which are scantily irrigated by inundation canals, and, beyond the river, rise gently towards the Sandal B\u0101r. The Deg torrent flows in a deep bed close to the northern border of the tahsil, and falls into the R\u0101vi near Gugera.\n\nGuindy.\u2014Village in Chingleput District, Madras. See Madras City.\n\nGujar\u0101t.\u2014This name, taken in its widest sense, signifies the whole country in which Gujar\u0101ti is spoken, including Cutch and K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, as well as the northern Districts and States of the Bombay Presidency from P\u0101lanpur to Daman: that is, the country lying between 20\u00b0 9' and 24\u00b0 43' N. and 68\u00b0 25' and 72\u00b0 22' E. In a narrower and more correct sense, the name applies to the central plain north of the Narbad\u0101 and east of the Rann of Cutch and K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. Gujar\u0101t, in this sense, lies between 23\u00b0 25' and 24\u00b0 4' N. and 71\u00b0 1' and 74\u00b0 1' E., and has an area of 29,071 square miles and a population (1901) of 4,798,504. Of this area less than one-fourth (7,168 square miles), chiefly in the centre and south, is British territory, belonging to the four Districts of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, Kaira, Panch Mah\u0101ls, and Broach. About 4,902 square miles, chiefly in two blocks\u2014one lying west of the S\u0101barmati and the other between the Mah\u012b and the Narbad\u0101\u2014belong to Baroda. The remainder belongs to the large and small States that have relations with the Bombay Government, and is distributed among the Agencies of P\u0101lanpur in the north, Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101 in the north-east, Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101 in the east, and Cambay at the mouth of the S\u0101barmati.\n\nThe plain of Gujar\u0101t is bounded on the north by the desert of M\u0101rw\u0101r, and on the east by the hills of crystalline rock that run southeast from Abu to join the western outliers of the Vindhyas near P\u0101v\u0101garh. From these hills, in the neighbourhood of which the country is rough, rocky, and well wooded, it slopes in a south-westerly direction towards the Rann of Cutch, the Nal Lake, and the sea, unbroken by any rocky outcrop or rising ground. The central region is of recent alluvial formation and has one of the richest soils in India, though parts of it are liable to flooding in the rains, and it suffered much in the famine of 1899-1902. Towards the Rann, the Nal Lake, and the sea-coast, the plain passes into salt or sandy waste, where the subsoil water is brackish and lies deep below the surface. The grazing lands of P\u0101lanpur in the north are watered by the Ban\u0101s and Saraswat\u012b, which flow from the Ar\u0101valli mountains into the Little Rann. The S\u0101barmati, rising near the source of the Ban\u0101s, flows into the Gulf\nof Cambay. Farther east, the Mahi, rising far away in M\u0101lw\u0101, flows into the same gulf, which finally receives also the waters of the Narbada, the lower course of which passes between Central Baroda and R\u0101jpipla and through the British District of Broach. The central and coast tracts are stoneless, and have fine groves of field trees, while the eastern hills are covered with forest. The spread of cultivation has driven the tiger, leopard, and bear into the eastern hills, and greatly reduced the numbers of wild hog; but antelope and nilgai are still common. Game-birds, both on land and water, abound.\n\nThe name Gujar\u0101t is derived from the widespread Gujar tribe, which is not, however, at the present day of much account in the province. According to some writers, the Gujar\u0101s were immigrants from Central Asia. There is no certain trace of them in India before the sixth century, by the end of which they were powerful in R\u0101jputana and had set up a kingdom at Broach, so they most likely entered India with the White Huns in the latter half of the fifth century. The Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsiang (A.D. 640) was acquainted with the kingdom of Broach, and also with a Gurjara kingdom farther north which he calls Kiu-chi-lo, having its capital at Pilo-mo-lo, which is plausibly identified with Bhilm\u0101l in the Jodhpur State. In its earliest form (Gurjarar\u0101tra), the name Gujar\u0101t is applied in inscriptions of the ninth century to the country north of Ajmer and the S\u0101mbhar Lake, while from the tenth to the thirteenth century Gujar\u0101t means the Solanki kingdom of Anhilv\u0101da. In the Musalm\u0101n period the name was applied to the province that was governed first from Anhilv\u0101da and then from Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nFor the history of Gujar\u0101t in the pre-Muhammadan period and its invasion by Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni, see BOMBAY PRESIDENCY and ANHILVADA. By about 1233 the Solanki kingdom of Anhilv\u0101da had broken up, and the most powerful rulers in Gujar\u0101t were the V\u0101ghela chiefs of Dholka.\n\n\u2018An inaccessible position, beyond the great desert and the hills connecting the Vindhyas with the Ar\u0101valli range, long preserved Gujar\u0101t from the Muhammadan yoke. Only by sea was it easily approached, and to the sea it owed its peculiar advantages, . . . its favouring climate and fertile soil. . . . The greater part of the Indian trade with Persia, Arabia, and the Red Sea passed through its harbours, besides a busy coasting trade. \u201cThe benefit of this trade overflowed upon the country, which became a garden, and enriched the treasury of the prince. The noble mosques, colleges, palaces, and tombs, the remains of which still adorn Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d and its other cities to this day, while they excite the admiration of the traveller, prove both the wealth and the taste of the founders!\u201d. Not till the reign of Al\u0101-ud-din (of Delhi) at the close of the thirteenth century did it become a Muslim province, and a century later it became independent again under a dynasty of Muslim\n\n1 Erskine, History of India, vol. i, p. 21.\nkings. . . . Firoz Sh\u0101h in 1391 granted the fief of Gujar\u0101t to Zafar Kh\u0101n, the son of a converted R\u0101jput, and five years later the fief-holder assumed the royal canopy. He soon enlarged his dominions, at first but a strip between hills and sea, by the annexation of Idar to the north and Diu in K\u0101thi\u0101war, plundered Jh\u0101lor, and even took possession of M\u0101lw\u0101 for a short space in 1407, setting his brother on the throne in the place of Hoshang, the son of Dilawar. His successor Ahmad I (1411-43) founded Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, which has ever since been the chief city of Gujar\u0101t, and recovered Bombay and Salsette from the Deccan kings. Mahm\u016bd I (1458-1511) not only carried on the traditional wars of his dynasty with M\u0101lw\u0101 on the east and Kh\u0101ndesh on the south, but kept a large fleet to subdue the pirates of the islands.\n\n'Nor were Asiatic pirates the only disturbers of his coast. The first of the three great waves of European invasion was already beating on the shores of Gujar\u0101t. Vasco da Gama had reached the Malabar port in 1498, and the effects of the new influence were soon felt farther north. The Portuguese had no more intention, at first, of founding an eastern empire than the later Dutch and English companies. The hostility of the Muslim traders compelled them to protect their agents, and a commercial policy was necessarily supported by military power. . . . The collision was brought about by the spirited action of the last Maml\u016bk Sult\u0101n of Egypt, K\u0101nsuh-el-Ghuri, who, realizing the imminent jeopardy of the great Indian trade which supplied so much of the wealth of Egypt, resolved to drive the Portuguese from the Arabian Sea. The Maml\u016bks had long maintained a fleet in the Red Sea, and Admiral Husain was dispatched in 1508 to Gujar\u0101t with a well-equipped war squadron manned with sailors who had often fought with Christian fleets in the Mediterranean. He was joined by the fleet of Gujar\u0101t, commanded by the governor of Diu, in spite of the efforts of the Portuguese captain, Louren\u00e7o de Almeida, to prevent their union; and the combined fleet was in every respect superior to the flotilla of Christian merchantmen which boldly sailed out of the port of Chaul to the attack. The Portuguese were defeated in a running fight which lasted two days, and the young captain, son of the famous viceroy, was killed. . . . He was avenged a few months later, when on February 2, 1509, his father, the viceroy Francisco de Almeida, utterly defeated the combined fleet of Egypt and Gujar\u0101t off Diu. In the following year the king of Gujar\u0101t offered Albuquerque, the conqueror of Goa, the port of Diu, and a Portuguese factory was there established in 1513, though the celebrated fortress of the Christian invaders was not built till 1535.\n\n'Though unable to withstand the Portuguese\u2014or perhaps not unwilling to see his powerful deputy at Diu humiliated\u2014Bah\u0101dur (1526-37) was one of the most brilliant figures among the warrior kings of Gujar\u0101t. The R\u0101jputs of the hills and the kings of the Deccan owned his superiority, and in 1531 he annexed M\u0101lw\u0101. A R\u0101jput rising and the advance of the Mughals under Hum\u0101y\u016bn the son of B\u0101bar for a time destroyed his authority (1535), but he recovered it bravely (1536), only to fall at last, drowned in a scuffle with the Portuguese whom he had admitted to his coast.'\n\n1 S. Lane-Poole, Medieval India ('Story of the Nations'), chap. vii.\nIn 1572 Akbar annexed Gujar\u0101t to the Mughal empire, of which it became a Subah. At its best period the independent Muhammadan kingdom of Gujar\u0101t comprised Northern Gujar\u0101t from Abu to the Narbad\u0101 : K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, which became a Musalm\u0101n province through the occupation of Diu (1402) and Girn\u0101r (1471), and the sack of Dw\u0101rka Bet (1473): the T\u0101pti valley as far east as Th\u0101lner; and the tract between the Gh\u0101ts and the sea from Surat to Bombay.\n\nThe Mughal viceroys of Gujar\u0101t were, up to the death of Aurangzeb (1707), on the whole successful in maintaining order and prosperity, in spite of the turbulence of the Kolis and R\u0101jputs in the north, of famines in 1596, 1631, 1681, 1684, and 1697\u20138, and of the Deccani attacks on Surat, which was sacked once by Malik Ambar (1609) and twice by Sivaji (1664 and 1670). Throughout the Mughal period the province generally yielded a revenue of nearly 2 crores, and a large foreign trade was carried on at the ports of Cambay, Broach, and Surat. The decline of Mughal rule began with a Mar\u0101th\u0101 raid across the Narbad\u0101 in 1705. From 1711 these invasions became annual, and the Mar\u0101th\u0101s established themselves successively at Songarh (1719), Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner (1723), and Baroda (1734). The beginning of the end came during the governorship of Sarbuland Kh\u0101n (1723\u201330), who farmed out the revenues and admitted the Mar\u0101th\u0101 claims to chauth and sardeshmukhi. Henceforward, although the Delhi court continued to appoint viceroys until 1748, absolute anarchy reigned in the province, which was ravaged impartially by the hostile leaders of the Peshw\u0101\u2019s and the Gaikw\u0101r\u2019s armies, by the R\u0101j\u0101s of Jodhpur, by the agents of the Niz\u0101m-ul-mulk, and by local Moslem chiefs, such as the B\u0101bis, who established themselves at Jun\u0101garh (1738) and B\u0101lasinor (1761), the Jh\u0101loris, who settled at P\u0101lanpur (1715), and Mom\u00edn Kh\u0101n, who began to scheme for the independence of Cambay about 1736. Famines in 1719, 1732, and 1747 added to the misery of the people. In 1737 the Gaikw\u0101r was admitted to a full half-share in the revenues of the province and occupied Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d jointly with the viceroy\u2019s troops (1738). Broach from 1731 to 1752 was held by a deputy of the Niz\u0101m, but had to give up a share of its customs to the Gaikw\u0101r. Surat suffered chiefly from the violence of rival candidates for the governorship.\n\nGujar\u0101t was now parcelled out among a number of local chiefs who carried on ceaseless petty wars, which the Mar\u0101th\u0101s had no wish to suppress so long as they could secure their share of the plunder of the province. The Peshw\u0101\u2019s seizure of half the Gaikw\u0101r\u2019s share in 1751 only added another claimant of blackmail. After the battle of P\u0101n\u012bpat the Musalm\u0101ns tried but failed to drive out the Gaikw\u0101r (1761), and the last chance of a strong native government growing up was ruined by the disputed succession at Baroda in 1768. The\nlocal troubles at Surat lasted until the castle was taken by the British in 1759.\n\nThe Mar\u0101th\u0101 confederacy now began to break up, and the Gaikw\u0101r was detached by his acceptance of British protection (1782). In Gujar\u0101t there was little improvement in the government during this period, though, in spite of disputes in the Gaikw\u0101r's family and intrigues at the Poona court, a semblance of order was preserved by British influence from 1782 to 1799, when the Gaikw\u0101r took Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d and imprisoned the Peshw\u0101's agent. Further disturbances then took place, which were put down by a British force (1803). In 1799 the Peshw\u0101 had farmed his rights to the Gaikw\u0101r, who was already in subsidiary alliance with the British. Negotiations followed between the British, the Peshw\u0101, and the Gaikw\u0101r, which ended in the cession to the first named of certain districts and rights in Gujar\u0101t. The British Government had annexed Surat in 1800 on the death of the Naw\u0101b, whose family were pensioned off, and had conquered Broach from Sindhia in the war of 1803.\n\nAfter the overthrow of the Peshw\u0101 in 1818 territorial arrangements in Gujar\u0101t settled down into their present form, the country being divided between the British Districts of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, Broach, Kaira, P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls, and Surat, the State of Baroda, and a number of small Native States. Gujar\u0101t suffered very severely from famine in 1899\u20131902, a period which was marked by great mortality both of men and cattle. The blow fell more severely from the fact that it came after a long period of prosperity, so that the people and the officials were alike unprepared for the calamities that followed.\n\n[See Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, P\u0101lanpur, Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, and Cambay.

It is bounded on the east by the Jhelum river, which cuts it off from Kashmir territory. Except for a low ridge of sandstone hills along the Jhelum, the tahsil consists of a plain intersected by numerous ravines. The population in 1901 was 150,566, compared with 152,455 in 1891. It contains 381 villages, of which G\u00fcjar Kh\u0101n is the head-quarters. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 2\u00b77 lakhs.\n\nGujr\u0101nw\u0101la District.\u2014District in the Lahore Division of the Punjab, lying in the Rechna Do\u0101b, between 31\u00b0 31' and 32\u00b0 31' N. and 73\u00b0 10' and 74\u00b0 24' E., with an area of 3,198 square miles. From the Chen\u0101b, which borders it for 80 miles on the north-west and separates it from the Districts of Gujar\u0101t and Sh\u0101hpur, the District\nstretches in a rough rectangle towards the R\u0101vi, the north-west part of Lahore District separating it from that river. On the east it is bounded by Si\u0101lkot, and on the west by Jhang. Excepting its south-eastern corner, which is traversed by the Degh stream, it is a flat stretch of country, unrelieved by hill or ravine, and absolutely featureless. The District naturally falls into two main divisions: the low-lying alluvial lands fringing the Chen\u0101b and Degh, and the upland between them. Geographically and physically, it lies between the fertile submontane District of Si\u0101lkot and the desert of Jhang; and the upland decreases in natural fertility as the distance from the Him\u0101layas increases, until in the south-west it merges in the B\u0101r tract, which in its natural aspect is a level prairie thickly covered with a stunted undergrowth. The Chen\u0101b Canal, which irrigates the H\u0101fizab\u0101d and Kh\u0101ng\u0101h Dogr\u0101n tahsils in this District, has, however, changed the desert into a garden, and the immigrant population bids fair to outnumber the original inhabitants.\n\nThere is nothing of geological interest in the District, which is situated entirely on the alluvium. Most of it was waste until the recent extension of the canal system, and possessed the marked, if scanty, features of the arid Western Punjab B\u0101r flora, trees being represented solely by the van (Salvadora), jand (Prosopis), and the large tamarisk, with kari (Capparis aphylla) and malh\u0101 (Zizyphus nummularia) as bushes. This is now disappearing, but the field annuals maintain a closer relationship with the Western Punjab than with the flora of the upper Gangetic plain or the submontane tract. The ber (Zizyphus Jujuba) is found in groves and gardens, in the eastern part especially, but has usually been planted.\n\nAntelope are to be found near Shekh\u016bpura and hog deer occasionally in all parts. Wild hog are plentiful in the forest Reserves near Waz\u012brab\u0101d.\n\nThe climate differs little from that of the Punjab plains, but the District is reputed healthy. The extremes of temperature are greatest in the B\u0101r, where the rainfall is scanty and the heat in the summer months excessive. The natives of this tract are an exceptionally strong and healthy race; but to strangers the hot months are most trying, ophthalmia, blindness, and diseases of the skin commonly resulting from exposure to the glaring sun and extreme heat.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages about 18 inches, with a maximum of 32 inches in 1890\u20131 and a minimum of 9 inches in 1891\u20132. The fall diminishes rapidly as the hills are left behind, varying from over 20 inches on the Si\u0101lkot border to only 10 or 12 inches in the B\u0101r.\n\nGeneral Cunningham\u2019s theory as to the identity of Sangla with the Sangala captured by Alexander is referred to in the article on that\nplace. The village of Asar\u016br has been identified as the site of the town of Tse-kie or T\u0101ki, visited by Hiuen Tsiang about A.D. 630, and described by him as the capital of the Punjab. Here immense ruins of Buddhist origin are still to be seen, and their date is marked by the discovery of coins as well as by the great size of the bricks, which is characteristic of the period when they were constructed. After the time of Hiuen Tsiang, we know little of Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la, until the Muhammadan invasions bring back regular chronological history. Meanwhile, however, T\u0101ki had fallen into oblivion, and Lahore had become the chief city of the Punjab.\n\nUnder Muhammadan rule the District flourished. From the days of Akbar to those of Aurangzeb, wells were scattered over the whole country, and villages lay thickly dotted about the southern plateau, now a barren waste of grass land and scrub jungle. Their remains may still be found in the wildest and most solitary reaches of the B\u0101r. Emin\u0101bad and Hafiz\u0101bad were the chief towns, while the country was divided into six well-tilled parganas. The principal architectural remains of the Mughal period are described in the article on Shekh\u016bpura. But before the close of the Muhammadan period the tract was mysteriously depopulated. The tribes at present occupying the District are all immigrants of recent date, and before their advent the whole region seems for a time to have been almost entirely abandoned. The only plausible conjecture to account for this sudden and disastrous change is that it resulted from the constant wars by which the Punjab was convulsed during the last years of Muhammadan supremacy. On the rise of Sikh power, the waste plains of Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la were seized by the military adventurers who then sprang up. Charat Singh, the grandfather of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ranjit Singh, took possession of the village of Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la, then an inconsiderable hamlet, and made it the headquarters of himself and of his son and grandson. Minor Sikh chieftains settled at Waz\u012brab\u0101d, Shekh\u016bpura, and other towns; while in the western portion of the District the R\u0101jput Bhattis and Chath\u0101s maintained a sturdy independence. In the end, however, Ranjit Singh succeeded in bringing all the scattered portions of the District under his own power. The great Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was himself born at Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la, and the town continued to be his capital up to his occupation of Lahore. The mausoleum of his father is still to be seen there, and a lofty cupola close by covers a portion of the ashes of Ranjit Singh himself. The Sikh rule, which was elsewhere so disastrous, appears to have been an unmitigated benefit to Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la. Ranjit Singh settled large colonies in the various villages, and was very successful in encouraging cultivation throughout the depopulated plain of the B\u0101r. In the Degh valley, especially, he planted a body of hard-working Hindus, the Lab\u0101nas, to whom he granted the land at a nominal rent.\non condition that each cultivator should bring under tillage the ground allotted to him.\n\nIn 1847 the District came under British influence, in connexion with the regency at Lahore; and two years later, in 1849, it was included in the territory annexed after the second Sikh War. A cantonment was established at Wazirabad, which was abolished in 1855. The District formed a part originally of the extensive District of Wazirabad, which comprised the whole upper portion of the Rechna Doab. In 1852 this unwieldy territory was divided between Gujranwala and Sialkot. The District, as then constituted, stretched across the entire plateau, from the Chenab to the Ravi; but in 1853 the south-eastern fringe, consisting of 303 villages, was transferred to Lahore, and three years later a second batch of 324 villages was handed over to the same District. There was no outbreak during the Mutiny, and the Sikh Sardars and people rallied to the side of Government with the greatest enthusiasm.\n\nThe District contains 8 towns and 1,331 villages. Its population at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 616,892, (1891) 690,169, and (1901) 890,577. During the last decade it increased by 29 per cent., the increase being greatest in the Hafizabad and Khangah Dogran tahsils, owing to the extension of canal-irrigation and the colonization of the Bar. It is divided into four tahsils\u2014Gujranwala, Wazirabad, Hafizabad, and Khangah Dogran\u2014the head-quarters of each being at the place from which it is named. The chief towns are the municipalities of Gujranwala, the head-quarters of the District, Wazirabad, Ramnagar, Akalgargh, Eminabad, Kila Dinar Singh, and the 'notified area' of Sodhra.\n\nThe following table shows the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil       | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Gujranwala   | 756                  | 3               | 445      | 252,863    | 334\u00b75                     | - 6\u00b71                                                        | 11,605                                 |\n| Wazirabad    | 457                  | 4               | 254      | 183,205    | 400\u00b79                     | 0\u00b72                                                          | 8,158                                  |\n| Khangah Dogran | 873                | 230             |          | 237,843    | 272\u00b74                     | + 91\u00b75                                                      | 6,322                                  |\n| Hafizabad    | 895                  | 1               | 393      | 216,666    | 242\u00b71                     |                                                             | 4,736                                  |\n| District total | 3,198              | 8               | 1,331    | 890,577    | 278\u00b75                     | + 29                                                        | 30,821                                 |\n\nNote.\u2014The figures for the areas of tahsils are taken from revenue returns. The total area of the District is that given in the Census Report.\n\nMuhammadans number 603,464, or 67 per cent. of the total; Hindus, 208,557, or 23 per cent.; and Sikhs, 71,950. The density\nof population is 278 persons per square mile, as compared with the Provincial average of 209. The language usually spoken is Punjabi.\n\nThe most numerous tribes are the agricultural Jats, who number 246,000, or 27 per cent. of the total population. Next to them in numerical strength come the Arains (44,000), and after them the Rajputs (28,000). Saiyids number 9,000. Of the commercial and money-lending classes, the most numerous are the Aroras and Khatrins, who number 41,000 and 26,000 respectively. The Khojas, a Muhammadan commercial class, number 6,000. The Brahmins return 20,000. Of the artisan classes, the Kumhars (potters, 36,000), Tarkhans (carpenters, 36,000), Julahas (weavers, 34,000), Mochis (shoemakers and leather-workers, 31,000), Lohars (blacksmiths, 18,000), Telis (oil-pressers, 15,000), and Sonars (goldsmiths, 9,000) are the most important; and of the menials, the Chuiras and Musallis (sweepers, 91,000), Machhis (Muhammadan fishermen, bakers, and water-carriers, 24,000), Nais (barbers, 19,000), Chhimbas and Dhobis (washer-men, 11,000), and Jhinwars (Hindu water-carriers, 6,000). Kashmiris number 26,000. Other castes worth mention are the Mirasis (village minstrels, 15,000), Fakirs (mendicants, 11,000), and Barwala (village watchmen and messengers, 7,000). The Ulamas, a Muhammadan priestly class, stronger here than in any other District of the Province, number 10,000. About 49 per cent. of the population are dependent on agriculture.\n\nThe Sialkot Mission of the Church of Scotland established a branch at Wazirabad in 1863, and the United Presbyterian American Mission came to Gujranwala from Sialkot in the same year. The Roman Catholic missionaries have a station at the village of Maryabad, founded in 1892. The District contained 5,592 native Christians in 1901.\n\nThe fertility of the soil and the rainfall decrease as the distance from the hills increases. The soil varies in quality from a stiff clay, found chiefly in the drainage channels on the Sialkot border, to a light sandy soil only fit for inferior autumn crops. The introduction of canal-irrigation has, however, to a large extent equalized the agricultural conditions in the various parts of the District, which is now one of the richest in the Punjab.\n\nExcept in the Chenab Colony, the District is held chiefly on the bhaiyachara and patidari tenures. Zamindari lands cover about 14 square miles, and lands leased from Government about 388 square miles, chiefly in the colony. The area for which details are available from the revenue records of 1903\u20134 is 2,978 square miles, as shown on the next page.\n\nWheat is the chief crop of the spring harvest, covering 604 square miles in 1903\u20134. Gram occupied 174 square miles, and barley 51.\nCotton is the chief staple of the autumn harvest (86 square miles), and great millet is the principal food-grain (95 square miles). Rice occupied 73 square miles, and maize, spiked millet, and pulses 57, 47, and 153 respectively. There were 31 square miles under sugar-cane in that year.\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Gujranwala | 756   | 490        | 314       | 214              |\n| Wazirabad  | 455   | 266        | 219       | 113              |\n| Khangah Dogran | 873 | 553        | 468       | 276              |\n| Hafizabad  | 894   | 500        | 425       | 333              |\n| **Total**  | **2,978** | **1,809** | **1,426** | **936**          |\n\nThe cultivated area increased by 45 per cent. during the decade ending 1900, owing to the construction of the Chenab Canal, which has totally changed the agricultural conditions of the tract irrigated by it. Nothing of importance has been done towards improving the quality of the crops grown; but, as usual in canal-irrigated tracts, the cultivators display a marked tendency to substitute the more valuable spring crops for those reaped in the autumn. Loans for the construction of wells are taken steadily, nearly Rs. 7,000 having been advanced during the five years ending 1903\u20134 under the Land Improvement Loans Act; but there is yet much room for a further increase in the number of wells.\n\nBefore the construction of the Chenab Canal the south-western portion was chiefly inhabited by pastoral tribes; but the introduction of canal-irrigation and the consequent contraction of the area available for grazing has largely diminished the number of live-stock, though the cattle are still of good quality. An important fair is held at Shahkot for the benefit of the colonists, and a cattle fair is also held at Eminabad. The indigenous breed of horses is not above the average; the Army Remount department maintains six horse and six donkey stallions, and the District board four pony stallions. An annual horse show is held at Gujranwala. Sheep and goats are kept, but not in large numbers, and there are but few camels.\n\nOf the total area cultivated in 1903\u20134, 1,426 square miles, or 79 per cent., were classed as irrigated. Of this area, 663 square miles were irrigated from wells, 19 from wells and canals, 741 from canals, and 1,033 acres from tanks. In addition, 63 square miles, or nearly 4 per cent. of the cultivated area, were subject to inundation from the Chenab. The Chenab Canal takes off at the village of Khanki and its main line runs through the District, giving off the Jhang, Mi\u00e1n Ali, and Gugera upper branches, and irrigating the Hafizabad and Khangah Dogran tahsils. Most of the canal-irrigated area was formerly waste.\nand is included within the limits of the Chen\u0101b Colony. The District has 12,786 masonry wells, worked by cattle with Persian wheels, chiefly found in the tract bordering on Si\u0101lkot. It also possesses 277 water-lifts, unbricked wells, and lever wells, mostly in the riverain tracts. Cultivation on the land inundated by the river is precarious, and mainly confined to the spring harvest.\n\nThere are 2\u00b72 square miles of 'reserved' and 6 of unclassed forests under the Deputy-Conservator of the Chen\u0101b Forest division, and 7\u00b71 square miles of unclassed forest and Government waste under the Deputy-Commissioner. With the exception of a few shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo) plantations, these forests consist only of scrub and grass land, but form valuable fuel and fodder reserves. Avenues of shisham have been planted along the roads and canal banks, but on the whole the District is not well wooded. In 1904 the forest revenue was 1\u00b72 lakhs.\n\nThe sole mineral product is kankar or nodular limestone, which is found in considerable abundance.\n\nThe village of Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d enjoys a reputation for cutlery of various descriptions, and also for the manufacture of silver-headed walking-sticks. Silk is woven to a small extent, and the goldsmiths' work of the District has some celebrity. Brass vessels are made and ivory-turning carried on at Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la. Cotton cloth is woven in considerable quantities. The District contains 12 steam mills and factories, which in 1904 employed 475 hands in all. Five of them are cotton-ginning and pressing factories, three are flour-mills, three combine flour-milling with cotton-ginning, and one is a combined flour-mill and oil-press. The principal centres of the mill industries are Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la, H\u0101sz\u0101b\u0101d, and S\u0101ngla.\n\nA large and growing export trade is carried on in wheat and other grains, cotton, and oilseeds; brass vessels and gh\u016b are also exported. The chief imports are iron, piece-goods, and sugar. Waz\u012br\u0101b\u0101d is the centre of a considerable trade in timber floated down the Chen\u0101b from the Him\u0101layas.\n\nThe main line of the North-Western Railway passes through the District inside its eastern border, and a branch from Waz\u012br\u0101b\u0101d down the Rechna Do\u0101b runs through the heart of the District, tapping the wealth of the Chen\u0101b Colony. The Waz\u012br\u0101b\u0101d-Si\u0101lkot branch also has a length of 6 miles in the District. The grand trunk road runs parallel to the main line of railway, and a metalled road to Si\u0101lkot parallel to the latter branch. The total length of metalled roads is 75 miles, and of unmetalled roads 1,309 miles. Of these, 56 miles of metalled and 40 of unmetalled roads are under the Public Works department, the rest being maintained from Local funds. The Chen\u0101b, which is now little used for traffic, is crossed by eleven ferries.\n\nPrior to the construction of the Chen\u0101b Canal, agriculture over the\ngreater part of the District was very precarious, and the B\u0101r was inhabited by nomad tribes who grew crops only in the most favourable seasons. All the famines, therefore, which visited the Punjab up to 1890 affected Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la more or less seriously. The construction of the canal has, however, entirely altered the conditions of the District, which now exports food-grains even in famine years. The area of the crops matured in the famine year 1899\u20131900 amounted to 77 per cent. of the normal.\n\nThe District is in charge of a Deputy-Commissioner, aided by three Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, of whom one is in charge of the treasury. It is divided into the four tahs\u012bls of Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la, H\u0101fiz\u0101b\u0101d, Waz\u012br\u0101b\u0101d, and Kh\u0101ng\u0101h Dogr\u0101n, each under a tahs\u012bld\u0101r assisted by a naib-tahs\u012bld\u0101r. Two Executive Engineers of the Upper Chen\u0101b Canal have their head-quarters at Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la, and one of the Lower Chen\u0101b Canal at Kh\u0101nki. Waz\u012br\u0101b\u0101d is the head-quarters of an Extra-Deputy-Conservator of Forests.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner as District Magistrate is responsible for criminal justice, while civil judicial work is under a District Judge. Both officers are supervised by the Divisional Judge of the Si\u0101lkot Civil Division, who is also Sessions Judge. There are five Munsifs, two at head-quarters and one at each tahs\u012bl; and six honorary magistrates. The predominant forms of crime are burglary and cattle-theft.\n\nThe Sikh exactions reached a height which is almost incredible, as in the richest portion of the District the ordinary rate was equivalent to an assessment of Rs. 5 per acre, while a yearly demand of Rs. 120 to Rs. 200 was imposed on the land watered by a good well. Consequently at annexation the people were impoverished and demoralized, the village communities weak and inclined to repudiate the principle of joint responsibility, and averse to a fixed system of money payments. The summary settlement made in 1847\u20138 was based on the cash value of the grain collections of the preceding five years, less a reduction of 10 per cent. The result was a demand of Rs. 6,70,000, which fell on the cultivation at the rate of Rs. 1\u20139\u20133 per acre. The assessment was not only rigid and unequal, but in itself severe. High prices enabled the people to pay it until annexation, when prices fell. In 1851 the regular settlement was begun, and the officer in charge was convinced of the necessity for large and general reductions. The result was a reduction of the previous demand by about 20 per cent. The new assessment had an incidence of Rs. 1\u20134\u20136 per cultivated acre. In spite of the large abatement, many villages and individuals refused to engage for a cash payment and were sold up in consequence. Thus a serious expropriation of the old proprietors in favour of capitalists was begun. The matter was eventually referred to Government, and it was decided that \u2018the refusal of a proffered assessment by the proprietors does not\nmake the compulsory sale of their land legal: all that they can be made to forfeit are the privileges of contracting for the payment of the Government revenue and of managing the estate.' That the assessment was in reality too high is shown by a comparison with the much lower rates of the present settlement, despite the rise of prices, and also by the fact that economic rents were practically unknown, the owners being only too glad to get tenants to cultivate on condition of paying the revenue with a nominal m\u0101lik\u0101na. In 1858 a reduction of Rs. 21,000, or 4 per cent., was made, and thereafter the assessment, helped out by good seasons, worked satisfactorily. A revised settlement, completed in 1864\u20138, was directed chiefly to the correction of inequalities. Pasture lands were assessed where cultivation was backward, and lump rates were imposed on wells. The assessment was extremely moderate, the amount being only 6 lakhs, compared with 5\u00bd lakhs for the last year of the regular settlement, and an immediate revision was contemplated, but the settlement was eventually sanctioned for twenty years. Competition rents came into existence, and the District slowly recovered from the financial chaos into which a combination of circumstances had thrown it.\n\nThe current settlement was made between 1888 and 1894. Prices were found to have risen 27 per cent. in Wazirabad and Gujranwala, where also cash-rents prevailed to an extent unusual in the Punjab. The third tahsil, Hafizabad, was in process of irrigation from the Chenab Canal, and was therefore assessed for only ten years. The sanctioned assessment was nearly 9 lakhs, an increase of 37 per cent. The tahsil of Hafizabad, which has now been reconstituted and divided (with some additions and modifications) into the two tahsils of Hafizabad and Khangah Dogran, again came under settlement in 1902. The previous assessment was 3\u00bc lakhs, and it is anticipated that the revision now being carried out will result in an increase of 2\u00bc lakhs, due to the extension of irrigation and colonization. The average assessment on 'dry' land is 10 annas (maximum 12 annas, minimum 8 annas), and on 'wet' land Rs. 1\u20132 (maximum Rs. 1\u20138, minimum 12 annas). The total demand, including cesses, for the whole District in 1903\u20134 was about 12\u00b79 lakhs. The average size of a proprietary holding is 5\u00b74 acres.\n\nThe collections of land revenue alone and of total revenue are shown in the table below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1888-9 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 5\u00b705   | 5\u00b734   | 8\u00b793   | 9\u00b795   |\n| Total revenue  | 6\u00b783   | 8\u00b708   | 13\u00b730  | 14\u00b779  |\n\nThe District contains six municipalities: namely, Gujranwala, Wazirabad, Ramnagar, Akalganj, Eminabad, and Kila Didak.\nSingh; and five 'notified areas,' Hafizabad, Sodhra, Pindi Bhatian, Khangah Dogran, and Sangla. Outside these, local affairs are managed by the District board, whose income, derived mainly from a local rate, amounted in 1903-4 to 1.5 lakhs. The expenditure in the same year was 1.3 lakhs, roads being the largest item.\n\nThe regular police force consists of 503 of all ranks, including 120 municipal police, in charge of a Superintendent, who usually has 4 inspectors under him. The village watchmen number 1,423. There are 14 police stations, 9 outposts, and 2 road-posts. The District jail at head-quarters has accommodation for 422 prisoners.\n\nGujranwala stands twenty-first among the twenty-eight Districts of the Province in respect of the literacy of its population. In 1901 the proportion of literate persons was 3.5 per cent. (6 males and 0.4 females). The number of pupils under instruction was 4,906 in 1880-1, 8,267 in 1890-1, 10,938 in 1900-1, and 10,664 in 1903-4. In the last year there were 14 secondary (public) schools, 119 primary, and one 'special,' besides 24 advanced and 144 elementary (private) schools, with 851 girls in the public and 520 in the private schools. The District possesses 6 Anglo-veracular high schools for boys. The chief schools for girls are the mission vernacular high school and the municipal vernacular middle school at Gujranwala town. The District also has 19 schools, with 209 pupils, intended mainly for low-caste children. The expenditure on education in 1903-4 was 1.4 lakhs, of which municipalities paid Rs. 15,000, while fees realized Rs. 28,000. The rest was paid out of District funds, except the sum of Rs. 13,000 received from Government for the maintenance of primary schools, and Rs. 17,000 from subscriptions and endowments.\n\nBesides the civil hospital and city branch dispensary, there are 11 outlying dispensaries, which in 1904 treated a total of 178,237 out-patients and 1,137 in-patients, while 10,080 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 21,000, Local and municipal funds providing Rs. 10,000 each.\n\nThe number of successful vaccinations in 1903-4 was 24,039, representing 27 per 1,000 of the population. The Vaccination Act has been extended to the town of Gujranwala.\n\n[M. F. O'Dwyer, *District Gazetteer* (1893-4), and *Settlement Report* (1894); Rev. T. G. Bailey, *Punjabi Grammar as spoken in the Wazirabad District* (1904).]\n\n**Gujranwala Tahsil.**\u2014Tahsil of Gujranwala District, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 49' and 32\u00b0 20' N. and 73\u00b0 48' and 74\u00b0 24' E., with an area of 756 square miles. The population in 1901 was 252,863, compared with 269,166 in 1891. It contains the towns of Gujranwala (population, 29,224), the head-quarters, Eminabad (6,494), and Kila Didar Singh (2,705); and 445 villages. The land revenue and cesses\nin 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 3,78,000. The eastern portion of the tahsil is a rich and highly developed tract, with abundant well-irrigation. The rest lies in the level uplands, where the soil is lighter and better adapted for crops dependent on a scanty rainfall. The floods of the Degh irrigate a few villages in the south-east.\n\n**Gujranwala Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of Gujranwala District and tahsil, Punjab, situated in 32\u00b0 9' N. and 74\u00b0 11' E., on the North-Western Railway and the grand trunk road; distant by rail from Calcutta 1,294 miles, from Bombay 1,322, and from Karachi 828. Population (1901), 29,224, including 10,390 Hindus, 15,525 Muhammadans, and 2,181 Sikhs. Originally founded, as its name shows, by G\u016bjars, the town was renamed Khanpur by some S\u0101nsi Jats of Amritsar who settled here; but its old name has survived. The town is of modern growth, and owes any importance it has entirely to the father and grandfather of Ranjit Singh. Ranjit Singh himself was born here, but he made Lahore his capital in 1799. The town contains a mausoleum to Mah\u0101n Singh, father of Ranjit Singh, and a lofty cupola covering a portion of the ashes of the great Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 himself.\n\nThe municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 73,400, and the expenditure Rs. 73,600. In 1903-4 the income and expenditure were Rs. 83,100 and Rs. 67,900 respectively. The chief source of income was octroi (Rs. 59,700); while the main items of outlay were conservancy (Rs. 10,300), education (Rs. 17,300), medical (Rs. 10,100), public safety (Rs. 9,600), and administration (Rs. 12,800). The trade of the town, which is rapidly increasing, is chiefly in grain, cotton, and oil. Brass vessels and iron boxes are made, ivory bangles are turned, and some pottery and cotton cloth are manufactured. The factory industries include cotton-ginning, cotton-pressing, and the production of oil; and the three factories gave employment in 1904 to 120 persons. There are three Anglo-veracular high schools for boys\u2014the municipal, United Presbyterian American Mission, and Khalsa schools\u2014and an aided vernacular high school for girls, also supported by the mission, besides a vernacular middle school for girls maintained by the municipal committee. The mission further maintains an industrial orphanage for boys. The town possesses a Government hospital with a branch dispensary.\n\n**Gujrat District.**\u2014District in the Rawalpindi Division of the Punjab, lying between 32\u00b0 10' and 33\u00b0 1' N. and 73\u00b0 17' and 74\u00b0 29' E., with an area of 2,051 square miles. In shape a narrow strip of sub-Himalayan plain country, it lies between the Chen\u0101b and Jhelum rivers and marks the northern limit of the true Punjab plains. It is bounded on the north-east by Kashmir; on the north-west by Jhelum District; on the south-west by Sh\u0101hpur; and on the south-east by Gujranwala.\nand Sialkot. The northern corner is crossed by the Pabbi Hills, a low range, pierced by the Jhelum at Mong R\u0101sul, which forms a continuation of the Salt Range. These hills consist of a friable Tertiary sandstone and conglomerate, presenting a chaos of rock, naked or clothed with rough scrub, and deeply scored with precipitous ravines. Their highest point has an elevation of 1,400 feet above sea-level, or about 600 feet above the surrounding plain. Immediately below and surrounding these hills, a high and undulating submontane plateau extends across the north of the District from the Jhelum eastwards, till it terminates in a precipitous bank 100 to 200 feet in height, which almost overhangs the waters of the Tawi and Chen\u0101b. At the foot of the plateau a belt of upland crosses the District, ending in a high bank, beneath which lies a strip of lowland about 8 miles in width, which forms the wider valley of the Chen\u0101b. A similar narrow belt of lowland fringes the Jhelum. The surface of the do\u0101b thus descends in a series of steps towards the south and west, and a section of the line along the grand trunk road shows a rise of 111 feet from the Chen\u0101b to the Jhelum in a distance of 34 miles. Besides the great boundary rivers, the Jhelum and Chen\u0101b, the District is intersected by numerous hill torrents rising in the Outer Him\u0101layas or the Pabbi Hills, the chief being the Bhimbar, Bhandar, Dalli, Dab\u016bli, Do\u0101ra, and Bak\u0101l. Most of these streams, although unmanageable torrents in the rains, either dry up entirely during the dry season, or find their way into the Chen\u0101b by insignificant channels.\n\nThe greater part of the District lies on the Indo-Gangetic alluvium, but beds of Siw\u0101lik (Upper Tertiary) age are found in the Pabbi or Kh\u0101ri\u0101n Hills, which are composed of an enormous accumulation of sandstones, sands, conglomerates, and clays. The sandstones are highly fossiliferous, and have yielded great numbers of mammalian bones and teeth, including species of Equus, Bos, Elephas, and Cervus.\n\nNone of the submontane Districts, except Si\u0101lkot, has a scantier flora than Gujr\u0101t, but the low Pabbi range supports a few stunted trees and shrubs of kinds abundant in the neighbouring Salt Range and dry Outer Him\u0101laya. In the broken country at the north-east corner, and on the bank of the Chen\u0101b farther to the south, there is a good deal of scrub, chiefly Acacia modesta and reed jungle. The dh\u0101k (Butea frondosa) is fairly common, while the kikar (Acacia arabica) and horse-radish-tree (Moringa pterygosperma) occur also, the first being fully naturalized in the northern part.\n\nWolves are found in the Pabbi Hills and hyenas are occasionally met with; nilgai and antelope are rare, but \u2018ravine deer\u2019 (Indian gazelle) are not at all uncommon on the hills. Wild hog are numerous\nin the low-lying lands of the Chen\u0101b, where they do a great deal of damage.\n\nThe climate is quite bearable, even in the hot season, owing to the nearness of the hills. The health of the people is unusually good; but malaria prevails along the Jhelum and Chen\u0101b in the autumn months, and small-pox along the borders of Kashmir, whence it is generally imported. Plague entered the District in 1902. The village of Malkow\u0101l was in the same year the scene of an unfortunate accident whereby 19 villagers who had been inoculated against plague died of tetanus.\n\nThe rainfall is abundant, and the country people have a proverb that 'rain is always to be had for the asking.' It rapidly decreases with the distance from the Himalayas and the Pabbi range, the average annual fall varying from 28 inches at Kh\u0101ri\u0101n to 20 at Ph\u0101lia.\n\nGujr\u0101t Town itself is a place of some antiquity, and the District abounds in ancient sites, Mong being the most important. The District formed part of the kingdom of Porus, who was defeated by Alexander, probably in the Karri plain beyond the Jammu border, in July, 326 B.C.; but four years later it was conquered by Chandragupta Maurya in the national rising which took place on the death of Alexander. It remained under the Mauryas until shortly after the death of Asoka in 231, and about forty years later came under the sway of Demetrius the Graeco-Bactrian. The overthrow of the Bactrians by the Parthians in the latter half of the second century brought another change of rulers, and the coins of the Indo-Parthian Maues (c. 120 B.C.), who is known to local tradition as R\u0101j\u0101 Moga, have been found at Mong. At the end of the first century A.D., the whole of the Punjab was conquered by the Yueh-chi. For several hundred years nothing is known of the history of the District, except that between 455 and 540 it must have been exposed to the ravages of the White Huns. Dr. Stein holds that the District formed part of the kingdom of Gurjjara, which, according to the R\u0101jatarangini, was invaded between A.D. 883 and 902 by Sankara Varm\u0101n of Kashmir, who defeated its king Al\u0101kh\u0101na. This may be the Al\u012b Kh\u0101n to whom tradition ascribed the refounding of Gujr\u0101t. But authentic history commences only in the Lodi period, when Bahlolpur, 23 miles north-east of Gujr\u0101t, was founded in the reign of Bahrol (1451\u201389). Khw\u0101s Kh\u0101n, governor of Roht\u0101s under Sher Sh\u0101h Suri, founded Khw\u0101spur near Gujr\u0101t. The settlement of the tract was completed by Akbar, who built a fort and compelled the G\u016bjars, a pastoral tribe given to plunder, to settle in it. The tract was then named Gujr\u0101t and formed into a separate district. Revenue records have been preserved in the families of the hereditary registrars (k\u0101mungos), and these exhibit Gujr\u0101t as the capital of a district containing 2,592 villages, paying a revenue\nof 16 lakhs. In 1605 the famous Saiyid Abdul K\u0101sim received Gujr\u0101t as a *tuy\u016bl* or fief from Akbar. On the decay of the Mughal power N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h ravaged the District and destroyed Gujr\u0101t, after which it was overrun by the Gakhars of Rawalpindi, who probably established themselves at Gujr\u0101t in 1741. The country also suffered at the same time from the ravages of Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101ni, whose armies frequently crossed and recrossed it.\n\nMeanwhile the Sikh power had been asserting itself in the Eastern Punjab; and in 1765 Sard\u0101r G\u00fcjar Singh, head of the Bhang\u012b confederacy, crossed the Chen\u0101b, defeated the Gakhar chief, Mukarrab Kh\u0101n, and extended his dominions to the banks of the Jhelum. On G\u00fcjar Singh\u2019s death in 1788, his son, S\u0101hib Singh, became involved in war with Mah\u0101n Singh, the chieftain of Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la, and afterwards with his son, the celebrated Ranjit Singh. After a few months of desultory warfare in 1798, the Gujr\u0101t leader found it well to accept a position of dependence under the young ruler of Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la. At length, in 1810, Ranjit Singh, now master of the consolidated Sikh empire, determined to depose his tributary vassal. S\u0101hib Singh withdrew to the hills without opposition, and shortly afterwards accepted the Bajw\u0101t territory in the present Si\u0101lkot District conferred on him in *j\u0101g\u012br*. In 1846 Gujr\u0101t came under the supervision of British officials, when a settlement of land revenue was effected under orders from the provisional government at Lahore. Two years later, the District was the scene of some of the battles which decided the event of the second Sikh War. While the siege of Mult\u0101n still dragged slowly on, Sher Singh established himself at R\u0101mmagar on the Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la side of the Chen\u0101b, 22 miles below Gujr\u0101t, leaving the main body of his army on the northern bank. Here he awaited the attack of the British, who attempted unsuccessfully to drive him across the river, on November 22, 1848. Lord Gough withdrew from the assault with heavy loss; but sending round a strong detachment under Sir Joseph Thackwell by the Wazir\u0101b\u0101d ferry, he turned the flank of the enemy, and won the battle of Sadullapur. Sher Singh retired northward, and took up a strong position between the Jhelum and the Pabb\u012b Hills. The bloody battle of Chili\u0101nw\u0101la followed (January 13, 1849), a victory as costly as a defeat. On February 6 Sher Singh again eluded Lord Gough\u2019s vigilance, and marched southwards to make a dash upon Lahore; but the British pressed him close in the rear, and, on February 22, he turned to offer battle at Gujr\u0101t. The decisive engagement which ensued broke irretrievably the power of the Sikhs. The Punjab lay at the feet of the conquerors, and passed by annexation under British rule.\n\nAt the first distribution of the Province, the whole wedge of land between the Chen\u0101b and the Jhelum, from their junction to the hills,\nformed a single jurisdiction; but a few months later, the south-western portion was made a separate charge, with its head-quarters at Shahpur. Various interchanges of territory took place from time to time at later dates; and in 1857 the north-eastern corner of the original District, comprising the tongue of land between the Tawi and the Chenab, was transferred to Si\u0101lkot. Gujr\u0101t District then assumed its present form.\n\nAt the time of the Mutiny the wing of native infantry stationed at Gujr\u0101t was ordered to Si\u0101lkot, and the Jhelum mutineers, who tried to cross the river in order to join them, were defeated and dispersed by the Deputy-Commissioner with the police and local levies. A marauding tribe, the Chibs, from across the Jammu border, who had long been a source of annoyance, invaded the District and gave a good deal of trouble. But Deva, their stronghold, was destroyed in the following year by the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Jammu.\n\nExcepting the mounds marking the ruins of ancient villages, the District contains no monuments of the Hindu period. At Khw\u0101spur are the ruins of a sarai built in 1546 by Khw\u0101s Kh\u0101n, the governor of Roht\u0101s under Sher Sh\u0101h; and at Kh\u0101ri\u0101n is a deep well with steps, built by Akbar in fulfilment of a promise made by Hum\u0101y\u016bn. Another similar well built by Akbar exists at Gujr\u0101t town, and there are the ruins of a hunting-box at Alamgarh. At Naurang\u0101b\u0101d are the remains of a sarai and at Kh\u0101ri\u0101n a well with steps, both built by Aurangzeb. The tomb (rebuilt in 1867) of Sh\u0101h Daula at Gujr\u0101t bears an inscription dated 1719.\n\nThe District contains 4 towns and 1,336 villages. Its population at each of the last four enumerations was: (1868) 616,509, (1881) 689,115, (1891) 760,875, and (1901) 750,548. It fell by 1.3 per cent. during the last decade, owing to emigration. The Chenab Colony received more than 25,000 settlers, and the people readily emigrate even beyond India. The District is divided into the three tahsils of Gujr\u0101t, Kh\u0101ri\u0101n, and Ph\u0101lia, the headquarters of each being at the place from which it is named. The towns are the municipalities of Gujr\u0101t, the head-quarters of the District, Jal\u0101lpur, Kunjah, and Dinga. The table on the next page shows the principal statistics of population in 1901.\n\nMuhammadans form as much as 87.4 per cent. of the population, Hindus 9.2, and Sikhs 3.3 per cent. The density, 366 persons per square mile, is about double the Provincial average, and is equal to the average for the sub-Himalayan Districts. The language of the District is Western Punjabi, sometimes known as Lahnda.\n\nThe most numerous caste is that of the agricultural Jats, who number 195,000, or 26 per cent. of the total population. Among Jats are included the Gondals, who in 1891 numbered 28,000. Next to them in importance are the G\u016bjars, who are far stronger here than in any\nother Punjab District, and number 111,000, or 15 per cent. of the population. After them come the R\u0101jp\u016bts (24,000), Arains (22,000), and Aw\u0101ns (15,000). The Lab\u0101n\u0101s (8,000), who were formerly carriers and traders, have now taken to agriculture and service in the army. Of the commercial and money-lending classes, the most numerous are the Aror\u0101s (29,000) and Khattr\u012bs (18,000). The Bh\u0101t\u012bs number only 5,000. The Mu\u1e25ammadan priestly class, the Saiyids, return 19,000, and the Br\u0101hmans, who are traders as well as priests, 7,000. Of the artisan classes, the Moch\u012bs (shoemakers and leather-workers, 34,000), Tarkh\u0101ns (carpenters, 24,000), Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers, 23,000), Kumh\u0101rs (potters, 18,000), Loh\u0101rs (blacksmiths, 14,000), and Telis (oil-pressers, 9,000) are the most important. The Kashm\u012bris, immigrants from Kashmir, who live mainly by shawl-weaving, number 33,000. Of the menial classes the most important are the Chuhr\u0101s (sweepers, 34,000), M\u0101chh\u012bs (fishermen, bakers, and water-carriers, 16,000), and Nais (barbers, 15,000). About 63 per cent. of the population are supported by agriculture.\n\n| Tahsil | Area in square miles | Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1881 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------|---------------------|------|---------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Gujr\u0101t | 5.6                 | 3    | 518     | 309,887    | 557.3                     | -0.3                                            | 10,798                                 |\n| Kh\u0101ri\u0101n| 6.43                | 1    | 507     | 242,687    | 377.4                     | -2.2                                            | 6,715                                  |\n| Ph\u0101lia | 7.21                | ...  | 311     | 197,974    | 274.5                     | -2.9                                            | 7,300                                  |\n| District total | 2,051 | 4 | 1,336 | 750,548 | 365.9 | -1.3 | 24,813 |\n\nNote.\u2014The figures for the areas of tahsils are taken from revenue returns. The total District area is that given in the Census Report.\n\nAs early as 1862 the operations of the Church of Scotland Punjab Mission, which had its head-quarters at Si\u0101lkot, were extended to Gujr\u0101t, and in 1865 a European missionary was permanently stationed there. The activity of the mission is especially noticeable in the sphere of education. A Ladies\u2019 Mission House was completed in 1892, and zan\u0101na work combined with female education has made steady progress. The District contained 241 native Christians in 1901.\n\nThe submontane tract east of the Bhimbar consists of plateaux of sandy soil, intersected by hill torrents. West of that stream the Pabb\u012b Agriculture. submontane tract is equally sandy and still more broken. The soil of the central upland is stronger and better, but like the submontane tract devoid of water, the Pabb\u012b Hills arresting the drainage from the Him\u0101layas and percolation from the Jhelum, while the torrents which pass through both these tracts flow in such deep beds as to do harm rather than good. The\nsoil of the lowlands is generally a good loam fertilized to some extent by the hill torrents, while the riverain tracts along the Jhelum and Chen\u0101b consist of a fertile loam moistened by the rivers, though liable to injury from floods.\n\nThe District is held almost entirely by communities of small peasant proprietors, large estates covering only about 1,000 acres. The area for which details are available from the revenue records of 1903-4 is 1,922 square miles, as shown in the table below:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Gujr\u0101t | 554   | 442        | 125       | 25               |\n| Kh\u0101ri\u0101n| 646   | 434        | 19        | 53               |\n| Ph\u0101lia | 722   | 456        | 198       | 161              |\n| **Total** | **1,922** | **1,332** | **342** | **239** |\n\nThe area, in square miles, under each of the principal food-crops in 1903-4 was: wheat (507), spiked millet (235), great millet (103), gram (97), and barley (56). There were 10 square miles under sugar-cane, 22 under cotton, and 58 under oilseeds.\n\nThe cultivated area increased by 4 per cent. during the decade ending 1901; there is still room, however, for extension, especially by increased well-irrigation. Experiments made in the cultivation of Australian wheat appear to show that, while the out-turn and quality are excellent, the grain does not store well. Attempts have also been made to cultivate sweet potatoes and *Sorghum saccharatum*, so far without definite results. Loans are readily taken for the construction of wells, and nearly Rs. 30,000 was advanced under the Land Improvement Loans Act during the five years ending 1904.\n\nThe cattle are of the ordinary Punjab type, but have been improved by the introduction of Hiss\u0101r bulls. The local breed of horses is good, and has been much improved by foreign sires. The Army Remount department maintains 5 horse stallions, and the District board 3 pony and 3 donkey stallions. A horse show is held every year at Gujr\u0101t town. Sheep and goats are kept in considerable numbers, but only a few camels.\n\nOf the total area cultivated in 1903-4, 342 square miles, or 26 per cent., were irrigated from wells. In addition, 87 square miles, or 7 per cent., are subject to inundation from the Jhelum, Chen\u0101b, and minor streams. The District contains 10,435 masonry wells worked with Persian wheels by cattle, besides 541 unbricked wells, lever wells, and water-lifts. The Lower Jhelum Canal takes off at the village of Mong Ras\u016bl, but does not irrigate any part of the District. The projected Upper Jhelum Canal will, however, supply nearly the whole of the Ph\u0101lia tahsil.\nThe District contains 83 square miles of 'reserved' and half a mile of unclassed forests under the Deputy-Conservator of the Chen\u0101b Forest division, and 2 square miles of unclassed forest and Government waste under the Deputy-Commissioner. The most important Reserve is that comprising the greater part of the Pabb\u012b Hills, which is covered with bush and scrub; a fair number of forest areas dotted about the central plateau are thinly covered with jand (Prosopis spicigera), dh\u0101k (Butea frondosa), and the leafless caper; but much of the 'reserved' forest consists of grass lands on the Chen\u0101b. In 1903\u20134 the income of the forests under the Forest department was Rs. 41,000, and of those under the Deputy-Commissioner Rs. 600.\n\nBeds of kankar or nodular limestone are to be found, though the supply is very limited. Lime used to be burned in the Pabb\u012b Hills, but the practice has been discontinued.\n\nThe most important industry is the manufacture of furniture at Gujr\u0101t, of a quality unsurpassed in India outside the Presidency towns. The only other distinctive art is that of damascening iron with gold and silver, now applied chiefly to the decoration of such articles as caskets, vases, bracelets, trays, &c. Cotton cloth is made all over the District, and an imitation in cotton of English checks and tweeds has a wide sale. Hemp sacking is largely produced. Inferior shawls of pashm wool are made at Jal\u0101lpur, and there is a small manufacture of soap. Boots and shoes and brass vessels are made at Gujr\u0101t town.\n\nIn ordinary years the District produces much more grain than is required for local consumption, and wheat, spiked millet, oilseeds, oil, ghi, wool, cotton (raw and woven), and hides are exported in large quantities by rail. The chief imports are piece-goods, iron, sugar, salt, rice, wool, brass vessels, spices, and dyes. Gujr\u0101t town is the only place of any commercial importance.\n\nThe District is traversed by the main line and the Sind-S\u0101gar branch of the North-Western Railway, which meet at L\u0101la M\u016bsa. The grand trunk road runs by the side of the main line, and an important unmetalled road leads from Gujr\u0101t to Bhimbar in Jammu territory. The total length of metalled roads is 52 miles, and of unmetalled roads 611 miles. Of the metalled roads, 41 miles are under the Public Works department, and the rest are maintained by the District board. Both the Chen\u0101b and Jhelum are navigable, but as trade routes they have lost their importance since the advent of the railway. The railway bridges across the two rivers have tracks for wheeled traffic, and there are thirteen ferries on the Chen\u0101b and seven on the Jhelum.\n\nThe District was visited by famine in 1783 (the great chulisa famine), 1815, 1831, and 1863; and scarcity was experienced in 1869 and in 1878. In 1896\u20137 severe scarcity occurred. Relief works were opened,\nand the greatest daily average relieved in any week exceeded 55,000, while the total expenditure was Rs. 4,84,000. There was scarcity again in 1899-1900, but only test works were opened, and the daily average number of persons relieved in any week never rose above 1,800. The total expenditure was a little over Rs. 10,000.\n\nThe District is divided into the three tahsils of Gujr\u0101t, Ph\u0101lia, and Kharian, each under a tahsildar and naib-tahsildar. It is in charge of a Deputy-Commissioner, aided by three Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, of whom one is in charge of the District treasury. Two Executive Engineers of the Upper and Lower Jhelum Canals are stationed in the District.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner as District Magistrate is responsible for criminal justice. Civil judicial work is under a District Judge, and both officers are subordinate to the Divisional Judge of the Jhelum Civil Division, who is also Sessions Judge. There are three Munsifs, one at head-quarters and one at each outlying tahsil. The predominant forms of crime are cattle-theft and burglary.\n\nUnder Sikh rule the revenue was paid almost universally in grain, the demand being a certain share of either the actual or the estimated produce. Ranjit Singh divided the District among his Sard\u0101rs, who took what they could without much regard to the recognized share. In 1846 a summary settlement was made of the greater part of the District, the assessments being based mainly on the average realizations of the preceding three years. In 1849 a second summary settlement was effected; but the proprietors could only be induced to take up leases with great difficulty, as this settlement, though it reduced the previous demand, was unequal and in many estates too high. Sir Henry Lawrence visited the District in 1852 and found startling inequalities in the rates, which varied from an anna to Rs. 2 per bigha. He ordered a prompt reassessment, which was carried out by the Deputy-Commissioner in three months, the result being a reduction of 5-9 per cent. in the demand, and an average rate of Rs. 1-10-5 per acre of cultivation.\n\nThe first regular settlement was made between 1852 and 1859, and resulted in a reduction of 8 per cent. on the previous assessment. A revised assessment was carried out in 1865-8. An immediate increase of 5-8 per cent. was taken, giving a rate of R. 0-15-5 per acre of cultivation, while, after fifteen years, progressive assessments were to bring in an increase of 12-8 per cent. on the demand of the regular settlement. A second revision was undertaken between 1888 and 1893. Prices were found to have risen by at least 25 per cent. and cultivation by 27 per cent. The new assessment, including various deferred payments, was fixed at 8-5 lakhs, at which sum it stood in 1903-4, being an increase\nof 34 per cent. on the last payment under the first revised settlement. The average assessment on 'dry' land is 14 annas (maximum Rs. 1-4, minimum 8 annas), and on 'wet' land Rs. 1-13 (maximum Rs. 2-8, minimum Rs. 1-2). The average size of a proprietary holding is 3\u00b76 acres.\n\nThe collections of land revenue alone and of total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 5,91   | 6,10   | 7,76   | 8,53   |\n| Total revenue  | 7,51   | 8,11   | 10,60  | 11,85  |\n\nThe District contains four municipalities, Gujr\u0101t, Jal\u0101lpur, Kunjah, and Dinga. Outside these, local affairs are managed by the District board, whose income, mainly derived from a local rate, amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 91,400. The expenditure was Rs. 94,000, of which public works formed the largest item.\n\nThe regular police force consists of 338 of all ranks, including 38 municipal police, under a Superintendent, who is usually assisted by 2 inspectors. The village watchmen number 907. There are eleven police stations. The District jail at head-quarters has accommodation for 118 prisoners.\n\nGujr\u0101t stands twenty-second among the twenty-eight Districts of the Province in regard to the literacy of its population, of whom 3\u00b73 per cent. (6\u00b71 males and 3 females) could read and write in 1901. The proportion is highest in the Ph\u0101lia tahsil. The number of pupils under instruction was 3,764 in 1880-1, 9,553 in 1890-1, 9,725 in 1900-1, and 11,218 in 1903-4. In the last year the District possessed 6 secondary and 74 primary (public) schools, and 3 advanced and 256 elementary (private) schools, with 378 girls in the public, and 733 in the private schools. Gujr\u0101t town has two Anglo-veracular high schools, one kept up by Government as a model school, and one by the Scottish Mission. The mission also has schools for low-caste children at Gujr\u0101t, Lala M\u00fcsa, Sh\u0101diwal, and Jal\u0101lpur. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 60,000, of which Provincial funds contributed Rs. 6,000, municipalities Rs. 8,000, and the District fund Rs. 19,000. Fees brought in Rs. 19,000.\n\nBesides the civil hospital at Gujr\u0101t, the District contains ten outlying dispensaries. In 1904 the number of cases treated was 152,575, of whom 548 were in-patients, and 6,645 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 16,000, the greater part of which was contributed by the District fund. The Scottish Mission maintains two hospitals: the Dow Memorial Hospital for females at Gujr\u0101t, with a\nbranch at Daulatnagar; and the other at Jal\u0101lpur, with a branch at L\u0101la M\u016bsa.\n\nThe Vaccination Act is in force only in Gujr\u0101t and Jal\u0101lpur towns. The number of persons successfully vaccinated in 1903-4 was 23,770, representing 31.7 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[Captain H. S. P. Davies, *District Gazetteer* (1892-3); *Settlement Report* (1893); and *Customary Law of the Gujr\u0101t District* (1892).]\n\n**Gujr\u0101t Tahsil.** \u2014 Tahsil of Gujr\u0101t District, Punjab, lying between 32\u00b0 24' and 32\u00b0 53' N. and 73\u00b0 47' and 74\u00b0 29' E., with an area of 554 square miles. Its south-east border rests on the Chen\u0101b. The northern portion consists of an undulating plateau, scored by hill torrents. The plateau sinks into the plain about the latitude of Gujr\u0101t town, and is bordered by a narrow strip of low-lying alluvial land along the Chenab. The population in 1901 was 309,887, compared with 308,861 in 1891. The tahsil contains the towns of Gujr\u0101t (population, 19,410), the head-quarters, Jal\u0101lpur (10,640), and Kunj\u0101h (6,431); and 518 villages. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 4.4 lakhs.\n\n**Gujr\u0101t Town.** \u2014 Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of Gujr\u0101t, Punjab, situated in 32\u00b0 34' N. and 74\u00b0 5' E., on the main line of the North-Western Railway, about 5 miles north of the present bed of the Chen\u0101b. It is distant by rail 1,335 miles from Calcutta, 1,362 miles from Bombay, and 817 miles from Kar\u0101chi. Population (1901), 19,410. Tradition ascribes the foundation of the town, under the name of Ud\u0101n\u0101gri, to Bachan P\u0101l, a R\u0101jput, in the fifth century B.C., and avers that it was refounded about A.D. 120 by R\u0101n\u012b Gujr\u0101n, a daughter-in-law of the famous R\u0101j\u0101 Ras\u0101lu of Si\u0101lkot. Another tradition declares it to have been refounded by one Ali Kh\u0101n, who may be the Al\u0101kh\u0101na who was overthrown between A.D. 883 and 902 by Sankara Varman of Kashm\u012br.\n\nThe town stands on an ancient site, formerly occupied by two successive cities, the second of which Sir Alexander Cunningham supposed to have been destroyed in 1303 by the Mongols, in one of their incursions during the reign of Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Khilj\u012b. More than 200 years later, Sher Sh\u0101h turned his attention to the surrounding country, but it was probably Akbar who founded the existing town. Though standing in the midst of a Jat neighbourhood, the fort was first garrisoned by G\u016bjars, and took the name of Gujr\u0101t Akbar\u0101b\u0101d. Remains of the Mughal period still exist. During the reign of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, Gujr\u0101t became the residence of a famous saint, Pir Sh\u0101h Daula, and the wealth derived from the offerings of disciples was freely spent on the adornment of the town. The viaduct he built over a torrent bed close to the town is still in a good state of preservation. The Gakhar chief, Mukarrab Kh\u0101n of R\u0101walpindi, held Gujr\u0101t for twenty-five years, until his expulsion in 1765 by the Sikhs under Sard\u0101r Gujar Singh Bhangi. Gujr\u0101t\nwas the scene of the final struggle between the Sikhs and the British, when Lord Gough's victory over Sher Singh on February 22, 1849, finally broke the Sikh power. In the middle of the town is the old fort, built, together with the bath-house, by Akbar. The shrine of Sh\u0101h Daula, to the north of the town, is famous throughout and beyond the Province. It is the home of a number of human monstrosities with narrow heads and weak intellects, known as Sh\u0101h Daula's rats. They are brought from great distances, and it has been supposed that parents sometimes compress the heads of their infants in order to fit them for this asylum.\n\nThe municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 31,900, and the expenditure Rs. 31,600. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 36,100, derived chiefly from octroi and school fees; and the expenditure was Rs. 36,500. The town is the trading centre of the District, and collects all the surplus agricultural produce, in return for which European goods, raw iron, &c., are sold to the villagers. There is also a considerable traffic in dried fruits from Kashmir. European furniture is made on a large scale, and the art of damascening iron with gold is practised. A good deal of cotton cloth is woven, including imitations of English checks and tweeds, but the old industry of shawl-weaving is practically extinct. Boots and shoes are made and supplied to many native regiments, and the Gujrat brass vessels have some reputation. The town has a civil hospital and two Anglo-veracular high schools, one maintained by the municipality but managed by the Educational department since 1904, the other by the Scottish Mission, which has a station here. The town also possesses the Dow Memorial Hospital for women, maintained by the mission.\n\nGula.\u2014Sub-tahsil of the Kaithal tahsil of Karn\u0101l District, Punjab. It has an area of 455 square miles, and contains 204 villages. The head-quarters are at the village of Gula. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 1\u00b72 lakhs.\n\nGulaothi.\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Bulandshahr, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 35' N. and 77\u00b0 48' E., 12 miles north of Bulandshahr town on the Meerut road. Population (1901), 7,208. The town is said to have been founded by Mew\u0101tis or by Gahlot Rajputs. It is chiefly inhabited by Saiyids and Bani\u0101s. A prominent Saiyid, named Mihrb\u0101n Ali, who died a few years ago, did much to improve the town and its approaches. He built several houses, metalled the road to the K\u0101li Nadi, and built a bridge across it at a cost of Rs. 30,000, and also constructed a large mosque and established a school for teaching Arabic and Persian. The American Methodist Mission has a branch here. Gulaothi is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,800. It has a considerable\nlocal trade and is thriving. There is a middle school with about 200 pupils.\n\n**Gulbarga Division.**\u2014Division in the south-western corner of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, also known as the Southern Division. It lies between $15^\\circ 11'$ and $18^\\circ 40'$ N. and $75^\\circ 16'$ and $77^\\circ 51'$ E., and is bounded on the west and south by the Bombay and Madras Presidencies respectively. The head-quarters of the S\u016bbahd\u0101r or Commissioner are at Gulbarga City. The total population of the Division rose from 1,946,737 in 1881 to 2,430,999 in 1891, and to 2,462,834 in 1901. The area in the latest year was 16,585 square miles, and the density of population 149 persons per square mile, as compared with 135 for the whole State. In 1901 Hindus formed 88 per cent. and Musalm\u0101ns 11 per cent. of the total population, while other religions included Jains (6,163), Christians (1,059, of whom 903 were natives), P\u0101rs\u012bs (152), Sikhs (64), and Animists (209). In 1901 the Division included the four Districts of Gulbarga, Lingsugur, Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, and Raich\u016br. Considerable changes have been made under the reconstitution of 1905. Lingsugur District has been divided between Gulbarga and Raich\u016br, and the Y\u0101dgir t\u012bluk has been transferred from Raichur to Gulbarga. Bidar District has been added to the Division, which is now constituted as follows:\n\n| District     | Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Land revenue and cesses, 1901, in thousands of rupees |\n|--------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Gulbarga     | 6,004                | 1,041,067        | 18,36                                                  |\n| Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d    | 4,010                | 535,927          | 12,51                                                  |\n| Raich\u016br      | 6,879                | 932,090          | 19,18                                                  |\n| Bidar        | 4,168                | 766,129          | 11,63                                                  |\n| **Total**    | **21,061**           | **3,274,313**    | **61,68**                                              |\n\nThe Division contains 32 towns, or about two-fifths of the total number in the State, and 5,652 villages. The largest towns are Gulbarga City (population, 29,228) and Raich\u016br (22,165). The chief places of commercial importance are Gulbarga, Raich\u016br, Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, Lat\u016br, Lingsugur, Tuljapur, Bidar, and Homn\u0101b\u0101d. Gulbarga, Raich\u016br, Bidar, Kalyani, Udgir, Parenda, Mudgal, S\u016br\u0101pur, Kohir, and Anegundi are famous for their historical and archaeological associations.\n\n**Gulbarga District**\u00b9.\u2014District in the Gulbarga Division, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, adjoining Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d and Bidar on the north; Atr\u0101f-i-balda and Mahb\u016bbnagar on the east; Mahb\u016bbnagar, Raich\u016br, and Lingsugur on the south; and part of Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d and the District of Bij\u0101pur and the\n\n\u00b9 For the alterations made in 1905 see section on Population. Except where otherwise stated, the article describes the District as it stood before these were effected.\nAkalkot State of Bombay on the west. It lies between $16^\\circ 40'$ and $17^\\circ 44'$ N. and $76^\\circ 22'$ and $78^\\circ 20'$ E., and had a total area of 4,092 square miles in 1901, including paigah and jagirs; while the area of the khalsa and sarf-i-khas lands was 2,428 square miles. A range of hills enters the north of the District from Osmanabad on the west, and continues in a south-easterly direction for about 60 miles through the Mahagaon and Chincholi taluks, which are hilly. The remaining taluks are almost flat, the slope of the country being from north to south and south-east.\n\nThe principal river is the Bhima, a tributary of the Kistna, which rises near Poona in British territory, and, entering the District near Afzalpur in the west, traverses the taluks of Gulbarga and Andola for a distance of 150 miles. The other rivers are the Kagn\u00e4, and its tributaries the Benithora, Mullamari, and Kamaluti. The Kagn\u00e4 is itself a tributary of the Bhima, as is also the Awarja.\n\nThe geological formations are the Archaean gneiss eastward, the Bhima series about the centre, and the Deccan trap the north and west. The region has been fully described by Mr. R. B. Foote (Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. xii, pt. i).\n\nGenerally speaking, the District is devoid of forests, except in the hilly portions of the Mahagaon and Chincholi taluks, which contain teak (Tectona grandis), eppa (Hardwickia binata), tirman (Anogeissus latifolia), sandra (Acacia Catechu), babul (Acacia arabica), tarvar (Cassia auriculata), bijasal (Pterocarpus Marsupium), mallamaddi (Terminalia tomentosa), nim, tamarind, mango, and several species of fig.\n\nIn the hills and jungles in the northern portion of the District tigers, bears, leopards, nilgai, and wild hog are found; and in the plains, hare and antelope.\n\nThe climate differs materially in the several geological divisions. The Carnatic or trappean portion is hot and dry during the summer, whereas the Telingana or granitic portion, which has wooded hills and tanks, is damp, and not so hot in the dry season. Fever prevails from July to October, and during recent years plague has been prevalent in some taluks.\n\nThe rainfall is very capricious, causing occasional droughts. Its average amount for the twenty-one years ending 1901 was 29 inches. The great famine of 1900 was the result of the abnormally scanty rainfall (14.7 inches) of 1899.\n\nPrior to the Muhammadan conquest the District was included in the territory of the Kakatiyas of Warangal. In the early part of the fourteenth century Ulugh Khan, afterwards Muhammad bin Tughlak, annexed it to the kingdom of Delhi, since which time it has continued under Muhammadan rule. After the death of Muhammad bin Tughlak it fell to the Bahmani kingdom,\nand after the break-up of that power, to Bijapur. On the conquest of the Deccan by Aurangzeb it was again included in the empire of Delhi, but was separated from it on the establishment of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State by Asaf Jah.\n\nThe fort of Gulbarga, originally built by R\u0101j\u0101 Gulchand, and afterwards strengthened by Al\u0101-ud-din Bahmani, is a remarkable building, containing 15 towers and 26 guns, one of which is 25 feet long. A large mosque, 216 by 176 feet, in the fort, is constructed on the model of the mosque of Cordova in Spain, and is the only one of its kind in India. In the eastern quarter of the city are the tombs of the kings of Gulbarga, huge square buildings surmounted by domes. Near the tomb of Khw\u0101ja Banda Naw\u0101z are a mosque, a sarai, and a college, all built by Aurangzeb in 1687. The forts of F\u012broz\u0101b\u0101d, on the Bhima river, and of Chincholi and Chit\u0101pur are worthy of note, especially the last, where the Portuguese from Goa constructed a curious church, which has now been renovated.\n\nThe number of towns and villages, including the paig\u0101h and j\u0101girs, is 1,109. The population at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 523,838, (1891) 649,258, and (1901) 742,745. The towns now are Gulbarga, Aland, S\u016br\u0101pur, Kosgi, Y\u0101dgir, Seram, Shah\u0101b\u0101d, and Kodangal. About 81 per cent. of the population in 1901 were Hindus and 15 per cent. Musalm\u0101ns. Though the District is in the Carnatic division, Kanarese was spoken by only 53 per cent. of the population, Telugu being the language of 25, Urdu of 14, and M\u0101r\u0101th\u012b of 6 per cent. The subjoined table exhibits the details of area, towns, villages, and population, according to the Census of 1901:\n\n| Taluk     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Gulbarga  | 524                  | 1               | 108      | 75,512     | 144                         | - 11.0                                                   | Not available                          |\n| Mah\u0101gaon  | 307                  | ...             | 81       | 43,990     | 140                         | + 3.6                                                   |                                        |\n| Chincholi | 277                  | ...             | 69       | 37,671     | 136                         | + 16.0                                                  |                                        |\n| Kodangal  | 141                  | 1               | 60       | 31,182     | 221                         | - 8.7                                                   |                                        |\n| Seram     | 267                  | 1               | 72       | 50,043     | 187                         | + 5.2                                                   |                                        |\n| Gurmatk\u0101l | 304                  | ...             | 86       | 51,424     | 169                         | + 8.5                                                   |                                        |\n| Andola    | 608                  | ...             | 117      | 73,854     | 121                         | + 24.1                                                  |                                        |\n| J\u0101girs, &c.| 1,604                | 4               | 509      | 379,969    | 228                         | + 11.1                                                  |                                        |\n| Total     | 4,092                | 7               | 1,102    | 742,745    | 181                         | + 14.4                                                  | 14,880                                 |\n\nIn 1905 the Gurmatk\u0101l and Mah\u0101gaon taluks were divided between Seram, Kodangal, Gulbarga, and Y\u0101dgir, the last being transferred from Raich\u016br District. Sh\u0101hpur and S\u016br\u0101pur have also been added from the recently abolished Lingsugur District, besides 73 villages from Mahbubnagar District, included in the Kodangal and Y\u0101dgir taluks.\nIn its present form, the District consists of eight taluks\u2014Gulbarga, Andola, Chincholi, Kodangal, Seram, Yadgir, Shahpur, and Surapur; five paigah ilakas, Aland, Firozabad, Afzalpur, Kalgai, and Chitapur; and two jagirs, Tandur and Kosgi. The area of the paigah and jagirs is approximately 976 square miles, and the population 253,349.\n\nThe most numerous agricultural caste is that of the Kunbis, 231,000, of whom 81,000 are Lingayat or Banjara Kapus and 77,500 Kolis. Next in point of numbers are the Mahars or village menials (67,600), the Mangs or leather-workers (39,100), the Vanis or trading caste (30,000), and the Brahmins (18,000). The Mahars and Mangs also work as field-labourers. The number engaged in and supported by agriculture in 1901 was 432,814, or 58 per cent. of the total population.\n\nAn American Methodist Mission was established at Gulbarga in 1883, with a branch at Karni. A school connected with it has 200 pupils. The District contained 187 native Christians in 1901, of whom 113 were Roman Catholics and 62 Anglicans.\n\nGulbarga falls into two natural divisions, the Carnatic and the Telingana. In the former the regar or black cotton soil predominates, which is interspersed with masab or chalka; in the latter the masab and kharab or sandy soils predominate, though regar is not wanting. In the Carnatic portion rabi crops, such as white jowar, wheat, gram, cotton, and linseed, are extensively grown, while in the latter yellow jowar, bajra, castor seed, rice, linseed, and hemp are the common kharif crops. In the two Telingana taluks of Kodangal and Gurmatkal rice is largely raised with tank-irrigation. The soils of Chincholi and Mahagaon are lateritic, and are next to the regar in fertility.\n\nThe tenure of lands is mainly ryotwari. In 1901, out of an area of 2,428 square miles of khalsa, crown lands, and inams, 1,955 were cultivated, 43 being irrigated; 138 square miles were cultivable waste and fallows, 126 were occupied by forests, and 209 were not available for cultivation. The staple food-crop is jowar, covering 64 per cent. of the net area cropped. Bajra, rice, and wheat are next in importance, the area under each being 206, 32, and 22 square miles. Cotton and oilseeds were grown in 50 and 103 square miles.\n\nOn the completion of the settlement of the District in 1893, the whole of the available lands were taken up by the ryots, hence no extension of holdings has been possible. The cultivators have shown no disposition to adopt improved agricultural implements or new varieties of seed.\n\nThere is no particular breed of cattle, but those ordinarily reared are strong and suitable for ploughing the stiff regar and heavy loamy soils. Sheep and goats are of the ordinary type. Ponies are to be had everywhere for from Rs. 25 to Rs. 30, but those of the Andola taluk command\nas much as Rs. 100. Two Arab stallions are kept by the State at Gulbarga and Kodangal for the purpose of improving the breed of horses.\n\nThe total area of irrigated land in 1900\u20131 was 43 square miles, or about 2.2 per cent. of the cultivated area. The different sources of irrigation and the areas under each are as follows: canals and channels 4.5 square miles, and tanks and wells 38.5. Kodangal and Gurmatkal are the only taluks where tank-irrigation is carried on. There are altogether 107 large and 119 small tanks, 5,255 wells, and 196 other sources of irrigation, such as anicuts and channels, all in good repair.\n\nIn the Chincholi taluk 51 square miles of land were formed into a \u2018reserved\u2019 forest in 1896, which contains teak and other valuable timber. The taluks of Seram, Kodangal, Gurmatkal, and Mahagaon also contain some scrubby jungle and open forests. The total area of protected and unprotected forests is 126 square miles.\n\nThe most important mineral found and worked extensively in the District is laminated limestone, which occurs at Shahabad on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, Chitapur on the Nizam\u2019s Guaranteed State Railway, and also in the Gulbarga and Seram taluks. The stone is known as Shahabad stone, from the name of the place where it was first quarried, and is employed largely in roofing and flooring.\n\nAmong hand industries are the weaving of cotton and silk saris and cloth of gold, ordinary cotton cloth, and cotton tweeds. In the Andola and Chincholi taluks the shepherds make blankets of very superior quality valued at from Rs. 10 to Rs. 50, which are durable and waterproof. A large spinning and weaving mill, 2 miles west of Gulbarga, began working in 1886, with a capital of 12 lakhs. It contains 21,036 spindles and 224 looms, and gives occupation to 970 persons. There is one ginning factory in the Seram taluk.\n\nThe exports consist of jowar, bajra, and other cereals and pulses, hides, cotton, jaggery, oilseeds, tobacco, and tarvar bark used in tanning. The chief imports are salt, salted fish, opium, spices, silver and gold, refined sugar, sulphur, yarn, raw silk, iron, brass, cotton and woollen stuffs, matches, kerosene oil, and hardware. The city of Gulbarga is the chief centre of trade, to which everything is brought by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, and thence distributed to all parts of the District. The other centres are Tandur and Sulpet. The trading castes are Lingayat Vanis and Komatis, besides Momins, Marwaris, and Bhatias. The Bhatias, who come from Bombay, are engaged in the export of grain and oilseeds.\n\nThe Great Indian Peninsula Railway line enters the District at Dudneh in the west and leaves it near Wadi junction, with a length of 50 miles. The Nizam\u2019s Guaranteed State Railway, starting from Wadi junction, goes north-east and east for 115 miles.\nThe total length of roads is only 79 miles. These run from Gulbarga to Homn\u0101b\u0101d (37\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) miles), T\u0101nd\u016br station to Kosgi (26 miles), N\u0101wandgi station to Dichkanalli (11\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) miles), and the Malkhaid road (4 miles).\n\nAltogether eight famines were recorded during the last century, in 1804, 1819, 1833, 1854, 1873, 1877\u20138, 1897, and 1899\u20131900. The famine of 1804 was partly due to struggles with the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and partly to excessive rain, which prevented sowings; and that of 1873 was caused by the influx of people from the adjoining famine-stricken districts; all the others were the result of local drought and the failure of crops. The rainfall in 1899 was less than half the average, causing the failure of both the kharif and rabi crops, which resulted in the famine of 1900. The distress was intense, and relief measures were carried out at a cost to the State of 3\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) lakhs. The loss of cattle was computed at 28 per cent.\n\nThe District is divided into three subdivisions: the first comprising the t\u0101luks of Seram, Kodangal, and Y\u0101dg\u012br, under a Second T\u0101lukd\u0101r; the second comprising the t\u0101luks of Chincholi and Gulbarga, under a Third T\u0101lukd\u0101r; and the third comprising the t\u0101luks of Andola, Sh\u0101hpur, and S\u016br\u0101pur, under the head-quarters Second T\u0101lukd\u0101r. There is a tahs\u012bld\u0101r in each t\u0101luk.\n\nThe District civil court is under a Judge called the N\u0101zim-i-Diw\u0101ni, and each tahs\u012bld\u0101r sits as a subordinate civil court. The First T\u0101lukd\u0101r is the chief magistrate of the District, and the N\u0101zim-i-Diw\u0101ni is a Joint-Magistrate, who exercises magisterial powers during the absence of the First T\u0101lukd\u0101r from head-quarters. The Second and Third T\u0101lukd\u0101rs and the tahs\u012bld\u0101rs exercise second and third-class magisterial powers. As Gulbarga city is the head-quarters of the Division, the S\u016bbahd\u0101r and the N\u0101zim-i-S\u016bbah or Divisional Civil and Criminal Judge also hold their courts here. Serious crime in ordinary years is light, but cattle-thefts and dacoities increase in adverse seasons.\n\nThe District was formed in 1873, and then consisted of only six t\u0101luks, but on the breaking-up of the S\u016br\u0101pur District in 1883 the Andola t\u0101luk was transferred to Gulbarga. Prior to 1866, t\u0101luks were made over to revenue farmers who received 10 per cent. on the collections; but in 1866 regular officials were appointed for revenue and judicial work. The first regular settlement was completed in 1893 and the assessment was fixed for fifteen years, resulting in an increase of Rs. 1,76,970, or nearly 18 per cent. The average assessment on \u2018dry\u2019 land is Rs. 1\u20132 (maximum Rs. 2\u20132, minimum R. 1), and on \u2018wet\u2019 land Rs. 11 (maximum Rs. 14, minimum Rs. 5). The land revenue and the total revenue of the District are shown on the next page, in thousands of rupees.\n\nOwing to changes in area effected in 1905, the land revenue demand is now about 17.4 lakhs.\nThe levy of a local cess of one anna in the rupee on land revenue was commenced from 1890, five-twelfths of the total being set apart for roads and public purposes. Boards were constituted for every taluk, except Gulbarga, where a District board was formed, which supervises the working of the taluk boards and municipalities of Gulbarga and all taluk head-quarters. The total income in 1901 was Rs. 66,300, and the expenditure Rs. 48,600.\n\nThe First Talukdar is the head of the District police, the Mohtamim or Superintendent being his executive deputy. Under him are an assistant, 9 inspectors, 96 subordinate officers, 600 constables, and 30 mounted police, distributed among 34 thanas. The Central jail at Gulbarga is capable of accommodating 1,000 prisoners. Convicts with sentences exceeding six months from Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d, Raichur, and Ling\u0101g\u016br are sent here. The six outlying taluk offices have lock-ups for temporary confinement. The prisoners in the Central jail are taught various industries: and carpets, shatranjis, counterpanes, towels of sorts, cotton tweeds and other cloths, tents, and furniture of all descriptions are made, most of which are sold locally.\n\nGulbarga District takes a low place as regards the literacy of its population, of whom only 2 per cent. (3.8 males and 0.11 females) could read and write in 1901. The first State school was opened in 1866, and local board schools were established in 1890. The total number of pupils under instruction in 1881, 1891, 1901, and 1903 was 323, 2,130, 3,600, and 3,317 respectively. In 1903 there were 43 primary schools, one middle, and one high school, 273 girls being under instruction in that year. The total amount expended on education in 1901 was Rs. 26,750, of which 52 per cent. was devoted to primary schools.\n\nThe District possesses one hospital and four dispensaries, with accommodation for 24 in-patients. In 1901 the total number of cases treated in all these institutions was 34,438, of whom 204 were in-patients. The number of operations performed was 652. The total expenditure was Rs. 15,580, of which Rs. 12,555 was contributed by the State and Rs. 3,025 from the local cess. Besides these, there is a Y\u016bn\u0101ni dispensary in Gulbarga city, at which the total number of patients treated in 1901 was 24,295. The expenditure was Rs. 2,088, met wholly from the local cess.\n\nThe number of persons successfully vaccinated in 1900-1 was 1,766, or 2.37 per 1,000 of the population. Compared with previous years, the proportion has risen.\nGulbarga T\u0101luk.\u2014Central t\u0101luk of Gulbarga District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. In 1901 the area was 674 square miles, and the population 103,051, including j\u0101girs. The population in 1891 was 115,699, the decrease being due to plague. The t\u0101luk contains Gulbarga City (population, 29,228), the head-quarters of the Division, District, and t\u0101luk; and 145 villages, of which 37 are j\u0101gir. The land revenue in 1901 was 2\u00b78 lakhs. In 1905 the Mah\u0101gaon t\u0101luk was merged in Gulbarga. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway passes through the t\u0101luk, which is composed of black cotton soil. The two paigah il\u0101k\u016bs of Afzalpur and K\u0101lg\u012b, with populations of 34,909 and 30,610, and 47 and 43 villages respectively, lie to the west and east of Gulbarga. Their areas are about 151 and 136 square miles.\n\nGulbarga City.\u2014Ancient city and head-quarters of the Gulbarga Division and District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 17\u00b0 21' N. and 76\u00b0 51' E. The population in 1901 was 29,228, compared with 28,200 in 1891 and 22,834 in 1881. Gulbarga was formerly a Hindu city of some importance, and before the Musalm\u0101n conquest formed part of the dominions of the R\u0101j\u0101 of Warangal. Warangal, Gulbarga, and Bidar were successively captured by Muhammad bin Tughlak early in the fourteenth century. About 1345 the Deccan governors rebelled against Muhammad bin Tughlak; and in the confusion that followed Zafar Kh\u0101n assumed royal dignity and, proclaiming his independence, took possession of the Deccan provinces, including Daulat\u0101b\u0101d, Gulbarga, and Bidar, and establishing his capital at Gulbarga commenced to reign in 1347 under the title of Al\u0101-ud-din Hasan Sh\u0101h Gang\u016b Bahmani, or according to some historians Al\u0101-ud-din Bahman Sh\u0101h. Gulbarga remained the capital of the Bahmani kings from this date until the reign of Ahmad Sh\u0101h Wali, who removed his capital to Bidar. Gulbarga then rapidly lost its importance. In 1504 it was occupied by the Bij\u0101pur troops; and though recovered by Amir Barid in 1514, it was shortly after again taken by the Bij\u0101pur troops, and remained in the possession of the Adil Sh\u0101hi kings until the Mughal invasion of the Deccan, when Mir Jumla besieged and took it in 1657. From this period Gulbarga formed part of the Deccan possession of the Delhi rulers, till the surrender of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d to the first of the Niz\u0101ms. The old palaces and mosques which were erected by the Bahmani kings were suffered to fall into ruins and decay after the removal of the capital to Bidar.\n\nThe city is situated on an undulating plain, presenting a somewhat dreary expanse of black soil. It was made the head quarters of a Division about 1874, when a new era of prosperity commenced. It now contains the residence of the S\u016bbahd\u0101r, several large buildings for State offices and officials, a Central jail, a public garden, a large tank, an extensive market-place, schools, post office and other public\noffices, cotton-spinning and weaving mills, and a Christian mission with a school attached to it. The south-eastern line of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway has a station 2 miles from the town. Gulbarga is a large centre of trade, and has of late years become a most prosperous town and a rival of Sholapur. In the eastern quarter of the town are the tombs of the Bahmani kings. They are huge square buildings surmounted by domes, and are roughly but strongly built. Not far away is the shrine of Khw\u0101ja Banda Naw\u0101z, a celebrated Musalm\u0101n saint, who came here during the reign of Firoz Sh\u0101h Bahmani in 1413. To the north-west is the old fort of Gulbarga, the outer walls and gateways of which, together with most of the old buildings in it, are in a dilapidated condition. The b\u0101l\u0101 his\u0101r or citadel is in a better state of preservation. One of the most remarkable buildings in this part of India is the unfinished mosque in the old fort, built in the reign of Firoz Shah and modelled after the great mosque of Cordova in Spain, measuring 216 feet east and west, and 176 feet north and south, and covering an area of 38,016 square feet. Its great peculiarity is that the whole area is covered in.\n\nGuledgarh (Guledgud, or 'the emigration hill').\u2014Town in the B\u0101d\u0101mi taluka of Bij\u0101pur District, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 3' N. and 75\u00b0 47' E., 9 miles north-east of B\u0101d\u0101mi. Population (1901), 16,786, including suburb 672. There are local manufactures of cotton and silk cloth, which are exported to Sholapur, Poona, the Konkan, and Bombay. Guledgarh is one of the stations of the Basel Mission. In its neighbourhood are valuable stone quarries. The municipality was established in 1887, and had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 12,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 13,000. The town contains a dispensary. The fort was built in 1580 in the reign of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Adil Sh\u0101h II. The present town was built in 1706 on the site of a dry lake. It was besieged and plundered by one of the officers of the R\u0101st\u012b\u0101s in 1750. Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n took it in 1787. It was again plundered by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, when the town was deserted for a time. Repeopled by the Desai, it was again plundered and deserted in the disturbances caused by Narsingh. In 1818 General Munro, through the Desai, induced the inhabitants to return. In 1826 it fell to the British.\n\nGulf of Cambay. Strip of sea separating the peninsula of K\u0101thi\u0101war from the northern Bombay coast. See Cambay, Gulf of.\n\nGulf of Manaar. Gulf between India and Ceylon. See Manaar, Gulf of.\n\nGulshan\u0101b\u0101d. State and town in Central India. See Jaor\u0101.\n\nGumal Pass (Gomal).\u2014The route which leads along the valley of the Gumal river, through the Southern Waz\u012brist\u0101n Agency, North-West Frontier Province, from Murtaz\u0101 and Domandi, on the borders of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n and Baluchist\u0101n, to the Afgh\u0101n plateau. The Gumal\nis the oldest of all the trade routes in this quarter. Down it there pours yearly a succession of k\u0101filas or caravans led and followed by thousands of well-armed traders, called Powindas, from Afghanistan to India. These traders belong to the Ghilzai race, of which the chief tribes are the Dotannis, Sulaim\u0101n Khel, N\u0101sirs, Kharotis, Jandr\u0101n, &c.\n\n**Gumal River.**\u2014River on the north-west frontier of India, which rises near Sarwandi on the Koh N\u0101k range in Afghanistan, and flowing south-east enters British territory at Domandi, where it is joined by the Kundar. It runs thence eastwards till it reaches Murtaza in Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n District. Between Domandi and Murtaza the Gumal receives the waters of the Wana Toi (north bank) at Toi Khula, and the Zhob (south bank) at Khajuri Kach. From Domandi to Khajuri it is the boundary between the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchist\u0101n (Zhob Agency). The channel of the Gumal passes to the Indus a few miles south of Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n cantonment; but, except in times of flood, all the water is used for irrigation in Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n District and does not reach the Indus.\n\n**Gumla Subdivision.**\u2014South-western subdivision of R\u0101nch\u012b District, Bengal, lying between $22^\\circ 21'$ and $23^\\circ 38'$ N. and $84^\\circ 0'$ and $85^\\circ 6'$ E., with an area of 3,622 square miles. The subdivision is part of the undulating elevated plateau of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, but to the west and south the surface is more broken, the hills are steeper, and the valleys are replaced by ravines. The plateau falls away to the south, while the level of the country rises, and there is another and higher plateau to the west. The population in 1901 was 434,689, compared with 398,243 in 1891, the density being 120 persons per square mile. The subdivision contains one town, P\u0101lkot (population, 3,246), and 1,157 villages, of which Gumla is the head-quarters.\n\n**Gumla Village.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in R\u0101nch\u012b District, Bengal, situated in $23^\\circ 2'$ N. and $84^\\circ 33'$ E. Population (1901), 777. It is a flourishing trade centre.\n\n**Gumman\u0101yakanp\u0101lya.**\u2014Village in the B\u0101gepalli t\u0101luk of Kol\u0101 District, Mysore, situated in $13^\\circ 18'$ N. and $77^\\circ 55'$ E., 10 miles east of B\u0101gepalli town. Population (1901), 207. It is a small fortified circular rock in the midst of jungle, and was founded about 1350 by a Beda chief, after whom it is named. He and his brother maintained a band of freebooters from Cuddapah, on condition of receiving half the plunder they gained. Settlers were also encouraged by liberal terms. By 1412 an orderly government was introduced, and the robbers withdrew. In the next century the place became tributary to Vijayanagar, and it remained in the same family till taken by Haidar Ali.\n\n**G\u016bmsur.**\u2014Subdivision and t\u0101luk of Ganj\u0101m District, Madras. See GOOMSUR.\n\n**Gumti** (Gomati; possibly the Sambos of Arrian).\u2014River of the\nUnited Provinces, which rises (28\u00b0 35' N., 80\u00b0 7' E.) nearly 20 miles east of Pilibhit. For about twelve miles the river-bed is a mere depression, which dries up in the hot season. A small stream, the Gaihai, then joins it, and a shallow channel is formed, while after it has received the Joknai (35 miles from its source) it runs in a perennial stream. A few miles farther down the Paway\u0101n steam tramway crosses by a bridge 250 feet long, and the Sh\u0101hjah\u0101npur-Kheri road by a bridge 210 feet long. The Gumti then flows sluggishly through Sh\u0101hjah\u0101npur and Kheri, with a winding course and a network of channels, choked with weeds and aquatic plants. Below Muhamdi it changes its character, and has a well-defined channel 100 to 200 feet wide, with banks increasing in height to 60 feet at Lucknow, 180 miles from its source. Two considerable affluents, the Kathn\u0101 (90 miles long) and Saray\u0101n (120 miles), join the Gumti in Sit\u0101pur. At Lucknow it is crossed by two railway bridges, and one stone, one brick, and two iron road-bridges. From Lucknow its course winds much through B\u0101ra Banki, Sult\u0101npur, and Jaunpur Districts, the distance by river from Lucknow to Jaunpur being almost double the distance in a direct line. The breadth of the river increases from 120 to 200 feet in Lucknow and B\u0101ra Banki to 200 to 400 in Sult\u0101npur, and 400 to 600 in Jaunpur. At Jaunpur it is crossed by a magnificent stone bridge, 654 feet long, built at the end of the sixteenth century, and also by a railway bridge. The Sai, a large river which runs parallel to the Gumti for over 350 miles, joins it below Jaunpur. From this point the river flows through the Districts of Jaunpur and Benares, and joins the Ganges at Saidpur in Gh\u0101zipur District, after a total course of nearly 500 miles.\n\nThe Gumti with its tributaries drains about 7,500 square miles, and is especially liable to severe floods, causing much damage. A careful survey of the river was made after the flood of 1894. It then appeared that the floods are entirely due to excessive rainfall in the catchment area, and not to spill from other rivers. At Lucknow the fall is only 9 inches per mile, and at Jaunpur only 6 inches, so that flood-water cannot be carried off fast enough. After heavy rain in September, 1894, the river rose at Lucknow to a height of 22 feet above the ordinary low-water level. There is a tradition that in 1774 the Gumti rose so high at Jaunpur that boats sailed over the bridge, the parapet of which is 27 feet above low-water level. In 1871 the water rose there to a height of 9 feet above the parapet; 4,000 houses were destroyed in the city, and nearly 9,000 in the villages of the District. In September, 1894, the river again rose 27 feet above low-water level, and 1,378 houses in the city were partly or completely destroyed. The Gumti is navigable as high as Muhamdi, but traffic is not very considerable. Grain, fuel, and thatching-grass are carried down stream, and stone is taken up. It is not used for irrigation.\nGuna.\u2014Town and British military station in the Is\u0101garh district of Gwalior State, Central India, situated in $24^\\circ 39'$ N. and $77^\\circ 19'$ E., on the Agra-Bombay road, and on the Bina-B\u0101ran branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 11,452, including military station. Originally a small village, the place rose in importance after 1844, when it became a station for a regiment of Gwalior Contingent Cavalry. The opening of the railway from Guna to B\u0101ran in 1899 at once increased its importance as a trading centre, and it has continued to develop rapidly. The town, which has a population (1901) of 5,415, contains a charitable dispensary, a State post office, a sarai, and a school.\n\nThe military station lies on a picturesquely wooded site about a mile east of the town, and has a population (1901) of 6,037. After the Gwalior Contingent revolted in 1857, the station was for a time occupied by British troops, but since 1860 it has been garrisoned by the Central India Horse. Up to 1896 the officer commanding was also in political charge of the surrounding minor States, now included in the Gwalior Residency. He is still an ex-officio Assistant to the Resident at Gwalior, and exercises the powers of a second-class magistrate for Guna station. Besides the regular military hospital, a civil dispensary, a school, and an inspection bungalow are situated here. The local funds, raised chiefly from octroi, bring in an income of about Rs. 6,500 a year.\n\nGundak.\u2014River of Nep\u0101l and Bengal. See Gandak.\n\nGundalpet.\u2014Southern taluk of Mysore District, Mysore State, lying between $11^\\circ 36'$ and $12^\\circ 1'$ N. and $76^\\circ 24'$ and $76^\\circ 52'$ E., with an area of 535 square miles. The population in 1901 was 74,897, compared with 63,936 in 1891. The taluk contains one town, Gundalpet (population, 4,065), the head-quarters; and 155 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 91,000. The west and south are occupied by extensive forests, separated from the inhabited portions by ranges of hills running parallel with these boundaries and culminating in the Gop\u0101lsw\u0101mi Betta, situated at the angle where they diverge. The Gundal river flows through the taluk from south to north and has a dam for irrigation. The Moy\u0101r runs along the south boundary, but in a very sunken bed. Jola is the staple \u2018dry crop,\u2019 and r\u0101gi is also grown. The area under \u2018wet crops\u2019 is small, but a superior rice is raised under the Vijayapur tank, and betel-leaf of a special quality and value is largely grown. Wild date groves abound on the banks of the Gundal and its feeders.\n\nGundi\u0101li.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nGundlakamma.\u2014River of Southern India, which rises in the Nallamalai hills in Kurnool District, Madras, in $15^\\circ 48'$ N. and $78^\\circ 51'$ E. Shortly afterwards it is joined by two mountain streams, the\nZampaleru and the Enumaleru, and then enters the plains through the Cumbum gh\u0101\u1e6d. An enormous reservoir, known as the Cumbum tank, has been formed for irrigation purposes by throwing a dam across the gap at this point. After issuing from this tank, the river turns to the north and runs under the Velikonda hills in a meandering course through a corner of Kurnool District. It next enters the south of Gunt\u016br District, then turns first east and later south-east, flowing part of this distance through Nellore District, and at last falls into the sea in $15^\\circ 34' \\text{N.}$ and $80^\\circ 10' \\text{E.}$, near Pedda Devaramp\u0101\u1e0d, about 12 miles north of Ongole. The river comes down in freshes in September, October, and November; and during high tides it is navigable for two miles inland from its mouth.\n\nVarious projects have been put forward for utilizing its waters for irrigation on a large scale. One scheme is to build a masonry dam across it at Tangir\u0101\u1e37a, about 12 miles south-west of Vinukonda in Gunt\u016br District. This would intercept the drainage from an area of 1,771 square miles, and form a reservoir 15 square miles in extent, capable of storing water sufficient to irrigate about 130,000 acres. The supply in the reservoir would be taken down the bed of the river for 23 miles to a point where a dam could be built to turn it into a channel on the left bank, which would distribute it over the Ongole t\u0101luk. The estimated cost of this project is about 60 lakhs, and it is expected to yield a return of from 2 to 3 per cent. on the capital outlay.\n\n**Gundlupet.**\u2014T\u0101luk of Mysore District, Mysore. See Gundalpet.\n\n**Guni.**\u2014T\u0101luka in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d District, Sind, Bombay, lying between $24^\\circ 30'$ and $25^\\circ 10'$ N. and $68^\\circ 20'$ and $68^\\circ 50'$ E., with an area of 986 square miles. The population in 1901 was 91,506, compared with 79,940 in 1891. The density, 93 persons per square mile, is below the District average. The t\u0101luka contains one town, Tando Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n (population, 4,635), the head-quarters; and 158 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to more than 2\u00bd lakhs. The t\u0101luka consists of a level plain, of which the monotony is broken only by two small hills. Considerable irrigation works have been constructed, and others are in contemplation. The principal crops are rice, bajra, wheat, barley, and sugar-cane.\n\n**Gunnaur Tahsil.**\u2014North-western tahsil of Budaun District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Asadpur and R\u0101jpura, and lying between $28^\\circ 6'$ and $28^\\circ 29'$ N. and $78^\\circ 16'$ and $78^\\circ 39'$ E., with an area of 370 square miles. Population increased from 126,440 in 1891 to 162,291 in 1901. There are 313 villages and one town, Gunnaur (population, 6,644), the tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 2,16,000, and for cesses Rs. 26,000. The density of population, 439 persons per square mile, is below the District average, though the rate of increase between 1891 and 1901 was higher\nthan in any other tahsil. Gunnaur lies almost entirely in the Ganges kh\u0101dar, the high sandy tract characteristic of Budaun only crossing the south-east corner. It is thus liable to floods, but benefits by comparatively dry seasons. A considerable tract is still occupied by jungle. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 246 square miles, of which 40 were irrigated, wells being the chief source of supply.\n\n**Gunnaur Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Budaun District, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 14' N. and 78\u00b0 27' E., 4 miles south of Babr\u0101l\u0101 station on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. Population (1901), 6,644. The town was the head-quarters of a mah\u0101l or pargana under Akbar, but its early history is legendary. It is chiefly composed of mud huts with a few brick houses, and contains a dispensary and a branch of the American Methodist Mission. Gunnaur is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,000. A good deal of trade passes through the place to Babr\u0101l\u0101 station. There are a middle school with 90 pupils and a girls\u2019 school with 15.\n\n**Guntakal.**\u2014Village in the Gooty taluk of Anantapur District, Madras, situated in 15\u00b0 9' N. and 72\u00b0 23' E. Population (1901), 6,059. It is an important railway junction. Here the north-west line of the Madras Railway is joined by the three branches of the Southern Mahratta Railway which lead respectively to Bezw\u0101da, Bangalore, and Bellary. The distance from Guntakal to Bombay is 518 miles, to Madras 276, to Bellary 30, to Bangalore 174, and to Bezw\u0101da 279 miles. A steam cotton-press, known as Volkart\u2019s United Press, has been erected; but the existence of the junction has done little for the place, and it is not rapidly increasing. On the high ground to the south-west, one of the most dreary spots in all the Presidency, have been discovered several prehistoric implements, &c.\n\n**Guntok.**\u2014Capital of Sikkim State. See Gangtok.\n\n**Guntupalli.**\u2014Hamlet in the Ellore taluk of Kistna District, Madras, situated in 17\u00b0 N. and 81\u00b0 8' E., 24 miles north of Ellore town. Population (1901), 1,092. On the western side of a small ravine running up into a low group of hills are extensive rock-cut Buddhist remains. These consist of a chaitya cave, a circular chamber with a simple fa\u00e7ade containing a d\u0101gaba cut in the solid rock, and several sets of vih\u0101ra caves with entrance halls and chambers on each side. On the ridge shutting in the ravine are a series of cut stone d\u0101gabas, and a brick st\u016bpa in fair preservation. The date of these remains is placed at about 100 B.C. The chaitya cave is still resorted to as a place of pilgrimage. Local tradition asserts that there was formerly a town called Jainapuram on the site of Guntupalli.\n\n**Gunt\u016br District.**\u2014A District in the Madras Presidency which has recently (1904) been constituted out of the Ongole taluk of Nellore and\nportions of Kistna District. Its head-quarters are at the town after which it is named, and it consists of the revenue subdivisions of Gunt\u00fcr, Ten\u0101li, Narasaraopet, and Ongole. Until 1859 there was an older District of the same name and with the same head-quarters. This was abolished in that year and divided between the Districts of Rajahmundry and Masulipatam, which were renamed God\u0101vari and Kistna. Subsequent to this change the construction and extension of the great irrigation systems which lead from the God\u0101vari and Kistna rivers, and the increase in work of all kinds which is necessarily the result of improvement in the methods of administration, rendered the task of efficiently controlling these two wealthy areas more than one Collector could compass. The God\u0101vari District has accordingly now been lightened by the transfer to Kistna of the t\u0101luks of Yernagudem, Ellore, Tanuku, Bhimavaram, and Narasapur (excluding Nagaram Island), while Kistna has been relieved of the t\u0101luks of Ten\u0101li, Gunt\u00fcr, Sattanapalle, Palnad, B\u0101patla, Narasaraopet, and Vinukonda, which, with the Ongole t\u0101luk of Nellore, have been formed into the new Gunt\u00fcr District. Its area is 5,733 square miles, the population (1901) 1,490,635, and the land revenue demand 56\u00bd lakhs.\n\nGunt\u00fcr Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of Gunt\u00fcr District, Madras, consisting of the Gunt\u00fcr and Sattanapalle t\u0101luks.\n\nGunt\u00fcr T\u0101luk.\u2014T\u0101luk of Gunt\u00fcr District, Madras, lying between 16\u00b0 8' and 16\u00b0 35' N. and 80\u00b0 20' and 80\u00b0 41' E., with an area of 500 square miles. The population in 1901 was 200,557, compared with 266,817 in 1891. The t\u0101luk contains two towns\u2014Gunt\u00fcr (population, 30,833), the head-quarters, and Mangalagiri (7,702) and 109 villages, of which Undavalalle is interesting for its archaeological remains. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 5,13,000. In the south of the t\u0101luk the tract adjoining B\u0101patla is a fertile expanse of black soil, a veritable garden when the rainfall is sufficient, but extremely desolate in dry weather. The centre of the t\u0101luk is liable to be submerged by floods, which deposit a wealth of river mud on the land, making portions of it very fertile. The country is well supplied with good roads, and the Bank Canal passes through a portion of its north-eastern corner. The heat in April and May is excessive, but after the north-east monsoon breaks the weather becomes cool and pleasant.\n\nGunt\u00fcr Town.\u2014Former head-quarters of the Collector of the old Gunt\u00fcr District, Madras, situated in 16\u00b0 18' N. and 80\u00b0 28' E. Since 1859 it was the station of the Sub-Collector of Kistna, and it has recently become the head-quarters of a new Gunt\u00fcr District. It was constituted a municipality in 1866. The municipal income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 49,000 and Rs. 48,000 respectively. In 1903-4 the income amounted to\nRs. 1,58,000 and the expenditure to Rs. 1,55,000; of the former, Rs. 1,00,000 was contributed by Government, and the rest was principally derived from the house and land taxes and tolls. The population in 1901 numbered 30,833, of whom 22,843 were Hindus, 6,926 Musalmans, and 1,060 Christians. The town is situated 6 miles to the east of the Kondavid hills, which the rays of the evening sun light up with beautiful effect. It was apparently founded in the second half of the eighteenth century by the French, who preferred it to Kondavid, the head-quarters of the sarkar then in their possession, on account of its greater coolness and better water-supply. The town indeed derives its name from the Telugu gunta, 'a tank.' Guntur still enjoys the reputation of being one of the healthiest and best-conserved towns in the Presidency, but as compared with other places its water-supply can no longer be considered good. A partial scheme for improving it by tapping some springs in the neighbourhood has recently been completed at a cost of over 2 lakhs.\n\nWhen the Northern Circars were ceded to the British in 1765, Guntur was specially exempted from the cession during the life of Bas\u0101lat Jang, whose j\u0101gir it was. In 1778 the Madras Government rented the place from Bas\u0101lat Jang. It was restored to him in 1780, but again came into the hands of the British in 1788, the cession being finally confirmed in 1823.\n\nFive lines of road converge on the town, the most important being the trunk road which runs from Sit\u0101nagaram, on the Kistna river near Bezw\u0101da, to Madras. It is a great centre of the cotton trade, containing three steam and two hand presses, and five ginning factories. It possesses a second-grade college, managed by the American Evangelical Lutheran Mission. In former days, during the hot season when the canals were closed, the only means of egress was by a road journey of 60 miles to Masulipatam and thence by steamer to Madras. This inaccessibility has been removed since the opening of the East Coast and Southern Mahratta Railways, on the latter of which it has a station.\n\nGunupur.\u2014Agency tahsil in Vizagapatam District, Madras, lying on the Ganjam border, with an area of about 600 square miles. The population in 1901 was 113,682, compared with 113,822 in 1891, consisting of Khonds and Savaras, with a sprinkling of Oriy\u0101 Br\u0101hmans and a considerable number of Telugus. The number of villages is 1,149, and the head-quarters are at Gunupur. The tahsil lies entirely in the valley of the Vamsadh\u0101ra river, and is extensively cultivated with rice and 'dry grains.' The greater part of it is included in the Jeypore estate, but part belongs to the zamindar of Kurup\u0101m.\n\nGurd\u0101spur District.\u2014District in the Lahore Division of the Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 35' and 32\u00b0 30' N. and 74\u00b0 52' and 75\u00b0 56' E., with an area of 1,889 square miles. It is bounded on the\nnorth by the Jammu province of Kashmir; on the west by Si\u0101lkot District; on the south-west by Amritsar; on the south-east and east by the Be\u0101s, which separates it from the Kap\u016brthala State and Hoshiarpur District, and also by Kangra District; and on the north-east by the Chamba State.\n\nThe District occupies the submontane portion of the B\u0101ri Do\u0101b, together with a triangular wedge of territory west of the R\u0101vi. It includes the hill stations of Dalhousie and Bakloh, two isolated pieces of hill territory acquired from the Chamba State, together with a strip of territory on which the cart-road runs connecting these outlying stations with the main body of the District. Dalhousie crowns the westernmost shoulder of a magnificent snowy range, the Dhaola Dh\u0101r, between which and the plains two minor ranges intervene. The Pathankot tahsil comprises 130 miles of hilly country between the R\u0101vi and the Chakki torrent, which divides it from Kangra District. The central watershed of the Do\u0101b consists of an elevated plain, contracted to an apex just below the hills, but rapidly spreading out like an open fan until it fills the whole space between the two river-beds. Well-defined banks terminate the plateau on either side, the country falling abruptly away to the present level of the rivers. The bank towards the Be\u0101s valley attains a considerable height, and is covered by a ridge of drifted sand; that towards the R\u0101vi is less marked. The plain, though apparently a dead level, has a sufficient westward slope to cause a rapid flow of water in definite drainage lines after heavy rain. Immediately below the hills the country is well wooded, undulating, and picturesque; and, being constantly kept cool and moist by the drainage of the hills, it wears an aspect of freshness very different from the arid monotony of the plains. West of the R\u0101vi is a small tract between that river and the Jammu hills, watered by numerous flowing streams and of great fertility; but the rest of the District west of the R\u0101vi is, with the exception of the riverain strips, an arid expanse of rolling downs intersected by sandy torrent beds.\n\nThe Chakki stream, after forming the eastern border of the Pathankot tahsil, falls into the Be\u0101s, which touches the boundary of the District at Mirthal, and thence, running south, divides it from Hoshiarpur District on the east. On the west, the R\u0101vi forms the border between Gurd\u0101spur and the Jammu State for about 25 miles, after which it enters the District and meanders in a south-westerly course till it leaves Gurd\u0101spur and forms the boundary between Si\u0101lkot and Amritsar Districts. Its chief tributary is the Ujh, which enters the Shakargarh tahsil from Jammu. Several minor torrents traverse the District, and the drainage from the hills has formed large jhils or swamps, of which the K\u0101hn\u016bw\u0101n is the largest. Their area has, how-\never, been much diminished by drainage during recent years. The B\u0101r\u012b Do\u0101b Canal, which takes off from the R\u0101vi at M\u0101dhopur, just south of the hills, runs for some miles through a deep cutting, but emerges on the level a little east of Gurd\u0101spur town, and divides into four main branches.\n\nWith the exception of a narrow strip penetrating the hills between the Chakki and R\u0101vi rivers, the whole of the District lies on the alluvium. The north-east running up to Dalhousie includes representatives of the older rocks of the Central Him\u0101layan zone, consisting of slates overlain by conglomerates and limestones. The slates are usually referred to the infra-Blaini series of Simla, and the conglomerates, with which are associated masses of trap, to the Blaini group, while the limestones are supposed to represent the Krol group. To the southwest of these, the outer hills are composed of sandstones and conglomerates of Upper Tertiary age, belonging to the Siw\u0101lik series.\n\nThe District includes portions of several different botanical areas. Its southern part is entirely in the Central Punjab plain, and the flora resembles that of Jullundur. Owing to dense cultivation, there are few wild plants, except the field weeds that come up with the spring and autumn crops; but on the rivers the t\u0101li (Dalbergia Sissoo) occurs, and blocks of inferior soil are covered with a jungle of reed-grass (Saccharum and Andropogon sp.) and tamarisk (jhao, pilchi). Trees are chiefly planted, but the dh\u0101k (Butea frondosa) and kikar (Acacia arabica) grow spontaneously, though the second is a doubtful native. The ber (Zizyphus Jujuba) is abundant. The submontane tract east of the R\u0101vi is well wooded; the mango, the j\u0101mun (Eugenia Jambolana), and the mulberry, with different shrubs and herbs of the Outer Him\u0101laya, are frequent. West of the R\u0101vi there is little natural vegetation. The Path\u0101nkot tahsil is mainly Outer Him\u0101layan.\n\nThe wild animals include the leopard, wolf, wild cat, hyena, hog, and deer, found chiefly in the Path\u0101nkot tahsil. Nilgai are also common. Owing to the drying up of the jhils, the water-fowl for which the District was once famous have largely disappeared.\n\nThe climate is on the whole good, and, because of the proximity of the hills, the heat is never excessive. The Path\u0101nkot tahsil is decidedly malarious, owing to its heavy rainfall, and to the large proportion of its soil which is saturated with canal-irrigation. Goitre is common here and spleen disease in all parts.\n\nThe rainfall is abundant. Excluding Dalhousie, where the annual fall averages 80 inches, the average varies from 24 inches at Aliw\u0101l in the Bat\u0101la tahsil to 51 inches at M\u0101dhopur, where 11 inches fall in the winter and 40 in the summer. The heaviest rainfall recorded during the twenty years ending 1901 was 99 inches at Dalhousie in 1882\u20133, and 80 inches at M\u0101dhopur in 1881\u20132. Only 9\u00b76 inches fell at Aliw\u0101l\nin 1899\u20131900. In 1870 the R\u0101vi altered its course, and began to threaten the town of Dera N\u0101nak. In spite of strenuous efforts made to divert the channel, the river carried away the T\u0101li S\u0101hib temple, and the town itself was only saved by the erection of a strong embankment. There were heavy floods in 1892 and 1894.\n\nThe earliest relics of antiquity are the cave-temples of Mukheshwar, attributed to the P\u0101ndavas, on the R\u0101vi. Path\u0101nkot was the seat of an ancient Hindu kingdom whose history is related in the article on that town. During the Saiyid dynasty the District was in the heart of the Khokhar country, and Kal\u0101naur was twice attacked by Jasrath Khokhar. Akbar was at Kal\u0101naur when he received the news of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s death, and he was here installed by Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n on February 15, 1556, and seems often subsequently to have held his court here. He had to retake the District from Sikandar Sh\u0101h, S\u016bri, in the following year. Under Akbar the Afgh\u0101ns who had been settled at K\u0101hm\u016bw\u0101n by Sher Sh\u0101h were driven out, and the place became a favourite resort of Jah\u0101ng\u012br. In the reign of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n the Sh\u0101h Nahr or \u2018royal canal\u2019 was begun, in order to conduct water from the R\u0101vi to the gardens at Sh\u0101lam\u0101r, near Lahore; and prince Mur\u0101d\u2019s army assembled at Bahr\u0101mpur, the head-quarters of the chaklad\u0101r or governor of Jammu and Kangra, for his campaign against R\u0101j\u0101 Jagat Chand. The chief historical importance of the District, however, lies in its connexion with the rise of the Sikhs. Dera N\u0101nak on the R\u0101vi preserves the name of the founder of Sikhism, who died in 1538 on the opposite bank. Both Gur\u016b Amar D\u0101s and Gur\u016b Har Rai were also connected with the District. In 1710 the Sikh leader Banda plundered Bat\u0101la and Kal\u0101naur, and made the District the head-quarters of his raids on the neighbourhood. Driven into the hills by Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h in 1711, he returned and built a fort at Lohgarh, identified with the modern Gurd\u0101spur, and defeated Isl\u0101m Jang, viceroy of Lahore. In 1713 Abdus Samad Kh\u0101n drove him back to the hills, and, though he again returned and recaptured Kal\u0101naur, finally took him prisoner at Lohgarh in 1716.\n\nThe next period in the history of the District is closely connected with Adina Beg. At first governor of Bahr\u0101mpur and subsequently of the Jullundur Do\u0101b, he founded D\u012bn\u0101nagar in 1730, which he seems generally to have made his head-quarters. This ruler is chiefly remarkable for the astuteness with which he played off Ahmad Sh\u0101h, the Delhi emperors, and the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, one against the other, until he was installed by the last-named power as governor of Lahore with headquarters at Bat\u0101la. His death in 1758 removed the main obstacle to the spread of the Sikh power, which was only temporarily checked by their defeat at Barn\u0101la in 1762.\n\nThe Sikh R\u0101mgarhia confederacy, under the famous Jassa Singh,\nthen occupied Bat\u0101la, Din\u0101nagar, Kal\u0101naur, Sr\u012bgovindpur, and other places, the rest of the B\u0101ri Do\u0101b south of Din\u0101nagar falling into the hands of the Kanhay\u0101s, while west of the R\u0101vi the Bhang\u012b confederacy rose to power. The rival confederacies soon fell out, and a struggle for supremacy ensued between the R\u0101mgarhi\u0101s and Kanhay\u0101s; the Bhangis, who supported the former, lost their power in these parts in 1774, and Jassa Singh himself was expelled by the Kanhay\u0101s. He returned in 1783, but again lost Bat\u0101la to the Kanhay\u0101s in 1786; and two years after his death, in 1806, all the remaining possessions of the R\u0101mgarhia confederacy were annexed by Ranjit Singh. The Kanhay\u0101 estates were confiscated in 1811, and later on Bat\u0101la and its dependencies were assigned to Sher Singh, a putative son of Ranjit Singh by his Kanhay\u0101 wife, Maht\u0101b Kaur. Din\u0101nagar was a favourite resort of Ranjit Singh, and it was there that in 1838 he received the Macnaghten mission which negotiated the proposed alliance for placing Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101 on the throne of K\u0101bul.\n\nPath\u0101nkot and a few neighbouring villages in the plains, together with all the hilly portion of the District, formed part of the country ceded by the Sikhs to the British after the first Sikh War in 1846. Under the original distribution of the new territory they were attached to K\u0101ngra; but after the final annexation in 1849, the upper portion of the B\u0101ri Do\u0101b became a separate District, with its head-quarters at Bat\u0101la. In 1852 the head-quarters were removed to Gurd\u0101spur, and in 1853 the District received an addition by the transfer from Si\u0101lkot of the Shakargarh tahsil. No outbreak took place during the Mutiny, in spite of the large number of Hindust\u0101nis then employed on the head-works of the canal; but the ford of Trimmu was the scene of the battle at which Nicholson, after his famous forced march from Amritsar, intercepted and destroyed the Si\u0101lkot mutineers. In 1853 the site for the new sanitarium of Dalhousie, together with the strip of hill road connecting it with the plains, was acquired by the British Government by purchase from the Chamba State. It was transferred from K\u0101ngra in 1860, and in 1862 the further transfer of a strip of hill country between the R\u0101vi and the Chakki brought the District into its present shape.\n\nRecent authorities locate the Sangala of Alexander\u2019s historians, the stronghold of the Kathaei, in Gurd\u0101spur District, but the exact site has not been determined. If this theory be correct, the twelve altars set up by Alexander to mark the extreme limit of his advance were probably erected in the Be\u0101s lowlands, somewhere near the meeting-point of the three Districts of Gurd\u0101spur, Hoshi\u0101rpur, and K\u0101ngra. The antiquities of Path\u0101nkot are dealt with in the article on that town. It is impossible to fix the date of the rock-temples at Mukheshwar (Mukesar) on the R\u0101vi, which legend attributes to the P\u0101ndavas.\nThe only inscription is undecipherable, but, judging from the character of the letters that have been made out, it dates approximately from the eleventh century. The soft sandstone of the sculptures has everywhere decayed. Among monuments of later date, the most interesting is the masonry platform at Kal\u0101naur, which marks the scene of Akbar's coronation in 1556. For particulars as to other remains of interest, see the article on Bat\u0101la Town.\n\nGurd\u0101spur contains 11 towns and 2,244 villages. Its population at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 823,695, (1891) 943,922, and (1901) 940,334. During the last decade it decreased by 0.4 per cent., the fall being largely accounted for by emigration, about 44,000 settlers having gone from this District to the Chen\u0101b Colony. The District is divided into the four tahsils of Gurd\u0101spur, Bat\u0101la, Shakargarh, and Path\u0101nkot, the headquarters of each being at the place from which it is named. The chief towns are the municipalities of Gurd\u0101spur, the administrative headquarters of the District, Dalhousie, Bat\u0101la, D\u012bn\u0101nagar, Kal\u0101naur, Path\u0101nkot, Suj\u0101npur, Dera N\u0101nak, and Srigobindpur.\n\nThe following table shows the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Gurd\u0101spur  | 496                  | 3               | 668      | 238,379    | 520.9                     | + 2.5                                         | 7,478                                  |\n| Shakargarh | 485                  | 7               | 703      | 234,495    | 483.4                     | - 6.3                                         | 4,789                                  |\n| Path\u0101nkot  | 367                  | 5               | 395      | 141,623    | 385.9                     | + 0.5                                         | 5,250                                  |\n| Bat\u0101la     | 470                  | 3               | 478      | 305,807    | 632.6                     | + 1.7                                         | 9,262                                  |\n| District total | 1,880              | 11              | 2,244    | 940,334    | 497.8                     | + 0.4                                         | 26,779                                 |\n\n* The only figures available for the areas of tahsils are those derived from the revenue returns, and the tahsil densities have been calculated on the areas given in the revenue returns for 1900-1. These returns do not always cover the whole of the country comprised in a tahsil; and hence the total of the tahsil areas does not agree with the District area as shown in the Census Report of 1901, in the table above, and on page 390, which is the complete area as calculated by the Survey department. The tracts not included in the revenue survey are as a rule uninhabited or very sparsely populated.\n\nMuhammadans number 463,371, or over 49 per cent. of the total; Hindus, 380,636, or over 40 per cent.; and Sikhs, 91,756, or 10 per cent. Mirza Ghul\u0101m Ahmad of K\u0101di\u0101n, who claims to be the Mahdi and the Messiah, has founded a Muhammadan sect known as the Ahmadiy\u0101s. The District contains several important Sikh shrines, especially at Dera N\u0101nak, and a large number of Hindu and Sikh religious houses. The density of the population is high. The language of the District is chiefly Punjabi, but a good deal of Dogri is spoken on the Jammu border.\nThe agricultural Jats are the most numerous tribe, numbering 143,000, or 15 per cent. of the total. Other agricultural tribes are the Rajputs, who mostly inhabit the submontane portion of the District and number 80,000, the Arains (64,000), and the Gujars (49,000). Of the commercial and money-lending classes, the most numerous are the Khatris (17,000) and Mahajan Pahari (14,000), who are stronger here than in any other part of the Province. The Brahmins number 45,000. Of artisan classes, the Julahas (weavers, 47,000), Tarkhans (carpenters, 35,000), Kumhars (potters, 22,000), Telis (oil-pressers, 19,000), and Mochis (shoemakers and leather-workers, 15,000) are the most important. The menial castes include the Chuhrahs (sweepers, 67,000), Jhinwars (water-carriers, 39,000), Nais (barbers, 16,000), Chhimbas and Dhobis (washerwomen, 13,000), Chamars (field labourers, general coolies, and leather workers, 28,000), Dumnas (makers of bamboo articles, 10,000), and Meghs (weavers, 7,000). Other castes worth mentioning in this District are the Mirasis (village minstrels, 31,000), Fakirs (mendicants, 17,000), and Barwala (village watchmen and messengers, 11,000). About 50 per cent. of the population are supported by agriculture.\n\nThe American United Presbyterian Mission has been established in Gurdaspur since 1872, and occupies the Pathankot and Shakargarh tahsilts. The Church Missionary Society has an important station at Batla, established in 1878, where it maintains the flourishing Baring high school. In 1901 the District contained 4,198 native Christians.\n\nThe soils of the hilly tract consist of beds of conglomerate and boulder drift, changing into strata of soft sandstone alternated with beds of stiff red clay. The surface soil is nowhere rich, and, where the sandstone is close to the surface, needs constant showers of rain. In the plains, the soil varies from the sandy soils of Shakargarh to the light loam which is largely characteristic of the plains portion of the Doab, with clay soils in the canal-irrigated tracts and rich alluvial deposits in the river-beds. Fertile as the District is with its ordinary supply of rain, the crop failure is apt to be complete when rain fails, except where there is irrigation; fortunately, however, two bad harvests in succession are almost unknown.\n\nThe District is held almost entirely on the bhaiyachari and pattidari tenures, zamindari lands covering only about 55 square miles.\n\nThe area for which details are available from the revenue records of 1903-4 is 1,824 square miles, as shown on the next page.\n\nWheat is the chief crop of the spring harvest, covering 510 square miles in 1903-4; gram and barley covered 132 and 81 square miles, respectively. Sugar-cane, the chief crop of the autumn harvest, is the most valuable staple; and the area under sugar-cane (82 square miles)\nis greater, both actually and relatively, than in any other District in the Province. Rice, maize, and pulses are the chief autumn food-grains, covering 91, 106, and 147 square miles, respectively.\n\n| Tahsil     | Total area | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Gurdaspur  | 496        | 379        | 79        | 37              |\n| Shakargarh | 485        | 395        | 19        | 30              |\n| Pathankot  | 397        | 299        | 58        | 40              |\n| Bat\u0101la     | 476        | 380        | 188       | 34              |\n| **Total**  | **1,824**  | **1,333**  | **344**   | **141**         |\n\nThe cultivated area increased by nearly 5 cent. during the decade ending 1901, the increase being chiefly due to the extension of canal-irrigation. Nothing has been done to improve the quality of the crops grown, but owing to the development of the export trade the cultivation of wheat has greatly increased of recent years. Loans for the construction of wells are popular, and Rs. 24,000 was advanced under the Land Improvement Loans Act during the five years ending 1903-4.\n\nThe cattle of the District deserve no particular mention, though the breed has been considerably improved by the introduction of Hissar bulls, and a fair of some importance is held at Din\u0101nagar. The horses of the Shakargarh tahsil are above the average. The District board maintains three horse and three donkey stallions; the people keep very few camels, and the sheep and goats are not of importance.\n\nOf the total area cultivated in 1903-4, 344 square miles, or 26 per cent., were classed as irrigated. Of this area, 215 square miles were irrigated from wells, 2,046 acres from wells and canals, 121 square miles from canals, and 3,150 acres from streams and tanks. In addition, 193 square miles, or 14 per cent., are subject to inundation from the R\u0101vi, Sutlej, and other streams. Half the canal-irrigation is from the B\u0101ri Do\u0101b Canal, while the remainder is provided by private inundation canals which water the riverain tracts, chiefly in the Path\u0101nkot tahsil. Owing to the rapid slope of the country, there is practically no well-irrigation north of the road which passes through Gurdaspur and Shakargarh; but south of this wells become more frequent, and in the Bat\u0101la tahsil are an important feature in the agricultural conditions of the country. The District has 6,760 masonry wells, all worked with Persian wheels by cattle, and 2,988 lever wells, unbricked wells, and water-lifts.\n\n'Reserved' forests, covering 12\u00b75 square miles, are managed by the Deputy-Conservator of the Kangra division. The chil (Pinus longifolia) is the most important tree. About 400 acres of unclassed forests and Government waste are under the control of the Deputy-Commissioner.\nThe Path\u0101nkot tahsil is abundantly wooded, mango groves and bamboo clumps having been planted round most of the villages. The submontane tract in Shakargarh is very bare, but the plains portion of the District is on the whole well covered with trees, and the avenues which fringe the roads are exceptionally fine. The forest revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 200.\n\nKankar or nodular limestone and saltpetre are the only mineral products of any importance.\n\nThe New Egerton Woollen Mills at Dh\u0101riw\u0101l turn out woollen worsteds and hosiery of all kinds. In 1904 the number of hands employed was 908. The wool industry is carried on by hand to a considerable extent, shawls being made of pashm, the fine wool of the Tibetan goat, at Dera N\u0101nak and Kanj\u016br; but the industry is declining. Coarse blankets are also produced. A great deal of cotton is woven; and at Bat\u0101la a striped mixture of silk and English cotton thread known as s\u016bsi used to be made in large quantities, but the manufacture has been largely displaced by that of chintz. Soap and carpets are also made at Bat\u0101la. Turbans are woven of silk or cotton or a mixture. Many attempts have been made to domesticate the silkworm, but without success. Harness and other articles of leather are made at D\u012bn\u0101nagar. Iron sugar-mills are made and ivory bangles are turned at several places. Sugar-refining is an important industry, and a large refinery and distillery at Suj\u0101npur employed 117 hands in 1904. The carpentry of the District is above the average. There is a brewery at Dalhousie.\n\nGrain, sugar, oilseeds, and cotton are exported, besides woollen stuffs from the Egerton Mills, rum from Suj\u0101npur, and beer from Dalhousie. Gram is imported from Ludhi\u0101na and Ferozepore, gh\u016b from Kashm\u012br, cotton from R\u016bpar, and iron and piece-goods from Amritsar and Delhi. Most of the trade is by rail, but a certain amount is carried by road to Si\u0101lkot and Jammu. Bat\u0101la is the chief trade centre. The Punjab Banking Company has a branch at Dalhousie.\n\nA branch of the North-Western Railway from Amritsar passes through the District, with its terminus at Path\u0101nkot, whence a metalled cart-road runs to Dalhousie and another to P\u0101lampur in K\u0101ngra District, with a branch to Dharm\u1e63\u0101l\u0101. The most important unmetalled roads are the Hoshiarpur-Si\u0101lkot road, which passes through Gurd\u0101spur and Si\u0101lkot, and the road from Path\u0101nkot passing through Gurd\u0101spur to Amritsar. The total length of metalled roads is 59 miles and of unmetalled roads 608 miles. Of these, 31 miles of metalled and 25 miles of unmetalled roads are under the Public Works department, while the District board controls 28 miles of metalled and 583 miles of unmetalled roads. The R\u0101vi is crossed by fifteen ferries and the Be\u0101s\nby ten, only one of which is managed by the Gurd\u0101spur District authorities. Little traffic is carried on by either river.\n\nWith the exception of a small area in the north-west, the District is practically immune from famine; and in the tract liable to distress ready employment is afforded to the inhabitants by migration to the highly-irrigated tracts of the Path\u0101nkot tahsil and Jammu territory. The crops matured in the famine year 1899\u20131900 amounted to 77 per cent. of the normal.\n\nThe District is in charge of a Deputy-Commissioner, aided by six Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, of whom one is subdivisional officer in charge of Dalhousie during the summer months, and another is in charge of the District treasury. The District is divided into four tahsils\u2014Gurd\u0101spur, Bat\u0101la, Shakargarh, and Path\u0101nkot\u2014each under a tahsild\u0101r assisted by a naib-tahsild\u0101r.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner as District Magistrate is responsible for criminal justice. The civil judicial work is under a District Judge, and both are supervised by the Divisional Judge of the Amritsar Civil Division (who is also Sessions Judge). There are five Munsifs, one at head-quarters, two at Bat\u0101la, and one at each of the other tahsils. There are also Cantonment Magistrates at Dalhousie and Bakloh, and two honorary magistrates. The predominant form of crime is burglary.\n\nChanges in boundaries made during the early settlements render any comparison of past and present assessments impossible for the District as a whole. The various summary settlements were all high, except in Path\u0101nkot, and had to be reduced in the other tahsils. The regular settlement of the various areas now included fixed the assessment in 1852 at 14 lakhs. In 1862 a revision resulted in a demand of 13 lakhs, a reduction of 8 per cent. The assessment was full on \u2018dry\u2019 lands, while wells were treated very lightly. Land irrigated from wells or canals was assessed as if unirrigated, with the addition of a rupee per acre. The area which could be irrigated from a well in ordinary years was underestimated, and considerable loss to Government ensued. The assessment, which was very light, worked easily and well. In 1869 the records-of-rights of the villages of the Sh\u0101hpur hill tract in the Path\u0101nkot tahsil, including Dalhousie, were revised, but not the assessment. In the Gurd\u0101spur tahsil the assessment of 63 estates, which had been settled for ten years only, was completely revised in 1876. An assessment based on crop rates, and fluctuating from year to year with the area actually under crop, was introduced into 37 estates damaged by percolation from the B\u0101ri Do\u0101b Canal. The fluctuating system was extended in 1879 to 29 other villages.\n\nThe resettlement of the whole District was completed between 1885\nand 1892. Prices had increased enormously, by 83 per cent. in the case of wheat and barley, 57 in that of maize, and 158 in that of great millet. Cultivation had also increased by 7 per cent., the area supplied from wells by 26, and the number of wells by 14 per cent. The water rate charged on canal lands was replaced by general enhanced rates for land irrigated from wells and canals. The result was a demand of 15\u00bd lakhs, an increase of 20 per cent. on the revenue of the last years of the expiring assessment, and the settlement was sanctioned for twenty years. The average assessment on 'dry' land is Rs. 1-2-6 (maximum Rs. 1-13, minimum 8 annas), and on 'wet' land Rs. 2-7 (maximum Rs. 4, minimum Rs. 1-6). The demand, including cesses, for 1903-4 was 17.7 lakhs.\n\nThe collections of land revenue alone and of total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 11.08  | 13.85  | 13.85  | 14.57  |\n| Total revenue  | 13.67  | 18.30  | 19.86  | 21.17  |\n\nThe District contains nine municipalities, Gurd\u0101spur, Dalhousie, Bat\u0101la, D\u012bn\u0101nagar, Kal\u0101naur, Path\u0101nkot, Sujanpur, Dera N\u0101nak, and Sr\u012bgobindpur; and two 'notified areas,' Fatehgarh and Bahr\u0101mpur. Outside these, local affairs are managed by the District board, whose expenditure in 1903-4 amounted to 1.7 lakhs, public works being the largest item. The income, which is mainly derived from a local rate, was 1.8 lakhs.\n\nThe regular police force consists of 566 of all ranks, including 5 cantonment and 147 municipal police, in charge of a Superintendent, who usually has 4 inspectors under him. The village watchmen number 1,957. There are 18 police stations and 12 outposts. The District jail at head-quarters has accommodation for 287 prisoners.\n\nGurd\u0101spur stands twenty-fourth among the twenty-eight Districts of the Province in respect of the literacy of its population. In 1901 the proportion of literate persons was 2.8 per cent. (5.1 males and 0.2 females). The number of pupils under instruction was 5,697 in 1880-1, 10,631 in 1890-1, 8,790 in 1900-1, and 8,323 in 1903-4. In the last year there were 15 secondary and 142 primary (public) schools, and 5 advanced and 58 elementary (private) schools, with 258 girls in the public and 76 in the private schools. The District possesses 3 Anglo-veracular high schools, one of which contains only Christian boys. It also possesses 10 public schools for girls, the most important of which is the Dalhousie Convent School. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 92,000, to which Government\ncontributed Rs. 7,000, and Local funds Rs. 27,000, while fees brought in Rs. 28,000.\n\nBesides the Gurdaspur civil dispensary, the District has twelve outlying dispensaries. These in 1904 treated a total of 208,766 out-patients and 1,537 in-patients, and 7,268 operations were performed. The income and expenditure were Rs. 30,000, Local and municipal funds contributing Rs. 12,000 and Rs. 15,000 respectively.\n\nThe number of successful vaccinations in 1903-4 was 28,641, representing 30.6 per 1,000 of population. The Vaccination Act is in force at Dalhousie.\n\n[L. W. Dane, District Gazetteer (1891-2); Settlement Report (1892); and Customary Law of the Main Tribes in the Gurdaspur District (1893).]\n\nGurdaspur Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of Gurdaspur District, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 48' and 32\u00b0 13' N. and 75\u00b0 6' and 75\u00b0 36' E., with an area of 496 square miles. The Beas bounds it on the east, and the Ravi on the north-west. Along each of these rivers is a strip of alluvial country. The plateau between the two is well wooded and fertile, and is irrigated by the Bari Doab Canal. The population in 1901 was 258,379, compared with 252,092 in 1891. It contains the towns of Gurdaspur (population, 5,764), the head-quarters, Dinanagar (5,191), and Kalanaur (5,251); and 668 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 5,17,000. The woollen mills of Dhariwal in this tahsil are well-known throughout India.\n\nGurdaspur Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of the same name, Punjab, situated in 32\u00b0 3' N. and 75\u00b0 25' E., on the Amritsar-Pathankot branch of the North-Western Railway; distant by rail from Calcutta 1,252 miles, from Bombay 1,283, and from Karachi 839 miles. Population (1901), 5,764. The town stands high on the watershed between the Ravi and the Beas. The fort was built by the Sikh leader Banda during the revolt which followed the death of the emperor Bahadur Shah in 1712. When hard pressed by the Mughal forces Banda retired into the fort, but was starved out. His followers were massacred wholesale, while he himself was carried in a cage to Delhi and tortured to death. The fort now contains a monastery of Saraswat Brahmins. The town was selected as the head-quarters of the District in 1852 on account of its central position. The municipality was created in 1867. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 19,400. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 18,600, chiefly from octroi (Rs. 4,400) and grants from Government (Rs. 6,100); and the expenditure was Rs. 17,700. The town has little trade, being overshadowed by the commercial centre of Batala. It contains an Anglo-veracular high school and a dispensary.\n\nGurgaon District.\u2014District in the Delhi Division of the Punjab,\nlying between $27^\\circ 39'$ and $28^\\circ 33'$ N. and $76^\\circ 18'$ and $77^\\circ 34'$ E., in the extreme south-east of the Province, with an area of 1,984 square miles. It stretches towards the outlying hills of the R\u0101jput\u0101na table-land, and its southern part belongs geographically to that part of Northern R\u0101jput\u0101na known as Mew\u0101t or the country of the Meos. It is bounded on the north by the States of Duj\u0101na and Pataudi, and the Districts of Rohtak and Delhi; on the east the river Jumna separates it from Bulandshahr and Al\u012bgarh in the United Provinces; on the south it marches with the Muttra District of the United Provinces and the State of Bharatpur; on the west it is bounded by territories belonging to the States of Alwar, Jaipur, and N\u0101bha. The surface presents a considerable variety of contour.\n\nPhysical aspects. Two low rocky ranges, continuations of the Ar\u0101valli chain, enter its border from the south, and run northward in a bare and treeless mass towards the plain country. The northern plain falls into two natural divisions, divided by the western range. Eastwards, the valley between the two ridges lies wide and open throughout; and below the escarpment of the eastern ridge an alluvial level extends unbroken to the banks of the Jumna. Immediately at the foot of the uplands lie a series of undulating hollows, which during the rains become extensive swamps. West of the western range lies the Rew\u0101ri tahsil, consisting of a sandy plain, dotted with isolated hills. Though naturally dry and sterile, it has become, under the careful hands of its Ahir inhabitants, a well-cultivated tract. Numerous torrents carry off the drainage from the hills, while large pools or jhil collect the water brought down by these torrents.\n\nThe greater part of the District is covered by alluvium, but outcrops of rock occur in numerous small hills and ridges. These are outliers of the slates and quartzites (Alwar quartzite) of the Delhi system. The slate is usually a fissile clay slate, and is quarried near Rew\u0101ri. There are brine wells in the Sult\u0101npur mah\u0101l and sulphur springs at Sohna\u00b9.\n\nThe flora is mainly that of North-Eastern R\u0101jput\u0101na, and in the south-west includes several desert forms. Trees are few, except where planted; but on the hills that extend into the District from the Ar\u0101valli ranges gugal (Boswellia serrata), yielding frankincense, occurs, and also an acacia yielding catechu; while the south-east portion is characterized by the dhaok or dhao (Anogeissus pendula). The Jumna valley and the north-eastern corner belong botanically to the Upper Gangetic plain.\n\nThe days when tigers abounded in Gurgaon on the wooded banks of the Jumna are long since gone by, though now and then a straggler from the Alwar hills is seen. The striped hyena is found only in the\n\n\u00b9 Hacket, 'Geology of the Ar\u0101valli Region,' Records, Geological Survey of India, vol. xiv, part iv.\nneighbourhood of the hills. Leopards are not uncommon. Wolves, foxes, and jackals are common in all parts. The sacred monkey is found in great numbers about Hodal, and there are also a few in Rew\u0101r\u012b and Gurgaon. Wild hog frequent the low hills near Bhaundi and Sohna and the lowlands of the Jumna. Both antelope and 'ravine deer' (Indian gazelle) are fairly plentiful, the former in the hilly and sandy parts, the latter in the lowlands. The nilgai is also found in the southern parts of the Rew\u0101r\u012b tahsil. Hog deer are occasionally met with in the lowlands of the Jumna.\n\nBoth heat and cold are less extreme than in the Punjab proper, though near the hill ranges and in the Firozpur-Jhirka valley the radiation from the rocks makes the heat intense. Fever is the chief cause of mortality, but the District is the least unhealthy of the Division, Simla excepted. The flooded tracts near N\u016bh are particularly malarious, and fever has come with the Agra Canal into the high plain.\n\nThe average rainfall varies from 22 inches at Rew\u0101r\u012b to 26 at Gurgaon. Of the total at the latter place, $23\\frac{1}{2}$ inches fall in the summer months and $2\\frac{1}{2}$ in the winter. The uncertain nature of the monsoon is the most marked feature of the returns, the precipitation having varied from 48 inches at N\u016bh in 1885\u20136 to 0\u00b71 inch at Hattin in 1899\u20131900.\n\nGurgaon, with the rest of the territory known as Mew\u0101t, formed in early times part of an extensive kingdom ruled over by R\u0101jputs of the Jaduansi or J\u0101don tribe. The J\u0101don power was broken by Muhammad of Ghor in 1196; but for two centuries they sturdily resisted the Muhammedan domination, and the history of the District is a record of incursions of the people of Mew\u0101t into Delhi territory and of punitive expeditions undertaken against them. Under Firoz Sh\u0101h III the J\u0101dons were converted to Isl\u0101m; and Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n or Bah\u0101dur Nahar took a prominent part in the intestine struggles that followed the invasion of Tim\u016br, founding the family of the Kh\u0101nz\u0101das, members of which ruled Mew\u0101t in partial independence of the Delhi empire. B\u0101bar annexed Mew\u0101t, and from this time the power of the Kh\u0101nz\u0101das rapidly declined. During the decay of the Mughal empire the District was torn between contending powers. In the north were the Naw\u0101bs of Farrukhnagar, a principality founded in 1732; in the centre an independent power had risen at Ghasera; Rew\u0101r\u012b was held by an Ahir family, with forts at Gokulgarh and Guraora; while from the south the great J\u0101t ruler, S\u016braj Mal of Bharatpur, was extending his dominions. He captured Ghasera and Farrukhnagar; but after his death in 1763 Farrukhnagar returned to its former rulers, and a great part of the tract was recovered for the empire by Najaf Kuli Kh\u0101n. Under the Mar\u0101th\u0101s the greater part of the District was held by Generals de Boigne, Perron, and Bourquin. Begam\nSumr\u016b owned the *parsana* of Jh\u0101rsa; and George Thomas had that of Firozpur assigned to him in 1793, and once plundered Gurgaon, but lost this part of his possessions in the following year. In Rew\u0101ri, Tej Singh, ancestor of the present leading family of Ahirs, allied himself with the Mar\u0101th\u0101s and established himself in power.\n\nAfter Lord Lake's conquests the District passed to the British with the rest of the country ceded by Sindhia in 1803, but was left in the hands of native assignees, the District of Gurgaon being formed piecemeal as their estates for one cause or another escheated. The first of these acquisitions was in 1808, when Rew\u0101ri, N\u016bh, Bahora, and Sohna came under British rule, and a District was formed with its headquarters at Bhar\u0101w\u0101s near Rew\u0101ri. After the lapse of Hodal and Palwal the head-quarters were transferred to Gurgaon. More escheats followed; and in 1836 the Naw\u0101b of Firozpur-Jhirka lost his estates for complicity in the murder of Mr. William Fraser, Commissioner of Delhi, while Jh\u0101rsa lapsed on the death of Begam Sumr\u016b. In 1857 the Naw\u0101b of Farrukhnagar, followed by the Meos, rose in rebellion, while in Rew\u0101ri the Ahir chief preserved an armed neutrality. Order was, however, quickly restored after the fall of Delhi, and the estates of Farrukhnagar were confiscated.\n\nThe chief objects of antiquarian interest are at Palwal, Hodal, Farrukhnagar, Firozpur-Jhirka, and Rew\u0101ri.\n\nThe District contains 8 towns and 1,171 villages. The population at each of the last four enumerations was: (1868) 689,034, (1881) 641,848, (1891) 668,929, and (1901) 746,208. It increased by 11\u00b75 per cent. during the last decade. There are five *tahsils*\u2014Gurgaon, Firozpur, N\u016bh, Palwal, and Rew\u0101ri\u2014each named from its head-quarters. The chief towns are the municipalities of Rew\u0101ri, Farrukhnagar, Palwal, Firozpur-Jhirka, Sohna, and Hodal. Gurgaon, the head-quarters of the District, is a small place. The following table shows the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Gurgaon | 413                 | 3              | 207      | 125,760    | 304\u00b75                     | + 11\u00b79                                          | 3,986                            |\n| Palwal | 382                 | 2              | 187      | 172,557    | 451\u00b77                     | + 15\u00b72                                          | 4,301                            |\n| Firozpur| 317                | 1              | 230      | 132,287    | 417\u00b73                     | + 16\u00b72                                          | 2,362                            |\n| N\u016bh    | 403                 | 1              | 257      | 145,931    | 362\u00b71                     | + 10\u00b79                                          | 2,397                            |\n| Rew\u0101ri | 426                 | 1              | 290      | 169,673    | 398\u00b73                     | + 5\u00b72                                           | 6,397                            |\n| District total | 1,984 | 8              | 1,171    | 746,208    | 376\u00b71                     | + 11\u00b75                                          | 19,443                           |\n\n**Note.**\u2014The figures for the areas of *tahsils* are taken from revenue returns. The total District area is that given in the *Census Report*.\nHindus number 499,373, or 67 per cent., and Muhammadans 242,548. About 85 per cent. of the people returned their language as Hindust\u0101ni or Urd\u016b; 14 per cent. speak Mew\u0101t\u012b, and 2,600 persons Braj.\n\nThe Meos (129,000), who number one-sixth of the population, are probably almost pure aborigines, of the same stock as the Min\u0101s of the Ar\u0101valli Hills, though perhaps with an admixture of R\u0101jput blood. They hold large tracts of land in the southern portion of the District, and are now without exception Muhammadans, though retaining many Hindu customs. The tribe has laid aside its former lawless turbulence; and the Meos, though still thriftless, extravagant, and lazy, now rank among the most peaceable communities in the Punjab. The J\u0101ts (77,000) live chiefly in Palwal and the northern parganas; they are almost entirely Hindus. Some of their villages worthily sustain the general high reputation of the tribe, but others are reported to be ill-cultivated. The Ah\u012brs (78,000) form the majority of the population in Rew\u0101r\u012b, and are justly esteemed for the skill and perseverance with which they have developed the naturally poor resources of that sterile region. They are all Hindus. The G\u016bjars (25,000) also are practically all Hindus. The R\u0101jputs comprise 18,000 Hindus and 9,000 Muhammadans. The Gaurwas (4,000) are R\u0101jputs who have adopted widow remarriage. The Kh\u0101nz\u0101das (4,000) claim descent from J\u00e1don R\u0101jputs, converted by Firoz Sh\u0101h, who made them rulers of Mew\u0101t. It is possible that they are akin to the Meos, some of whom profess to have been formerly Kh\u0101nz\u0101das; if so, they may be the representatives of the upper, as the Meos are of the lower, classes of the aboriginal population. The M\u0101lis (market-gardeners) number 11,000. The Saiyids (3,000) and Balochs (2,000) bear a bad name as indolent and thriftless cultivators, and swell the returns of crime far beyond their just proportion. The criminal class of Min\u0101s (800) are notorious for their thieving propensities. The chief of the commercial tribes are the Bani\u0101s (37,000). Of the menial tribes, the most important are the Ch\u00fchr\u0101s (scavengers, 21,000), Jhinwars (water-carriers, 12,000), Kumbh\u0101rs (potters, 16,000), Loh\u0101rs (blacksmiths, 7,000), Nais (barbers, 14,000), Kass\u0101bs (butchers, 17,000), Tarkh\u0101ns (carpenters, 13,000), and Telis (oilmen, 7,000). There are 26,000 Fak\u012brs. About 60 per cent. of the population are dependent on agriculture.\n\nThe Society for the Propagation of the Gospel has branch missions at Gurgaon and Rew\u0101r\u012b, with dispensaries at the latter place and at Palwal. In 1901 the District contained 221 native Christians.\n\nThe Jumna in Gurgaon, as elsewhere, is fringed by a strip of alluvial land, the kh\u0101dur, which leads to the broad level plain, known as the b\u0101ngar. Here the soil is almost uniformly a good loam. Towards the hills the plain sinks into a shallow depression of clayey soil, the dabur, which receives the drainage of the\nhigher ground. West of the hills the ground is broken by rocky knolls and sandhills, while even in the level parts the soil is much lighter than that of the b\u0101ngar.\n\nThe District is held almost entirely on the pattid\u0101r\u012b and bhaiy\u0101ch\u0101r\u012b tenures, though zamind\u0101r\u012b lands cover 9,000 acres.\n\nThe area for which details are available from the revenue records of 1903\u20134 is 1,941 square miles, as shown below:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Gurgaon    | 413   | 299        | 43        | 37               |\n| Palwal     | 382   | 314        | 150       | 42               |\n| Firozpur   | 317   | 259        | 49        | 7                |\n| Nuh        | 403   | 329        | 72        | 23               |\n| Rew\u0101ri     | 426   | 365        | 106       | 23               |\n| **Total**  | **1,941** | **1,566** | **400**   | **130**          |\n\nThe chief crops of the spring harvest are gram and barley, which occupied 71 and 167 square miles respectively in 1903\u20134. Wheat occupied 68 square miles. In the autumn, spiked millet is by far the most important crop, occupying 347 square miles. Next come pulses (275 square miles), great millet (111 square miles), and cotton (86 square miles). There is little sugar-cane (only 12 square miles), and practically no rice.\n\nThe cultivated area has increased but slightly since the settlement of 1872\u201383, being 1,566 square miles in 1903\u20134 as compared with 1,555 square miles at settlement; and as four-fifths of the total area is now under cultivation, no great extension is to be expected, or could be possible without unduly reducing the area utilized for grazing. Little attention is paid to any regular course of cropping. Unmanured land is generally cultivated only for one harvest, and the rest it gets during the other harvest is thought sufficient. Great millet is not sown in the same land two years in succession. Cotton is not sown after spiked millet. In all other cases, in deciding what crop to sow, regard is paid to the kind of soil and amount of rainfall, without any consideration as to what the previous crop was. Advances for constructing wells under the Land Improvement Loans Act are fairly popular, Rs. 67,000 having been advanced during the five years ending 1904. During the same period 2\u00b78 lakhs was advanced under the Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Act, for the purchase of bullocks and seed.\n\nAs might be expected from the small proportion of land uncultivated, grazing is scarce, and Gurgaon is not a great cattle-breeding District. A cattle fair is held at Rew\u0101ri. The horses and sheep are of no special importance. The District board maintains two horse and two donkey stallions. Large numbers of goats are grazed on the hills: they are\nfrequently owned by butchers, who make them over to shepherds on condition of receiving a certain share, generally a half, of the increase.\n\nOf the total area cultivated in 1903-4, 400 square miles, or 25 per cent., were classed as irrigated. Of this area, 222 square miles were irrigated from wells, 152 from canals, and 25 from streams, tanks, and embankments. The District has 9,208 wells in use, all worked by bullocks on the rope-and-bucket system, besides 3,511 unbricked wells, lever wells, and water-lifts. Canal-irrigation is entirely from the Agra Canal, which traverses the eastern portion of the District. The third main source of irrigation is the collection of the water of the hill torrents by means of embankments. These are maintained by the District board, and the total area irrigated from them doubled in the twenty years ending 1901. On the other hand, owing to the diminution of water in the S\u0101hibi, Indori, and Landoh\u0101 streams, the low-lying flooded area has considerably decreased.\n\nThe only forests are about one square mile of unclassed forest and Government waste under the control of the Deputy-Commissioner. As a whole, the District is not well wooded, and some parts, such as the low-lying tracts in the N\u016bh tahsil, are extremely bare. In Rew\u0101ri the tamarisk is especially common, and the ownership of these trees in waste lands and along village roads is often distinct from that of the soil. Palwal is by far the best wooded tahsil, and most of the J\u0101t villages in it reserve a certain portion of their area from the plough.\n\nThe Sult\u0101npur salt sources lie in six villages, five in this District and one in Rohtak. The salt is made entirely from natural brine, 43 wells of which were worked in this District in 1903-4. The brine is about 26 feet below the surface and 15 feet deep, and the supply seems inexhaustible, as some of the works have existed for over 200 years. The salt, known as Sult\u0101npuri, is, however, of poor quality, and the demand for it is dying out. Saltpetre is extracted from the earth of old sites and refined at Hodal. Iron ore exists in the hills, but its manufacture has long been abandoned owing to the scarcity of fuel. Traces of copper exist and mica is occasionally extracted. Plumbago has been found, but is too impure to be of any commercial value. A little gold is sometimes washed out of the sand of the hill torrents. Excellent slates are quarried in the neighbourhood of Rew\u0101ri.\n\nCoarse cotton and woollen fabrics are made in the villages. Muslin is woven at Rew\u0101ri, but there is little trade in it. The chief industry is the brass manufacture of Rew\u0101ri; the greater part of the out-turn consists of cooking utensils, but articles decorated with chasing, engraving, and parcel tinning are also produced for export. Glass bangles are made at Sohna, shoes at Jharsa, Sohna, and other places, and iron vessels at Firozpur-Jhirka, and at D\u0101r\u0101pur and T\u0101nk\u012b in the Rew\u0101ri tahsil. There are two\nfactories for ginning cotton, one at Palwal and one at Hodal, employing 268 hands in 1904. There is an out-still for the distillation of spirit at Firozpur-Jhirka.\n\nTrade centres in the town of Rew\u0101r\u012b, which ranks as one of the chief emporiums in the Punjab. Its merchants transact a large part of the commerce between the States of R\u0101jput\u0101na and Northern India. Salt from the S\u0101mbh\u0101r Lake and iron are the principal imports; while sugar, grain, and English piece-goods are the staple exports. Hardware of brass, coated with white metal, is also largely exported. The District produces cereals and pulses considerably beyond its needs for home consumption; and of late years, owing to the extension of railway communication, a steady export trade in grain has sprung up. N\u016bh, Firozpur-Jhirka, Palwal, Hattin, Nagina, Punah\u0101na, Hodal, Hasanpur, and Farrukhnagar are the chief marts (after Rew\u0101r\u012b) for country produce, the last named being also the market for the Sult\u0101npur\u012b salt.\n\nThe R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway from Delhi to Ajmer crosses the District with a branch line to Farrukhnagar, and the Bhatinda line leaves it at Rew\u0101r\u012b, which is an important junction. The Agra-Delhi chord of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, opened in 1904, runs through the east, and the Rew\u0101r\u012b-Phulera line through the Rew\u0101r\u012b tahsil.\n\nThe grand trunk road from Delhi to Agra traverses the Palwal tahsil, and there is a metalled road from Gurgaon to Sohna (15 miles), which is to be carried 6 miles farther on to N\u016bh. A metalled road also runs from Firozpur-Jhirka through Nagauna into the State of Alwar. The roads of greatest mercantile importance are, however, still unmetalled, very heavy, and difficult to traverse in the rains. The total length of metalled roads is 81 miles, and of unmetalled roads 509 miles. Of these, 30 miles of metalled roads are under the Public Works department, and the rest are maintained from Local funds. The Jumna is navigable by country craft throughout its course, and is crossed by eight ferries.\n\nAs might be expected in a District so largely dependent, until lately, on the rainfall, Gurgaon suffered severely in all the famines that have visited the Punjab. The ch\u0101lisa famine of 1783\u20134 was very disastrous; and in the famines of 1833\u20134 and 1837\u20138 a number of estates were deserted, partly on account of high assessments and partly from too stringent collection of revenue. The effects of the famines of 1860\u20131 and 1868\u20139 were greatly mitigated by the relief afforded by Government. In the latter year, the first for which we have full reports, 344,527 daily units were relieved, and 15,324 persons were employed on works, with a total expenditure of Rs. 11,139. The famine of 1877\u20138, in conjunction with a new and excessive assessment of land revenue and an unsympathetic revenue\nadministration, badly crippled the District for some time; the maximum number on relief on any one day was 2,155, while 313 deaths from starvation were reported, and 150,000 head of cattle died. There was scarcity in 1884. In 1896-7 the famine was by no means severe, as irrigation from the Agra Canal had been developed and a much larger measure of protection ensured. Distress lasted from January to May, 1897, and affected none but the menial classes. The daily average of persons relieved in no week exceeded 3,100, and the total cost was only Rs. 14,070. In the famine of 1899-1900 an area of 1,033 square miles, or 53 per cent. of the District, was affected; the greatest daily number in receipt of relief was 18,153 persons, or 5 per cent. of the population affected, and the total expenditure was 3.8 lakhs.\n\nThe District is divided for administrative purposes into five tahsils, each under a tahsildar and a nail-tahsildar. It is in charge of a Deputy-Commissioner, who has under him two Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, one being in charge of the District treasury.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner as District Magistrate is responsible for criminal justice, and the District Judge for civil judicial work. Both are under the supervision of the Divisional and Sessions Judge of Delhi. There is only one Munsif, who sits at head-quarters. The predominant forms of crime are cattle-theft and burglary.\n\nA notable feature in the system of land tenures is the re-distribution of the land among the communal proprietors. This custom has survived in a few villages, but is dying out. The fiscal history is a melancholy one. As each pargana came under British rule, it was either summarily settled, or else the Collector managed the whole as a single estate, and made from it what collections he could, no regular engagement being entered into with the proprietors. Regular settlements began in 1836-7, and by 1842 every pargana had been dealt with. The working of this settlement, though very uneven, was satisfactory on the whole. The rapid rise in prices which continued to the end of the decade helped to mitigate the severities of the assessment. Thus, by the time prices fell in the next decade, increased cultivation and irrigation had put the people in a better position to fulfil their engagements.\n\nThe revised settlement was carried out between 1872 and 1883. The increase in cultivation was estimated at 40 per cent., while the increase taken in revenue was only 17 per cent. The new settlement, however, was most unfortunate in the opening seasons of its term. The autumn harvest of 1877 was a complete failure, and the local officials recommended the suspension of the entire instalment; but sanction was refused on the ground that proprietors whose revenue had just been raised must be in a position of affluence and therefore able to pay in a bad year as well as in a good. The result was widespread distress,\nand collection of the revenue in full proved impossible. Moreover, it was not until 1882 that counsels of leniency prevailed, and by that time pestilence and famine had stamped upon the people an impress of poverty which years of prosperity could hardly remove. The assessment was lowered by nearly 8 per cent. for a term of seven years, and permanently by 4 per cent. At the expiry of the term in 1889 the larger reduction was made permanent; and though the years 1890-5 were years of plenty, they were overshadowed by the famine lustrum that followed. The District came under resettlement in 1903. The average assessment on 'dry' land is Rs. 1-0-6 (maximum Rs. 1-12, minimum 9 annas), and on 'wet' land Rs. 2-8 (maximum Rs. 3-8, minimum Rs. 1-8). The demand, including cesses, in 1903-4 was nearly 14 lakhs. The average size of a proprietary holding is 3\u00b77 acres.\n\nThe collections of land revenue alone and of total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 12,47  | 11,96  | 10,12  | 11,31  |\n| Total revenue  | 13,68  | 13,72  | 12,97  | 14,32  |\n\nThe District contains six municipalities\u2014Rew\u0101ri, Farrukhnagar, Palwal, Firozpur-Jhirka, Sohna, and Hodal\u2014besides four 'notified areas.' Outside these, local affairs are managed by a District board, whose income amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 1,24,000. Its expenditure in the same year was Rs. 1,46,000, the principal item being public works.\n\nThe regular police force consists of 520 of all ranks, including 117 municipal police, under a Superintendent, who is usually assisted by two inspectors. The village watchmen number 1,428. The District contains 15 police stations, one outpost, and 13 road-posts. There is no jail in Gurgaon, and the convicts are sent to the Delhi District jail. The M\u012bn\u0101s and Bauri\u0101s are proclaimed under the Criminal Tribes Act, and 908 were on the register in 1901.\n\nGurgaon stands twenty-seventh among the twenty-eight Districts of the Province in respect of the literacy of its population. In 1901 the proportion of literate persons was 2\u00b76 per cent. (4\u00b79 males and 0\u00b71 females). The number of pupils under instruction was 3,199 in 1880-1, 4,696 in 1890-1, 5,139 in 1900-1, and 5,563 in 1903-4. In the last year the District possessed 7 secondary and 108 primary (public) schools, and 17 elementary (private) schools, the number of girls being 347 in the public and 105 in the private schools. Of the public schools, 11 were supported by municipalities and 18 received a grant-in-aid, the remainder being maintained by the District board. The only high school is an Anglo-vernacular municipal school at Rew\u0101ri, managed by the\nEducational department. The special schools include two for low-caste boys, and one industrial school for boys and another for girls. To encourage education among the criminal tribe of Min\u0101s, stipends of from Rs. 1 to Rs. 3 per month are offered to boys of this class to support them at school. The total expenditure on education in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 51,000, of which Government contributed Rs. 2,000, municipalities Rs. 15,000, District funds Rs. 25,000, and fees Rs. 8,000.\n\nBesides the Gurgaon dispensary, the District has eight out-lying dispensaries. At these institutions 77,889 out-patients and 1,716 in-patients were treated in 1904, and 3,707 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 24,000, of which Rs. 13,000 was derived from Local funds and the greater part of the remainder from municipal funds. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel has a dispensary in charge of a lady doctor at Rew\u0101ri, and another at Palwal.\n\nThe number of successful vaccinations in 1903\u20134 was 23,697, or 31.76 per 1,000 of the population. Vaccination is compulsory only in Rew\u0101ri.\n\n[J. Wilson, Codes of Tribal Custom of Twenty-one Tribes in the Gurgaon District (1882); D. C. J. Ibbetson, District Gazetteer (1884); F. C. Channing and J. Wilson, Settlement Report (1882).]\n\nGurgaon Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of Gurgaon District, Punjab, lying between 28\u00b0 12' and 28\u00b0 33' N. and 76\u00b0 42' and 77\u00b0 15' E., with an area of 413 square miles. The population in 1901 was 125,760, compared with 112,390 in 1891. It contains the three towns of Gurgaon (population, 4,765), the head-quarters, Sohna (6,024), and Farrukhnagar (6,136); and 207 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 2.5 lakhs. At annexation the area covered by the present tahsil was occupied by the parganas of Farrukhnagar held by the Naw\u0101b of Farrukhnagar, Jh\u0101rsa held by Begam Sumr\u016b, and the greater part of Bahora and Sohna held by General Perron. The two last parganas were resumed at annexation, and were brought under British administration in 1808\u20139. Jh\u0101rsa lapsed on Begam Sumr\u016b's death in 1835, and Farrukhnagar was confiscated owing to the Naw\u0101b's complicity in the Mutiny of 1857. Dams are built across the torrent-beds which descend from the low rocky hills in the centre and east, and the water is stored up for irrigation. In the north, the soil is a rich mould; in the south, sand predominates; while in the north-west, in the neighbourhood of Farrukhnagar, the sand ridges are separated by depressions of hard soil where the water collects in seasons of heavy rainfall.\n\nGurgaon Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of the same name, Punjab, situated in 28\u00b0 29' N. and 77\u00b0 2' E., 3 miles from Gurgaon station on the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. Population (1901), 4,765. It is of no commercial or historical importance. Gurgaon is also known as Hid\u0101yatpur, the village where at annexation a cavalry\ncantonment was located in order to watch Begam Sumr\u016b's troops at Jh\u0101rsa. The civil head-quarters of the District were transferred here in 1816. Its name is taken from the neighbouring village of Gurgaon-Mas\u0101ni, where there is a temple of S\u012btla, goddess of small-pox, which is visited annually by 50,000 or 60,000 people. The town is administered as a 'notified area,' and contains a vernacular middle school and a dispensary.\n\nGurmatk\u0101l.\u2014Former t\u0101luk in the south-east of Gulbarga District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. In 1901 it had an area of 320 square miles and a population of 52,480, compared with 48,348 in 1891. The 91 villages it contained were divided in 1905 between the Seram, Y\u0101dgir, and Kodangal t\u0101lukas. The land revenue in 1901 was a lakh.\n\nGurramkonda (gurram, 'a horse,' and kond\u0101, 'a hill').\u2014Ancient fortress in the Vayalp\u0101\u1e0d t\u0101luk of Cuddapah District, Madras, situated in 13\u00b0 47' N. and 78\u00b0 36' E. Population (1901), 1,718. The fort was always one of the most important strongholds in Cuddapah, and is supposed to have been first built by the Golconda Sult\u0101ns. The work in it is entirely Muhammadan. It stands on an extraordinary hill, 500 feet high, three sides of which consist of almost perpendicular precipices. The fourth side, though steep, is accessible; but the fortifications guard every assailable part of it by ramparts and redoubts, line behind line. A long wall, curving and winding through the rocks, connects the upper with the lower fort, and the whole presents the appearance of a fastness built with a skill and knowledge of fortification unusual in Southern India. On the plain below is the old palace of its chiefs, now used as a halting-place for officials. Round about the fort are many of the wild barren hills characteristic of this part of the country, and here they are even more picturesque than usual.\n\n'They are beautiful,' one writer has said, 'under almost every aspect; whether on a bright sunshiny day with the sun's beams glancing from the bare rocks, and throwing the stony hills into a bold contrast with the green and narrow valleys lying between them, or as seen on a moonlight night from the windows of the old Gurramkonda palace, when the valleys lie dark and sleeping below, with the gloomy lofty rocks erect above them, as if on guard, each outline and almost each stone appearing plainly defined against the silvery sky behind; or else when towards evening a squall comes rolling up from the north-east, enveloping first one hill and then another in clouds of mist and rain, while the valleys are still smiling in the sunshine. Under every aspect the scene is a beautiful one, and the old palace of Gurramkonda forms a favourite halting-place.'\n\nGurramkonda was the capital of the Carnatic B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Afterwards, when held by a local chief under the Naw\u0101b of Cuddapah, it was of such importance that the tenure was purely military, and the governor had the privilege of coin-\ning money. When M\u012br S\u0101hib betrayed S\u012bra (1766), he received Gurramkonda (which had at some former time been held by his ancestors) as a j\u0101gir from the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. Two years later he made it over to Haidar Ali, his brother-in-law. In 1771 Saiyid Sh\u0101h, Haidar\u2019s general, surrendered it to Trimbak Rao. Tip\u016b recaptured it in 1773. In 1791 the Niz\u0101m\u2019s forces, aided by a British battery under Captain Read, besieged Gurramkonda and captured the lower fort; but the citadel held out till the peace, when the place was ceded to the Niz\u0101m. In 1800 it was transferred to the British, with the rest of the District of Cuddapah.\n\nHow the place got its name of \u2018horse-hill\u2019 is not clear. The rock itself bears no resemblance whatever to a horse. The local legend says the appellation was derived from the fact that a horse which was supposed to be the guardian of the fort was kept on the top of the hill. As long as the horse remained there, the fort would be impregnable. For generations, this horse (or at all events one of its descendants) was kept in a stable on the summit of the hill. At length a Mar\u0101th\u0101 thief climbed up the perpendicular rock by driving long iron nails into it. He reached the top, gained the stable, and, wonderful to narrate, conveyed the horse down by the same way by which he had come. He reached the foot of the hill in safety, but, while stopping in a grove to rest, was captured with the horse. The governor of the fort, astonished at the boldness and skill of the thief, contented himself with inflicting the comparatively lenient punishment of cutting off both his hands. But the spell was broken, the divine horse had been carried away, and when next the fort was attacked it fell. Near the fort is the tomb of M\u012br R\u0101j\u0101 Ali Kh\u0101n, uncle of Tipu Sultan, and several other Musalm\u0101n buildings. A Persian inscription on the tomb contains an epitaph with the date of Al\u012b Kh\u0101n\u2019s death (A.D. 1780).\n\nGursarai.\u2014Estate in Jh\u0101nsi District, United Provinces, with an area of 155 square miles. The estate is held on the ub\u0101ri tenure (see JH\u0100NSI DISTRICT), the land revenue payable to Government being at present Rs. 20,000 and the cesses Rs. 5,500. The proprietors receive about Rs. 54,000 from the under-proprietors. The owner is a Mar\u0101th\u0101 Br\u0101hman, whose family settled here about 1727. A member of the family was governor of J\u0101laun and other territories belonging to the Peshw\u0101 in Bundelkhand. In 1840 Kesho Rao, who at that time managed Gursarai under the R\u0101j\u0101 of J\u0101laun, was a claimant for the succession to the J\u0101laun estate, which was, however, held to have lapsed. Kesho Rao was allowed to continue in the management of Gursarai, and in 1852 the estate was granted to him, subject to the payment of Rs. 22,500 as a quit-rent. On the outbreak of the Mutiny in J\u0101laun the British officer in charge of that District was forced to retire to Agra, and Kesho Rao assumed charge on behalf of Government, and maintained order till the end of October, 1857. He was then seized by the\nGwalior mutineers and maltreated, after which he retired to Gursarai. When Sir Hugh Rose reached Jhansi, Kesho Rao at once communicated with him, and together with his sons gave valuable help in the subsequent operations. The title of R\u0101j\u0101 Bah\u0101dur and other rewards were granted for these services. R\u0101j\u0101 Kesho Rao was an honorary magistrate with civil and revenue powers, and had a limited jurisdiction in his own estates. He died in 1880, and in 1886 the special powers vested in the R\u0101j\u0101 were cancelled. The ub\u0101ri grant, which carried with it a reduced demand for land revenue, was conditional on the estate remaining undivided. In 1895 serious disputes led to the cancellation of the grant and the assessment of a full revenue demand. The title of R\u0101j\u0101 was at the same time withdrawn from the head of the family. Default in the payment of revenue led to the assumption of direct management by Government, a money allowance being paid to the proprietors. The disputes as to the shares due to each member of the family were finally settled by a decree of the Privy Council passed in 1898, and in 1902 the ub\u0101ri grant was restored. The privileged rate of revenue is Rs. 25,000, which has been temporarily reduced to Rs. 20,000 for five years. The payments made to the ub\u0101rid\u0101rs by the village proprietors will be revised in the settlement operations now being carried out in JH\u0100NSI DISTRICT. Gursarai town had a population of 4,304 in 1901, and contained a police station, a post office, and a school with about 84 pupils.\n\n**Guruv\u0101y\u016br.**\u2014Village in the Ponn\u0101ni t\u0101luk of Malabar District, Madras, situated in 10\u00b0 35' N. and 76\u00b0 3' E., near Chowgh\u0101t. Population (1901), 3,393. It is notable for a large Hindu temple dedicated to Krishna, an inscription on the western gopuram (tower) of which shows that it was built in A.D. 1747. The wall of the shrine is elaborately painted with scenes from the Bh\u0101gavatam. The temple is largely resorted to by the sick.\n\n**Guti.**\u2014Subdivision, t\u0101luk, and town in Anantapur District, Madras. See GOOTY.\n\n**Gwa.**\u2014Southernmost township of Sandoway District, Lower Burma, lying between 17\u00b0 15' and 18\u00b0 10' N. and 94\u00b0 25' and 94\u00b0 49' E., with an area of 1,264 square miles. It lies between the Arakan Yoma and the Bay of Bengal, presenting to the latter a long stretch of rock-bound coast. The population was 15,331 in 1891, and 18,437 in 1901, the density being only 15 persons per square mile. The head-quarters are at the village of Gwa (population, 1,436), at the mouth of the Gwa river in the extreme south of the District. There are 177 villages. The majority of the population are Buddhists, but the Chin communities, inhabiting the Arakan Yoma to the east of the township, are mostly spirit-worshippers. The area cultivated in 1903\u20134 was 22 square miles, paying Rs. 22,800 land revenue.\nGw\u0101dar.\u2014An open roadstead and port in Makr\u0101n, Baluchist\u0101n, situated in 25\u00b0 8' N. and 62\u00b0 19' E., about 290 miles from Kar\u0101chi, with a population of 4,350 persons (1903). The majority are fishermen, Meds. The Portuguese attacked and burnt the town in 1581; and at the end of the next century it was taken by the Kh\u0101ns of Kal\u0101t and was handed over by Nasir Kh\u0101n I to Sult\u0101n Said, a brother of the ruler of Maskat, for his maintenance. It has since remained, with about 300 square miles of the adjoining country, in the hands of Maskat, the ruler of which place is represented by an Arab governor, or w\u0101li, with an escort of twenty sepoys. The value of the trade, which is carried on by Hindus and by Khojas, locally known as Loti\u0101s, was estimated in 1903 at 5\u00bd lakhs of exports and 2 lakhs of imports. The contract for customs, which are generally levied at 5 per cent. ad valorem, was leased for Rs. 40,000 in the same year. Gw\u0101dar is a fortnightly port of call of the British India Steam Navigation Company's steamers. On the hill overlooking the town is a stone dam of fine workmanship.\n\nGwalior Residency.\u2014A Political Charge in the Central India Agency, which comprises all the northern part of the western section of Central India, extending from the Chambal in the north to Bhilsa in the south, and from Bundelkhand and the Jh\u0101nsi District of the United Provinces on the east to the R\u0101jput\u0101na Agency on the west: or, generally speaking, the tract lying between 23\u00b0 21' and 26\u00b0 52' N. and 76\u00b0 29' and 79\u00b0 8' E., with an area of 17,825 square miles. Of this area, 17,020 square miles belong to the Gwalior State, the rest being occupied by the Chhabra pargana of Tonk State (R\u0101jput\u0101na), and the minor States of R\u0101ghugarh, Khan\u012badh\u0101na, P\u0101ron, Garha, Umri, Bhadaura, and several small holdings (see table on page 417).\n\nThe population of the charge (1901) is 2,187,612, of whom Hindus number 1,883,038, or 86 per cent.; Animists, 170,316, or 8 per cent.; Musalm\u0101ns, 103,430, or 4 per cent.; and Jains, 30,129, or 1 per cent. The density of population is 123 persons per square mile. The charge contains 6,820 villages and 16 towns, of which the chief are Lashkar (102,626, with Brigade), Mor\u0101r (19,179), Gwalior (16,807), Guna (11,452, with military station), Bhind (8,032), Bhilsa (7,481), Narwar (4,929), and Chander\u012b (4,093). Bhilsa, Morena, and Guna are the chief centres for the sale of grain, and Chander\u012b for the manufacture of fine cloths.\n\nAfter the Treaty of S\u0101lbai (1782), Mr. Anderson was appointed Resident at the court of Mah\u0101dji Sindhia, which was merely a moving camp until 1810, when Daulat Rao Sindhia permanently fixed his headquarters on the spot where Lashkar city now stands. Till 1854, when an Agent to the Governor-General for Central India was appointed, the Resident at Gwalior corresponded directly with the Governor-General. In 1860 the minor States were made into a separate charge, under the\nofficer commanding the Central India Horse at Guna. This arrangement was abolished in 1896, when these States were again placed under the Resident, the officer commanding at Guna continuing to act as *ex-officio* Assistant to the Resident, with, however, very limited powers. In 1888 the Khan\u012b\u0101dh\u0101na State was transferred from the Bundelkhand Agency to the Resident at Gwalior; and in 1895 the Gwalior State districts of Bhilsa and Is\u0101garh were transferred from the Bhop\u0101l Agency to this charge. The Resident, as the officer accredited to the Gwalior Darb\u0101r, is also in all matters of general policy the channel of communication between the Darb\u0101r and other Political officers, such as the Agents in M\u0101lw\u0101 and Bhop\u0101war, within whose charges isolated portions of the Gwalior State are situated. He exercises a close supervision over the minor holdings of the charge, all criminal cases of any importance in which are either dealt with by him personally or submitted for his sanction and approval. He also has the powers of a District and Sessions Judge for portions of the Midland and B\u012bna-B\u0101ran sections of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway which pass through the States of Gwalior, Dat\u012b\u0101, Samthar, Khan\u012b\u0101dh\u0101na, and the Chhabra *pargana*. The head-quarters of the Political officer are situated in the area known as \u2018The Residency,\u2019 a piece of land measuring 1\u00b717 square miles situated close to Mor\u0101r, about four miles to the east of Gwalior fort. This area is administered by the Resident, and includes three villages, the revenues from which are devoted to the upkeep of the Residency limits. In 1901 the population of the Residency was 1,391. The Great Indian Peninsula and Gwalior Light Railways and the Agra-Bombay and Bh\u012bnd-Jh\u0101nsi high roads traverse the charge.\n\nThe table on the next page shows the States, portions of States, and minor holdings under the Residency.\n\n**Gwalior State.**\u2014The largest treaty State in the Central India Agency, under the political supervision of a Resident at Gwalior. The State has a total area of 25,041 square miles, and is composed of several detached portions, but may be roughly divided into two, the Gwalior or northern, and the M\u0101lw\u0101 section. The northern section consists of a compact block of territory, lying between 22\u00b0 10\u2032 and 26\u00b0 52\u2032 N. and 74\u00b0 38\u2032 and 79\u00b0 8\u2032 E., with an area of 17,020 square miles. It is bounded on the north, north-east, and north-west by the Chambal river, which separates it from the Agra and Et\u0101wah Districts of the United Provinces, and from the Native States of Dholpur, Karauli, and Jaipur in the R\u0101jput\u0101na Agency; on the east by the British Districts of J\u0101laun and Jh\u0101nsi in the United Provinces, and by Saugor in the Central Provinces; on the south by the States of Bhop\u0101l, Khilchipur, and R\u0101jgarh, and by the Sironj *pargana* of Tonk; and on the west by the States of Jh\u0101law\u0101r, Tonk, and Kotah in the R\u0101jput\u0101na\nAgency. The M\u0101lw\u0101 section, with an area of 8,021 square miles, is made up of several detached districts, between which portions of other States are interposed, and which are themselves intermingled in bewildering intricacy.\n\n| Name                  | Title       | Caste, clan, &c. | Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Total revenue, 1902-3 |\n|-----------------------|-------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| Gwalior (portion)     | H.H.Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101| Mar\u0101th\u0101           | 17,020               | 2,068,032       | Rs. 55,56,000        |\n| R\u0101ghugarh             | R\u0101j\u0101        | Kh\u012bch\u012b R\u0101jput     | 112                  | 19,446          | 52,000               |\n| Khani\u0101dh\u0101na           | J\u0101gird\u0101r    | Bund\u0113la R\u0101jput   | 68                   | 15,538          | 22,000               |\n| P\u0101ron                 | R\u0101j\u0101        | Kachw\u0101ha R\u0101jput  | 60                   | 5,557           | 25,000               |\n| Garha                 | R\u0101j\u0101        | Kh\u012bch\u012b R\u0101jput     | 44                   | 9,481           | 22,000               |\n| Umri                  | R\u0101j\u0101        | Sesod\u0101 R\u0101jput     | 60                   | 2,409           | 6,000                |\n| Bhadaura              | R\u0101j\u0101        | Sesod\u0101 R\u0101jput     | 50                   | 2,275           | 5,000                |\n| Dharnaoda             | Th\u0101kur      | Kh\u012bch\u012b R\u0101jput     | 41                   | 4,323           | 9,000                |\n| Sirsi                 | Diw\u0101n       | Dhandere R\u0101jput   | 12                   | 5,448           | 6,000                |\n| Khiaoda               | Th\u0101kur      | Sesod\u0101 R\u0101jput     | 10                   | 857             | 2,000                |\n| K\u0101thaun               | Th\u0101kur      | J\u0101don R\u0101jput      | 5                    | 3,505           | 7,000                |\n| Agra Barkhera         | Th\u0101kur      | Ponw\u0101r R\u0101jput     | 31                   | 5,258           | 19,000               |\n| Chhabra (Tonk portion)|            |                  | 312                  | 36,046          | 2,37,000             |\n| Nimrol (Dholpur portion) |          |                  |                      | 523             |                      |\n| Railways and military stations | | | | 8,862 | |\n| **Total**             |             |                  | 17,825               | 2,187,612       | 59,68,000            |\n\nThe State takes its name from the old town of Gwalior, which, though never the actual capital, has always been an important place from the strength of its fort. The name is a corruption of Gop\u0101dri or Gopagiri, \u2018the shepherd\u2019s hill.\u2019\n\nThe State falls into three natural divisions, conveniently designated the plain, plateau, and hilly tract. The plain occupies the country lying to the north, east, and west of the town of Gwalior, and corresponding practically with the Gwalior Gird, Tonwargh\u0101r, Bhind, and Sheopur zilas of the State, with an area of 5,884 square miles. The elevation in this tract averages only a few hundred feet above the sea, ranging from about 500 feet to nearly 900. From a point about 80 miles south of Gwalior the country rises rapidly towards the south until it reaches the level of the M\u0101lw\u0101 plateau, with an average elevation of about 1,500 feet. The area of this tract is 17,856 square miles, or more than 70 per cent. of the whole State. The hilly tract comprised in the Amjhera zila consists of a medley of hill and valley, covered for the most part with thick jungle. It has an area of 1,301 square miles and a mean elevation of 1,800 feet above sea-level.\n\nTwo branches of the Vindhya range traverse the State: one striking northwards from Bhilsa passes up the centre of the State to Gwalior.\nwhile the other runs in a parallel direction through the Ujjain and Nimach districts. The watershed is determined by the main scarp of the Vindhyas, which lies to the north of the Narbad\u0101 river, and all streams flow in a northerly direction. The most important are the Chambal, with its tributaries, the greater K\u0101l\u012b Sind, Sipr\u0101, and the western P\u0101rbati; the Betw\u0101; and the Sind, with its tributaries, the eastern P\u0101rbati, Pahuj, and Kunw\u0101ri. These streams, though affording a considerable water-supply, are practically of no value for agricultural purposes, as the steepness of their banks makes irrigation from their waters almost impossible.\n\n1 To describe its geological formation, the Gwalior State may be divided into four principal sections: the country extending between the western portion of Bundelkhand to the east, the Chambal river to the west, and the northern part of M\u0101lw\u0101 to the south, within which is situated the capital of the State: the district of Nimach; several large tracts of the M\u0101lw\u0101 plateau; and a portion of the southern scarp of the M\u0101lw\u0101 plateau and of the country along the Narbad\u0101 river.\n\nThe first region, constituting Gwalior proper, is largely occupied by the Vindhyan series, rising in a succession of scarps which strike approximately north and south, except in their northern portion where the direction gradually changes to north-east and becomes parallel to the course of the Chambal river. There are four principal ranges capped by massive beds of sandstones which, taken in order from east to west, belong respectively to the Kaimur, lower Rewah, upper Rewah, and lower Bandair divisions. Beyond the fourth range, towards the Chambal river, the ground becomes largely covered by alluvial deposits, which conceal the next division of the Vindhynans, the Sirb\u016b shales. A number of rock exposures appear, however, in the Chambal river, remarkable for the occurrence of the Chambal limestone band, here intercalated among the Sirb\u016b shales and not known to occur at that horizon in Bhop\u0101l or in Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand.\n\nNorth of latitude 26\u00b0 N., the Kaimur sandstone no longer rests upon the crystalline rocks of the Bundelkhand gneiss, but upon sedimentary rocks belonging to the Bij\u0101war series. They were originally distinguished as the Gwalior series, but their complete lithological agreement with the Bij\u0101wars of Bundelkhand and with those of Rewah authorizes their correlation with that group. The Bij\u0101wars are very much older than the Vindhynans, and these hill ranges already existed as such before the commencement of the Vindhyan era. This is one of the oldest and at the same time one of the most distinct instances of a former land surface to be found in India, though similar features frequently recur among rocks of various geological ages in consequence\n\n1 By Mr. E.

The lowest bed of the series is, as usual, a conglomerate of white quartz pebbles overlaid by a mass of sandstone, which caps the gneissose scarp forming the southern limit of the most southern and most continuous of the ranges. The sandstone is called the P\u0101r sandstone, from the town of P\u0101r situated at the foot of the scarp, 15 miles southwest of Gwalior. The overlying rocks, whose aggregate thickness amounts to about 2,000 feet, form the parallel ranges north of the P\u0101r sandstone scarp, and include shales, banded jaspers, limestones, porcelanites, and basic volcanic rocks. Several bands of the latter occur at various horizons. They are well exposed in the hill upon which the fort of Gwalior stands, where they are capped by an outlier of Kaimur sandstone. Some of the shales and jaspers are impregnated with hematite, sometimes to such an extent as to become valuable iron ores. In the angle included between the scarps formed by the Kaimur and P\u0101r sandstones, a considerable area of the Bundelkhand gneiss outcrop is situated in Gwalior territory. The southern continuation of the Vindhyan ranges is greatly concealed by the overflowing Deccan trap, while, to the north, they sink beneath the Gangetic alluvium, which also covers a great deal of the Bij\u0101wars and gneiss.\n\nA great variety of rocks occur in the Nimach area, which has, however, been very little studied. The three great groups of the Upper Vindhyans\u2014the Kaimur, Rewar, and Bandair\u2014are all represented with their characteristic subdivisions, and are here underlaid by typical Lower Vindhyans of great thickness and considerable superficial extent. These rest on crystalline schists and gneisses of Archaean age (Ar\u0101valli series), and on strata of the Delhi series, whose age is difficult to decide, as it appears to be a heterogeneous group probably constituted partly of true Bij\u0101war rocks and partly of newer strata intermediate in age between the Bijawars and Vindhyans. A considerable portion of Sindhia\u2019s territories situated in M\u0101lw\u0101 has never been geologically surveyed. The formations consist largely of Deccan trap, and it is also known that the Vindhyans occur in the neighbourhood of Bhilsa.\n\nFarther south the districts bordering the Narbad\u0101 have been geologically famous ever since Keatinge\u2019s discovery of Cretaceous fossils at Chir\u0101kh\u0101n, 22 miles east of B\u0101gh, in 1856, and the region has been carefully surveyed by Dr. Blanford. The fossil sea-urchins have been studied by the late Professor Duncan, who arrived at the\nconclusion that the beds containing them are of cenomanian age, approximately corresponding, therefore, with the upper greensand in England. These fossils are found in a series of calcareous strata which, through a misapprehension regarding their geographical situation, have been misnamed the B\u0101gh beds by Dr. Carter in the first published account of Keatinge's discovery. Both the underlying and overlying beds are sandstones, the whole series being conformable with one another. The lower sandstone is sometimes distinguished under the name of Nim\u0101r sandstone. All these strata belong to the Lameta or infra-trappean group.\n\nThe town of B\u0101gh itself is situated on Bij\u0101wars, much of the neighbouring region being occupied by an outcrop of these rocks bordered on all sides by faults. The area includes the usual rock of the Bij\u0101war series\u2014slates, siliceous limestones, jaspers, and basic volcanic rocks. The lines of fracture are occupied by a siliceous breccia, which often contains a large proportion of hematite and then constitutes a valuable iron ore which was once extensively mined and smelted. The same district contains extensive outcrops of gneissose rocks. The gneiss exhibits a great deal of variety, and in this respect differs from the Bundelkhand gneiss, and seems closely related to the type called Bengal gneiss, which is regarded as more recent. The remainder of the district is occupied by Deccan trap.\u00b9\n\nIn the northern parts of the Gwalior State the vegetation in waste tracts consists largely of deciduous trees and shrubs, many of which flower when leafless or nearly so in the hot season. The principal species of trees are Bombax malabaricum, Sterculia urens, Semecarpus Anacardium, Acacia arabica, A. leucophloea, and A. Catechu, Anogeissus latifolia and A. pendula, Cordia Rothii, Phyllanthus Emblica, Erythrina suberosa, and Gmelina arborea. Farther south the low hills are covered with low forest, containing many shrubs like Grewia, Zizyphus, Woodfordia, Casearia, Carissa, Capparis, and Antidesma, mixed with Butea frondosa, Buchanania latifolia, Bassia latifolia, Diospyros tomentosa, Odina Wodier, and Boswellia serrata, though when the last is plentiful the brushwood undergrowth is often scanty. In places bamboos abound. In the extreme south the typical forest of the Central Indian highlands occurs, containing some teak, s\u0101j (Terminalia tomentosa), and other species\u2014such as Ougeinia, Dalbergia latifolia, Hardwickia, Cochlospermum, Schrebera, and Soymida\u2014characteristic of the region generally.\n\nThe Gwalior forests, and especially those in the northern section,\n\n\u00b9 'Geology of Gwalior and Vicinity,' Records, Geological Survey of India, vol. iii, pp. 33-42; Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. vi, part iii; Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, vol. xxx, 1865; Records, Geological Survey of India, vol. xx, pp. 81-92.\nabound in wild animals of every kind, tigers, leopards, s\u0101mbar, chital, antelope, and bears being met with, while small game is found everywhere.\n\nThroughout the plateau, which comprises nearly three-quarters of the total area, the climate is comparatively equable, being free from extremes of either heat or cold. In the plains, however, the hot season is distinctly oppressive, and the cold in winter is severe. The annual rainfall varies from about 30 inches on the plateau to 40 inches in the plains.\n\nThe house of Sindhia (or Shinde) traces its descent from a family of which one branch held the hereditary post of p\u0101tel in Kannerkhera, a village 16 miles east of S\u0101t\u0101ra. The head of the family received a patent of rank from the emperor Aurangzeb, while a daughter of the house was married to R\u0101j\u0101 S\u0101h\u016b, son and successor of Sambh\u0101ji. The founder of the Gwalior house was R\u0101noj\u012b Sindhia, who belonged to an impoverished branch and, according to a story current in Sir John Malcolm\u2019s time, had become a personal attendant on the Peshw\u0101 B\u0101l\u0101j\u012b B\u0101ji Rao, and used to carry his slippers. He rose rapidly in favour, brought to the front by his soldierly qualities. In 1726, together with Malh\u0101r Rao Holkar, the founder of the house of Indore, and the Ponw\u0101r, he was authorized by the Peshw\u0101 to collect chauth (25 per cent. of the revenues) and sardeshmukhi (10 per cent. over and above the chauth) in the M\u0101lw\u0101 districts, retaining for his own remuneration half the mokassa (or remaining 65 per cent.). R\u0101noj\u012b fixed his head-quarters at the ancient city of Ujjain, which ultimately became the capital of the Sindhia dominions, and in 1745 he died near Shuj\u0101dpur, where his cenotaph stands. He left three legitimate sons, Jay\u0101pa, Datt\u0101j\u012b, and Jotiba, and two illegitimate, T\u016bkaji and Mah\u0101dji. Jay\u0101pa succeeded to the territories of R\u0101noj\u012b, estimated to produce 65-5 lakhs yearly, but was killed at N\u0101gaur in 1759. He was followed by his son Jankoji, who was taken prisoner at P\u0101mpat (1761) and put to death, and Mah\u0101dji Sindhia succeeded.\n\nThe history of Gwalior State during the rule of Mah\u0101dji and his successor Daulat Rao is practically the history of India, in shaping which they both took a leading part. Mah\u0101dji returned from the Deccan to M\u0101lw\u0101 in 1764, and by 1769 re-established his power there. In 1772 M\u0101dh\u016b Rao Peshw\u0101 died; and in the struggles which ensued Mah\u0101dji took an important part, and seized every chance of increasing his power and augmenting his possessions. In 1775 Raghuba Peshw\u0101 threw himself on the protection of the British. The reverses which Sindhia\u2019s forces met with at the hands of Colonel Goddard after his famous march from Bengal to Gujar\u0101t (1778), the fall of Gwalior to Major Popham (1780), and the night attack by Major Camac, opened\nhis eyes to the strength of the new power which had entered the arena of Indian politics. In 1782 the Treaty of S\u0101lbai was made with Sindhia, the chief stipulations being that he should withdraw to Ujjain, and the British north of the Jumna, and that he should negotiate treaties with the other belligerents. The importance of this treaty can scarcely be exaggerated. It made the British arbiters of peace in India and virtually acknowledged their supremacy, while at the same time Sindhia was recognized as an independent chief and not as a vassal of the Peshw\u0101. A Resident, Mr. Anderson (who had negotiated the treaty), was at the same time appointed to Sindhia's court.\n\nSindhia took full advantage of the system of neutrality pursued by the British to establish his supremacy over Northern Hindust\u0101n. In this he was assisted by the genius of Beno\u00eet de Boigne, whose influence in consolidating the power of Mah\u0101dji Sindhia is seldom estimated at its true value. He was a Savoyard, a native of Chamb\u00e9ry, who had served under Lord Clare in the famous Irish Brigade at Fontenoy and elsewhere, and who after many vicissitudes, including imprisonment by the Turks, reached India and for a time held a commission in the 6th Madras Infantry. After resigning his commission he had proposed to travel overland to Russia, but was prevented by the loss of his possessions and papers, stolen, it appears, at the instigation of Mah\u0101dji, who was suspicious of his intentions. De Boigne finally entered Sindhia's service, and, by his genius for organization and command in the field, was instrumental in establishing the Mar\u0101th\u0101 supremacy. Commencing with two battalions of infantry, he ultimately increased Sindhia's regular forces to three brigades. With these troops Sindhia became invincible, defeating the R\u0101jputs at L\u0101lsot (1787), P\u0101tan (1790), and Merta (1790), Holkar at Lakheri (1793), and the Delhi forces at Agra (1787).\n\nIn 1785 Sindhia reinstated the emperor Sh\u0101h Alam on his throne at Delhi, receiving in return the title of deputy Vak\u012bl-ul-Mutlak or vicegerent of the empire, that of Vak\u012bl-ul-Mutlak being at his request conferred on the Peshw\u0101, his master, as he was pleased to designate him. In 1788 the atrocities practised by Ghul\u0101m K\u0101dir on the unfortunate emperor gave Sindhia the opportunity of taking possession of Delhi and becoming the protector of the aged Sh\u0101h Alam. After the peace made with Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n in 1792, Sindhia successfully exerted his influence to prevent the completion of a treaty between the British, the Niz\u0101m, and the Peshw\u0101, directed against Tip\u016b. In the same year Sindhia carried out the investiture of the Peshw\u0101 with the insignia of Vak\u012bl-ul-Mutlak. During the ceremony he professed the greatest humility, even insisting on bearing the Peshw\u0101's slippers, as his father had served an earlier Peshw\u0101. The old Mar\u0101th\u0101 nobles, however, were\ndisgusted, and refused to attend or offer the usual complimentary gifts to Sindhia. Mah\u0101dji was now at the zenith of his power, when all his schemes for further aggrandizement were cut short by his sudden death in 1794 at W\u0101nowri near Poona. Mah\u0101dji Sindhia had many qualities superior to those of his successful contemporaries, such as Gh\u0101zi-ud-d\u012bn, Ghul\u0101m K\u0101dir, and Raghuba, who had come to the front by treachery or sheer brutality. With such men Sindhia had nothing in common.\n\n'Clear in the conception of reasonable projects, he was bold and prudent in their realization. . . . In a scene of barbarous anarchy, when all the bonds of society seemed to be unloosed, he was amiable, courteous, and free from cruelty. . . . Sindhia was easily provoked and not easily appeased. But, if he seldom forgave an injury, he never forgot a benefit . . . consequently he was served with fidelity and affection. His countenance was expressive of good sense and good humour, but his complexion was dark, his person inclining to corpulence, and he limped from the effects of his wound at P\u0101nipat. He could write, was a good accountant, and understood revenue affairs well.'\n\nMah\u0101dji left no heir, and was succeeded by Daulat Rao, a grandson of his brother T\u016bkaji, who was scarcely fifteen years of age at the time. Born in wealthy surroundings, brought up among foreign troops from whom he had learned to despise those of his own country, the possessor of vast territories and a dominant military organization, Daulat Rao looked upon himself as the chief sovereign in India and not as a member of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 confederacy. At this time the death of the young Peshw\u0101, M\u0101dhu Rao II (1795), and the troubles which it occasioned, the demise of T\u016bkaji Holkar and the rise of the turbulent Jaswant Rao Holkar, together with the intrigues of N\u0101n\u0101 Farnavis, threw the country into confusion and enabled Sindhia to gain the ascendancy. He also came under the influence of Sarje Rao Gh\u0101tke, the most unprincipled scoundrel of the day, whose daughter he had married (1798). Urged possibly by this adviser, Daulat Rao aimed at increasing his dominions at all costs, and seized territory from the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Ponw\u0101rs of Dh\u0101r and Dew\u0101s. The rising power of Jaswant Rao Holkar, however, alarmed him. In July, 1801, Jaswant Rao appeared before Sindhia's capital of Ujjain, and, after defeating some battalions under Hessing, extorted a large sum from its inhabitants, but did not ravage the town. In October, however, Sarje Rao Gh\u0101tke took revenge by sacking Indore, razing it almost to the ground, and practising every form of atrocity on its inhabitants. From this time dates the gardi-k\u0101-teakt, or 'period of unrest,' as it is still called, during which the whole of Central India was overrun by the armies of Sindhia and Holkar and their attendant predatory Pind\u0101ri bands, under Amir Kh\u0101n and others. De Boigne had retired in 1796: and his successor,\nPerron, was a man of a very different stamp, whose determined favouritism of French officers, in defiance of all claims to promotion, produced discontent in the regular corps.\n\nFinally, on December 31, 1802, the Peshw\u0101 signed the Treaty of Bassein, by which the British were recognized as the paramount power in India. The continual evasion shown by Sindhia in all attempts at negotiation brought him into conflict with the British, and his power was completely destroyed in both Western and Northern India by the victories of Ahmadnagar, Assaye, As\u012brgarh, and Lasw\u0101ri. His famous brigades were annihilated and his military power irretrievably broken. On December 30, 1803, he signed the Treaty of Sarji Anjangaon, by which he was obliged to give up his possessions between the Jumna and Ganges, the district of Broach, and other lands in the south of his dominions; and soon after, by the Treaty of Burh\u0101npur, he agreed to maintain a subsidiary force to be paid for out of the revenues of territory ceded by the treaty. By the ninth article of the Treaty of Sarji Anjangaon he was deprived of the forts of Gwalior and Gohad. The discontent produced by the last condition almost caused a rupture, and did actually result in the plundering of the Resident's camp and detention of the Resident as a prisoner. In 1805, under the new policy of Lord Cornwallis, Gohad and Gwalior were restored, and the Chambal river was made the northern boundary of the State, while certain claims on R\u0101jput States were abolished, the British Government at the same time binding itself to enter into no treaties with Udaipur, Jodhpur, Kotah, or any chief tributary to Sindhia in M\u0101lw\u0101, Mew\u0101r, or M\u0101rw\u0101r. In 1816 Sindhia was called on to assist in the suppression of the Pind\u0101ris. For some time it was doubtful what line he would take, but he ultimately signed the Treaty of Gwalior in 1817 by which he promised full co-operation. He did not, however, act up to his professions, and connived at the retention of the fort of As\u012brgarh, which had been ceded by the treaty. A fresh treaty in 1818 effected a readjustment of boundaries, Ajmer and other lands being ceded.\n\nIn 1827 Daulat Rao died, leaving no son or adopted heir. His widow, Baiza Bai, an unscrupulous and designing woman, adopted Mukut Rao, a boy of eleven belonging to a distant but legitimate branch of the family, who succeeded as Jankoji Rao Sindhia. Difficulties then arose as to whether the Bai should rule in her own right or as regent, and her behaviour towards the young chief finally caused a rise of feeling in his favour which impelled the Bai to take refuge in British territory. She returned after an interval and lived at Gwalior till her death in 1862. The chief's maternal uncle, known as the M\u0101m\u0101 S\u0101hib, had meanwhile become minister. The most important event during this period was the readjustment of the terms for maintaining the contingent force raised under the treaty of 1817.\nJankoji Rao was a weak ruler and feuds were constant at his court, while the army was in a chronic state of mutiny. He died in 1843; and in the absence of an heir, his widow T\u0101r\u0101 Bai adopted Bh\u0101girath Rao, a son of Hanwant Rao, commonly called B\u0101b\u0101ji Sindhia. He succeeded under the name of Jay\u0101j\u012b Rao Sindhia, the M\u0101m\u0101 Sahib being chosen as regent. T\u0101r\u0101 Bai, however, came under the evil influence of D\u0101d\u0101 Kh\u0101sgiw\u0101la, the comptroller of her household, an unscrupulous adventurer who wished to get all power into his own hands. A complicated series of intrigues followed, which it is impossible to unravel. The D\u0101d\u0101, however, succeeded in driving the M\u0101m\u0101 Sahib from the State, and became minister. He filled all appointments with his relatives, and matters rapidly passed from bad to worse, ending in the assemblage of large bodies of troops who threatened an attack on Sironj, where the M\u0101m\u0101 Sahib was then residing. War was impending in the Punjab, and, as it was essential to secure peace, the British Government decided to interfere. Colonel Sleeman, the Resident, was withdrawn, and the surrender of D\u0101d\u0101 Kh\u0101sgiw\u0101la was demanded. A British force under Sir Hugh Gough moved on Gwalior, and crossed the Chambal in December, 1843. On December 29 followed the simultaneous battles of Panniar and Mah\u0101r\u0101jpur, in which the Gwalior army was annihilated. A treaty was then made, under which certain lands to the value of 18 lakhs were ceded for the upkeep of a contingent force, besides other lands for the liquidation of the expenses incurred in the late war, the State army was reduced, and a Council of Regency was appointed during the minority, to act under the Resident\u2019s advice.\n\nIn 1852 Dinkar Rao (afterwards Rao R\u0101j\u0101 Sir Dinkar Rao, Mushir-i-kh\u0101s Bah\u0101dur, K.C.S.I.) became minister, and under his able management radical reforms were introduced into every department of the administration. During the Mutiny, Sindhia gave valuable assistance to the British, at no little risk to himself. Early in June, 1858, he was driven from the Gwalior fort by T\u0101nti\u0101 Topi and the R\u0101n\u012b of Jh\u0101nsi, to whom all his troops deserted. But on June 19, Gwalior was captured by Sir Hugh Rose and Sindhia was reinstated. For his services lands worth 3 lakhs a year were made over, while he was allowed to increase his infantry from 3,000 to 5,000 men, and his artillery from 32 to 36 guns. In 1861 he was created a G.C.S.I. In 1872 the State lent 75 lakhs for the construction of the Agra-Gwalior portion of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, and a similar amount in 1873 for the Indore-Nimach section of the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. A personal salute of 21 guns was conferred in 1877, and Jay\u0101j\u012b Rao became a Counsellor of the Empress and later on a G.C.B. and C.I.E. In 1882 land was ceded by the State for the Midland section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. In 1886 Gwalior fort and Mor\u0101r cantonment, with\nsome other villages, which had been held by British troops since 1858, were exchanged for Jhansi city.\n\nJayaji Rao died in 1886 and was succeeded by his son, the present chief, Madhava Rao Sindhia, then a boy in his tenth year. A Council of Regency conducted the administration until 1894, when the Maharaja obtained powers. He takes a deep and active interest in the administration of his State, having a comprehensive grasp of the work done in each department. In 1900 the Maharaja went to China during the war, at the same time presenting a hospital ship for the accommodation of the wounded. The chief bears the titles of Maharaja and His Highness, and receives a salute of 19 guns, increased to 21 in his own territory. The present Maharaja is a G.C.V.O., G.C.S.I., and A.D.C. to the King-Emperor, besides holding the rank of Honorary Colonel in the British Army, and Honorary Colonel of Skinner's Horse, a regiment originally raised by Colonel Skinner, an officer of De Boigne. He has also received the gold Kaisar-i-Hind medal, and the honorary degree of LL.D. granted by the University of Cambridge.\n\nGwalior State contains very many places of archaeological interest. Except Old Ujjain, which requires to be excavated before its site can be properly examined, the earliest remains are those round Bhilsa, at Beshnagar, and Udayagiri, where many Buddhist remains of the first century B.C. and Hindu relics of the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. are to be seen. At Bagh a series of fine rock-cut Buddhist viharas exist, dating probably from the seventh century. Medieval Hindu and Jain architecture is represented at Baro, Gwalior, Gyaraspur, Narod, and Udayapur, while the best Muhammadan work is seen at Chanderi, Mandasor, Narwar, Gohad, and Gwalior. Besides these, old shrines and buildings are met with in many localities, few places indeed of any size being without some such relic of the past. Most of the remains are those of Hindu and Jain temples of the tenth to the thirteenth centuries. At Kutw\u00e4r or Kamantalpur, 10 miles north-east of Nurabad (26\u00b0 24' N. and 78\u00b0 6' E.), and at Paroli and Paravali, 9 miles north of Gwalior, are remains which date back to the fifth and sixth centuries, perhaps even earlier. Rajapur near Terahi contains the remains of a stupa, probably of late date. Terahi, Kadwaha close by, Dubkund near Sheopur, and Suhania, 25 miles north of Gwalior, all show signs of having once been places of importance, especially Suhania, which appears to have been a large city. At Kaliadeh, 5 miles north of Ujjain Town, is an old palace constructed in the bed of the Sipra. The waters of the river are led through fancifully shaped conduits into numerous tanks and over sculptured stone curtains, whence they fall in a thin iridescent sheet, until they finally return to their natural bed over a fall of some 20 feet.\nThe palace appears to have been built by the Khilji Sultans of Malwa in the sixteenth century.\n\nThe population at the three enumerations was: (1881) 2,993,352, (1891) 3,378,774, and (1901) 2,933,001, the density in the last year being 117 persons per square mile. The decrease of 13 per cent. during the last decade is mainly due to the effect of bad seasons, notably the disastrous famine of 1899-1900. The State contains 23 towns, the two largest being Gwalior City (population, 119,433), consisting of Gwalior, Lashkar, and Brigade; and Ujjain (39,892), the former capital. Nine of these towns are in the plains, the remainder being on the plateau. There are 9,538 villages, with an average number of 273 inhabitants.\n\nThe following table gives statistics of population and land revenue:\n\n| District     | Area in square miles | Towns | Population, 1901 | Population per square mile | Number of persons able to read and write | Land revenue and cesses for khalsa area, 1902-3 |\n|--------------|----------------------|-------|------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Sheopur      | 2,862                | 3     | 729              | 214,624                    | 75                                        | 8,13,000                                      |\n| Tonwargh\u0101r   | 1,834                | 1     | 704              | 369,414                    | 199                                       | 11,12,000                                     |\n| Bhind        | 1,554                | 2     | 819              | 394,461                    | 254                                       | 11,65,000                                     |\n| Gwalior Gird | 1,513                | 3     | 614              | 323,693                    | 246                                       | 5,25,000                                      |\n| Narwar       | 4,041                | 2     | 1,298            | 308,361                    | 131                                       | 6,58,000                                      |\n| Is\u0101garh      | 3,591                | 2     | 1,367            | 248,079                    | 75                                        | 4,97,000                                      |\n| Bhilsa       | 1,623                | 1     | 708              | 120,189                    | 74                                        | 3,32,000                                      |\n| Sh\u0101japur      | 3,494                | 3     | 1,393            | 361,050                    | 103                                       | 14,02,000                                     |\n| Ujjain       | 1,505                | 3     | 697              | 269,670                    | 139                                       | 9,86,000                                      |\n| Animghera    | 1,301                | ...   | 464              | 66,426                     | 74                                        | 1,51,000                                      |\n| Mandasor     | 1,721                | 3     | 775              | 196,434                    | 114                                       | 9,03,000                                      |\n\nTotal 25,041 23 9,538 2,933,001 117 70,000 85,44,000\n\nHindus form 84 per cent. of the total, Animists 7 per cent., Musalmans 6 per cent., and Jains 2 per cent. The followers of B\u0101b\u0101 Kap\u016br, a Husaini Saiyid, are found only in this State. He was originally a soldier, but subsequently devoted his time to carrying water for the poor, and finally adopted a life of meditation. He fell from the roof of his house and died in 1571. His shrine is situated in a cave, cut in the north-eastern face of the rock on which the Gwalior fort stands. It is supported by grants from State funds, and is visited by both Hindus and Muhammadans.\n\nOwing to the wide area covered by the State, a great diversity of languages exists. Thus Malwi is spoken by 25 per cent. of the population, but is used by 80 to 90 per cent. of the people in the western districts. Bundeli speakers form 18 per cent. of the total, but the language is spoken by 70 per cent. in Bh\u0101nder and 86 per cent. in Bhilsa. Urdu was returned by 18 per cent. and is spoken in all parts\nby the official classes. In Tonwargh\u0101r a dialect of Western Hindi, called Tonwargh\u0101ri, is the prevailing tongue, and is spoken by 13 per cent. of the population of the State.\n\nThe Hindu castes most largely represented are the Cham\u0101rs (leather workers and labourers), 319,500; Br\u0101hmans, 310,000; R\u0101jputs, 297,000; K\u0101chh\u012bs (agriculturists), 158,000; Ahirs (graziers and cultivators), 108,715; Gujars (graziers and cultivators), 100,700; Balais, 71,000; and Koris (weavers), 66,500. Among the Muhammadans, Shaikhs number 58,800 and Path\u0101ns 47,600. The most prominent jungle tribes are the Kir\u0101rs (agriculturists and hunters), 62,400; Min\u0101s, 62,300; and Bhils, 41,300, the last being chiefly met with in the Amjh\u0113ra district. A large proportion of the population is agricultural, 57 per cent. in the plains and hilly tracts and 47 in the plateau being supported by agriculture, while 26 per cent. follow pastoral occupations. Industrial pursuits are followed by 15 per cent., commercial by 3 per cent., and professional by 1 per cent.\n\nChristians in 1901 numbered 765, including 379 native Christians. The Canadian Presbyterian Mission has establishments at Ujjain and Nimach.\n\nThe variety in the physical features of the State causes great differences in the agricultural conditions. The best soil is found in M\u0101lw\u0101, but the Tonwargh\u0101r and Bhind districts are covered with alluvial soil of fair fertility. In the centre of northern Gwalior a hilly tract, formed by an arm of the Vindhya, makes much of the country in the Narwar, Sheopur, and Is\u0101garh districts of little use for agricultural purposes. Nearly the whole of Amjh\u0113ra is cut up by hills and contains little soil of value. Other factors are the density and character of the population. Large tracts of good land are lying fallow for want of cultivators, while the endeavours made to induce the Bhils in Amjh\u0113ra to practise ordinary methods have not met with much success.\n\nThe soil is classed under ten main heads: m\u0101r, or black soil, very retentive of moisture; k\u0101bar, an inferior black soil, less retentive of moisture; paru\u0101, a light soil; d\u016bmat, a clayey soil; p\u0101th\u0101l, a detrital soil found on the slopes of the hills; karmatiya, used mainly for growing rice; bh\u016br\u012b, a yellow soil; kachh\u0101r, the soil found along river-beds; and r\u0101nkar and d\u0101ndu, two stony soils of little value. The first four classes produce both spring and autumn crops, while the rest bear only an autumn crop. The last two soils cannot be cultivated every year.\n\nOf the total area of the State, 5,587 square miles, or 22 per cent., have been alienated in grants, leaving 19,454 square miles of kh\u0101lsa or land directly under State control. The main agricultural statistics for 1902\u20133 are shown on the next page, areas being in square miles.\n\nJow\u0101r is the principal crop, covering 1,807 square miles, or 29 per\ncent. of the total cropped area in kh\u0101lsa land, in 1902-3; while gram (952), wheat (467), b\u0101jra (341), maize (252), barley (119), arhar (107), and rice (66) are also important. The chief non-food crops are oil-seeds (346), cotton (305), poppy (65), and sugar-cane (9). Various minor grains, mostly pulses, are also grown, while til, linseed, and rameli are grown for oil, and amb\u016bri and san-hemp for fibre. In the country round Gwalior city a considerable quantity of Indian hemp is produced for the manufacture of g\u0101nja and bh\u0101ng. Tobacco and the usual vegetables are grown in villages. The area in acres under poppy was 49,553 in 1900-1, 34,057 in 1901-2, and 41,345 in 1902-3. The decrease is due mainly to the diminution in the M\u0101lw\u0101 population, which has made it difficult for agriculturists to obtain the necessary labour at the right moment, so essential to the proper cultivation of this crop. Liberal concessions are made for the breaking up of waste land and clearing of forests.\n\n| District     | Total kh\u0101lsa | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------------|--------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Sheopur      | 2,522        | 502        | 21        | 335             |\n| Tonwargh\u0101r   | 1,620        | 794        | 47        | 299             |\n| Bhind        | 1,397        | 742        | 35        | 169             |\n| Gwalior Gird | 1,362        | 274        | 37        | 332             |\n| Narwar       | 3,032        | 773        | 99        | 1,044           |\n| Is\u0101garh      | 2,421        | 528        | 19        | 1,126           |\n| Bhilsa       | 1,423        | 299        | 3         | 757             |\n| Sh\u0101j\u0101pur     | 2,609        | 741        | 47        | 1,292           |\n| Ujjain       | 1,069        | 495        | 12        | 425             |\n| Amjh\u0113ra      | 673          | 194        | 4         | 222             |\n| Mandasor     | 1,326        | 380        | 37        | 470             |\n| **Total**    | **19,454**   | **5,722**  | **361**   | **6,471**       |\n\nThe total area under cultivation increased from 5,287 square miles in 1901-2 to 5,722 square miles in 1902-3, but the irrigated area fell from 377 square miles to 361. Loans of seed and money are freely given, the rate of interest being 4 per cent. on seed grants and 6 per cent. on loans for well-digging and the purchase of bullocks. This system of making State advances is said to be rapidly ousting the former monopoly of the village bankers.\n\nThe only special breed of cattle met with in the State is the M\u0101lw\u0101. These are of medium size, generally of a grey, silver grey, or white colour. They are very strong and active. In the Narwar and Sheopur districts a local breed of cattle is raised of a very hardy type. The milch cows and the goats of the Bhind and Tonwargh\u0101r districts have a considerable reputation.\n\nA separate irrigation department, which was started during the present chief's minority and is now a section of the State Public Works department, deals with the maintenance of existing wells and tanks and\nthe construction of new works. No water rates are levied, a return on the outlay being obtained from the higher rates levied on the increased area brought under irrigation. The chief source of water-supply is from wells. In M\u0101lw\u0101 water is usually raised in a leathern bag worked by bullocks, while in northern Gwalior the Persian wheel is common. The cost of making wells is considerable in northern Gwalior, and in the Sheopur district especially is almost prohibitive, owing to the proximity of the rock to the surface. In 1902\u20133, 361 square miles of kh\u0101lsa land were irrigated, of which 247 square miles were supplied from wells, 87 from tanks, and 27 from other sources. Owing to their depth below the surrounding country, the rivers are of little use for irrigation.\n\nThe forests lie mainly in the Sheopur, Is\u0101garh, Narwar, Amjhera, and Bhilsa districts. In 1896 they were placed under regular supervision, but as yet no attempt has been made to work them commercially, and no areas have been formally \u2018reserved.\u2019 The forest produce, consisting of timber, charcoal, grass, gum, lac, and the flowers and fruit of the mahu\u0101 and chironji, is auctioned yearly to contractors who supply the public. A Conservator of forests has lately been appointed, who is introducing systematic management. An annual revenue of about Rs. 72,000 is derived, giving a profit of Rs. 13,000.\n\nIron is found round Gwalior in large quantities, a very pure hematite occurring in the Bij\u0101war rocks. In former days a considerable industry existed near Panni\u0101r, but this has almost entirely died out, owing to the cheapness of the European product. Heaps of slag still indicate the sites of old workings. A little crude salt and saltpetre are manufactured from surface efflorescences. A considerable deposit of mica exists at Gang\u0101pur, but has not yet been worked commercially. Limestone occurs in many places, but is little quarried. The chief mineral product of Gwalior is the magnificent building material provided by the Vindhyan sandstone, which has been used in the old buildings on the fort and throughout the modern city of Lashkar. The quarrymen are mostly Cham\u0101rs, who pay an annual fee of Rs. 4 a head.\n\nThe main industries are connected with cotton, which is ginned and pressed in factories at many places. A large spinning-mill, established by a private firm at Ujjain in 1898, employs 500 hands and produces 3,000 lb. of yarn a day. The fabrics produced at Chander\u012b are remarkable for their fineness, and a popular kind of cotton print is made at Mandasor. Opium is manufactured at Ujjain and Mandasor, the latter place being the chief centre of the industry. At Sheopur a local art in lacquer-work exists, bedstead legs and playing-cards being a speciality.\n\nThe principal exports are grain, oilseeds, cotton, opium, country cloth, and ghi. These articles are exported to Bombay, Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d,\nCawnpore, Indore, and Calcutta principally, much of the opium being shipped to China. The chief articles imported are hardware, kerosene oil, arms, machinery, and paper, which are obtained from Bombay, Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, Cawnpore, Indore, and Calcutta. The Muhammadan population imports a considerable quantity of white metal utensils from Bhilw\u0101ra in R\u0101jput\u0101na. The chief marts are Lashkar, Ujjain, Bhind, Morena, Sabalgarh, Sheopur, S\u012bpri, Guna, Mungadol\u012b, Pachh\u0101r, Chander\u012b, Mandasor (for opium especially), Sh\u0101japur, Nimach, and Gang\u0101pur.\n\nThe northern part of the State is traversed by the Midland section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, while two branches run from Bhop\u0101l to Ujjain and from B\u012bna to B\u0101ran. The Gwalior Light Railway, a local State line, runs for 185 miles, from Gwalior north-east to Bhind, and south-west to Sipri with a branch to Sabalgarh. This was constructed by the Darb\u0101r at a cost of 44 lakhs, and is managed by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company. In the famine of 1897 it was of the greatest benefit to the districts round Gwalior, where the distress was keen. Small extensions of the line run to shooting preserves and round the palace precincts. The R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway main line from Khandw\u0101 to Ajmer and a branch to Ujjain pass through the M\u0101lw\u0101 portion. The Baroda-Ujjain branch of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway runs for 46 miles in Gwalior territory, and the N\u0101gda-Muttra line, now under construction, will also pass through much of the State.\n\nGwalior possesses a large number of roads, some constructed by the British Government and some by the State. The total length of metalled roads is 885 miles. In 1888, at the request of the Council of Regency, all roads running through the State were taken over by the Darb\u0101r, which became responsible for their proper maintenance. One of the chief routes is the Agra-Bombay road, of which 216 miles lie in Gwalior territory. The Gwalior-Jh\u0101nsi road, 33 miles in length, constructed by the British Government, was handed over to the State in 1888.\n\nNo post offices had been opened in the State until 1885, when a convention was entered into with the British Government, which has been modified by additional agreements in 1888 and 1895. The State post offices issue money orders, the commission being retained by the Darb\u0101r, and all articles are delivered by the State officials. The number of post offices has risen from 65 in 1885 to 129 in 1903, while the number of letters and parcels carried has increased from 345,000 and 28,000 in 1896 to 4,308,000 and 106,000 in 1903. British stamps surcharged with two cobras and the word \u2018Gwalior\u2019 are used, and yielded a revenue of Rs. 85,000, including the sale of service stamps, in 1903. The department is in charge of the State postmaster-general.\nBritish telegraph offices combined with post offices have been opened at a dozen of the principal towns.\n\nThe first famine of which any records exist devastated northern Gwalior in 1783-4, its dire effects being noted by Mr. Malet in his diary. The next severe famine, that of 1896-7, was mainly felt in the northern districts, while that of 1899-1900 was worst in M\u0101lw\u0101, the N\u012bmach district being most affected, only 4 inches of rain falling. A large number of relief works at a cost of 38-2 lakhs and many poorhouses were opened, 14 lakhs was distributed on gratuitous relief, and large suspensions and remissions were granted to the cultivators. The sickness which followed the famine carried off numbers of the enfeebled population.\n\nFor administrative purposes the State is divided into two large portions: northern Gwalior, comprising seven zilas or districts\u2014Gw\u0101lior Gir\u012bd, Bh\u012bnd, Sheopur, Tonwargh\u0101r, Is\u0101garh, Bh\u012blsa, and Narwar; and the M\u0101lw\u0101 pr\u0101nt or division, comprising four zilas\u2014Ujjain, Mandasor, Sh\u0101j\u0101pur, and Amjh\u0113ra. The zilas are subdivided into parganas, the villages in a pargana being grouped into circles, each under a patw\u0101ri.\n\nThe administrative machinery of the State is controlled by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, assisted by the Sadr Board. This Board consists of seven members, the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 himself being president and the members being in charge of different departments, of which the most important are the Revenue, Land Records and Settlement, Forest, Accounts, Public Works, Customs, and Post Office. The chief has no minister, but a staff of secretaries, supervised by a chief secretary, prepare cases for the final orders of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101. A Sar S\u016bbah, in general charge of the M\u0101lw\u0101 pr\u0101nt, controls and supervises the work of the S\u016bbahs in charge of the zilas. The S\u016bbahs are zila magistrates, exercising powers similar to those of a District Magistrate in British India. They are assisted by Kam\u0101sd\u0101rs (Kam\u0101vsid\u0101rs) in charge of parganas, who are magistrates of the second or third class and Munsifs for their charges. The constitution in the northern division is similar, except that here the S\u016bbahs are directly under the Sadr Board.\n\nThe first regular judicial court was established in 1844, by the M\u0101m\u0101 S\u0101hib when minister of the State. This court, designated the Huz\u016br Ad\u016blat, was presided over by a judge, who heard cases only from the city and surrounding districts, as the farmers of revenue exercised judicial powers in the villages they held. In 1852 Sir Dinkar Rao abolished the system of leasing villages and appointed Kam\u0101sd\u0101rs and S\u016bbahs, to whom judicial powers, both civil and criminal, were granted. In 1888 the Council of Regency adopted the system now in force.\n\nThe lowest civil courts are those of the Kam\u0101sd\u0101rs in charge of parganas, who are empowered to hear cases up to Rs. 500 in value. The\nSadr Amin of the zila deals with cases up to Rs. 3,000 in value. The prant judge hears cases up to Rs. 50,000 in value; and the Chief Judge of the Sadr Adalat, or High Court, hears cases up to any value.\n\nThe lowest criminal courts in the State are those of the Kam\u0101sd\u0101rs, who are magistrates of the second or third class. The Sadr Amins are first-class magistrates for the zila, and the Subahs are zila (District) magistrates. The Prant Adalat, to which both first and second-class magistrates commit cases, takes the place of the Sessions Court in British India. The Chief Judge's Court, the Sadr Adalat or High Court, is the highest criminal court in the State. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie successively from the pargana courts to the zila and prant courts and the High Court. Cases involving imprisonment for life, or a sentence of death, are referred by the Prant Adalat (Sessions) to the Sadr Adalat, and all sentences of death are finally laid before the Maharaja for confirmation. The Maharaja also hears appeals against decisions of the Sadr Adalat. Codes based on those of British India, but modified so as to suit local customs, were issued in 1895.\n\nSince 1902 a regular Accounts department has been formed, in which all State accounts are audited. The normal revenue of the State is 150 lakhs, excluding 11 lakhs assigned to jagird\u0101rs. In 1902-3 the chief heads of revenue were: land, 85 lakhs; customs, 11 lakhs; stamps, 2\u00b78 lakhs; excise, 1\u00b74 lakhs; opium, 2\u00b78 lakhs; interest on railway loan, 21\u00b73 lakhs; and railway earnings, 3 lakhs. The expenditure amounted to 133 lakhs, the chief heads being: collection of land revenue, 8\u00b73 lakhs; general administration, including the chief's establishment, 16 lakhs; police, 7\u00b75 lakhs; military, 41\u00b73 lakhs; public works, 21\u00b78 lakhs; irrigation, 6\u00b77 lakhs; education, 2\u00b74 lakhs; medical, 1\u00b76 lakhs; and law and justice, 3 lakhs.\n\nThere are five main classes of tenure in the State. Guaranteed Th\u0101kurs possess land in the State under guarantee from the British Government; the conditions of their tenure vary in almost every case. Jagird\u0101rs hold directly from the Darb\u0101r, and often exercise limited judicial and general administrative powers within their own holdings, besides having a right to a seat in Darb\u0101r and enjoying other privileges. T\u0101nk\u0101d\u0101rs and istimr\u0101nd\u0101rs hold on a permanent quit-rent. Muq\u012bd\u0101rs enjoy rent-free grants, which are subdivided into devasth\u0101n grants for the upkeep of temples, and dharm\u0101da and pad\u0101rakh, religious and charitable grants. The last and most general class consists of the kh\u0101lsa area directly under State management. Since the first settlement made by Dinkar Rao in 1852, the samind\u0101rs have held their land for a regular term varying from seven to twelve years, and more recently a settlement has been made for twenty years in the Bhander zila. In the Bhil country of Amjhera, however, and in some parts of northern Gwalior, the poorness of the soil necessitates a yearly settlement by the\n'plough' of land (about 15 acres) cultivated. Alienation of land under certain restrictions, of which the most important is the prohibition of sale to any man not a subject of the Gwalior Darb\u0101r, has been permitted since 1898, in which year proprietary rights were formally recognized. Revenue was originally collected through tipd\u0101rs or merchant bankers, who stood security and received 10 per cent. as remuneration. This system has lately been abolished, and all revenue due from kh\u0101lsa land is now paid directly to the State officials. The rates paid vary according to the quality of the soil, ranging for irrigated land from Rs. 4 to Rs. 40 per acre, the latter rate being charged on poppy-growing land, and for 'dry' land from about 8 annas to Rs. 6. The average incidence of the land revenue demand is Rs. 2-7-9 per acre of cultivated land, and 11 annas per acre of total area. A regular survey for settlement purposes was first made in 1871, the dori or rope of 1 jarib (66 feet in length) being used. In 1890, 1892, and 1896-7 a fresh survey of different parts of the State was made by the plane table, a training class being at the same time opened for the patw\u0101ris. The demand in 1871 was 50-8 lakhs, and in 1896 it was 89-7 lakhs.\n\nThe collections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | Average, 1881-90 | Average, 1891-1900 | 1900-1 | 1901-2 | 1902-3 |\n|----------------|------------------|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 93.90            | 86.20              | 85.43  | 71.24  | 85.44  |\n| Total revenue  | 2,052.7          | 1,515.5            | 1,367.7| 1,387.8| 1,518.7|\n\nA considerable revenue is derived from opium, which is grown chiefly in M\u0101lw\u0101. A duty of Rs. 25 is levied on every chest (140 lb.) of opium exported, to which an extra duty called k\u0101nti kharch, amounting to Rs. 7-14-0 per chest at Mandasor and Rs. 7-6-0 at Ujjain, is added for the maintenance of the scales. The income from this source varied from 3.2 lakhs in 1881 to 4.3 lakhs in 1891, 2 lakhs in 1901, and 2.8 lakhs in 1903. The right to retail opium within the State is sold by auction annually. The salt revenue is governed by an agreement of 1878, by which the Darb\u0101r undertook not to open any new salt works, nor to allow more than 1,930 tons a year to be manufactured at existing works. At the same time it was agreed that none of the salt so manufactured should be exported from the State, and that no salt should be imported, except such as had paid duty in British India, such salt being admitted free of any further tax. In return, the Government of India pays a yearly sum of 3.1 lakhs as compensation.\n\nA regular department for the collection of customs and excise duties was constituted in 1902. A superintendent of customs and excise is appointed for each z\u012bla, with a staff of inspectors and patrols. The department is controlled by a Commissioner of customs and excise, who\nis a member of the Sadr Board. The practice of farming the collections makes it impossible to give figures for earlier years, but in 1903 customs yielded 11 lakhs and excise 1.4 lakhs.\n\nCountry liquor is made from the flowers of the *mahua* (*Bassia latifolia*). The Persian still is used in distilling large quantities, and earthen pot-stills by petty contractors. The strength of the liquor varies from 70\u00b0 to 25\u00b0 under proof. The right to vend in all towns of any size is sold by auction, but in outlying areas any one can set up a still on payment of Rs. 5 for every maund of *mahua* put under fermentation. A special tax is levied on the retail vend of foreign liquors. The right to sell drugs is included in the liquor contracts.\n\nCourt-fee stamps were first introduced in 1862, the system being revised in 1897. Four classes of stamps are now in use, known respectively as *ad\u0101lat\u012b* for judicial applications, *tall\u0101na* for process services, *dast\u0101wezi* for ordinary deeds, and *tamassuk* and *nakal tamassuk* for documents concerning loans to cultivators. The net income in 1902\u20133 was 2.8 lakhs.\n\nUp to 1899 several issues from local mints were still current in Gwalior. Besides various coins belonging to neighbouring States, such as the *S\u0101lim sh\u0101hi* of Part\u0101bgarh, the *Gajj\u0101 sh\u0101hi* of Jh\u0101nsi, and the *Dati\u0101* issues, these included the Gwalior rupee struck at Gwalior, the *Ch\u0101ndori* at Is\u0101garh, and the *Top sh\u0101hi* at Sheopur. The inconvenience of this multiplicity of currencies was accentuated by the procedure at the regular settlement of 1871, when 5 *parganas* were assessed in British currency, 20 in the Gwalior, 19 in the *Ch\u0101ndori*, and 3 in the *Top sh\u0101hi*. In 1893 the State mints were closed. By 1897, it was found possible to convert the *Gajj\u0101 sh\u0101hi* and the *Top sh\u0101hi* coins, and in 1898 the Gwalior and *Ch\u0101ndori* coins, which were called in. The British rupee and its fractional coins are now the only legal tender. The State still mints its own copper, which is of the same value as the British coin, and gold coins are struck for special purposes.\n\nThe Public Works department existed in the time of the late chief, when the Jai Bil\u0101s Palace in Lashkar was built, but was improved in 1886 under the Council of Regency, and various changes in its constitution have taken place since. At present it is divided into four sections, dealing respectively with irrigation, roads, buildings, and railways. The officer in charge of each section is independent, but all four are under the Sadr Board. The Victoria College and Memorial Hospital at Lashkar, the M\u0101dhava College and Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101\u2019s p\u0101lace at Ujjain, the Gwalior Light Railway, and the Ujjain water-works may be mentioned as the principal works undertaken within the last twenty years.\n\nThe chiefs of Gwalior have always given the greatest attention to their army, and a regular force was started by Mah\u0101dji in 1784, the history of which has been briefly referred to above. By the treaty of\n1817, Sindhia engaged to maintain a contingent force of 5,000 horse, which finally developed into the Gwalior Contingent, and mutinied in 1857 at Mor\u0101r. The existing regiments of Central India Horse still represent this force.\n\nThe State at present maintains three regiments of Imperial Service Cavalry, of 610 men each, armed with lance, carbine, and sword; two battalions of Imperial Service Infantry, of 996 men each, of all ranks; and a Transport Corps, having 300 carts, 725 ponies, and 548 men. The Transport Corps served in the Chitr\u0101l and Tir\u0101h Campaigns. Other troops include two batteries of horse artillery with 244 men, three bullock batteries with 322 men, one elephant battery with 189 men, and a total of 36 guns; and five battalions of infantry, numbering 8,532 combatants and 1,467 non-combatants. The irregulars who assist in police work consist of 5,613 men. The army is under the State commander-in-chief, with a staff.\n\nFor many years, no real distinction existed between the police and the army, a body of men being detailed for police work and called by various names. On the abolition of the system of farming villages in 1852, a regular chaukid\u0101ri force was introduced for village watch and ward. The police officers appointed at the same time received judicial powers, and were under the control of the superior district officials. In 1874 a regular police force was organized, and offences cognizable by the police were distinguished. The force, however, still continued to be a collection of district units, each controlled by the S\u016bbah. Finally in 1903 a system based on that followed in British India was introduced, the police being placed under an Inspector-General at head-quarters. There are now 13,236 men of all ranks in the force, giving one man to every two square miles, and to every 222 of the population. One police station has been opened in each pargana, with a certain number of outposts; and a certain number of military police, armed with rifles, are also posted to each pargana.\n\nThe State contains three Central jails, twelve district jails, and pargana lock-ups. They are under the control of a Superintendent at head-quarters. Carpets, rugs, cloth, and other articles are produced in the jails. The cost of maintaining a prisoner in 1902\u20133 was Rs. 23.\n\nIn 1854\u20135, during the ministry of Sir Dinkar Rao, some schools were established in the districts, and by 1857 the number of pupils throughout the State was 2,653. Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Jay\u0101ji Rao, on attaining his majority, paid great attention to the subject of education, and raised the annual expenditure from Rs. 9,200 to Rs. 17,500. A regular Educational department was formed under Sir Michael Filose, the present chief secretary, in 1863, and by 1891 there were 143 schools in the State. In 1895 an officer of the Indian Educational Service was appointed Inspector-General of education. At that time the\nState contained 183 schools, including 2 colleges with high schools attached, 16 Anglo-vernacular schools, and 170 village schools. The present Mah\u0101r\u0101ja has always shown a special interest in the spread of education among girls as well as among boys. The ordinary educational institutions in 1902\u20133 included two Arts colleges at Lashkar and Ujjain with high schools attached to them, a high school at Mor\u0101r, and 323 village schools. Besides these, many special schools have been opened, including a service school for training officials, a Sard\u0101rs' school and a Sard\u0101rs' daughters' school for the children of State Sard\u0101rs, a military school, and engineering and other special classes.\n\nGwalior stands fairly high as regards the literacy of its population, of whom 24 per cent. (4 males and 0.1 females) were able to read and write in 1901. The total number of pupils in 1902\u20133 was 3,050, of whom 850 were girls, and the total expenditure was 2.4 lakhs. English education is chiefly confined to the Br\u0101hmans, Mar\u0101th\u0101s, R\u0101jputs, Muhammadans, and Jains. The Gwalior Gazette, published weekly, is an official publication containing State orders and general news from other newspapers.\n\nA Medical department was first organized in 1887, and since that date hospitals and dispensaries have been opened in various parts of the State, with accommodation for 380 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 258,394, including 3,398 in-patients, and 11,413 operations were performed. A women's ward is attached to the Jay\u0101ji Rao Hospital at Lashkar, in connexion with which a class for midwifery is carried on. The total cost of the department in 1902\u20133 was 1.6 lakhs.\n\nVaccination is regularly carried out and has increased rapidly. In 1903 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 69,000, representing 23 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[J. Grant Duff: History of the Mahrattas, 3 vols. (1826).\u2014H. G.

It is bounded, except on the east and south-east, where it meets the borders of Dat\u012b\u0101 State, by other districts of Gwalior. The district, except for an outcrop of Vindhyan sandstone near Gwalior city, consists of a level alluvial plain. It is traversed by no rivers of any size, but the Sind flows along the eastern boundary. The population in 1901 was 323,693, giving a density of 246 persons per square mile. The district contains three towns, Lashkar (population, including the Brigade, 102,626),\nGwalior (16,807), and Mor\u0101r (10,179); and 614 villages. It is divided into three parganas, with head-quarters at Mastura, Pichhor, and Lashkar respectively. The land revenue is Rs. 5,25,000. At Antri, not far from the railway station, stands the tomb of Abul Fazl, the author of the Ain-i-Akbari, who was murdered near the spot by Bir Singh Deo of Orchh\u0101.\n\n**Gwalior City.\u2014**This name is commonly used by Europeans to describe the present capital of the Gwalior State, and is thus erroneously applied to two distinct areas. The northern town, which stands on the site of the ancient city of Gwalior, lies at the foot of the celebrated fort of the same name, while Lashkar, the real capital, is situated 2 miles to the south. The Gwalior station on the Midland section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway is one mile from Gwalior, two from Lashkar.\n\nThe population of both places at the three enumerations was: (1881) 88,066, (1891) 104,083, (1901) 119,433 (including Gwalior, Lashkar, and Brigade). Hindus formed 74 per cent. and Musalmans 23 per cent. Gwalior proper is a decaying town and only contained 16,807 inhabitants at the last Census. In the sixteenth century Gwalior was the chief town of one of the sarkars of the S\u016bbah of M\u0101lw\u0101. It was famous for stone-carving, an industry which still survives, the manufacture of glazed tiles and jewellery, now lost arts, and ironware made from metal smelted locally. Until the opening of the present Agra-Bombay high road, Gwalior was also important as being one of the principal stages on the great route from the Deccan which passed by Sironj, Narwar, Gwalior, and Dholpur to Agra.\n\nThe old city of Gwalior is now a desolate-looking collection of half-empty, dilapidated, flat-roofed stone houses, deserted mosques, and ruined tombs. As it stands, the town is entirely Muhammadan in character, no old Hindu remains being traceable. It has one good main street, and, in spite of its generally wretched appearance, contains several fine buildings. The J\u0101ma Masjid, built of red sandstone, is a good example of later Mughal style. The main building was erected in the time of Jah\u0101ngir (1605\u201327), a new end being added in 1665. The mosque of Kh\u0101ndola Kh\u0101n, his tomb and that of his son Naz\u012bri Kh\u0101n, as well as several other tombs, are noticeable for the excellent carved stone with which they are decorated, much of the pierced screen-work being of unusual beauty. To the east of the town stands the mausoleum of Muhammad Ghaus, a fine example of early Mughal architecture. It is built in the form of a square, with hexagonal towers at its corners surmounted by small domes. The body of the building is enclosed on all sides by carved stone lattices of elaborate and delicate design, the whole being surmounted by a large dome, which was originally covered with blue glazed tiles. Shaikh Muhammad Ghaus, whose body lies\nwithin, was a well-known personage in the sixteenth century. He was famous for his liberality, and also notorious among Muhammadans for his broad-minded views regarding infidels. He visited Akbar at Agra in 1558; but owing to the influence at court of a rival saint, he was ill received and in disgust retired into seclusion at Gwalior, where he died in 1562. Near to the tomb of Muhammad Ghaus is that of T\u0101n Sen, the most famous singer India has ever known. It is an open structure, supported by twelve outer pillars and four inner. Over the tomb formerly grew a tamarind, the leaves of which, when chewed, were popularly supposed to endow the partaker with a most melodious voice, and which were in consequence much sought after by dancing-girls. Just beyond the fort to the north stands a tall cusped Path\u0101n gateway. Nothing but the gate remains, a conspicuous object from a long distance.\n\nTwo miles south of the fort lies the city of Lashkar, the modern capital of Sindhia's dominions. The site was originally selected by Daulat Rao Sindhia in 1810 for his camp (lashkar), but the headquarters never moved and the standing camp gradually developed into a city. Lashkar is now a large city with a population of 89,154 persons, and has a considerable trade. On its outskirts stand the chief's palaces and other important buildings. During the Mutiny, Sindhia, deserted by his troops, was forced by T\u0101nti\u0101 Top\u012b and the R\u0101ni of Jh\u0101nsi to leave Lashkar and retire to Agra. He was reinstated in his capital soon after by Sir Hugh Rose (Lord Strathnairn), who attacked and defeated the mutineers.\n\nGwalior fort is one of the most famous in India, 'the pearl in the necklace of the castles of Hind,' as the author of the Taj-ul-Maasir put it. It stands on an isolated sandstone hill, which towers 300 feet above the old town, measuring 1\u00be miles long, and 2,800 feet across at its widest part. The walls above the scarp are about 30 feet high. As seen from the north-east its aspect is most imposing:\n\n'The long line of battlements which crown the steep scarp on the east is broken only by the lofty towers and fretted domes of the noble palace of R\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101n Singh. . . . At the northern end, where the rock has been quarried for ages, the jagged masses of the overhanging cliff seem ready to fall upon the city beneath them. . . . Midway over all towers the giant form of a massive temple, grey with the moss of ages.'\n\nThe fort has figured in Indian history since the sixth century, and may have been of importance long before then, as the date of its foundation is uncertain, while from the time of its capture by Kutb-ud-din in 1196 until 1858 it has been continuously the centre of war and tumult. Tradition assigns the foundation to one S\u016braj Sen, who was cured of leprosy by an ascetic named Gw\u0101lipa. The latter inhabited\nthe hill on which the fort now stands, and this was called Gwalior after him. In inscriptions relating to the fort, however, it is called Gopagiri, Gop\u0101dri, and Gop\u0101chala ('the shepherd's hill'), whence the modern Gw\u0101lher, Gw\u0101liar, and Gwalior.\n\nThe first historical holders of Gwalior were the Huna adventurers, Toram\u0101na and his son Mihirakula, who partially overthrew the Gupta power in the sixth century. An inscription belonging to this family has been found in the fort. In the ninth century it was in the hands of R\u0101j\u0101 Bhoj of Kanauj, whose record, dated 876, is on the Chaturbhuj rock-cut temple. The Kachw\u0101ha R\u0101jputs (see Jaipur State) were its possessors in the middle of the tenth century, and they appear to have continued to hold it either as independent rulers or as feudatories till about 1128, when they were ousted by the Parih\u0101rs. The latter held possession until 1196, when the fort was taken for Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad Ghori by Kutb-ud-d\u012bn Aibak. Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni had commenced an assault in 1021, but was bought off. In 1210, during the rule of Kutb-ud-d\u012bn's son, the Parih\u0101rs recovered it, and held possession until 1232, when it was captured by Altamsh after a severe siege lasting eleven months, and 700 prisoners were executed before the victor's tent. It remained a Mu\u1e25ammadan possession till 1398, but, in the disturbances caused by Tim\u016br's invasion, it was seized by the Tonwar R\u0101jputs. Though subjected to attacks in 1404, 1416, and 1429, the Tonwars managed to retain their hold till 1518, when the fort was surrendered to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Lodi.\n\nDuring the period of Tonwar rule, Gwalior rose to great eminence, especially in the long reign of R\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101n Singh (1486\u20131517). It was in his time that the magnificent palace with its great gate, which crowns the eastern face of the rock, was built; while under the direction of his favourite G\u016bjari queen, Mrignain\u0101, 'the fawn-eyed,' Gwalior became pre-eminent as the home of music, whence all the finest musicians of India came for long after. Out of 36 singers and players enumerated in the Ain-i-Akbari, 15 had learned in the Gwalior school, including the famous T\u0101n Sen. In 1526 the fort was taken by B\u0101bar. In 1542 it fell to Sher Sh\u0101h S\u016br\u012b, with whom it became a favourite resort, the remaining rulers of his dynasty practically making it the capital of their dominions. It passed to Akbar in 1558, and remained a Mughal possession until the eighteenth century. During its possession by the Mu\u1e25ammadans it was used as a state prison, the cells for political prisoners, now called the Nauchauki, still existing near the Dhonda gate, to the west of the fort. Many members of the Delhi ruling house of the day have entered the fort, few ever to leave it. Political prisoners were disposed of by being made to drink a decoction of crushed poppy-heads, which produced insanity and finally death.\n\nIn the confusion which followed on the battle of Panipat in 1761,\nLokendra Singh, the Jat chief of Gohad, obtained possession of the fort, but was driven out by Sindhia soon after. During the Maratha War it was captured in 1780 by Major Popham's brigade, a surprise assault being made by a party led by Captain Bruce, brother to the well-known traveller, who was guided up the rock by a dacoit. The spot where the escalade took place is to the west of the fort near the Urw\u0101h\u012b Gate, and is still called the Faringi Pah\u0101r, or 'white man's ascent.' The fort was then handed back to the R\u0101n\u0101 of Gohad, but was retaken by Sindhia in 1784. During the troubles with Sindhia in the beginning of the nineteenth century, the fort was taken by General White in 1804, but was again made over to Sindhia in the following year. After the disturbances which ended in the battles of Mah\u0101r\u0101jpur and Panniar in 1843, the fort was garrisoned by the Gwalior Contingent under British officers, which had been raised in accordance with the treaty of 1844, and it continued in their charge till they rebelled in 1857. On June 19, 1858, it was taken by assault by a party of Sir Hugh Rose's force under Lieutenants Waller and Rose, the latter of whom fell in the great gateway. It was then held by a detachment of the British garrison at Mor\u0101 until 1886, when it was made over to Sindhia in exchange for Jh\u0101nsi.\n\nThe fort contains many objects of historical and antiquarian interest. The main entrance is on the eastern side, where a long ramp, affording an ever-extending view over the plains below, leads up through six gates to the summit of the rock. Of these gates, three are worthy of special note: the lowest gate, built in Muhammadan style and known as the Alamgiri Darw\u0101za, erected in 1660; the gate next above it, called the B\u0101dalg\u0101r Pol, in Hindu style of the fifteenth century; and the H\u0101thi Pol, of the same style and period, at the summit. Just beyond the fourth or Ganesh Gate is a small mosque which was built by a Musalman governor, on the site of the original shrine erected by Suraj Sen to Gw\u0101lipa, the tutelary saint of the hill. Near the next or Lakshman Gate is a small rock-cut temple in ninth-century style, hewn out of the hill-side. It is dedicated to Chaturbhuj, the four-armed Vishnu, and bears near it an inscription of R\u0101j\u0101 Bhoj of Kanauj, dated 876, in which he is termed Gopagiri Sw\u0101mi or 'lord of Gwalior.'\n\nThere are six palaces in the fort, four Hindu and two Muhammadan. Between the Lakshman and H\u0101thi Pol gates, one passes along the magnificent fa\u00e7ade of M\u0101n Singh's palace\u2014a wall of hewn sandstone blocks, 300 feet long and 100 high, relieved along the top by an ornamental frieze of coloured tiles, and at intervals along the front by massive round towers crowned with graceful domes and connected together by a balustrade of delicately fretted stonework. The palace is a two-storeyed building 300 feet long by 160 broad, with two extra storeys of underground rooms for use in hot weather on its eastern face.\nThe rooms and courtyards of this palace are richly carved, and were profusely ornamented with coloured tiles, of which a few still remain. The emperor B\u0101bar, who visited the place in 1529, about twenty years after its completion, has left a graphic account of its appearance. He notes that the palaces are singularly beautiful, but built without regular plan, and states that the fa\u00e7ade was then covered with white stucco, and the domes plated with copper. The G\u016bj\u0101r\u012b Mahal, situated at the south-east corner of the fort, has a noble quadrangle full of fine sculpture and mouldings, and some admirable windows. It was built by R\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101n Singh for his favourite queen Mrignain\u0101. Just outside the palace is a small cemetery containing the graves of Europeans who have died in the fort. The remaining Hindu palaces are of less interest, while the two Muhammadan edifices are poor, being built only of rubble and plaster.\n\nMany temples and shrines still stand in the fort, of which three are of special importance. Two are situated close together upon the eastern rampart, and are known to natives as the Greater and Lesser S\u0101s-b\u0101hu. They are, as a rule, erroneously called Jain by Europeans. Both must have been very beautiful examples of eleventh-century work. They are built on the same plan, that of a cross, and are richly ornamented with sculpture. The larger one bears an inscription which mentions its foundation in 1092, and its completion in the following year by Mahip\u0101la, the Kachw\u0101ha chief of Gwalior. The dedicatory verses show that the temple was sacred to Hari (Vishnu), which is what the sculpture would lead one to expect. The smaller temple must have been built about the same time, and was also dedicated to Vishnu. The third temple of importance is that now called the Teli Mandir, or \u2018oilman\u2019s temple.\u2019 It is the loftiest building in the fort, being 110 feet high, and is distinguished by its roof from other temples in Northern India. The lower portion of the building is decidedly Northern in style, while the roof is of the wagon type met with at Mah\u0101balipur and other places in the Madras Presidency. It was at first a Vaishnava temple, as the flying figures of Garuda over the lintel of the original door and on the side faces show. Later on, in the fifteenth century, when it was converted to Saiva uses, a second and smaller door was erected inside the other, which bears a figure of \u015aiva\u2019s son, the elephant-headed god Ganesh, upon it. The building dates from the tenth or eleventh century.\n\nThe fort contains one small Jain temple to P\u0101rasn\u0101th, and the remains of another Jain temple, both of the twelfth century, but of no great interest. The only really important Jain remains are the five great collections of figures carved on the face of the rock itself, which were all executed between 1440 and 1473 during the sway of the Tonwar dynasty. Some of the figures are colossal, one in the group\nnear the Urw\u0101hi Gate being 57 feet high. B\u0101bar notices this figure and adds that he ordered all of them to be destroyed; but, as a matter of fact, only some of those most easily reached were partially mutilated.\n\nA large number of tanks have been made in the fort, some of which are said never to fail in their supply\u2014an important factor in the old days of long sieges, which, as Tavernier remarks, gave Gwalior the first place among the fortresses of India. The oldest tank is the S\u016braj Kund, or 'tank of the sun,' where a temple formerly stood. At the northern end is the Joh\u0101r tank, where the R\u0101jputs sacrificed their women and children to save them from capture when the fort was taken by Altamsh in 1232.\n\n[A.
