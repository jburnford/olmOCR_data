A survey of a portion of the East Coast was also supplied by Capt. H. CARR, of H. M. S. Orion, which will form a valuable addition to the Map. All these surveys have now been worked up by a draughtsman, whose services for this purpose were kindly lent by the Survey Department, and the work of compilation may be expected to be complete before the end of February. It is hoped that any members who are in a position to supply further information will do so at once, so that it may be embodied in the Map before it is sent home for publication.\n\nThe Council desire to express their best thanks to all those who have contributed the results of their valuable labours towards this most useful work, thereby rendering it possible, after a lapse of only two-and-a-half years since the last edition was published, to bring out a new edition of the Map, containing a large amount of fresh information in regard to localities which have hitherto remained practically unexplored.\n\nNo. 19 of the Journal was published last year, and No. 20 has just been produced. The Council much regret that, owing to unfortunate circumstances, the publication of the Journal has somewhat fallen behind. The Journal published last year (No. 19) bears the date 1887, but as it was not brought out till 1889, it will thus be seen that we are two years in arrears. The Council have thought it best, therefore,\nto omit the year 1888 altogether, and to let the present Journal (No. 20) bear the date 1889.\n\nThe Honorary Treasurer's Statement of the financial position of the Society is appended, and shows a state in this respect more satisfactory than in any previous year. There is a balance to credit of $787.95, and all liabilities have been cleared off, with the exception of the cost of the publication of the present Journal.\n\nMr. Stanford's account for lithographing the Map has been settled in full, and a balance of 25 copies still remains in his hands for sale, which may be expected to realize about \u00a310 6s. 7d.\n\nThrough the liberality of the Straits Government, a sum of $500 has again been placed on the Estimates to assist in defraying the expenses of the new edition of the Map of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nA.

For this purpose, I have here collected all the information I could, both by personal observation of the habits of these animals, and by enquiries of the several planters whose estates have been much affected, and by reference also to published notes in The Tropical Agriculturist, and in a paper published by authority of the Straits Settlements Government and written by Dr. Simon, together with the correspondence on the subject between the various planters and certain Government Officials.\n\nThe Species of Beetles.\u2014The two species of beetle which attack palms here are quite different in appearance and habits and in their method of destruction, although they are usually found together, and must be treated of separately. One is Oryctes rhinoceros, commonly known as the rhinoceros, elephant or black beetle, belonging to the group of Lamellicornia. The other is Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, known as the red beetle\u2014it is a large species of weevil. Two other larger species of Calandra occur in the island, both of which prey on some species of palm, but I have not received any notice of their attacking coco-nuts.\n\nOryctes rhinoceros.\u2014This beetle belongs to the group of Lamellicornia, the larvae of which live in decaying vegetable\nmatter. In the case of this species, the parent beetle deposits its eggs in the decaying stems of coco-nut trees, whether still erect or fallen to the ground. So abundant are they, that I have found as many as forty larvae, nearly all full grown, in about three feet of a rotten palm-stem. But besides this habitat, it is also stated that the larvae occur in manure pits, cow dung, tan bark, crushed sugar-canes, and other vegetable remains, and also in mangrove mud; and I have received grubs taken from piles of cow dung and from leaf mould, made by accumulating grass leaves, &c., in a pit, which were quite indistinguishable from those taken from rotten palms. Their existence in mangrove mud seems to me incredible, as it appears highly unsuited for them. I have been unable to get grubs taken from mud, and certainly palms growing near mangrove swamps are not more liable to attack than if they were growing in drier soil. The identification of larvae of this group is very difficult, and can only be undertaken by an entomologist, as all the grubs of the larger Lamellicorn beetles are very similar, and there are a number of harmless, and even useful, species of this group in Singapore. I have attempted to rear the grubs, but without success, as they invariably die in confinement in a few days.\n\nDescription of the Grub.\u2014The larva is a fleshy white grub from two and a half to three inches long when full grown. The head is rounded, broad, hard and of a dark chestnut brown colour, and behind it on the next segment is an angular patch of chitine on each side. The body is swollen at the tail, so that the grub can only lie upon its side, as is usual in this class of larvae. It is covered with short, scattered bristles, most numerous along the sides just below the spiracles. The legs are about half an inch in length, weak, but chitinous, and covered with bristles. The short antennae are quite hairless, and the jaws are thick and powerful, black with a single tooth below the sharp cutting point.\n\nDescription of the Beetle.\u2014The grub passes into the chrysalis state in the tree or the rubbish in which it has spent its life, merely making an oval nest in the rotten wood in which to dose. The chrysalis is large and fleshy, soft and white,\nand has the form of the perfect insect. It appears to remain but a short time in this state, for chrysalids are very rarely found. Hatched in the tree, it soon makes its way out, and eventually flies off to commence its work of destruction. The beetle varies a good deal in size, but is easily recognised. Large specimens are nearly 2\u00bd inches in length and very broad, of a dark brown or black colour, the cutinous coat being exceedingly hard. The head in the male is small and provided with a blunt horn curved over towards the back, half an inch long. The thorax is about an inch long and three quarters of an inch broad, very hard and solid; it is smooth, and scooped out in front, so that it slopes towards the head. The back edge of this depression is notched, and there are two small semicircular depressions on either side of the large one. The wing cases do not cover the body completely; they are broad and oblong and raised over the back, smooth and shining, but dotted all over with minute punctures. The under side of the body is red-brown, mostly hairless, but the mouth and all the face in front of the horn is covered with red hairs. The legs are strong and stout, the second joint being armed with sharp teeth, with the aid of which the beetle can tear its way into the tree. The female insect can be distinguished by its very short horn, not a quarter of an inch long, and by the much smaller depression in the thorax, which is not notched at the back, as it is in the male, than which, too, it is usually smaller. The insects fly briskly at dusk, rather high in the air, attacking the palm trees at night.\n\nDestruction of Trees.\u2014The grub of this insect is quite harmless, and indeed rather beneficial than otherwise, as it assists to convert rotting wood and other vegetable refuse into soil. It is the perfect insect that is so destructive. Its method of attack is as follows. It flies by night to a palm, and makes its way to the base of a leaf-stalk, and burrows into the heart of the cabbage, making a large hole, from which projects a quantity of the fibre of the tree resembling tow. The appearance of a tuft of this is evidence that the beetle has been at work. It remains in the hole usually all the next day and may be captured in the burrow. It nibbles\nin so deeply, that, not rarely, it bites through the growing point in the cabbage, or bud of the palm. More often, the attack is repeated till the rain getting into the burrows sets up decay, which rots the palm through. In either case the tree speedily dies. A tree once attacked seems to be very popular, and I have known palms from which two or three beetles a day could be taken regularly, in spite of all attempts to drive them away by the aid of carbolic acid, salt and other substances.\n\nThe following species of palm, besides the coco-nut, have been attacked, and some destroyed, in the Botanic Gardens.\u2014Cocos plumosa, Martinezia caryotefolia, Corypha gebanga, Phoenix dactylifera, Livistona chinensis, Verschaffeltia splendida, Areca rubia, Hyophorbe amaricaulis, Elaeis guineensis, Sabalum brasiliensis, Borassus flabelliformis, and several others, but the Betel nut (Areca catechu), the Gomuti (Arenga saccharifera), the Sago palm (Sagus Rumphii), and the slender-stemmed palms seem never to be attacked. I once found a beetle in the act of gnawing through the leaf stalk of a species of Cycad, mistaking it evidently for a palm-tree. It appears that the object of the beetle in thus attacking the trees is to drink the sweet sap in the bud of the palm.\n\nIt is very easy to distinguish trees that have been attacked by this beetle by the peculiar ragged appearance of the leaves. The beetle in burrowing into the bud, often bites straight through the folded leaf in the cabbage, so that when it is unfolded the top is found to be bitten symmetrically off, or each leaflet is perforated regularly. By these appearances, it is easy to tell whether a tree has been attacked or not, and so to judge of the state of the plantation.\n\nI observe that the trees most liable to attack are those in the neighbourhoods of towns. Small isolated patches round the Malay villages in the interior of the island are usually quite free from the attacks, even though the plantations are near mangrove swamps. It has been said that in this position the trees always suffer, and that the grubs are bred in mangrove mud. This is erroneous. I have seen many plantations near mangrove swamps without any trace of damage from beetles.\nand it is exceedingly improbable that the grubs are able to live in mangrove mud. When a plantation is abandoned or neglected, as soon as one or two trees die, the beetles come to attack and lay their eggs in the decaying stumps. From one tree they fly to another, and soon the whole plantation is in a dying state, and if there be any other estates near at hand, the beetle goes on to them, and will do a great deal of damage.\n\nIt would be easy enough in a clean kept estate to keep down the beetles, but where there is an endless supply of them in an adjoining estate, the matter is of great difficulty, and the destruction is something remarkable. A rotten cocoanut tree lasts a very long time in a state of decay, and over a thousand beetles could be bred from one before it was quite destroyed. Not only do the grubs live in the erect and fallen stems, but the butts left in the ground are often full of them, and I have even seen them in the timber of little bridges made of two or three pieces of cocoanut stems laid across a ditch in a plantation.\n\nOther timber they do not attack, as it does not decay into the powdery, soft mass that they require for the grub to live in.\n\nMethods of Destruction \u2014 The usual method of destruction of this insect in the trees, is to employ men to examine the bases of the leaf stalks of the palms frequently, and to search for the beetles. They are provided with a flexible iron or copper wire terminated by a barb, with which the beetle is speared in its burrow and drawn out. A tree once attacked should be frequently examined, as it is more liable to future attacks than those which have never been attacked. So long as the beetle is killed by the spear, there is no real need to extract it; in fact it is, to a certain extent, advantageous to leave its remains in the hole, as no beetles will again enter the hole while the dead one is there. In any case, it is advisable to plug the holes with bits of rag or tufts of fibre dipped in weak carbolic acid, as this will deter beetles. Many planters affirm that putting salt in the crown of the tree will keep away beetles. I have not found this remarkably successful. Probably the salt is indirectly beneficial by being washed\ndown to the roots by the rains, and there absorbed, and as anything that improves the health of a tree enables it also to resist and recover from the attacks of insects, the manuring by salt in this manner is of advantage indirectly against the pest. Kerosine and phenyl may also be used in place of carbolic acid, but they are less effective.\n\nAnother method of destruction consists in making large fires of the fallen leaves and husks in the plantations at night. The brilliant light of the fires attracts the beetles, which are beaten into the fires by men and boys armed with branches of trees.\n\nPlan for Extermination.\u2014Although it is obvious that there will always be sufficient food in the form of decaying vegetable matter to supply the needs of the beetle, so that it is really impossible to exterminate it, its numbers can be very greatly reduced by destroying in and near plantations all rubbish, leaves, husks and other vegetable refuse, or at least not allowing piles of it to accumulate. All dead trees should be cut into small pieces and burnt. And whereas it is absolutely useless for any cultivator to keep his plantations clear of rubbish in which beetles may breed, while his neighbour has so neglected his trees that they become merely nests of beetles, it should be made compulsory on every cultivator of coco-nuts, to however small an extent, to destroy by fire all dead trees on his grounds; nor should he be permitted even to utilize them as bridges or posts in the plantations.\n\nRhynchophorus ferrugineus, the Red Beetle.\u2014This is almost more destructive than the preceding kind, and attacks the palms in quite a different method. It is here not the perfect insect, but the grub that does the injuries.\n\nLike the black beetle, the red weevil is nocturnal in its habits, flying at night to deposit its eggs in the coco-nut trees. Possessed of a remarkably long ovipositor, it finds its way to the base of the leaf-stalk of the palm, and pushes the egg as deeply into the body of the tree as it can. It frequently makes use of the holes made by the elephant beetle, and can often be extracted thence by the beetle-spear. The egg on hatching produces a white footless grub, entirely different in\nappearance to that of the elephant beetle. It burrows tunnels through the soft growing portion of the palm, and when full grown nibbles its way to the surface, and forming an egg-shaped cocoon becomes a chrysalis, and eventually hatches out into the perfect insect. Some persons affirm that the beetle lays its eggs in the base of the tree, and that the grubs then burrow upwards. I have seen no case of this, nor have I ever seen the beetle at the foot of the tree, unless the palm happened to be stemless. In all the trees affected by the red beetle, that I have cut up, I found grubs only in the soft pithy wood at the base of the cabbage, and here they were sometimes thickly crowded together. I have certainly seen burrows made by some insect in the old stems of the coco palm, but I do not believe that they were the work of this animal, but, probably of some Longicorn beetle, several species of which occur here, and the grubs of which eat hard wood.\n\nLike the elephant beetle, this species attacks also other palms besides the coco-nut. Many of those mentioned as attacked by the former in the Botanic Gardens having also been attacked by the latter.\n\nIt is by no means so easy to find out when a palm is attacked by this insect, as it is in the case of the preceding. It works entirely inside the tree, and makes little or no external marks. By listening at the side of the tree the grub can be heard gnawing the wood. But usually the withering and fall of the central shoot is the first sign that anything is wrong. In some cases a tree exudes a shiny liquid having an unpleasant sour smell, which is a sign of serious damage.\n\nDescription of the Grub.\u2014The grub is a thick, fleshy, cylindrical, opaque white larva, with no feet or antenn\u00e6, quite hairless, except for some scattered hairs on the head and also a few on the tail. The head is small in proportion to the body, oblong and black, with small jaws. The segment next to the head is horny, but softer and paler than the head, with some subtriangular darker patches on either side. The body is curved and wrinkled, and almost equally thick without. The tail ends in a flat, squared process, with a few tubercles on which there are hairs. The grub lives in the burrows which it\nmakes, and which are full of slimy sap exuded from the injured wood. It moves about by the aid of its thickened segments, and usually burrows transversely through the tree. When full grown it attains a length of a little over two inches.\n\nThe Perfect Insect.\u2014The perfect insect varies a good deal in size and colouring. Usually about two inches in length, but often not more than one and a half from the tip of the snout to the end of the tail. Like all weevils, it possesses a long curved snout, which is blunt at the tip, and in the male ornamented with a kind of brush of reddish hairs. The head is very small, and usually more or less red.\n\nThe thorax broadest behind and narrowed in front is black, with a broad red band in the centre, smooth and polished. The wing cases are black, sometimes ornamented with red, grooved longitudinally, and squared and blunt at the ends, a good deal shorter than the body. The tail is black, edged with reddish fur beneath. The legs are strong, rather long, black, with a strong claw on the end of the second joint, besides the two small ones on the feet. The antennae are a little shorter than the snout, abruptly bent in the middle, and ending in a club.\n\nIt is the smallest of the palm-weevils here, and is easily known by the colouring. It flies at night, but is rarely seen on the wing.\n\nMethod of Destruction and Prevention.\u2014This insect, as has been stated above, is a much more difficult one to deal with, but several of the methods in use for the former species will be equally effective with the latter. The insects, both male and female, may often be found at the base of the leaves, and can be extracted with the beetle-spear before the eggs are laid. They may also be destroyed by fires, as in the case of the black beetle.\n\nSome planters have recommended cutting away the fibrous sheath which surrounds the young stem of the palm, and, as they say, trimming and cleaning the palm. But the result is attended with a certain amount of danger. For there is great risk that the trimmer will accidentally wound the tree with his knife, and the beetle is quick to take advantage of this and\nto deposit its eggs in the cut. I quote from *All About the Coco-nut Palm* by Messrs. Ferguson of Colombo, p. 12.\n\n\"Scores of instances might be recorded where, till the trees were come into bearing, a red beetle was never seen, but no sooner was the land cleared and the trees trimmed than it made its appearance and became very destructive. On one property, the trimming system had been carried on for years, till indeed more than one-third of the original plants perished before the estate was ten years old, and they were going at the rate of three trees weekly. The work of trimming was stopped for the reason offered above; the loss of trees continued for some time afterwards, but at the end of six months it had entirely ceased.\"\n\nThe cutting of notches by climbers in the trunk of the trees has been said to be injurious, under the impression that the red beetle may deposit its eggs in the notches, but, as previously stated, it does not attack old wood, that being too hard for the grub, and besides were it to deposit its eggs on the trunk of the tree, it would be exposed to the attacks of birds and bats during the operation. It certainly, however, does take advantage of the holes made by the elephant beetle and it is very common to find both kinds of beetle in the same holes. It is very probable that the extermination of the black beetle will greatly reduce the number of the red one, by preventing their getting into the heart of the tree by means of the burrows of the black beetle.\n\nMany planters are of opinion that a tree once attacked by the red beetle should be immediately destroyed, on the grounds that the tree is doomed and the grubs in the tree can then be killed. But a very considerable proportion of the trees attacked recover. Unless one or more of the grubs bores through the growing point at the base of the cabbage, or sets up decay in the heart of it the palm has a very good chance of recovery. At the same time, a tree once attacked is usually liable to further attacks from both kinds of beetles, and unless it is really a valuable tree, it is perhaps hardly worth attempting to save it. It is hardly necessary to state that when the central bud is destroyed, the palm cannot re-\ncover, and is practically dead. In this case, it should be destroyed at once, and the top cut out in order to find the grubs before they escape as beetles. Cutting the grubs out has been tried by several planters, and spearing them through the stem would be equally effective, but the results seem hardly to be worth the trouble. The grub when detected is usually at least half grown, and then deep within the tree, so that the tree has to be very deeply cut into to get at it, and probably this would set up internal decay.\n\nSummary. It is quite clear that, although it would be impossible to absolutely exterminate every beetle in the place, it will be possible to so far reduce their numbers that the damage done by them is infinitesimal. The large planters may be trusted to keep their plantations clean of any rubbish in which the black beetle may be propagated, and to destroy all dead and decaying palms on the estate, but that will avail little if other persons are permitted to leave dead trees, and piles of tan bark, manure heaps, rotten sugar-cane, &c., in the vicinity of the coco-nut estates, where the elephant beetle may be bred in large numbers. The small cultivator, to whom the loss of a few coco-nut trees is of little importance, should not be permitted to let them get into such a state that they are a source of danger to those of others.\n\nIt should be made compulsory upon every person owning coco-nut trees to cut down and burn all palm-trees that are dead upon the ground at once, nor should he be permitted to stack or store the stems in such manner that they can rot upon the ground, nor to use them for bridges or posts.\n\nIt should also be prohibited to owners of tan-works, sugar-factories, or other persons in whose trade large masses of vegetable debris form a by-product, to permit this refuse to accumulate in such a manner that it threatens the safety of any estate of coco-nuts. As the beetles do not, as a rule, fly to any very great distance, there are spots in which such accumulations would be absolutely harmless, being too far distant from any coco-nuts to send beetles to them, and as in some professions the destruction of such waste might be found very expensive, and perhaps injurious to trade, it might\nperhaps be preferable to merely indict any persons owning such refuse as having a nuisance on his property, should it be shown that any of his neighbours' coco-nut trees were suffering from the ravages of elephant beetles; and should grubs be found in the deposit he should then be compelled to destroy it.\n\nIf these steps are taken, I believe that the injury to the trees caused by the beetle will be mitigated to a very large extent, and the pest almost eradicated.\n\nHENRY N.

In November, 1881, two hundred and\neleven years after the Hudson's Bay Charter, and twelve years after the date of Mr. Forsyth's article, Queen Victoria granted a Charter of Incorporation to the British North Borneo Company, which, by confirming the grants and concessions acquired from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, constitutes the Company the sovereign ruler over a territory of 31,000 square miles, and, as the permission to trade, included in the Charter, has not been taken advantage of, the British North Borneo Company now does actually exist \"as a Territorial Power\" and not \"as a Trading Company.\"\n\nNot only this, but the example has been followed by Prince Bismarck, and German Companies, on similar lines, have been incorporated by their Government on both coasts of Africa and in the Pacific, and another British Company, to operate on the Niger River Districts, came into existence by Royal Charter in July, 1886.\n\nIt used to be by no means an unusual thing to find an educated person ignorant not only of Borneo's position on the map, but almost of the very existence of the island which, regarding Australia as a continent, and yielding to the claims recently set up by New Guinea, is the second largest island in the world, within whose limits could be comfortably packed England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, with a sea of dense jungle around them, as Wallace has pointed out. Every school-board child now, however, knows better than this.\n\nThough Friar Odoric is said to have visited it about 1325, and Ludovico Berthelma, of Bologna, between 1503 and 1507, the existence of this great island, variously estimated to be from 263,000 to 300,000 square miles in extent, did not become generally known to Europeans until, in 1518, the Portuguese Lorenzo de Gomez touched at the city of Brunei. He was followed in 1521 by the Spanish expedition, which under the leadership of the celebrated Portuguese circumnavigator Magellan, had discovered the Philippines, where, on the island of Mactan, their leader was killed in April, 1521. An account of the voyage was written by Pigafetta, an Italian volunteer in the expedition, who accompanied the fleet to Brunei after Magellan's death, and published a glowing\naccount of its wealth and the brilliancy of its Court, with its royally caparisoned elephants a report which it is very difficult to reconcile with the present squalid condition of the existing \"Venice of Hovels,\" as it has been styled from its palaces and houses being all built in, or rather over, the river to which it owes its name.\n\nThe Spaniards found at Brunei Chinese manufactures and Chinese trading junks, and were so impressed with the importance of the place that they gave the name of Borneo\u2014a corruption of the native name Brunei\u2014to the whole island, though the inhabitants themselves know no such general title for their country.\n\nIn some works, Pulau Kalamantan, which would signify wild mangoes island, is given as the native name for Borneo, but it is quite unknown, at any rate throughout North Borneo, and the island is by no means distinguished by any profusion of wild mangoes.*\n\nIn 1573, a Spanish Embassy to Brunei met with no very favourable reception, and three years later an expedition from Manila attacked the place and, deposing a usurping Sultan, re-instated his brother on the throne, who, to show his gratitude, declared his kingdom tributary to Spain.\n\nThe Portuguese Governor of the Moluccas, in 1526, claimed the honour of being the first discoverer of Borneo and this nation appears to have carried on trade with some parts of the island till they were driven out of their Colonies by the Dutch in 1609. But neither the Portuguese nor the Spaniards seem to have made any decided attempt to gain a footing in Borneo, and it is not until the early part of the 17th century that we find the two great rivals in the eastern seas\u2014the English and the Dutch East India Trading Companies\u2014turning their attention to the island. The first Dutchman to visit Borneo was Oliver van Noort, who anchored at Brunei in December, 1600, but though the Sultan was friendly, the natives made an attempt to seize his ship, and he sailed the following month, having come to the conclusion that the city was a nest of rogues.\n\n* The explanation Sago Island has been given, lamantah being the native term for the raw sago sold to the factories.\nThe first English connection with Borneo was in 1609, when trade was opened with Sukadana, diamonds being said to form the principal portion of it.\n\nThe East India Company, in 1702, established a Factory at Banjermassin, on the South Coast, but were expelled by the natives in 1706. Their rivals, the Dutch, also established Trading Stations on the South and South-West Coasts.\n\nIn 1761, the East India Company concluded a treaty with the Sultan of Sulu, and in the following year an English Fleet, under Admiral Drake and Sir William Draper, captured Manila, the capital of the Spanish Colony of the Philippines. They found in confinement there a Sultan of Sulu who, in gratitude for his release, ceded to the Company, on the 12th September, 1762, the island of Balambangan, and in January of the following year Mr. Dalrymple was deputed to take possession of it and hoist the British flag. Towards the close of 1763, the Sultan of Sulu added to his cession the northern portion of Borneo and the southern half of Palawan, together with all the intermediate islands. Against all these cessions the Spanish entered their protest, as they claimed the suzerainty over the Sulu Archipelago and the Sulu Dependencies in Borneo and the islands. This claim the Spaniards always persisted in, until, on the 7th March, 1885, a Protocol was entered into by England and Germany and Spain, whereby Spanish supremacy over the Sulu Archipelago was recognised on condition of their abandoning all claim to the portions of Northern Borneo which are now included in the British North Borneo Company's concessions.\n\nIn November, 1768, the Court of Directors in London, with the approval of Her Majesty's Ministers, who promised to afford protection to the new Colony, issued orders to the authorities at Bombay for the establishment of a settlement at Balambangan with the intention of diverting to it the China trade, of drawing to it the produce of the adjoining countries, and of opening a port for the introduction of spices, etc., by the Bugis, and for the sale of Indian commodities. The actual date of the foundation of the settlement is not known, but Mr. F. C. Danvers states that in 1771 the Court ordered that\nthe Government should be vested in \"a chief and two other persons of Council,\" and that the earliest proceedings extant are dated Sulu, 1773, and relate to a brawl in the streets between Mr. Alcock, the second in the Council, and the Surgeon of the Britannia.\n\nThis was a somewhat unpropitious commencement, and in 1774 the Court are found writing to Madras, to which Balambangan was subordinate, complaining of the \"unprudent management and profuse conduct\" of the Chief and Council.\n\nIn February, 1775, Sulu pirates surprised the stockade, and drove out the settlers, capturing booty valued at about a million dollars. The Company's officials then proceeded to the island of Labuan, now a British Crown Colony, and established a factory, which was maintained but for a short time, at Brunei itself. In 1803 Balambangan was again occupied, but as no commercial advantage accrued, it was abandoned in the following year, and so ended all attempts on the part of the East India Company to establish a Colony in Borneo.\n\nWhile at Balambangan, the officers, in 1774, entered into negotiations with the Sultan of Brunei, and, on undertaking to protect him against Sulu and Mindanau pirates, acquired the exclusive trade in all the pepper grown in his country.\n\nThe settlement of Singapore, the present capital of the Straits Settlements, by Sir Stamford Raffles, under the orders of the East India Company in 1819, again drew attention to Borneo, for that judiciously selected and free port soon attracted to itself the trade of the Celebes, Borneo and the surrounding countries, which was brought to it by numerous fleets of small native boats. These fleets were constantly harassed and attacked and their crews carried off into slavery by the Balinini, Illanun, and Dyak pirates infesting the Borneo and Celebes coasts, and the interference of the British Cruisers was urgently called for and at length granted, and was followed, in the natural course of events, by political intervention, resulting in the brilliant and exciting episode whereby the modern successor of the olden heroes Sir James Brooke obtained for his family, in 1840, the kingdom of Sarawak, on the west coast of the island,\nwhich he in time purged of its two plague spots\u2014head-hunting on shore, and piracy and slave-dealing afloat\u2014and left to his heir, who has worthily taken up and carried on his work, the unique inheritance of a settled Eastern Kingdom, inhabited by the once dreaded head-hunting Dyaks and piratical Mahomedan Malays, the government of whom now rests absolutely in the hands of its one paternally despotic white ruler, or Raja Sarawak, although not yet formally proclaimed a British Protectorate,* may thus be deemed the first permanent British possession in Borneo. Sir James Brooke was also employed by the British Government to conclude, on 27th May, 1847, a treaty with the Sultan of Brunei, whereby the cession to us of the small island of Labuan, which had been occupied as a British Colony in December, 1846, was confirmed, and the Sultan engaged that no territorial cession of any portion of his country should ever be made to any Foreign Power without the sanction of Great Britain.\n\nThese proceedings naturally excited some little feeling of jealousy in our Colonial neighbours\u2014the Dutch\u2014who ineffectually protested against a British subject becoming the ruler of Sarawak, as a breach of the tenor of the treaty of London of 1824, and they took steps to define more accurately the boundaries of their own dependencies in such other parts of Borneo as were still open to them. What we now call British North Borneo, they appear at that time to have regarded as outside the sphere of their influence, recognising the Spanish claim to it through their suzerainty, already alluded to, over the Sulu Sultan.\n\nWith this exception, and that of the Brunei Sultanate, already secured by the British Treaty, and Sarawak, now the property of the Brooke family, the Dutch have acquired a nominal suzerainty over the whole of the rest of Borneo, by treaties with the independent rulers\u2014an area comprising about two-thirds of the whole island, probably not a tenth part of which is under their actual direct administrative control.\n\n* A British Protectorate was established over North Borneo on the 12th May, over Sarawak on the 14th June and over Brunei on the 17th September 1888. Vide Appendix.\nThey appear to have been so pre-occupied with the affairs of their important Colony of Java and its dependencies, and the prolonged, exhausting and ruinously expensive war with the Achinese in Sumatra, that beyond posting Government Residents at some of the more important points, they have hitherto done nothing to attract European capital and enterprise to Borneo, but it would now seem that the example set by the British Company in the North is having its effect, and I hear of a Tobacco Planting Company and of a Coal Company being formed to operate on the East Coast of Dutch Borneo.\n\nThe Spanish claim to North Borneo was a purely theoretical one, and not only their claim, but that also of the Sulus through whom they claimed, was vigorously disputed by the Sultans of Brunei, who denied that, as asserted by the Sulus, any portion of Borneo had been ceded to them by a former Sultan of Brunei, who had by their help defeated rival claimants and been seated on the throne. The Sulus, on their side, would own no allegiance to the Spaniards, with whom they had been more or less at war for almost three centuries, and their actual hold over any portion of North Borneo was of the slightest. Matters were in this position when Mr. Alfred Dent, now Sir Alfred Dent, K.C.M.G., fitted out an expedition, and in December, 1877, and January, 1878, obtained from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, in the manner hereafter detailed, the sovereign control over the North portion of Borneo, from the Kinabalu river on the West to the Sibokou river on the East, concessions which were confirmed by Her Majesty's Royal Charter in November, 1881.\n\nI have now traced, in brief outline, the political history of Borneo from the time when the country first became generally known to Europeans\u2014in 1518\u2014down to its final division between Great Britain and the Netherlands in 1881.\n\nIf we can accept the statements of the earlier writers, Borneo was in its most prosperous stage before it became subjected to European influences, after which, owing to the mistaken and monopolising policy of the Commercial Companies then holding sway in the East, the trade and agriculture of this and other islands of the Malay Archipelago received a\nblow from which at any rate that of Borneo is only now recovering. By the terms of its Charter, the British North Borneo Company is prohibited from creating trade monopolies, and of its own accord it has decided not to engage itself in trading transactions at all, and as Raja Brooke's Government is similar to that of a British Crown Colony, and the Dutch Government no longer encourage monopolies, there is good ground for believing that the wrong done is being righted, and that a brighter page than ever is now being opened for Borneo and its natives.\n\nBefore finishing with this part of the subject, I may mention that the United States Government had entered into a treaty with the Sultan of Brunei, in almost exactly the same words as the English one, including the clause prohibiting cessions of territory without the consent of the other party to the treaty, and, in 1878, Commodore Schurfeldt was ordered by his Government to visit Borneo and report on the cessions obtained by Mr Dent. I was Acting British Consul-General at the time, and before leaving the Commodore informed me emphatically that he could discover no American interests in Borneo, \"neither white nor black.\"\n\nThe native population of Borneo is given in books of reference as between 1,750,000 and 2,500,000. The aborigines are of the Malay race, which itself is a variety of the Mongolian and indeed, when inspecting prisoners, I have often been puzzled to distinguish the Chinese from the Malay, they being dressed alike and the distinctive pig-tail having been shaved off the former as part of the prison discipline.\n\nThese Mongolian Malays from High Asia, who presumably migrated to the Archipelago via the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, must, however, have found Borneo and other of the islands partially occupied by a Caucasoid race, as amongst the aborigines are still found individuals of distinctive Caucasoid type, as has been pointed out to be the case with the Baludopin tribe of British North Borneo, by Dr. Montano, whom I had the pleasure of meeting in Borneo in 1878-9. To these the name of pre-Malays has been given, but Professor Keane, to whom I beg to acknowledge my indebtedness on\nthese points, prefers the title of Indonesians. The scientific descriptions of a typical Malay is as follows:\u2014\"Stature little over five feet, complexion olive yellow, head brachy-cephalous or round, cheek-bones prominent, eyes black and slightly oblique, nose small but not flat, nostrils dilated, hands small and delicate, legs thin and weak, hair black, coarse and lank, beard absent or scant;\" but these Indonesians to whom belong most of the indigenous inhabitants of Celebes, are taller and have fairer or light brown complexions and regular features, connecting them with the brown Polynesians of the Eastern Pacific \"who may be regarded as their descendants,\" and Professor KEANE accounts for their presence by assuming \"a remote migration of the Caucasie race to South-Eastern Asia of which evidences are not lacking in Camboja and elsewhere, and a further onward movement, first to the Archipelago and then East to the Pacific.\" It is needless to say that the aborigines themselves have the haziest and most unscientific notion of their own origin, as the following account, gravely related to me by a party of Buludupuhs, will exemplify:\u2014\n\n\"The Origin of the Buludupuh Race.\n\nIn past ages a Chinese* settler had taken to wife a daughter of the aborigines, by whom he had a female child. Her parents lived in a hilly district (Bulud\u2014hill), covered with a large forest tree, known by the name of oph. One day a jungle fire occurred, and after it was over, the child jumped down from the house (native houses are raised on piles off the ground), and went up to look at a half burnt oph log, and suddenly disappeared and was never seen again. But the parents heard the voice of a spirit issue from the log, announcing that it had taken the child to wife and that, in course of time, the bereaved parents would find an infant in the jungle, whom they were to consider as the offspring of the marriage.\n\n* The Baudouins inhabit the Chang or Koa-batan-gan river, and Sir Henry Low, in a note to his history of the Sultans of Brunei in a number of the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society says that it is probable that in former days the Chinese had a Settlement or Factory in that river as some versions of the nature history of Brunei expressly state that the Chinese wife of one of the earliest Sultans was brought thence.\nand who would become the father of a new race. The prophecy of the spirit was in due time fulfilled.\"\n\nIt somewhat militates against the correctness of this history that the Buludupihs are distinguished by the absence of Mongolian features.\n\nThe general appellation given to the aborigines by the modern Malays\u2014to whom reference will be made later on\u2014is Dyak, and they are divided into numerous tribes, speaking very different dialects of the Malayo-Polynesian stock, and known by distinctive names, the origin of which is generally obscure, at least in British North Borneo, where these names are not, as a rule, derived from those of the rivers on which they dwell.\n\nThe following are the names of some of the principal North Borneo aboriginal tribes:\u2014Kadaians, Dusuns, Ida'ans, Bisaias, Buludupihs, Eraans, Subans, Sun-Dyaks, Muruts, Tagaas. Of these, the Kadaians, Buludupihs, Eraans and one large section of the Bisaias have embraced the religion of Mahomet; the others are Pagans, with no set form of religion, no idols, but believing in spirits and in a future life, which they localise on the top of the great mountain of Kina-balu. These Pagans are a simple and more natural, less self-conscious, people than their Mahomedan brethren, who are ahead of them in point of civilization, but are more reserved, more proud and altogether less \"jolly,\" and appear, with their religion, to have acquired also some of the characteristics of the modern or true Malays. A Pagan can sit, or rather squat, with you and tell you legends, or, perhaps, on an occasion join in a glass of grog, whereas the Mahomedan, especially the true Malay, looks upon the Englishman as little removed from a \"Kahr\"\u2014an uncircumcised Philistine\u2014who through ignorance constantly offends in minor points of etiquette, who eats pig and drinks strong drink, is ignorant of the dignity of repose, and whose accidental physical and political superiority in the present world will be more than compensated for by the very inferior and uncomfortable position he will attain in the next.\n\nThe aborigines inhabit the interior parts of North Borneo, and all along the coast is found a fringe of true Malays, talk-\ning modern Malay and using the Arabic written character, whereas the aborigines possess not even the rudiments of an alphabet and, consequently, no literature at all.\n\nHow is the presence in Borneo of this more highly civilized product of the Malay race, differing so profoundly in language and manners from their kinsmen\u2014the aborigines\u2014to be accounted for? Professor Keane once more comes to our assistance, and solves the question by suggesting that the Mongolian Malays from High Asia who settled in Sumatra, attained there a real national development in comparatively recent times, and after their conversion to Mahomedanism by the Arabs, from whom, as well as from the Buddhist missionaries who preceded them, they acquired arts and an elementary civilization, spread to Borneo and other parts of Malaya and quickly asserted their superiority over the less advanced portion of their race already settled there. This theory fits in well with the native account of the distribution of the Malay race, which makes Mentangkabau, in Southern Sumatra, the centre whence they spread over the Malayan islands and peninsula.\n\nThe Professor further points out, that in prehistoric times the Malay and Indonesian stock spread westwards to Madagascar and eastwards to the Philippines and Formosa, Micronesia and Polynesia. \"This astonishing expansion of the Malayan people throughout the Oceanic area is sufficiently attested by the diffusion of common (Malayo-Polynesian) speech from Madagascar to Easter Island and from Hawaii to New Zealand.\"\n\nChapter II.\n\nThe headquarters of the true Malay in Northern Borneo is the City of Brunei, on the river of that name, on the North-West Coast of the island, where resides the Court of the only nominally independent Sultan now remaining in the Archipelago.*\n\nThe Brunei river is probably the former mouth of the Limbang, and is now more a salt water inlet than a river. Con-\n\n* He has since been \"protected\"\u2014see ante page 6, note.\ntrary, perhaps, to the general idea, an ordinary eastern river, at any rate until the limit of navigability for European craft is attained, is not, as a rule, a thing of beauty by any means.\n\nThe typical Malay river debouches through flat, fever-haunted swampy country, where, for miles, nothing meets the eye but the monotonous dark green of the level, interminable mangrove forest, with its fantastic, interlacing roots, whose function it appears to be to extend seaward, year by year, its dismal kingdom of black fetid mud, and to veil from the rude eye of the intruder the tropical charms of the country at its back. After some miles of this cheerless scenery, and at a point where the fresh water begins to mingle with the salt, the handsome and useful *nipa* palm, with leaves twenty to thirty feet in length, which supply the native with the material for the walls and roof of his house, the wrapper for his cigarette, the sugar for his breakfast table, the salt for his daily needs and the strong drink to gladden his heart on his feast days, becomes intermixed with the mangrove and finally takes its place\u2014a pleasing change, but still monotonous, as it is so dense that, itself growing in the water, it quite shuts out all view of the bank and surrounding country.\n\nOne of the first signs of the fresh river water, is the occurrence on the bank of the graceful *nibong* palm, with its straight, slender, round stem, twenty to thirty feet in height, surmounted with a plume of green leaves. This palm, cut into lengths and requiring no further preparation, is universally employed by the Malay for the posts and beams of his house, always raised several feet above the level of the ground, or of the water, as the case may be, and split up into lathes of the requisite size, forms the frame-work of the walls and roof, and constitutes the flooring throughout. With the pithy centre removed, the *nibong* forms an efficient aqueduct, in the absence of bamboo, and its young, growing shoot affords a cabbage, or salad, second only to that furnished by the coconut, which will next come into view, together with the betel (*Areca*) nut palm, if the river visited is an inhabited one; but if uninhabited, the traveller will find nothing but thick, almost impenetrable jungle, with mighty trees shooting up one hun-\ndred to a hundred and fifty feet without a branch, in their endeavour to get their share of the sun-light, and supporting on their trunks and branches enormous creepers, rattans, graceful ferns and lovely orchids and other luxuriant epiphytal growths. Such is the typical North Borneo river, to which, however, the Brunei is a solitary exception. The mouth of the Brunei river is approached between pretty verdant islets, and after passing through a narrow and tortuous passage, formed naturally by sandbanks and artificially by a barrier of stones, bare at low water, laid down in former days to keep out the restless European, you find your vessel, which to cross the bar should not draw more than thirteen or fourteen feet, in deep water between green, grassy, hilly, picturesque banks, with scarcely a sign of the abominable mangrove, or even of the nipa, which, however, to specially mark the contrast formed by this stream, are both to be found in abundance in the upper portion of the river, which the steamer cannot enter. After passing a small village or two, the first object which used to attract attention was the brick ruins of a Roman Catholic Church, which had been erected here by the late Father Quarteron, a Spanish Missionary of the Society of the Propaganda Fide, who, originally a jovial sea captain, had the good fortune to light upon a wrecked treasure ship in the Eastern seas, and, feeling presumably unwonted twinges of conscience, decided to devote the greater part of his wealth to the Church, in which he took orders, eventually attaining the rank of Prefect Apostolic. His Mission, unfortunately, was a complete failure, but though his assistants were withdrawn, he stuck to his post to the last and, no doubt, did a certain amount of good in liberating, from time to time, Spanish subjects he found in slavery on the Borneo Coast.\n\nHad the poor fellow settled in the interior, amongst the Pagans he might, by his patience and the example of his good life, have made some converts, but amongst the Mahomedans of the coast it was labour in vain. The bricks of his Brunei Church have since been sold to form the foundation of a steam sawmill.\n\nTurning a sharp corner, the British Consulate is reached,\nwhere presides, and flies with pride the Union Jack. Her Majesty's Consular Agent, Mr. or Inche Mahomet, with his three wives and thirteen children. He is a native of Malacca and a clever, zealous, courteous and hospitable official, well versed in the political history of Brunei since the advent of Sir James Brooke.\n\nThe British is the only Consulate now established at Brunei, but once the stars and stripes proudly waved over the Consulate of an unpaid American Consul. There was little scope at Brunei for a white man in pursuit of the fleeting dollar, and one day the Consulate was burnt to the ground, and a heavy claim for compensation for this alleged act of incendiarism was sent in to the Sultan. His Highness disputed the claim, and an American man-of-war was despatched to make enquiries on the spot. In the end, the compensation claimed was not enforced, and Mr. Moses, the Consul, was not subsequently, I think, appointed to any other diplomatic or consular post by the President of the Republic. A little further on are the palaces, shops and houses of the city of Brunei, all, with the exception of a few brick shops belonging to Chinamen, built over the water in a reach where the river broadens out, and a vessel can steam up the High Street and anchor abreast of the Royal Palace. When Pigafetta visited the port in 1521, he estimated the number of houses at 25,000, which, at the low average of six to a house, would give Brunei a population of 150,000 people, many of whom were Chinese, cultivating pepper gardens, traces of which can still be seen on the now deserted hills. Sir Spencer St. John, formerly H. B. M. Consul-General in Borneo, and who put the population at 25,000 at the lowest in 1863, asserts that fifteen is a fair average to assign to a Brunei house, which would make the population in Pigafetta's time 375,000. From his enquiries he found that the highest number was seventy, in the Sultan's palace, and the lowest seven, in a fisherman's small hut. Pigafetta, however, probably alluded to families fives I think is the word he makes use of, and more than one family is often found occupying a Brunei house. The present population perhaps does not number\nmore than 12,000 or 15,000 natives, and about eighty Chinese and a few Kling shop-keepers, as natives of India are here styled. Writing in 1845, Sir James Brooke, then the Queen's first Commissioner to Brunei says with reference to this Sultanate:\u2014\"Here the experiment may be fairly tried, on the smallest possible scale of expense, whether a beneficial European influence may not re-animate a falling State and at the same time extend our commerce.\" * * * If this tendency to decay and extinction be inevitable, if this approximation of European policy to native Government should be unable to arrest the fall of the Bornean dynasty, yet we shall retrieve a people already habituated to European habits and manners, industrious interior races; and if it become necessary, a Colony gradually formed and ready to our hand in a rich and fertile country,\" and elsewhere he admits that the regeneration of the Borneo Malays through themselves was a hobby of his. The experiment has been tried and, so far as concerns the re-animation of the Malay Government of Brunei, the verdict must be \"a complete failure.\" The English are a practical race, and self-interest is the guide of nations in their intercourse with one another; it was not to be supposed that they would go out of their way to teach the degenerate Brunei aristocracy how to govern in accordance with modern ideas; indeed, the Treaty we made with them, by prohibiting, for instance, their levying customs duties, or royalties, on the export of such jungle products as gutta percha and India rubber, in the collection of which the trees yielding them are entirely destroyed, and by practically suggesting to them the policy, or rather the impolicy, of imposing the heavy due of $1 per registered ton on all European Shipping entering their ports, whether in cargo or in ballast, scarcely tended to stave off their collapse, and the Borneans must have formed their own conclusions from the fact that when they gave up portions of their territory to the Brookes and to the British North Borneo Company, the British Government no longer called for the observance of these provisions of the Treaty in the ceded districts. The English have got all they wanted from Brunei, but I think it can scarcely be said that they have\ndone very much for it in return. I remember that the late Sultan thought it an inexplicable thing that we could not assist him to recover a debt due to him by one of the British Coal Companies which tried their luck in Borneo. Moreover, even the cession to their good and noble friend Sir James Brooke of the Brunei Province of Sarawak has been itself also, to a certain extent, a factor in their Government's decay, that State, under the rule of the Raja\u2014Charles Brooke\u2014having attained its present prosperous condition at the expense of Brunei and by gradually absorbing its territory.\n\nBetween British North Borneo, on the one side, and Sarawak, on the other, the sea-board of Brunei, which, when we first appeared on the scene, extended from Cape Datu to Marudu Bay\u2014some 700 miles\u2014is now reduced to 125 or 130 miles, and, besides the river on which it is built, Brunei retains but two others of any importance, both of which are in rebellion of a more or less vigorous character, and the whole State of Brunei is so sick that its case is now under the consideration of Her Majesty's Government.\n\nThus ends in collapse the history of the last independent Malay Government. Excepting only Johor (which is prosperous owing to its being under the wing of Singapore, which fact gives confidence to European and Chinese capitalists and Chinese labourers, and to its good fortune in having a wise and just ruler in its Sultan, who owes his elevation to British influences), all the Malay Governments throughout the Malay Archipelago and in the Malay Peninsula are now subject either to the English, the Dutch, the Spanish or the Portuguese. This decadence is not due to any want of vitality in the race, for under European rule the Malay increases his numbers, as witness the dense population of Java and the rapidly growing Malay population of the Straits Settlements.\n\nThat the Malay does so flourish in contact with the European and the Chinese is no doubt to some extent due to his attachment to the Mahomedan faith, which as a tee-total religion is, so far, the most suitable one for a tropical race; it has also to be remembered that he inhabits tropical countries, where the white man cannot perform out-door labour.\nand appears only as a Government Official, a merchant or a planter.\n\nBut the decay of the Brunei aristocracy was probably inevitable. Take the life of a young noble. He is the son of one of perhaps thirty women in his father's harem, his mother is entirely without education, can neither read nor write, is never allowed to appear in public or have any influence in public affairs, indeed scarcely ever leaves her house, and one of her principal excitements, perhaps, is the carrying on of an intrigue, an excitement enhanced by the fact that discovery means certain death to herself and her lover.\n\nBrunei being a water town, the youngster has little or no chance of a run and game ashore, and any exercise he takes is confined to being paddled up and down the river in a canoe, for to paddle himself would be deemed much too degrading\u2014a Brunei noble should never put his hand to any honest physical work\u2014even for his own recreation. I once imported a Rob Roy canoe from England and amused myself by making long paddling excursions, and I would also sometimes, to relieve the monotony of a journey in a native boat, take a spell at the paddle with the men, and I was gravely warned by a native friend that by such action I was seriously compromising myself and lowering my position in the eyes of the higher class of natives. At an early age the young noble becomes an object of servile adoration to the numerous retainers and slaves, both male and female, and is by them initiated in vicious practices and, while still a boy, acquires from them some of the knowledge of a fast man of the world. As a rule he receives no sort of school education. He neither rides nor joins in the chase and, since the advent of Europeans, there have been no wars to brace his nerves, or call out any of the higher qualities of mind or body which may be latent in him, nor is there any standing army or navy in which he might receive a beneficial training. No political career, in the sense we attach to the term, is open to him, and he has no feelings of patriotism whatever. That an aristocracy thus nurtured should degenerate can cause no surprise. The general term for the nobles amongst the Bruneis is Pangeran, and their numbers may be\nguessed when it is understood that every son and daughter of every many-wived noble is also a Pangeran.\n\nSome of these unfortunate noblemen have nothing where-with to support their position, and in very recent times I have actually seen a needy Pangeran, in a British Colony where he could not live by oppression or theft, driven to work in a coal mine or drive a buffalo cart.\n\nWith the ordinary freeborn citizen of Brunei life opens under better auspices. The children are left much to themselves and are merry, precocious, naked little imps, able to look out for themselves at a very much earlier age than is the case with European infants, and it is wonderful to see quite little babies clambering up the rickety stairs leading from the river to the house, or crawling unheeded on the tottering verandahs. Almost before they can walk they can swim, and they have been known to share their mother's cigarettes while still in arms. All day long they amuse themselves in miniature canoes, rolling over and over in the water, regardless of crocodiles. Happy children! they have no school and no clothes\u2014one might, perhaps, exclaim happy parents, too! Malays are very kind and indulgent to their children and I do not think I have seen or heard of a case of the application of the parental hand to any part of the infant person. As soon as he is strong enough, say eight or nine years of age, the young Malay, according to the kampung, or division of the town, in which his lot has been cast, joins in his father's trade and becomes a fisherman, a trader, or a worker in brass or in iron as the case may be. The girls have an equally free and easy time while young, their only garments being a silver bangle, fastened to a chain or girdle round the waist. As they grow up they help their mothers in their household duties, or by selling their goods in the daily floating market, they marry young and are, as a rule, kindly treated by their husbands. Although Mahomedans, they can go about freely and unveiled, a privilege denied to their sisters of the higher classes. The greatest misfortune for such a girl is, perhaps, the possession of a pretty face and figure, which may result in her being honoured with the attentions of a noble, in whose harem she\nmay be secluded for the rest of her life, and, as her charms wane her supply of both food and clothing is reduced to the lowest limit.\n\nBy the treaty with Great Britain traffic in slaves is put down; that is, Borneo is no longer the mart where, as in former days, the pirates can bring in their captives for sale, but the slaves already in the place have not been liberated, and a slave's children are slaves, so that domestic slavery, as it is termed, exists on a very considerable scale in Brunei. Slaves were acquired in the old days by purchase from pirates and, on any pretext, from the Pagan tribes of Borneo. For instance, if a feudal chief of an outlying river was in want of some cash, nothing was easier than for him to convict a man, who was the father of several children, of some imaginary offence, or neglect of duty, and his children, girls and boys, would be seized and carried off to Brunei as slaves. A favourite method was that of \"forced trade.\" The chief would send a large quantity of trade goods to a Pagan village and leave them there to be sold at one hundred per cent or more above their proper value, all legitimate trade being prohibited meanwhile, and if the money or barter goods were not forthcoming when demanded, the deficiency would be made up in slaves. This kind of oppression was very rife in the neighbourhood of the capital when I first became acquainted with Borneo in 1871, but the power of the chiefs has been much curtailed of late, owing to the extensive cessions of territory to Sarawak and the British North Borneo Company, and their hold on the rivers left to them has become very precarious, since the warlike Kyans passed under Raja Brooke's sway. This tribe, once the most powerful in Borneo, was always ready at the Sultan's call to raid on any tribe who had incurred his displeasure and revelled in the easy acquisition of fresh heads, over which to hold the triumphal dance. The Brunei Malays are not a warlike race, and the Rajas find that, without the Kyans, they are as a tiger with its teeth drawn and its claws pared, and the Pagan tribes have not been slow to make the discovery for themselves. Those on the Lumbang river have been in open rebellion for the last three or four years.\nand are crying out to be taken under the protection of the Queen, or, failing that, then under the \"Kompani,\" as the British North Borneo Company's Government like that of the East India Company in days gone by, is styled, or under Sarawak.\n\nThe condition of the domestic slaves is not a particularly hard one unless, in the case of a girl, she is compelled to join the harem, when she becomes technically free, but really only changes one sort of servitude for another and more degrading one. With this exception, the slaves live on friendly terms with their masters' families, and the propinquity of a British Colony\u2014Labuan\u2014has tended to ameliorate their condition, as an ill-used slave can generally find means to escape thither and, so long as he remains there, he is a free man.\n\nThe scientific description of a typical Malay has already been given, and it answers well on almost all points for the Brunei specimen, except that the nose, as well as being small, is, in European eyes, deficient as to \"bridge,\" and the legs cannot be described as weak, indeed the Brunei Malay, male and female, is a somewhat fleshy animal. In temperament, the Malay is described as \"taciturn, undemonstrative, little given to outward manifestations of joy or sorrow, courteous towards each other, kind to their women and children. Not elated by good or depressed by bad fortune, but capable of excesses when roused. Under the influence of religious excitement, losses at gambling, jealousy or other domestic troubles they are liable to amok or run-a-muck, an expression which appears to have passed into the English language.\" With strangers, the Brunei Malay is doubtless taciturn, but I have heard Brunei ladies among themselves, while enjoying their betel-nut, rival any old English gossips over their cup of tea, and on an expedition the men will sometimes keep up a conversation long into the night till begged to desist. Courtesy seems to be innate in every Malay of whatever rank, both in their intercourse with one another and with strangers. The meeting at Court of two Brunei nobles who, perhaps, entertain feelings of the greatest hatred towards each other, is an interesting study, and the display of mutual courtesy unrivalled.\nI need scarcely say that horseplay and practical joking are unknown, contradiction is rarely resorted to and \"chaff\" is only known in its mildest form. The lowest Malay will never pass in front of you if it can be avoided, nor hand anything to another across you. Unless in case of necessity, a Malay will not arouse his friend from slumber, and then only in the gentlest manner possible. It is bad manners to point at all, but, if it is absolutely necessary to do so, the forefinger is never employed, but the person or object is indicated, in a sort of shamefaced way, with the thumb. It is impolite to bare a weapon in public, and Europeans often show their ignorance of native etiquette by asking a Malay visitor to let them examine the blade of the keris he is wearing. It is not considered polite to enquire after the welfare of the female members of a Brunei gentleman's household. For a Malay to uncover his head in your presence would be an impertinence, but a guttural noise in his throat after lunching with you is a polite way of expressing pleased satisfaction with the excellence of the repast. This latter piece of etiquette has probably been adopted from the Chinese. The low social position assigned to women by Brunei Malays, as by nearly all Mahomedan races, is of course a partial set-off to the general courtesy that characterises them. The average intelligence of what may be called the working class Malay is almost as far superior to that, say, of the British country bumpkin as are his manners. Mr. H. O. Forbes says in his \"Naturalist in the Eastern Archipelago\" that he was struck with the natives' acute observation in natural history and the accuracy with which they could give the names, habits and uses of animals and plants in the jungle, and the traveller cannot but admire the general hardiness and adaptability to changed circumstances and customs and quickness of understanding of the Malay coolies whom he engages to accompany him.\n\nCannot one imagine the stolid surprise and complete obfuscation of the English peasant if an intelligent Malay traveller were to be suddenly set down in his district, making enquiries as to the, to him, novel forms of plants and animals and asking for minute information as to the manners and customs of\nthe new people amongst whom he found himself, and, generally, seeking for information as the reasons for this and for that?\n\nTheir religion sits somewhat lightly on the Brunei Malays; the Mahomedan Mosque in the capital was always in a very dirty and neglected state, though prayers were said there daily, and I have never seen a Borneo Malay under the influence of religious excitement.\n\nGambling prevails, doubtless, and so does cock-fighting, but neither is the absorbing passion which it seems, from travellers' accounts, to be with Malays elsewhere.\n\nWhen visiting the Spanish settlements in Sulu and Balabac, I was surprised to find regular officially licensed cock-fighting pits, with a special seat for the Spanish Governor, who was expected to be present on high days and holidays. I have never come across a regular cockpit in Brunei, or in any part of northern Borneo.\n\nThe amoks that I have been cognisant of have, consequently, not been due to either religious excitement, or to losses at gambling, but, in nearly every case, to jealousy and domestic trouble, and their occurrence almost entirely confined to the British Colony of Labuan where, of course, the Mahomedan laws and penalties for female delinquencies could not be enforced. I remember one poor fellow whom I pitied very much. He had good reason to be jealous of his wife and, in our courts, could not get the redress he sought. He explained to me that a mist seemed to gather before his eyes and that he became utterly unconscious of what he was doing\u2014his will was quite out of his control. Some half dozen people\u2014children, men and women\u2014were killed, or desperately wounded before he was overpowered. He acknowledged his guilt, and suffered death at the hands of the hangman with quiet dignity.\n\nMany tragic incidents in the otherwise uneventful history of Labuan may be traced to the manner in which marriages are contracted amongst the Borneo Malays. Marriages of mere love are almost unknown; they are generally a matter of bargain between the girls' parents and the expectant bridegroom, or his parents, and, practically, everything depends on\nthe amount of the dowry or brikan\u2014literally \"gift\"\u2014which\nthe swain can pay to the former. In their own country there\nexist certain safeguards which prevent any abuse of this sys-\ntem, but it was found that under the English law a clever\nparent could manage to dispose of his daughter's hand several\ntimes over, so that really the plot of Mrs. Campbell Praed's\nsomewhat unpleasant play \"Ariane\" was anticipated in the\nlittle colony of Labuan. I was once called upon, as Coroner,\nto inquire into the deaths of a young man and his handsome\nyoung wife, who were discovered lying dead, side by side, on the\nfloor of their house. The woman was found to be fearfully cut\nabout, the man had but one wound, in his abdomen, penetrat-\ning the bowels. There was only one weapon by which the\ndouble murder could have been committed, a knife with a six\ninch blade, and circumstances seemed to point to the proba-\nbility that the woman had first stabbed the man, who had then\nwrenched the knife from her grasp and hacked her to death.\nThe man was not quite dead when found and he accused the\ndead woman of stabbing him. It was found, that they had\nnot long been married and that, apparently with the girl's\nconsent, her father had been negotiating for her marriage\nwith another. The father himself was subsequently the first\nman murdered in British North Borneo after the assump-\ntion of the Government by the Company, and his murderer\nwas the first victim of the law in the new Colony. Altogether\na tragic story.\n\nMany years ago another amok, which was near being tra-\ngical, had an almost comical termination. The then Colo-\nnial Treasurer was an entertaining Irishman of rather mature\nage. Walking down to his office one day he found in the\nroad a Malay hacking at his wife and another man. Home\nrule not being then in fashion with the Irish, the Treasurer,\narmed only with his sun umbrella, attempted to interfere,\nwhen the amok turned furiously on him and the Irish offi-\ncial, who was of spare build, took to his heels and made good\nhis escape, the chase, though a serious matter to him, causing\nirrepressible mirth to onlookers. The man was never cap-\ntured, and his victims, though disfigured, recovered. I remem-\nber being struck by the contemptuous reply of Sir Hugh Low's Chinese servant when he warned him to be on his guard, as there was an amok at large, and alluded to Mr. C.'s narrow escape\u2014it was to the effect that the Treasurer was foolish to interfere in other people's concerns. This unwillingness to busy oneself in others' affairs, which sometimes has the appearance of callousness, is characteristic of Malays and Chinese.\n\nThe readers of a book of travels are somewhat under a disadvantage in forming their opinion of a country, in that incidents are focussed for them by those of the same nature being grouped together. I do not wish it to be thought that murders and amoks are at all common occurrences in Northern Borneo, indeed they are very few and far between, and criminal acts of all kinds are remarkably infrequent, that is, of course, if we regard head-hunting as an amusement sanctioned by usage, especially as, in the parts under native government, there is a total absence of any kind of police force, while every man carries arms, and houses with palm leaf walls and innocent of locks, bolts and bars, offer unusual temptations to the burglariously inclined. My wife and I nearly always slept without a watchman and with the doors and windows unclosed, the servants' offices being detached from the house, and we have never had any of our property stolen except by a \"boy.\"\n\nBrunei is governed by a Sultan styled lang-di-pertuan, \"he who rules,\" and four principal Ministers of State, \"Wazirs\"\u2014the Pangeran Bandahara, the Pangeran diGadong, the Pangeran Pamancha and the Pangeran Temenggong. These Ministers are generally men of the royal blood, and fly distinctive flags at their residences, that of the Bandahara being white, of the di Gadong, green, and of the Temenggong, red. The flags are remarkably simple and inexpensive, but quite distinctive, each consisting of a square bit of bunting or cloth of the requisite colour, with the exception of the Temenggong's, which is cut in the shape of a burgee. The Sultan's flag is a plain piece of yellow bunting, yellow being the Brunei royal colour, and no man, except the\nSovereign, is permitted to exhibit that colour in any portion of his dress. It shows how little importance attaches to the female sex that a lady, even a slave, can sport yellow in her dress, or any colour she chooses. Theoretically, the duties of the Bandahara are those of a Home Secretary; the d. Gadong is Keeper of the Seal and Chancellor of the Exchequer; the Pamancha's functions I am rather uncertain about, as the post has remained unfilled for many years past, but they would seem to partake of those of a Home Secretary; and the Temenggong is the War Minister and Military and Naval Commander-in-chief; and appears also to hear and decide criminal and civil cases in the city of Brunei. These appointments are made by the Sultan, and for life; but it will be understood that, in such a rough and ready system of government as that of Brunei, the actual influence of each Minister depends entirely on his own character and that of the Sultan. Sometimes one Minister will practically usurp the functions of some, or, perhaps, all the others, leaving them only their titles and revenues, while often on a vacancy occurring the Sultan does not make a fresh appointment, but himself appropriates the revenue of the office, leaving the duties to take care of themselves.\n\nTo look after trade and commerce there is, in theory, an inferior Minister, the Pangeran Shahander.\n\nThere is another class of Ministers\u2014Wantri\u2014who are selected by the Sultan from among the people, and are chosen for their intelligence and for the influence and following they have amongst the citizens. They possess very considerable political power, their opinions being asked on important matters. Such are the two Jumatans and the Orang Kaya di Gadong, who may be looked upon as the principal officers of the Sultan and the Wazirs.\n\nThe State officials are paid by the revenues of certain districts which are assigned, as will be seen below, to the different offices.\n\nThe Mahomedan Malays, it has already been explained, were an invading and conquering race in Borneo, and their chiefs would seem to have divided the country, or, rather, the\ninhabitants, amongst themselves, in much the same way as England was parcelled out among the followers of William the Conqueror. The people of all the rivers* and of the interior, up to the limits where the Brunei Malays can enforce their authority, own as their feudal lord and pay taxes to either the Sultan, in his unofficial capacity, or to one of the nobles, or else they are attached to the office of Sultan or one of the great Ministers of State, and, again theoretically speaking, all the districts in the Sultanate are known, from the fact of the people on them belonging to a noble, or to the reigning Sultan for the time being, or to one of the Ministers of State, as either:\n\n1. Ka-r\u00e1jahan\u2014belonging to the Sultan or R\u00e1ja.\n2. Kouripan\u2014belonging to certain public officials during their term of office.\n3. Pusaka or Tulin\u2014belonging to the Sultan or any of the nobles in their unofficial capacity.\n\nThe crown and the feudal chiefs did not assert any claim to the land; there are, for instance, no \"crown lands,\" and, in the case of land not owned or occupied, any native could settle upon and cultivate it without payment of any rent or land tax, either to the Sultan or to the feudal chief of the district. Consequently, land was comparatively little regarded, and what the feudal chief claimed was the people and not the land, so much so that, as pointed out by Mr. P. Leys in a Consular report, in the case of the people removing from one river to another, they did not become the followers of the chief who owned the population amongst whom they settled, but remained subject to their former lord, who had the right of following them and collecting from them his taxes as before.\n\nIt is only of quite recent years, imitating the example of the English in Labuan, where all the land was assumed to be the property of the Sovereign and leased to individuals for a term of years, that the nobles have, in some instances, put forward a claim to ownership of the land on which their followers\n\n---\n\n* Owing to the absence of roads and the consequent importance of rivers as means of getting about, nearly all districts in Borneo are named after their principal rivers.\nchose to settle, and have endeavoured to pose as semi-independent princes. These feudal chiefs tax, or used to tax their followers in proportion to their inability to resist their lords' demands. A poll tax, usually at the rate of $2 for married men and $1 for bachelors, is a form of taxation to which, in the absence of any land tax, no objection is made; but the chiefs had also the power of levying special taxes at their own sweet will, when they found their expenditure in excess of their income, and advantage was taken of any delay in payment of taxes, or of any breach of the peace, or act of theft occurring in a district, to impose excessive fines on the delinquents, all of which if paid went to the chief, and if the fine could not be paid, the defaulter's children might be seized and eventually sold into slavery. The system of \"forced trade,\" I have alluded to when speaking on the subject of domestic slavery. The chiefs were all absentees and, while drawing everything they could out of their districts, did nothing for their wretched followers. The taxes were collected by their messengers and slaves, unscrupulous men who were paid by what they could get out of the people in excess of what they were bidden to demand, and who, while engaged in levying the contributions, lived at free quarters on the people, who naturally did their best to expedite their departure.\n\nPetty cases of dispute were settled by headmen appointed by the chief and termed orang kaya, literally \"rich men.\" These orang kayas were often selected from their possessing some little property and being at the same time subservient to the chief. In many cases, it seemed to me, that they were chosen for their superior stupidity and pliability. I have made use of the past tense throughout my description of these feudal chiefs as, happily, for reasons already given, the \"good old times\" are rapidly passing away.\n\nThe laws of Brunei are, in theory, those inculcated by the Koran and there are one or two officials who have some slight knowledge of Mahomedan law. Owing to the cheap facilities offered by the numerous steamers at Singapore, there are many Hajis\u2014that is, persons who have made the pilgrimage to Mecca\u2014amongst the Brunais and the Kadaaans, amongst\nthe latter more especially, but of course a visit to Mecca does not necessarily imply that the pilgrim has obtained any actual knowledge of the holy book, which some of them can decipher, the Malays having adopted the Arabic alphabet, but without, however, understanding the meaning of the Arabic words of which it consists. A friend of mine, son of the principal exponent of Mahomedan law in the capital, and who became naturalised as a British subject, had studied law in Constantinople.\n\nThere is no gaol in Brunei, and fines are found to be a more profitable mode of punishment than incarceration, the judge generally pocketing the fine, and when it does become necessary to keep an offender in detention, it is done by placing his feet in the stocks, which are set up on the public staging or landing before the reception room of the Sultan, or of one of his chief Ministers, and the wretched man may be kept there for months.\n\nThe punishment for theft, sanctioned by the Koran, is by cutting off the right hand, but this barbarous, though effective, penalty has been discountenanced by the English. On one occasion, however, when acting as H. B. M. Consul-General, I received my information too late to interfere. I had been on a visit to the late Sultan in a British gunboat, and anchored off the palace. During the evening, just before dinner, notwithstanding the watch kept on deck, some natives came alongside and managed to hook out through the ports my gold watch and chain from off the Captain's table, and the first Lieutenant's revolver from his cabin. During our interview next morning with the Sultan, I twitted him on the skill and daring of Brunei thieves, who could perpetrate a theft from a friendly war-ship before the windows of the Royal palace. The Sultan said nothing, but was evidently much annoyed, and a few weeks afterwards the revolver and the remains of my watch and chain were sent to me at Labuan, with a letter saying that three thieves had been punished by having had their hands chopped off. I subsequently heard that two of the unfortunate men had died from the effects of this cruel punishment.\nOn another occasion, some Brunei thieves skilfully dismounted and carried off two brass signal guns from the poop of a merchant steamer at anchor in the river, eluding the vigilance of the quarter-master, while the skipper and some of the officers were asleep on the skylight close by. The guns were subsequently recovered.\n\nExecution is either by means of the bow string or the kris.\n\nI had once the unpleasant duty of having to witness the execution by the bow string of a man named Maidin, as it was feared that, being the son of a favourite officer of the Sultan, the execution might be a sham one. This man, with others, had raided a small settlement of Chinese traders from Labuan on the Borneo coast, killing several of the shop-keepers and looting the settlement. So weak was the central government, and so little importance did they attach to the murder of a few Chinese, that, notwithstanding the efforts of the British Consul, Maidin remained at liberty for nearly two years after the commission of the crime.\n\nThe execution took place at night. The murderer was bound, with his hands behind his back, in a large canoe, and a noose of rope was placed round his neck. Two men stood behind him; a short stick was inserted in the noose and twisted round and round by the two executioners, thereby causing the rope to compress the windpipe. Maidin's struggles were soon over.\n\nIn the case of common people the kris is used, the executioner standing behind the criminal and pressing the kris downwards, through the shoulder, into the heart. This mode of execution has been retained by the European rulers of Sarawak. In British North Borneo the English mode by hanging has been adopted.\n\nFormerly, when ancient customs were more strictly observed, any person using insulting expressions in talking of members of the Royal family was punished by having his tongue slit, and I was once shown by the Temenggong, in whose official keeping it was, the somewhat cumbrous pair of scissors wherewith this punishment was inflicted, but I have never heard of its having been used during the last twenty years.\nalthough opportunities could not have been wanting.\n\nI was once horrified by being informed by an observant British Naval Officer, who had been to Brunei on duty, that he had been disgusted by noticing, notwithstanding our long connection with Brunei and supposed influence with the Sultan, so barbarous a mode of execution as that of keeping the criminal exposed, without food, day and night, on a stage on high posts in the river. I had never heard of this process, and soon discovered that my friend had mistaken men fishing for criminals undergoing execution. Two men perch themselves up on posts, some distance apart, and let down by ropes a net into the river. Waiting patiently\u2014and Bruneis can sit still contentedly doing nothing for hours\u2014they remain motionless until a shoal of fish passes over the net, when it is partially raised and the fish taken out by a third man, and the operation repeated.\n\nI do not think my naval friend ever published his Brunei reminiscences.\n\nI have already said there is no police force in Brunei; an official makes use of his own slaves to carry out his orders, where an European would call in the police. Neither is there any army and navy, but the theory is that the Sultan and Ministers can call on the Brunei people to follow them to war, but as they give neither pay nor sufficient food their call is not numerously responded to.\n\nEvery Brunei man has his own arms, spear, kris and buckler, supplemented by an old English \"Tower\" musket, or rifle, or by one of Chinese manufacture with an imitation of the Tower mark. The parang, or chopper, or cutlass, is always carried by a Malay, being used for all kinds of work, agricultural and other, and is also a useful weapon of offence or defence.\n\nBrunei is celebrated for its brass cannon foundries and still produces handsome pieces of considerable size. Pigafetta describes cannon as being frequently discharged at Brunei during his visit there in 1521. Brass guns were formerly part of the currency in Brunei and, even now, you often hear the price of an article given as so many pikuls (a pikul\u2014\nBRITISH BORNEO.\n\n133 lbs., or catties (a catty = 13 lbs.) of brass gun. The brass for the guns is chiefly furnished by the Chinese cash, which is current in the town.\n\nIn former days, in addition to brass guns, pieces of grey shirting 'belacky' and of Nanking 'coin shop,' and small bits of iron were legal tender, and I have seen a specimen of a Brunei copper coinage one Sultan tried to introduce, but it was found to be so easily imitated by his subjects that it was withdrawn from circulation. At the present day silver dollars, Straits Settlements small silver pieces, and the copper coinage of Singapore, Sarawak and British North Borneo all pass current; the copper, however, unfortunately predominating. Recently the Sultan obtained \u00a31000 of a copper coin of his own from Birmingham, but the traders and the Governments of Singapore and Labuan appear to have discounted its use, and he probably will not try a second shipment.\n\nThe profit on the circulation of copper coinage, which is only a token, is of course considerable, and the British North Borneo Company obtained a substantial addition to its revenue from the large amount of its coin circulated in Brunei. When the Sultan first mooted the idea of obtaining his own coin from England, one of the Company's officers expostulated feelingly with him, and I was told by an onlooker that the contrast of the expressions of the countenances of the immobile Malay and of the mobile European was most amusing. All that the Sultan replied to the objections of the officer was, \"It does not signify. Sir, my coin can circulate in your country, and yours can circulate in mine,\" knowing well all the time the profit the Company was making.\n\nThe inhabitants of the city of Brunei are very lightly taxed, and there is no direct taxation. As above explained, there is no land tax, nor ground rent, and every man builds his own house and is his own landlord. The right of retailing the following articles is \"farmed\" out to the highest bidder by the Government and their price consequently enhanced to the consumer: Opium (but only a few of the nobles use the drug), foreign tobacco, curry stuff, wines and spirits (not used by the natives), salt, gambier (used for chewing with the\nbetel or areca nut), tea (little used by the natives) and earth-nut and coco-nut oil. There are no Municipal rates and taxes, the tidal river acting as a self cleansing street and sewer at the same time; neither are there any demands from a Poor Law Board.\n\nOn the other hand, there being no Army, Navy, Police, nor public buildings to keep up, the expenses of Government are wonderfully light also.\n\nOther Government receipts, in addition to the above, are rent of Chinese house-boats or rather shop-boats, pawn-broking and gambling licenses, a \"farm\" of the export of hides, royalties on sago and gutta percha, tonnage dues on European vessels visiting the port, and others. The salaries and expenses of the Government Departments are defrayed from the revenues of the rivers, or districts attached to them.\n\nConsiderable annual payments are now made by Sarawak and British North Borneo for the territorial cessions obtained by them. The annual contribution by Sarawak is about $10,000, and by the British North Borneo $11,800. These sums are apportioned amongst the Sultan and nobles who had interests in the ceded districts. I may say here that the payment by British North Borneo to the Sultan of the State, under the arrangement made by Mr. Dent already referred to, is one of $5,000 per annum.\n\nAn annual payment is also made by Mr. W. C. Cowie for the sole right* of working coal in the Sultanate, which he holds for a period of several years. Coal occurs throughout the island of Borneo, and its existence has long been known. It is worked on a small scale in Sarawak and in some portions of Dutch Borneo, and the unsuccessful attempts to develop the coal resources of the Colony of Labuan will be referred to later on.\n\nIn the Brunei Sultanate, with which we are at present concerned, coal occurs abundantly in the Brunei river and elsewhere, but it is only at present worked by Mr. Cowie and his partners at Muara, at the mouth of the Brunei river\u2014\n\n* This right was transferred by Mr. Cowie to Raja Brooke in 1883\nMuara, indeed, signifying in Malay a river's mouth. The Revd J. E. Tennison-Wood, well known in Australia as an authority on geological questions, thus describes the Muara coalfields\u2014\"About twenty miles to the South-west of Labuan is the mouth of the Brunei river. Here the rocks are of quite a different character, and much older. There are sandstones, shales, and grits, with ferruginous joints. The beds are inclined at angles of 25 to 45 degrees. They are often altered into a kind of chert. At Muara there is an outcrop of coal seams twenty, twenty-five and twenty-six feet thick. The coal is of excellent quality, quite bitumenised, and not brittle. The beds are being worked by private enterprise. I saw no fossils, but the beds and the coal reminded me much of the older Australian coals along the Hunter river. The mines are of great value. They are rented for a few thousand dollars by two enterprising Scotchmen, from the Sultan of Brunei. The same sovereign would part with the place altogether for little or nothing. Why not have our coal mining station there? Or what if Germany, France or Russia should purchase the same from the independent Sultan of Brunei?\" As if to give point to the concluding remarks, a Russian man-of-war visited Muara and Brunei early in 1887, and showed considerable interest in the coal mines.*\n\nChapter III.\n\nThe fairest way, perhaps, of giving my readers an idea of what Brunei was and what it is, will be by quoting first from the description of the Italian Pigafetta, who was there in 1521, and then from that of my friend the late Mr. Stair Elphinstone Dalrymple, who visited the city with me in 1884. Pigafetta's description I extract from Crawford's Descriptive Dictionary of the Indian Islands.\n\n\"When,\" says he, \"we reached the city, we had to wait two hours in the prahu (boat or barge) until there had arrived two elephants, caparisoned in silk-cloth, and twelve men, each\n\n* The British Protectorate has obviated the danger.\nfurnished with a porcelain vase, covered with silk, to receive and to cover our presents. We mounted the elephants, the twelve men going before, carrying the presents. We thus proceeded to the house of the Governor, who gave us a supper of many dishes. Next day we were left at our leisure until twelve o'clock, when we proceeded to the King's palace. We were mounted, as before, on elephants, the men bearing the gifts going before us. From the Governor's house to the palace the streets were full of people armed with swords, lances and targets; the King had so ordered it. Still mounted on the elephants we entered the court of the palace. We then dismounted, ascended a stair, accompanied by the Governor and some chiefs and entered a great hall full of courtiers. Here we were seated on carpets, the presents being placed near to us. At the end of the great hall, but raised above it, there was one of less extent hung with silken cloth, in which were two curtains, on raising which, there appeared two windows, which lighted the hall. Here, as a guard to the King, there were three hundred men with naked rapiers in hand resting on their thighs. At the farther end of this smaller hall, there was a great window with a brocade curtain before it, on raising which, we saw the King seated at a table masticating betel, and a little boy, his son, beside him. Behind him women only were to be seen. A chieftain then informed us, that we must not address the King directly, but that if we had anything to say, we must say it to him, and he would communicate it to a courtier of higher rank than himself within the lesser hall. This person, in his turn, would explain our wishes to the Governor's brother, and he, speaking through a tube in an aperture of the wall would communicate our sentiments to a courtier near the King, who would make them known to his Majesty. Meanwhile, we were instructed to make three obeisances to the King with the joined hands over the head, and raising first one foot and then the other, and then kissing the hands. This is the royal salutation.\n\nAll the persons present in the palace had their loins covered with gold embroidered cloth and silk, wore poniards with golden hilts, orna-\nmented with pearls and precious stones, and had many rings on their fingers.\n\nWe remounted the elephants and returned to the house of the Governor.\n\nThere came to the house of the Governor ten men, with as many large wooden trays, in each of which were ten or twelve porcelain saucers with the flesh of various animals, that is, of calves, capons, pullets, pea-fowls and others, and various kinds of fish, so that of meat alone there were thirty or two-and-thirty dishes. We supped on the ground on mats of palm-leaf. At each mouthful we drank a porcelain cupful, the size of an egg, of a distilled liquor made from rice. We ate also rice and sweetmeats, using spoons of gold, shaped like our own. In the place where we passed the two nights, there were always burning two torches of white wax, placed on tall chandeliers of silver, and two oil lamps of four wicks each, while two men watched to look after them.\n\nNext morning we came on the same elephants to the sea side, where forthwith there were ready for us two prahu, in which we were reconducted to the ships.\" Of the town itself he says\u2014\"The city is entirely built in the salt water, the King's house and those of some chieftains excepted. It contains 25,000 acres, or families. The houses are all of wood and stand on strong piles to keep them high from the ground. When the flood tide makes, the women, in boats, go through the city selling necessaries. In front of the King's palace there is a rampart constructed of large bricks, with barbicans in the manner of a fortress, on which are mounted fifty-six brass and six iron cannon.\" With the exception of the statement concerning the number of families, Mr. Crawford considers Pigafetta's account contains abundant internal evidence of intelligence and truthfulness. I may be allowed to point out that, seeing only the King's house and those of some of the nobles were on terra firma, there could have been little use for elephants in the city and probably the two elephants Pigafetta mentions were the only ones there, kept for State purposes. It is a curious fact that though in its fauna Borneo\nmuch resembles Sumatra, yet, while elephants abound in the latter island, none are to be found in Borneo, except in a restricted area on the North-East Coast, in the territories of the North Borneo Company. It would appear, too, that the tenets of the Mahomedan religion were not strictly observed in those days. Now, no Brunei noble would think of offering you spirits, nor would ladies on any account be permitted to appear in public, especially if Europeans were among the audience. The consumption of spirits seems to have been on a very liberal scale, and it is not surprising to find PHILLIPPIA remarking further on that some of the Spaniards became intoxicated. Spoons, whether of gold or other material, have long since been discarded by all respectable Brunais; only Pagans make use of such things; the Mahomedans employ the fingers which Allah has given them. The description of the women holding their market in boats stands good to-day, but the wooden houses, instead of being on \"strong piles,\" now stand on rickety, round nubong palm posts. The description of the obeisance to the King is scarcely exaggerated, except that it is now performed squatting cross-legged\u2014sita\u2014the respectful attitude indoors, from the Sanskrit sit, to meditate, to worship, for an interior never stands in the presence of his superior, and has been dispensed with in the case of Europeans who shake hands. Though the nobles have now comparatively little power, they address each other and are addressed by the commonalty in the most respectful tone, words derived from the Sanskrit being often employed in addressing superiors, or equals if both are of high rank, such as Baganda, Dada, Paduka, Landa, and in addressing a superior the speaker only alludes to himself as a slave, Amba, Sahana. I have already referred to the prohibition of the use of yellow by others than the Royal family, and may add that it is a grave offence for a person of ordinary rank to pass the palace steps with his umbrella up, and it is forbidden to him to sit in the after part of his boat or canoe, that place being reserved for nobles. At an audience with the Sultan or with one of the Wazirs considerable ceremony is still observed. Whatever the time of the day, a thick bees' wax candle about three\nfeet long is lighted and placed on the floor alongside the European visitor, if he is a person of any rank, and it is etiquette for him to carry the candle away with him at the conclusion of his visit, especially if at night. It was a severe test of the courteous decorum of the Malay nobles when on one occasion, a young officer, who accompanied me, not only spilt his cup of coffee over his bright new uniform, but, when impressively bidding adieu to H. H. the Sultan, stood for some time unconsciously astride over my lighted candle. Not a muscle of the faces of the nobles moved, but the Europeans were scarcely so successful in maintaining their gravity.\n\nMr. Dalrymple's description of Brunei, furnished to the Field in August, 1884, is as follows: \"On a broad river sweeping round in an imposing curve from the South-Eastward, with abrupt ranges of sandstone hills, for the most part cleared of forest, hemming it in on either side, and a glimpse of lofty blue mountains towering skywards far away to the North-East, is a long straggling collection of atop (thatch made of leaves of nihong palm, and kajang (mat of ditto) houses, or rather huts, built on piles over the water, and forming a gigantic crescent on either bank of the broad, curving stream. This is the city of Brunei, the capital of the Yang di Pertuan, the Sultan of Brunei, atop one hundred or more, and now in his dotage, the abode of some 15,000 Malays, whose language is as different from the Singapore Malay as Cornish is from Cockney English, and the cogn of vantage from which a set of effete and corrupt Pangerans extended oppressive rule over the coast of North-West Borneo, from Sampanganjau Point to the Sarawak River in days gone by ere British enterprise stepped in, swept the Sulu and Ilanun pirates from the sea, and opened the rivers to commercial enterprise.\n\nStanding on the summit of one of the above-mentioned hills, a fine bird's eye view is obtained of the city below. The ramshackle houses are all built in irregular blocks or clusters, but present on either side a regular frontage to the broad river, and following its sweeping curve, form two imposing crescent, divided by a fine water-way. Behind these main\ncrescents are various other blocks and clusters of buildings, built higgledy piggledy and without plan of any sort. On the true left bank are some Chinese shops built of brick, and on the opposite bank a brick house of superior pretensions and a waving banner proclaiming the abode of the Chinese Consular Agent of the British North Borneo Company.\n\nA heterogeneous collection of buildings on the right side of the upper part of the city forms the palace (save the mark!) of the Sultan himself. A little further down a large, straggling, but substantial plank building, with a corrugated iron roof, marks the abode of the Pangeran Temenggong, a son of the former Sultan and the heir apparent to the throne of Brunei. Two steam launches are lying opposite at anchor, one the property of the Sultan, the other belonging to the heir apparent.\n\nThe public reception room of the Sultan's palace is a long apartment with wooden pillars running along either side, and supporting a raised roof. Beyond these on either side, are lateral compartments. At the far end, in the centre of a kind of alcove, is the Sultan's throne. The floors are covered with matting.\n\nAlthough the glories of Brunei have departed, and it is only the shadow of what it was when Pigafetta visited it, a certain amount of state is still kept up on occasions. A boat comes sweeping down the river crowded with Malays, a white flag waving from its stern, seven paddles flashing on either side, and an array of white umbrellas midships. It is the Pangeran di Gadong coming in state to pay a ceremonial visit. As it sweeps alongside, the Pangeran is seen sitting on a gorgeous carpet, surrounded by his officials. One holds an umbrella over his head, while another holds aloft the tongkat kudian, a long gilded staff, surmounted by a plume of yellow horse hair, which hangs down round it. The most striking point in the attire of the Pangeran and his Officers is the beauty of the krises with which they are armed, the handles being of carved ivory ornamented with gold, and the sheaths of beautifully polished wood, resembling satin wood. Cigars and coffee are produced, and a bichara ensues.\nQuakers' meeting is no bad metaphor to describe a Malay bichara. The Pangerans sit round in a circle smoking solemnly for some time until a question is put to them, to which a brief reply is given, followed by another prolonged pause.\n\nIn this way the business on which they have come is gradually approached.\n\nTheir manners are as polished as their faces are immobile, and the way to a Malay's heart lies through his pocket.\n\nTo the outsider, Brunei is a city of hideous old women, for such alone are met with in the thronged market place where some hundreds of market boats jostle each other, while their inmates shriek and haggle over their bargains, or during a water promenade while threading the labyrinths of this Oriental Venice; but if acquainted with its intricacies, or if paying a ceremonial visit to any of the leading Pangerans, many a glimpse may be had of some fair skinned beauty peeping through some handy crevice in the kayang wall, or, in the latter case a crowd of light-skinned, dark-eyed houris may be seen looking with all their might out of a window in the harem behind, from which they are privileged to peep into the hall of audience.\n\nThe present population of Brunei cannot exceed 12,000 to 15,000 souls, a great number having succumbed to the terrible epidemic of cholera a year ago. The exports consist of sago, gutta percha, camphor, india-rubber, edible birds' nests, gum dammar, etc., and what money there is in the city is almost entirely in the hands of the Chinese traders.\n\nIn the old days, when it enjoyed a numerous Chinese population, the surrounding hills were covered with pepper plantations, and there was a large junk trade with China. At present Brunei lives on her exports of jungle produce and sago, furnished by a noble river\u2014the Limbang, whose valley lies but a short distance to the Eastward. One great advantage the city enjoys is a copious supply of pure water, drawn from springs at the base of the hills below the town on the left bank of the river.\n\nSuch is a slight sketch of Brunei of the Bruneis. If the Pangerans are corrupt, the lower classes are not, but are law-\nabiding, though not industrious. And the day may yet come when their city may lift her head up again, and be to North Borneo what Singapore is to the straits of Malacca.\"\n\nThis description gives a capital idea of modern Brunei, and I would only observe that, from the colour of his flag and umbrellas the nobleman who paid the state visit must have been the Bandahara and not the Di Gadong.\n\nThe aged Sultan to whom Mr Dalrymple refers was the late Sultan Mumin, who, though not in the direct line, was raised to the throne, on the death of the Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin, to whom he had been Prime Minister, by the influence of the English, towards whom he had always acted as a loyal friend. He was popularly supposed to be over a hundred years old when he died and, though said to have had some fifty wives and concubines, he was childless. He died on the 29th May, 1885, having previously, on the advice of Sir C. C. Lees, then British Consul-General, declared his Temenggong, the son of Omar Ali Saifuddin to be his successor. The Temenggong ascended the throne, without any opposition, with the title of Sultan, but found a kingdom distracted by rebellion in the provinces and reduced to less than a fourth of its size when the treaty was made with Great Britain in 1847.\n\nI have said that there is no ground rent in Borneo, and that every one builds his own house and is his own landlord, but I should add that he builds his house in the kampong, or parish, to which, according to his occupation, he belongs and into which the city is divided. For instance, on entering the city, the first kampong on the left is an important one in a town where fish is the principal article of animal food. It is the kampong of the men who catch fish by means of bambu fishing stakes, or traps, described hereafter, and supply the largest quantity of that article to the market; it is known as the Kampong Pablat.\n\nNext to it is the Kampong Perambat, from the casting net which its inhabitants use in fishing. Another parish is called Membakut and its houses are built on firm ground, being principally the shops of Chinese and Klings. The last kam-\npong on this side is that of Burong Pingi, formerly a very important one, where dwelt the principal and richest Malay traders. It is now much reduced in size European steamers and Chinese enterprise having altered entirely the character of the trade from the time when the old Brunei nakedahs (master or owner of a trading boat) would cruise leisurely up and down the coast, waiting for months at a time in a river while trade was being brought in. The workers in brass, the jewellers, the makers of gold brocade, of mats, of brass guns, the oil manufacturers, and the rice cleaners, all have their own kampongs, and are jealous of the honour of each member of their corporation. The Sultan and nearly all the chief nobles have their houses on the true left bank of the river, i.e., on the right bank ascending.\n\nThe fishing interest is an important one, and various methods are employed to capture the supply for the market.\n\nThe kilong is a weir composed of nets made of split bambu, fastened in an upright position, side by side, to posts fixed into the bed of the stream, or into the sand in the shallow water of a harbour. There are two long rows of these posts with attached nets, one much longer than the other which gradually converge in the deeper water, where a simple trap is constructed with a narrow entrance. The fish passing up or down stream, meeting with the obstruction, follow up the walls of the kilong and eventually enter the trap, whence they are removed at low water. These kilong, or fishing stakes as they are termed, are a well known sight to all travellers entering Malay ports and rivers. All sorts of fish are caught in this way, and alligators of some size are occasionally secured in them.\n\nThe rambat is a circular casting net, loaded with leaden or iron weights at the circumference, and with a spread sometimes of thirty feet. Great skill, acquired by long practice, is shown by the fisherman in throwing this net over a shoal of fish which he has sighted, in such a manner that all the outer edge touches the water simultaneously, the weights then cause the edges of the circumference to sink and gradually close together, encompassing the fish, and the net is drawn\nup by a rope attached to its centre, the other end of which the fisherman had retained in his hand. The skill of the thrower is further enhanced by the fact that he, as a rule, balances himself in the bow of a small \"dug-out,\" or canoe, in which a European could scarcely keep his footing at all. The ramhat can also be thrown from the bank, or the beach, and is used in fresh and salt water. Only small fish and prawns are caught in this way. Prawns are also caught in small kelongs with very fine split bambu nets, but a method is also employed in the Brunei river which I have not heard of elsewhere. A specially prepared canoe is made use of, the gunwale on one side being cut away and its place taken up by a flat ledge, projecting over the water. The fisherman sits paddling in the stern, keeping the ledged side towards the bank and leaning over so as to cause the said ledge to be almost level with the water.\n\nFrom the same side there projects a long bambu, with wooden teeth on its under side, like a comb, fastened to the stern, but projecting outwards, forwards and slightly upwards, the teeth increasing in length towards its far end, and as they sweep the surface of the water the startled prawns, shut in by the bank on one side, in their efforts to avoid the teeth of the comb, jump into the canoe in large quantities.\n\nI have described the method of using the dip net, or serambau, on page 42. Many kinds of nets are in use, one\u2014the pukat\u2014being similar to our seine or drag net.\n\nThe hook and line are also used, especially for deep sea fishing, and fish of large size are thus caught.\n\nA favourite occasional amusement is tuba fishing. The tuba is a plant the juice of which has strong narcotic properties. Bundles of the roots are collected and put into the bottom of the canoes, and when the fishing ground is reached, generally a bend in a river, or the mouth of a stream which is barred at low tide, water is poured over the tuba and the juice expressed by beating it with short sticks. The fluid, thus charged with the narcotic poison, is then baled out of the canoes into the stream and the surface is quickly covered by all sorts of fish in all stages of intoxication, the smaller ones\neven succumbing altogether to the poison.\n\nThe large fish are secured by spearing, amid much excitement, the eager sportsmen often overbalancing themselves and falling headlong into the water to the great amusement of the more lucky ones. I remember reading an account of a dignified representative of Her Majesty once joining in the sport and displaying a pair of heels in this way to his admiring subjects. The tuba does not affect the flesh of the fish, which is brought to the table without any special preparation.\n\nThe principal export from Brunei is sago flour. The sago palm is known to the natives under the name of rumah, the pith, after its first preliminary washing, is called lamantah (i.e., raw), and after its preparation for export by the Chinese, sagu. The botanical name is Metroxylon, M. Lexis being that of the variety the trunk of which is unprotected, and M. Rumphi that of the kind which is armed with long and strong spikes, serving to ward off the attacks of the wild pigs from the young palm.\n\nThis palm is indigenous in the Malayan Archipelago and grows to the height of twenty to forty feet, in swampy land along the banks of rivers not far from the sea, but out of the reach of tidal influences. A plantation once started goes \"on for ever,\" with scarcely any care or attention from the proprietor, as the palm propagates itself by numerous off-shoots, which take the place of the parent tree when it is cut down for the purpose of being converted into food, or when it dies, which, unlike most other palms, it does after it has once flowered and seeded, i.e., after it has attained the age of ten or fifteen years.\n\nIt can also be propagated from the seed, but these are often unproductive.\n\nIf required for food purposes, the sago palm must be cut down at its base before it begins to flower, as afterwards the pith or farina becomes dried up and useless. The trunk is then stripped of its leaves and, if it is intended to work it up at its owner's house, it is cut into convenient lengths and floated down the river; if the pith is to be extracted on the spot the trunk is split in two, longitudinally, and is found to\ncontain a mass of starchy pith, kept together by filaments of woody fibre, and when this is worked out by means of bamboo hatchets nothing but a thin rind, the outer bark, is left. To separate the starch from the woody fibre, the pith is placed on a mat in a frame work over a trough by the river side; the sago washer then mounts up and, pouring fresh water over the pith, commences vigorously dancing about on it with his bare feet, the result being that the starch becomes dissolved in the water and runs off with it into the trough below, while the woody fibre remains on the mat and is thrown away, or, if the washer is not a Mahomedan, used for fattening pigs. The starch thus obtained is not yet quite pure, and under the name of lamantah is sold to Chinese and undergoes a further process of washing, this time by hand, in large, solid, wooden troughs and tubs. When sufficiently purified, it is sun-dried and, as a fine white flour, is packed in gunny bags for the Singapore market. At Singapore, some of this flour\u2014a very small proportion\u2014is converted into the pearl sago of the shops, but the greater portion is sent on direct to Europe, where it is used for sizing cloth, in the manufacture of beer, for confectionery, &c.\n\nIt will be seen that the sago palm thus affords food and also employment to a considerable number of both natives and Chinese and, requiring little or no trouble in cultivation, it is a perfect gift of the gods to the natives in the districts where it occurs. It is a curious fact that, though abounding in Sarawak, in the districts near Brunei and in the southern parts of British North Borneo on the West Coast, it seems to stop short suddenly at the Putatan River, near Gaya Bay, and is not found indigenous in the North nor on the North-East. Some time ago I sent a quantity of young shoots to a Chief living on the Labuk River, near Sandakan, on the East Coast, but have not yet heard whether they have proved a success.\n\nA nasty sour smell is inseparable from a sago factory, but the health of the coolies, who live in the factory, does not appear to be affected by it.\n\nThe Brunais and natives of sago districts consume a considerable quantity of sago flour, which is boiled into a thick,\ntasteless paste, called boya and eaten by being twisted into a large ball round a stick and inserted into the mouth\u2014an ungraceful operation. Tamarind, or some very acid sauce is used to impart to it some flavour. Sago is of course cheaper than rice, but the latter is, as a rule, much preferred by the native, and is found more nutritious and lasting. Logan, in the Journal of the Indian Archipelago, calculates that three sago palms yield more nutritive matter than an acre of wheat, and six trees more than an acre of potatoes. The plantain and banana also flourish, under cultivation, in Borneo, and Mr. Burbidge, in his preface to the Gardens of the Sun, points out that it fruits all the year round and that its produce is to that of wheat as $133:1$, and to that of the potato as $44:1$.\n\nWhat a Paradise! some of my readers will exclaim. There can be no want here! I am sure the figures and calculations above quoted are absolutely correct, but I have certainly seen want and poverty in Borneo, and these tropical countries are not quite the earthly paradises which some old writers would have us believe. For our poor British \"unemployed,\" at any rate, I fear Borneo can never be a refuge, as the sun would there be more fatal than the deadly cold here, and the race could not be kept up without visits to colder climates. But if sago and bananas are so plentiful and so nourishing, as we are taught by the experts, it does seem somewhat remarkable, in this age of invention, that some means cannot be devised of bringing together the prolific food stores of the East and the starving thousands of the West.\n\nBoth before, during and after the day's work, the Malays, man and woman, boy and girl, solace and refresh themselves with tobacco and with the areca-nut, or the betel nut, as, for some unexplained reason, it is called in English books, though betel is the name of the pepper leaf in which the areca-nut is wrapped and with which it is masticated.\n\nA good deal of the tobacco now used in Brunei is imported from Java or Palembang (Sumatra), but a considerable portion is grown in the hilly districts on the West Coast of North Borneo, in the vicinity of Gaya Bay, by the Muruts. It is unfermented and sun-dried, but has not at all a bad flavour.\nand is sometimes used by European pipe smokers. The Brunai Malays and the natives generally, as a rule, smoke the tobacco in the form of cigarettes, the place of paper being taken by the fine inner leaf of the nipa palm, properly prepared by drying. The Court cigarettes are monstrous things, fully eight inches long sometimes, and deftly fashioned by the fingers of the ladies of the harem.\n\nSome of the inland natives, who are unable to procure nipa leaf (dahun kirei), use roughly made wooden pipes, and the leaf of the maize plant is also occasionally substituted for the nipa. It is a common practice with persons of both sexes to insert a \"quid\" of tobacco in their cheek, or between the upper lip and the gum. This latter practice does not add to the appearance of a race not overburdened with facial charms. The tobacco is allowed to remain in position for a long time, but it is not chewed. The custom of areca-nut chewing has been so often described that I will only remind the reader that the nut is the produce of a graceful and slender palm, which flourishes under cultivation in all Malayan countries and is called by Malays pinang. It is of about the size of a nutmeg and, for chewing, is cut into pieces of convenient size and made into a neat little packet with the green leaf of the aromatic betel pepper plant, and with the addition of a little gambier (the inspissated juice of the leaves of the uncaria gambir) and of lime, prepared by burning sea shells. Thus prepared, the bolus has an undoubtedly stimulating effect on the nerves and promotes the flow of saliva. I have known fresh vigour put into an almost utterly exhausted boat's crew by their partaking of this stimulant.\n\nIt tinges the saliva and the lips bright red, but, contrary to a very commonly received opinion, has no effect of making the teeth black. This blackening of the teeth is produced by rubbing in burnt coco-nut shell, pounded up with oil, the dental enamel being sometimes first filed off. Toothache and decayed teeth are almost unknown amongst the natives, but whether this is in some measure due to the chewing of the areca-nut I am unable to say.\n\nIt used to be a disagreeable, but not unusual sight, to see\nthe old Sultan at an audience remove the areca-nut he had been masticating and hand it to a small boy, who placed it in his mouth and kept it there until the aged monarch again required it.\n\nThe clothing of the Brunei Malays is simple and suitable to the climate. The one garment common to men, women and children is the sarong, which in its general signification means a sheath or covering, e.g., the sheath of a sword is a sarong, and the envelope enclosing a letter is likewise its sarong. The sarong or sheath of the Brunei human being is a piece of cotton cloth, of Tartan pattern, sewn down the side and resembling an ordinary skirt, or petticoat, except that it is not pleated or attached to a band at the waist and is, therefore, the same width all the way down. It is worn as a petticoat, being fastened at the waist sometimes by a belt or girdle, but more often the upper part is merely twisted into its own folds. Both men and women frequently wear nothing but this garment, the men being naked from the waist up, but the women generally concealing the breasts by fastening the sarong high up under the arms; but for full dress the women wear in addition a short sleeved jacket of dark blue cotton cloth, reaching to the waist, the tight sleeves being ornamented with a row of half-a-dozen jingling buttons, of gold if possible, and a round hat of plaited pandan (screw-pine) leaves, or of nipah leaf completes the Brunei woman's costume. No stockings, slippers, or shoes are worn. Ladies of rank and wealth substitute silk and gold brocade for the cotton material used by their poorer sisters and, in lieu of a hat, cover their head and the greater part of the face with a selendang, or long scarf of gold brocade. They occasionally also wear slippers. The gold brocade is a specialty of Brunei manufacture and is very handsome, the gold thread being woven in tasteful patterns on a ground of yellow, green, red or dark blue silk. The materials are obtained from China. The cotton sarongs are also woven in Brunei of European cotton twist, but inferior and cheap imitations are now imported from Switzerland and Manchester. In addition to the sarong, the Brunei man, when fully dressed, wears a pair of loose cotton trowsers, tied round\nthe waist, and in this case the sarong is so folded as to reach only half way down to the knee, instead of to the ankle, as ordinarily.\n\nA short sleeved cotton jacket, generally white, covers his body and his head dress is a small coloured kerchief called dastar, the Persian word for turban.\n\nThe nobles wear silks instead of cottons and with them a small but handsome kris, stuck into the sarong, is de rigueur for full dress. A gold or silver betel-nut box might almost be considered as part of the full dress, as they are never without one on state occasions, it being carried by an attendant.\n\nThe women are fond of jewellery, and there are some clever gold and silversmiths in the city, whose designs appear to be imitated from the Javanese. Rings, earrings, broaches to fasten the jacket at the neck, elaborate hairpins, massive silver or gold belts, with large gold buckles, and bracelets of gold or silver are the usual articles possessed by a lady of position.\n\nThe characteristic earring is quite a specialty of Brunei art, and is of the size and nearly the shape of a very large champagne cork, necessitating a huge hole being made for its reception in the lobes of the ear. It is made hollow, of gold or silver, or of light wood gilt, or sometimes only painted, or even quite plain, and is stuck, lengthwise, through the hole in the ear, the ends projecting on either side. When the ladies are not in full dress, this hole occasionally affords a convenient receptacle for the cigarette, or any other small article not in use for the time being.\n\nThe men never wear any jewellery, except, perhaps, one silver ring, which is supposed to have come from the holy city\u2014Mecca.\n\nThe Malay kris is too well known to need description here. It is a dagger or poignard with a blade varying in length from six inches to two feet. This blade is not invariably wavy, or serpentine, as often supposed, but is sometimes quite straight. It is always sharp on both edges and is fashioned from iron imported from Singapore, by Brunei artificers. Great\ntaste is displayed in the handle, which is often of delicately carved ivory and gold, and just below the attachment of the handle, the blade is broadened out, forming a hilt, the under edge of which is generally fancifully carved. Age adds greatly to the value of the kris and the history of many is handed down. The highest price I know of being given for a Brunei kris was $100, paid by the present Sultan for one he presented to the British North Borneo Company on his accession to the throne, but I have heard of higher prices being asked. Very handsomely grained and highly polished wood is used for the sheath and the two pieces forming it are frequently so skilfully joined as to have the appearance of being in one. Though naturally a stabbing weapon, the Malays of Brunei generally use it for cutting, and after an amok the blade employed is often found bent out of all shape.\n\nThe parang is simply an ordinary cutlass, with a blade two feet in length. As we generally carry a pocket knife about with us, so the Brunei Malay always wears his parang, or has it near at hand, using it for every purpose where cutting is required, from paring his nails to cutting the posts of which his house is built, or weeding his patch of rice land.\n\nWith this and his blong he performs all his carpentry work; from felling the enormous timber tree in the jungle to the construction of his house and boat. The blong is indeed a most useful implement and can perform wonders in the hands of a Malay. It is in the shape of a small adze, but according to the way it is fitted into the handle it can be used either as an axe or adze. The Malays with this instrument can make planks and posts as smooth as a European carpenter is able to do with his plane.\n\nThe parang ilang is a fighting weapon, with a peculiarity in the shape of the blade which, Dr. Taylor informs me, is not known to occur in the weapons of any other country, and consists in the surface of the near side being flat, as in an ordinary blade, while that of the off side is distinctly convex. This necessitates rather careful handling in the case of a novice, as the convexity is liable to cause the blade to glance off any hard substance and inflict a wound on its wielder.\nThis weapon is manufactured in Brunei, but is the proper arm of the Kyans and, now, also of the Sarawak Dyaks, who are closely allied to them and who, in this as in other matters, such as the curious perforation of a part of their person, which has been described by several writers, are following their example. The Kyans were once the most formidable Sub-Malay tribe in Northern Borneo and have been alluded to in preceding pages. On the West coast, their headquarters is the Baram River, which has recently been added to Sarawak, but they stretch right across to the East Coast and Dutch territory.\n\nThere are many kinds of canoes, from the simple dug-out, with scarcely any free-board, to the pakerangan, a boat the construction of which is confined to only two rivers in North Borneo. It is built up of planks fastened together by wooden pegs, carved fashion, on a small keel, or tanas. It is sharp at both ends, has very good lines, is a good sea boat and well adapted for crossing river bars. It is not made in Brunei itself, but is bought from the makers up the coast and invariably used by the Brunei fishermen, who are the best and most powerful paddlers to be found anywhere. The trading boats\u2014prahus or tongkangs\u2014are clumsy, badly fastened craft, not often exceeding 30 tons burthen, and modelled on the Chinese junk, generally two-masted, the foremast raking forward, and furnished with rattan rigging and large lug sails. This forward rake, I believe, was not unusual, in former days, in European craft, and is said to aid in tacking. The natives now, however, are getting into the way of building and rigging their boats in humble imitation of the Europeans. The prahus are generally furnished with long sweeps, useful when the wind fails and in ascending winding rivers, when the breeze cannot be depended on. The canoes are propelled and steered by single-bladed paddles. They also generally carry a small sail, often made of the remnants of different gaily coloured garments, and a fleet of little craft with their gaudy sails is a pleasing sight on a fresh, bright morning. At the sports held by the Europeans on New Year's Day, the Queen's Birthday and other festivals, native\ncanoe races are always included and are contested with the keenest possible excitement by the competitors. A Brunei Malay takes to the water and to his tiny canoe almost before he is able to walk. Use has with him become second nature and, really, I have known some Brunei men paddle all day long, chatting and singing and chewing betel-nut, as though they felt it no exertion whatever.\n\nIn the larger canoes one sees the first step towards a fixed rudder and tiller, a modified form of paddle being fixed securely to one side of the stern, in such a way that the blade can be turned so as either to have its edges fore and aft, or its sides presented at a greater or less angle to the water, according to the direction in which it is desired to steer the boat.\n\nI was much interested, in going over the Pitt-Rivers collection, at the Oxford University Museum, to find that in the model of a Viking boat the steering gear is arranged in almost exactly the same manner as that of the modern Malay canoe, and indeed, the lines generally of the two boats are somewhat alike.\n\nTo the European novice, paddling is severe work, more laborious than rowing; but then a Brunei man is always in \"training,\" more or less; he is a teetotaller and very temperate in eating and drinking: indeed the amount of fluid they take is, considering the climate, wonderfully small. They scarcely drink during meals, and afterwards, as a rule, only wash their mouths out, instead of taking a long draught like the European.\n\nMr. Dalrymple is right in saying that a State visit is like a Quakers' meeting. Seldom is any important business more than broached on such an occasion; the details of difficult negotiations are generally discussed and arranged by means of confidential agents, who often find it to their pecuniary advantage to prolong matters to the limit of their employer's patience. The Brunei Malays are very nice, polite fellows to have to deal with, but they have not the slightest conception of the value of time, and the expression nanti dahulu (wait a bit) is as often in their mouths as that of matua (by-and-by) is by Miss Gordon Cumming said to be in those of the Fijians.\nA lady friend of mine, who found a difficulty in acquiring Malay, pronounced nanti dahulu, or nanti dulu as generally spoken, \"nanti doodle,\" and suggested that \"the nanti doodles\" could be a good name for \"the Brunei Malays.\"\n\nAs writing is a somewhat rare accomplishment, state documents are not signed but sealed\u2014\"chopped\" it is called\u2014and much importance is accordingly attached to the official seals or chops, which are large circular metal stamps, and the chop is affixed by oiling the stamps, blacking it over the flame of a candle and pressing it on the document to be sealed. The chop bears, in Arabic characters, the name, style and title of the Official using it. The Sultan's Chop is the Great Seal of State and is distinguished by being the only one of which the circumference can be quite round and unbroken; the edges of those of the Wazirs are always notched.\n\nBy the aboriginal tribes of Borneo, the Brunei people are always spoken of as Orang Abai, or Abai men, but though I have often enquired both of the aborigines and of the Brunais themselves, I have not been able to obtain any explanation of the term, nor of its derivation.\n\nAs already stated, the religion of the Brunais is Mahommedanism; but they do not observe its precepts and forms with any very great strictness, nor are they proselytisers, so that comparatively few of the surrounding pagans have embraced the religion of their conquerors.\n\nMany of their old superstitions still influence them, as, in the early days of Christianity, the belief in the old heathen gods and goddesses were found underlying the superstructure of the new faith and tinging its ritual and forms of worship. There still flourishes and survives, influencing to the present day the life of the Brunais, the old Spirit worship and a real belief in the power of evil spirits (hantu) to cause ill-luck, sickness and death, to counteract which spells, charms and prayers are made use of, together with propitiatory offerings. Most of them wear some charm to ward off sickness, and others to shield them from death in battle. If you are travelling in the jungle and desire to quench your thirst at a brook, your Brunei follower will first lay his parang, or cutlass in the bed\nof the stream, with its point towards the source, so that the Spirit of the brook shall be powerless to harm you.\n\nIn caves and on small islands you frequently find platforms and little models of houses and boats\u2014propitiatory offerings to hantus. In times of general sickness a large model of a boat is sometimes made and decked with flags and launched out to sea in the hope that the evil spirit who has brought the epidemic may take his departure therein. At Labuan it was difficult to prevail on a Malay messenger to pass after sunset by the gaol, where executions took place, or by the churchyard, for fear of the ghosts haunting those localities.\n\nJavanese element, and Hindu work in gold has been discovered buried in the island of Pappan, situated between Labuan and Brunei. Mr. INCHE MAHOMET, H. B. M.'s Consular Agent in Brunei, was good enough to procure for me a native history of Brunei, called the Telsetah Besar, or principal history. This history states that the first Mahomedan Sovereign of Brunei was Sultan MAHOMET and that, before his conversion and investiture by the Sultan of Johor, his kingdom had been tributary to the State of Majapahit, on the fall of which kingdom the Brunei Government transferred its allegiance to Johor. Majapahit* was the last Javanese kingdom professing Hinduism, and from its overthrow dates the triumph of Mahomedanism in Java. This occurred in A.D. 1478, which, if the chronicle can be trusted, must have been about the period of the commencement of the Mahomedan period in Brunei. Inclusive of this Sultan MAHOMET and of the late Sultan MUMIN, who died in May, 1885, twenty-three Mahomedan Sultans have reigned in Brunei and, allowing eighteen years for an average reign, this brings us within a few years of the date assigned to the overthrow of the kingdom of Majapahit, and bears testimony to the reliability of the chronicle. I will quote the first few paragraphs of the Telsetah, as they will give the reader an idea of a Brunei history and also because they allude to the connection of the Chinese with Borneo and afford a fanciful explanation of the origin of the name of the mountain of\n\n* Crawfurd's Dictionary\u2014Indian Islands\u2014Majapahit.\nKinabalu, in British North Borneo, which is 13,700 feet in height:\u2014\n\nThis is the genealogy of all the R\u00e1jas who have occupied the royal throne of the Government of Brunai, the abode of peace, from generation to generation, who inherited the royal drum and the bell, the tokens from the country of Johore, kamal almakam, and who also possessed the royal drum from Menangkabau, namely, from the country of Sagun-tang.\n\nThis was the commencement of the kingdom of Brunai and of the introduction of the Mahomedan religion and of the Code of Laws of the prophet, the beloved of God, in the country of Brunai; that is to say (in the reign of) His Highness Sultan MAHOMET. But before His Majesty's time the country of Brunai was still infidel, and a dependency of Majapahit. On the death of the Batara of Majapahit and of the PATIH GAJA MEDAH the kingdom of Majapahit fell, and Brunai ceased to pay tribute, which used to consist of one jar of the juice of the young betel-nut every year.\n\nIn the time of the Sultan BAHTRI of the kingdom of Johor, PATIH ALAK BERATA and PATIH BERBAHI were summoned to Johor, and the former was appointed Sultan MAHOMET by the Sultan of Johor, who conferred on him the royal drum and assigned him five provinces, namely, Kaluka, Seribas, Sadong, Samarahan and Sarawak. PATIH BERBAHI was given the title of Bandhara Sri Maharaja. After a stay of some little time in Johor, His Highness the Sultan MAHOMET returned to Brunai; but His Highness had no male issue and only one daughter. At that time also the Emperor of China ordered two of his ministers to obtain possession of the precious stone of the dragon of the mountain Kinabalu.\n\nNumbers of Chinese were devoured by the dragon and still possession was not obtained of the stone. For this reason they gave the mountain the name of Kinabalu (Kina = Chinese; batu = widow).\n\nThe name of one of the Chinese Ministers was ONG KANG and of another ONG SUM PING, and the latter had recourse to a stratagem. He made a box with glass sides and placed a large lighted candle therein, and\n\"when the dragon went forth to feed, Ong Sum Ping\n\"seized the precious stone and put the lamp in its place and\n\"the dragon mistook it for the precious stone. Having now\n\"obtained possession of the precious stone all the junks set\n\"sail for China, and when they had got a long way off from\n\"Kinabalu, Ong Kang asked Ong Sum Ping for the stone,\n\"and thereupon a quarrel ensued between them. Ong Kang\n\"continued to press his demand for the precious stone, and\n\"Ong Sum Ping became out of humour and sullen and refused\n\"to return to China and made his way back to Brunei. On\n\"arriving there, he espoused the Princess, the daughter of\n\"Sultan Mahomet, and he obtained the title of Sultan\n\"Ahamat.\n\n\"The Sultan Ahamat had one daughter, who was remark-\n\"ably beautiful. It came to pass that a Sheriff named Alli,\n\"a descendant of Amir Hassan (one of the grandchildren\n\"of the prophet) came from the country of Taif to Brunei.\n\"Hearing of the fame of the beauty of the Sultan's daughter,\n\"he became enamoured of her and the Sultan accepted him\n\"as his son-in-law and the Government of Brunei was hand-\n\"ed over to him by His Highness and he was styled Sultan\n\"Berkat. He enforced the Code of Laws of the beloved\n\"of God and erected a mosque in Brunei, and, moreover,\n\"ordered the Chinese population to make a stone fort.\"\n\nThe connection of the Chinese with Brunei was an import-\nant event in Borneo history and it was certainly to them that\nthe flourishing condition of the capital when visited by\nPigafetta in 1521 was due. They were the sole planters of\nthe pepper gardens, the monopoly of the trade in the produce\nof which the East India Company negotiated for in 1774,\nwhen the crop was reported to the Company to have been\n4,000 pikuls, equal to about 240 tons, valued on the spot at 17\u00bd\nSpanish dollars per pikul. The Company's Agent expressly\nreported that the Chinese were the only pepper planters,\nthat the aborigines did not plant it, and that the produce\nwas disposed of to Chinese junks, which visited the port\nand which he trusted would, when the exclusive trade in\nthis article was in the hands of the Company, be diverted\nfrom Brunei to Balambangan.\n\nThe station at this latter island, as already mentioned, was abandoned in 1775, and the English trade with Brunei appears soon afterwards to have come to an end.\n\nFrom extracts from the Journal of the Batavia Society of Arts and Sciences published in The British North Borneo Herald of the 1st October, 1886, the first mention of Brunei in Chinese history appears to be in the year 669, when the King of Polo, which is stated to be another name for Brunei (corruption of \"Brunei\"), sent an envoy to Pekin, who came to Court with the envoy of Siam. Again, in the year 1406, another Brunei envoy was appointed, who took with him a tribute of the products of the country, and the chronicle goes on to say that it is reported \"that the present King is a man from Fukien, who followed Cheng Ho when he went to this country and who settled there.\"\n\nThis account was written in 1618 and alludes to the Chinese shipping then frequenting Brunei. It is by some supposed that the northern portion of Borneo was the destination of the unsuccessful expedition which Kublai Khan sent out in the year 1292.\n\nTowards the close of the eighteenth century a Government seems to have arisen in Brunei which knew not Ong Sum Ping and, in 1809, Mr. Hunt reported that Chinese junks had ceased visiting Brunei and, owing no doubt to the rapacious and piratical character of the native Government, the pepper gardens were gradually deserted and the Chinese left the country. A few of the natives had, however, acquired the art of pepper cultivation, especially the Dusuns of Pappar, Kimanis and Bundu and when the Colony of Labuan was founded, 1846, there was still a small trade in pepper with those rivers. The Brunei Rajas, however, received their revenues and taxes in this commodity and their exorbitant demands gradually led to the abandonment of its cultivation.\n\nThese rivers have since passed under the Government of the British North Borneo Company, and in Bundu, owing partly to the security now afforded to life and property and partly to the very high price which pepper at present realizes\non account of the Dutch blockade of Achin\u2014Achin having been of late years the principal pepper-growing country\u2014the natives are again turning their attention to this article. I may remark here that the people of Bundu claim and shew evidence of Chinese descent, and even set up in their houses the little altar and joss which one is accustomed to see in Chinamen's shops. The Brunei Malays call the Chinese Orang Kina and evidence of their connection with Borneo is seen in such names as Kina-batangan, a river near Sandakan on the north-east coast, Kina-balu, the mountain above referred to, and Kina-benua, a district in Labuan. They have also left their mark in the very superior mode of cultivation and irrigation of rice fields on some rivers on the north-west coast as compared with the primitive mode practised in other parts of Northern Borneo. It is now the object of the Governments of Sarawak and of British North Borneo to attract Chinese to their respective countries by all the means in their power. This has, to a considerable extent, been successfully achieved by the present Raja Brooke, and a large area of his territory is now under pepper cultivation with a very marked influence on the public revenues. This subject will be again alluded to when I come to speak of British North Borneo.\n\nIt would appear that Brunei was once or twice attacked by the Spaniards, the last occasion being in 1645.* It has also had the honour in more recent times, of receiving the attentions of a British naval expedition which was brought about in this wise. Sir James, then Mr. Brooke, had first visited Sarawak in 1839 and found the district in rebellion against its ruler, a Brunei Raja named Muda Hassim, who, being a friend to the English, received Mr. Brooke with cordiality. Mr. Brooke returned to Sarawak in the following year and this time assisted Muda Hassim to put down the rebellion and finally, on the 24th September, 1841, the Malay Raja\n\n* Captain Rodney Mynors, R.N., states that in 1846 he captured at Brunei ten large Spanish brass guns, the longest being 14 feet 6 inches, cast in the time of Charles III of Spain and the most beautiful specimens of workmanship he had ever seen. Charles III reigned between 1759 and 1788.\nretired from his position as Governor in favour of the Englishman.\n\nThe agreement to so transfer the Government was not signed without the application of a little pressure, for we find the following account of it in Mr. Brooke's Journal, edited by Captain Rodney Mundy, R. N., in two volumes, and published by John Murray in 1848:\u2014 \"October 1st, 1841. 'Events of great importance have occurred during the last month. I will shortly narrate them. The advent of the Royalist and Swift and a second visit from the Diana on her return from Brunei with the shipwrecked crew of the Sultanah strengthened my position, as it gave evidence that the Singapore authorities were on the alert, and otherwise did good to my cause by creating an impression amongst the natives of my power and influence with the Governor of the Straits Settlements. Now, then, was my time for pushing measures to extremity against my subtle enemy the arch-intriguer Makota.' This Chief was a Malay hostile to English interest. 'I had previously made several strong remonstrances, and urged for an answer to a letter I had addressed to Muda Hassim, in which I had recapitulated in detail the whole particulars of our agreement, concluding by a positive demand either to allow me to retrace my steps by repayment of the sums which he had induced me to expend, or to confer upon me the grant of the Government of the country according to his repeated promises; and I ended by stating that if he would not do either one or the other I must find means to right myself. Thus did I, for the first time since my arrival in the land, present anything in the shape of a menace before the Raja, my former remonstrances only going so far as to threaten to take away my own person and vessels from the river.' Mr. Brooke's demand for an investigation into Makota's conduct was politely shelved and Mr. Brooke deemed 'the moment for action had now arrived. My conscience told me that I was bound no longer to submit to such injustice, and I was resolved to test the strength of our respective parties. Repairing on board the yacht, I mustered my people, explain-\n\"ed my intentions and mode of operation, and having loaded\nthe vessel's guns with grape and canister, and brought her\nbroadside to bear, I proceeded on shore with a detachment\nfully armed, and taking up a position at the entrance of the\nRaja's palace, demanded and obtained an immediate audience\nIn a few words I pointed out the villany of Makota, his\ntyranny and oppression of all classes, and my determination\nto attack him by force, and drive him from the country. I\nexplained to the Raja that several Chiefs and a large body of\nSiniawan Dyaks were ready to assist me, and the only course\nleft to prevent bloodshed was immediately to proclaim me\nGovernor of the country. This unmistakeable demonstration\nhad the desired effect * * * * None\njoined the party of Makota, and his paid followers were not\nmore than twenty in number.\n\nUnder the guns of the Royalist, and with a small body of\nmen to protect me personally, and the great majority of all\nclasses with me, it is not surprising that the negotiation pro-\nceeded rapidly to a favourable issue. The document was\nquickly drawn up, sealed, signed, and delivered, and on the\n24th of September, 1847, I was declared Raja and Governor\nof Sarawak amidst the roar of cannon, and a general display\nof flags and banners from the shore and boats on the river.\"\n\nThis is a somewhat lengthy quotation, but the language\nis so graphic and so honest that I need make no apologies for\nintroducing it and, indeed, it is the fairest way of exhibiting\nMr Brooke's objects and reasons and is, moreover, interest-\ning as shewing under what circumstances and conditions the\nfirst permanent English settlement was formed in Borneo.\n\nMr. Brooke concludes his account of his accession to the\nGovernment in words that remind us of another unselfish\nand modest hero\u2014General Gordon. He says \"Difficulty\nfollowed upon difficulty\u2014the dread of pecuniary failure, the\ndoubt of receiving support or assistance; this and much\nmore presents itself to my mind. But I have tied myself to\nthe stake. I have heaped logs around me. I stand\nupon a cask of gunpowder, and if others bring the torch I\nshall not shrink. I feel within me the firm, unchangeable\nconviction of doing right which nothing can shake. I see\nthe benefits I am conferring. The oppressed, the wretched,\nthe outlawed have found in me their only protector. They\nnow hope and trust, and they shall not be disappointed while\nI have life to uphold them. God has so far used me as a\nhumble instrument of His hidden Providence, and whatever\nbe the result, whatever my fate, I know the example will\nnot be thrown away. I know it tends to a good end in His\nown time. He can open a path for me through all difficulties,\nraise me up friends who will share with me in the task,\nawaken the energies of the great and powerful, so that\nthey may protect this unhappy people. I trust it may be so,\nbut if God wills otherwise, if the time be not yet arrived; if it\nbe the Almighty's will that the flickering taper shall be\nextinguished ere it be replaced by a steady beacon, I submit,\nin the firm and humble assurance that His ways are better\nthan my ways, and that the term of my life is better in His\nhands than in my own.\" On the 1st August, 1842, this\ncession of Sarawak to Mr. Brooke was confirmed by His\nHighness Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin, under the Great Seal\nMuda Hassim was the uncle of the Sultan, who was a sovereign\nof weak, vacillating disposition, at one time guided by\nthe advice of his uncle, who was the leader of the \"English\nparty,\" and expressing his desire for the Queen's assistance\nto put down piracy and disorder and offering, in return, to\ncede to the British the island of Labuan, at another following\nhis own natural inclinations and siding altogether with the\nparty of disorder, who were resolved to maintain affairs as\nthey were in the \"good old times,\" knowing that when the\nreign of law and order should be established their day and\ntheir power and ability to aggrandize and enrich themselves at\nthe expense of the aborigines and the common people would\ncome to an end. There is no doubt that Mr. Brooke him-\nself considered it would be for the good of the country that\nMuda Hassim should be raised to the throne and the Sultan\ncertainly entertained not altogether ill-founded dread that it was\nintended to depose him in the latter's favour, the more so as\na large majority of the Brunei people were known to be in his\ninterest. In the early part of 1845 Muda Hassim appears to have been in favour with the Sultan, and was publicly announced as successor to the throne, with the title of Sultan Muda (muda = young, the usual Malay title for the heir apparent to the Crown), and the document recognizing the appointment of Mr Brooke as the Queen's Confidential Agent in Borneo was written in the name of the Sultan and of Muda Hassim conjointly, and concludes by saying that the two writers express the hope that through the Queen's assistance they will be enabled to settle the Government of Borneo.\n\nIn April, 1846, however, Mr Brooke received the startling intelligence that in December, or January previous, the Sultan had ordered the murder of his uncle Muda Hassim and of several of the Raja's brothers and nobles of his party, in all some thirteen Rajas and many of their followers. Muda Hassim, finding resistance useless, retreated to his boat and ignited a cask of powder, but the explosion not killing him, he blew his brains out with a pistol. His brother, Pangeran Bintadin, one of the most enlightened nobles in Brunei, likewise terminated his existence by an explosion of gunpowder. Representations being made to Sir Thomas Ochran, the Admiral in command of the station, he proceeded in person to Borneo with a squadron of eight vessels, including two steamers. The Sultan, foreseeing the punishment that was inevitable, erected some well-placed batteries to defend his town. Only the two steamers and one sailing vessel of war, together with boats from the other vessels and a force of six hundred men were able to ascend the river and such was the rotten state of the kingdom of Borneo Proper and so unwarlike the disposition of its degenerate people that after firing a few shots whereby two of the British force were killed and a few wounded, the batteries were deserted, the Sultan and his followers fled to the jungle, and the capital remained at the Admiral's disposition. Captain Rodney Musby, accompanied by Mr Brooke, with a force of five hundred men was despatched in pursuit of His Highness, but it is needless to add that, though the difficulties of marching through a trackless country under a tropical downpour of\nrain were pluckily surmounted, it was found impossible to come up with the Royal fugitive. Negotiations were subsequently entered into with the Prime Minister, Pangeran Mumim, an intelligent noble, who afterwards became Sultan, and on the 19th July, 1846, the batteries were razed to the ground and the Admiral issued a Proclamation to the effect that hostilities would cease if the Sultan would return and govern lawfully, suppress piracy and respect his engagements with the British Government; but that if he persisted in his evil courses the squadron would return and burn down the capital. The same day Admiral Cochrane and his squadron steamed away. It is perhaps superfluous to add that this was the first and the last time that the Brunei Government attempted to try conclusions with the British, and in the following year a formal treaty was concluded to which reference will be made hereafter.\n\n(To be continued.)\nNOTES ON NAMES OF PLACES IN THE ISLAND OF SINGAPORE AND ITS VICINITY.\n\nPerhaps the following notes on some of the names of places in the island of Singapore and its immediate neighbourhood may not be without interest to the readers of the Journal. In Singapore the population is continually changing and, as the old Malay inhabitants have for the most part died out or migrated, it is probable that before very long the names of places may become corrupted (as some already have been) almost beyond recognition. That this should be the case is not surprising when we consider the various nationalities that have settled down in the island for purposes of trade and commerce, and how few and scattered are the remnants of the old Malay settlers and the remnants of the aboriginal \"Orang Laut.\" It will doubtless seem to Malay scholars to be superfluous to notice the meanings of some of the names but my object has been to write for the information of those who, although they are not thoroughly conversant with Malay, yet are disposed to take an intelligent interest in the subject.\n\nI have confined myself in these notes to the names of places in the Settlement of Singapore, but I may perhaps instance two cases in which the names of places in Johor territory have become curiously corrupted. There is a place on the shores of the Old Straits near Lengkuas called Janggut Ma' Duduk. This figures in the Government map of the island (1885) as \"Jaman Dulu\" and in the charts as \"Jaman Dudu.\" Again, there is the point known to Malays as\nTanjong Penyusok, and to us from our school geographies as Point Roumania. In Keane's Eastern Geography it is called \"Romania,\" in the map of the Malay Peninsula (1887) \"Tanjong Ramenia,\" and in the charts and Sailing Directions it is written indifferently as \"Ramunia\" and \"Rumania.\" There are dangerous shoals to the seaward of the point called by the same name, but the spelling varies in every instance. The fact of the matter is the name of Roumania, or whatever it is, is based on a misconception. There is an island called Pulau Rumenia about two miles West of Tanjong Penyusok and opposite to it on the mainland is a large kampong called Kampong Rumenia. The name applied to the point\u2014Ramunia, Roumania or Rumania\u2014is evidently a corruption of Rumenia, and the name has been applied to a place to which it never belonged. Rumenia is the well known fruit-bearing tree Butea microphylla.\n\nAyer G\u00e9m\u00faruh\u2014\"babbling waters.\" G\u00e9m\u00faruh is from \"guroh.\"\n\nAyer S\u00e1mak. \"S\u00e1mak\" (or samar) is a kind of tree, the bark of which is used in dyeing and tanning.\n\nBajau\u2014\"a pirate.\" (From Battak \"Bajo\" an attack?)\n\nBatu Koyok. A patch of rocks near Pulau Tekong. \"Koyok\" or \"kuyu\" is \"a pariah dog.\"\n\nBedok or Sa-b\u00e9dok\u2014\"the drum of a mosque.\"\n\nBerh\u00e1la K\u00e9ping. A curiously shaped rock at the entrance to Selat Singki. \"Berh\u00e1la\" (pronounced Ber\u00e1la) is \"an idol,\" and I am informed that \"K\u00e9ping\" is the Orang Laut pronunciation of \"K\u00e9ping,\" the numeral affix. This appendix of K\u00e9ping, however, is not very satisfactory, and it has been suggested to me by Mr. D. F. A. Hervey that it is probably \"K\u00e9ping,\" to guard, hence the name, the idol being supposed to watch the entrance to the strait.\n\nB\u00e9ting Kusah\u2014\"the dangerous sand-bank.\" \"Kusah\" is a variant of \"Susah.\"\n\n*Note.\u2014Bern\u00e1la is invariably corrupted on the charts into \"Varella,\" e.g., Varella Straits, to the South of Singapore, and Varella Island, off the Pahang Coast.*\nBlakang\u2014a kind of fish.\n\nBuran Darat. The coral patch to the N.E. of Blakang Mati. \"Buran\" is a kind of sea-anemone of a light green colour and is eaten by the Chinese.\n\nBukit G\u00e9mia. Mount Imbeah in Blakang Mati. \"G\u00e9mia\" is the sago-palm, a variant of \"R\u00e9mbia.\"\n\nBukit S\u00e9r\u00e1pong. \"S\u00e9r\u00e1pong\" is possibly from \"\u00c1pong\" \"drift wood,\" but the formation is doubtful.\n\nG\u00e9lang. This is probably the plant g\u00e9lang pasir (Portulaca oleracea). There is another plant, g\u00e9lang laut (Sesuvium postulacastrum).\n\nK\u00e1lang. \"a roller, skid\" for launching vessels. The B\u00e9danda K\u00e1lang, a tribe of the Orang Laut, took their name from the river.\n\nK\u00e1lang P\u00fading. \"P\u00fading\" is probably the shrub with variegated leaves (Justicia picta).\n\nKampong Glam. The glam tree (Melaleuca leucadendron).\n\nKampong K\u00f3pit. The village in Blakang Mati sometimes called S\u00e9l\u00e1t Singki. \"Kopit\" = narrow, contracted.\n\nKampong Pangk\u00e1l\u00e1n Paku. \"Pangk\u00e1l\u00e1n\" (from \"Pangkal\") \"landing place;\" \"Paku\" = a generic name for fern.\n\nKampong P\u00e9rm\u00e1tang. \"P\u00e9rm\u00e1tang\" is \"rising ground;\" \"a long ridge\" derived from \"Batang.\"\n\nKampong R\u00e9nngam. (1)\u2014\"R\u00e9nngam\" or \"Ranggam\" a thorny plant growing on low land. Its fruit can be eaten, and ataps are sometimes made out of its leaves. The plant is like the K\u00e9l\u00e1bi (2)\u2014\"R\u00e9nngam\" = an instrument for cutting padi.\n\nKandang K\u00e9rbau\u2014\"buffalo pen.\" Sometimes wrongly written \"Kampong K\u00e9rbau.\"\n\nKranji. A tree (Dalhousia indicum).\n\nL\u00f3bong Acheh. This is a hollow or cutting (\"l\u00f3bong\") in the sandy beach near Changi Point as if a large boat had been hauled up there. The story is that one of the Achinese ships that attacked Johor was beached there for repairs. Compare Mr Hervey's note on \"Prigi Acheh,\" p. 168 of Journal No. II.\nLoyang. \"Brass\" according to Favre. Perhaps the place is so called from the colour of the water.\n\nPasir Pel\u00e9kat, i.e., Pasir Orang Pel\u00e9kat. \"Pel\u00e9kat\" = Pulicat, the place in India.\n\nPasir Ris. Perhaps this is a contraction for Pasir Iris (\"iris\" = to shred). I have heard the word pronounced as Pasiris by an old resident.\n\nPinang Rawang. \"Rawang\" is a \"swamp\" or \"quaking bog.\"\n\nPulau Ayer Chawan. Pulau Ayer Limau. Pulau Ayer Merbau. These three islands are close together. \"Chawan\" is \"a cup\" or \"basin;\" \"Merbau\" is a tree (Atzelia palembanica).\n\nPulau Blokang Mati = \"dead-back island,\" so called from the sterility of the soil on the hills.\n\nPulau Brani. Properly = \"Pulau Ayer Brani,\" as it is still written on the charts. The island is so called from a well at the top of the hill, the water of which was supposed to have potent qualities. There used to be a \"Kolam,\" or tank, formed out of the natural rock on the Tanjong Pagar side of the island which received the overflow from the well and in which people used to bathe. The remains of this tank can still be seen.\n\nPulau Bukum. \"Bukum\" is said to be the same as \"Hukum,\" and there is a tradition that the Raja used to try cases in the island, hence the name, probably through the intermediate form \"berhukum.\"\n\nPulau Damar Laut. \"Damar Laut\" is the tree \"Vatica russak;\" \"Damar Laut,\" however, is the name also given to another tree (Canarium).\n\nPulau Jong. \"Junk Island,\" a small island of a conical shape to the North of Pulau S\u00ebking and Pulau S\u00ebb\u00e1rok. The story is that Malay pirates one night attacked a Chinese junk, which was anchored where the island now is, and just as the Malays got alongside, the Nakhodah of the junk awoke. On seeing the pirates, through terror, he uttered such a frightful yell that the sea-spirit turned the junk into an island much to the consterna-\nNAMES OF PLACES IN SINGAPORE.\n\nPutau Khatib Bongsu. \"Khatib\" = \"a preacher,\" \"Bongsu\" = \"youngest-born,\" hence = the island of a person of that name. This name has been fearfully corrupted in charts and maps, figuring as \"Kitch Bungsee,\" \"Kita Bangsa,\" &c.\n\nPutau Merambong. \"Rambong\" is the kind of basket used by Bugis in Singapore for carrying pine-apple in, but Mr. D. F. A. Hervey suggests that the name is probably derived from the plant called \"ambong-ambong,\" a seaside shrub with a white flower.\n\nPutau Mismut. Derived from \"S\u00e9m\u00fat\" (ants).\n\nPutau Miskol. \"Miskol\" is the larger kind of water-vessel made from the coco-nut shell, and has a narrow orifice. The \"Gayong\" is shallower and is the half shell. Compare Terumbu Gayong, a shoal not far from the island. The ordinary form of the word is \"S\u00e9kol\" and the \"Mi\" in this and the other word (Mismut) would seem to be an affix peculiar to the baha Orang Laut.\n\nPutau P\u00e9sek. \"P\u00e9sek\" is a Bugis word meaning coins with holes in the middle. Compare \"Pitis\" and \"Pichis.\"\n\nPutau Renget. \"Renget\" is the sand-fly (agas-agas), and signifies \"mosquito\" in some aboriginal dialects. It is also the name of a fresh water shell.\n\nPutau Sa-Kijang Bandera, Sa-Kijang Pel\u00e9pah = St. John's Island West and St. John's Island East, respectively. St. John's, as pointed out by Mr. W. E. Maxwell, is a corruption of \"Sa-Kijang.\" Sa-Kijang Bandera is so called because there used to be a flagstaff there before it was moved to Mount Faber. In the map of the island (1885) \"Bandera\" is corrupted with \"Berak.\" \"Pel\u00e9pah\" are the fronds of a palm. These islands are supposed to be two roe-deer at which the \"spear-reef\" (Terumbu Seligi) off Blakang Mati is being aimed.\n\nSa-ranggong. \"Ranggong\" is a kind of bird about the size of the adjutant and its description is as follows:\u2014\n\nBlack on back and white on breast, neck long, bill\nlong and sharp, crest grey. The feet are not webbed.\n\n**Pulau S\u0113b\u016brus.** \"S\u0113b\u016brus\" is a sort of fruit-bearing tree that grows in mangrove swamp.\n\n**Pulau S\u0113m\u016blun.** \"S\u0113m\u016blun\" is the name of a tribe of the \"Orang Laut.\" The name is wrongly written as \"S\u0113mbilan\" on the Government Map (1885).\n\n**Pulau S\u016bber.** \"Suber\" is a kind of tree out of the bark of which cord is made.\n\n**Pulau S\u016bdong.** A beautiful little island surrounded by a coral reef. \"S\u016bdong\" is said to be the same as \"Tu-dong\" (a cover), so called from the shape of the island with the reef round it.\n\n**Pulau T\u0113kong.** \"T\u0113kong\" = \"an obstacle\" so called because the island blocks the mouth of the Johor River.\n\n**Pulau Ubin.** \"Ubin\" according to FAVRE is Javanese, and means \"squared stone.\" The island is so called from the granite quarries.\n\n**Sarang Rimau** = \"The tiger's den.\" This is the western end of Blakang Mati, apparently the place where Fort Siloso now is. \"Sal\u00fasuh\" is a kind of herb used as a remedy in childbirth, but I have no idea how the fort came to be so called, as the Orang Laut of Kampong Kopit only know the place by the name of Sarang Rimau.\n\n**S\u0113lat Singki.** The narrow strait between Pulau Brani and Blakang Mati. The charts wrongly give the name to the S\u0113lat Pandan. \"Singki\" probably = \"S\u0113ngkil\" or \"Singkir\" = sharp-edged. At Penang the word means \"set on edge\" (of the teeth), hence perhaps it is metaphorically applied to the difficulties of the passage. \"S\u0113ngkil\" is also the name of a plant.\n\n**S\u0113lat T\u0113brau.** \"T\u0113brau\" is a kind of large fish. The word also signifies a large kind of grass like prairie-grass.\n\n**Sungei B\u0113rih.** \"B\u0113rih\" is the variety of the red fish with the black head.\n\n**Sungei B\u0113r\u014dnok.** \"A kind of sea-worm\" (FAVRE).\n\n**Sungei J\u0113l\u016btong.** \"J\u0113l\u016btong\" is a gutta-bearing tree (Dyera costulata).\nSungei P\u00e9r\u00e9pok. \"P\u00e9r\u00e9pok\" = \"brambles,\" \"thorns.\"\n\nSungei Ponggol. \"Ponggol\" = \"a stump of a tree\" especially \"a high stump.\" Compare \"Punggur.\" It has been suggested to me that the word is Tamil (Ponkal, \"the feast of the boiling rice,\" celebrated when the sun enters the sign of Capricorn), but the word is clearly Malay and not Tamil.\n\nSungei Sa-rimbun. \"Rimbun\" is \"luxuriant,\" \"in great quantity,\" \"thick.\"\n\nSungei S\u00e9l\u00e9tar. A tribe of the Orang Laut (Orang S\u00e9l\u00e9tar), who formerly lived there, took its name from the river. See Journal Indian Archipelago, Vol. I, p. 302.\n\nSungei Tampines. \"Tampines\" is the well-known timber tree (Sloctia sideroxylon).\n\nSungei T\u00e9ban. \"T\u00e9ban\" = \"to bet,\" \"to stake an equal amount.\"\n\nSungei T\u00e9mbuan. \"T\u00e9mbuan\" or \"T\u00e9buan\" = \"a hornet.\"\n\nSungei Tengok. \"Tengok\" = \"the rank smell of things cooked in oil and kept a long time.\"\n\nSungei Tuas. \"Tuas\" = \"to chop in two pieces,\" also \"to raise by leverage,\" \"to support.\"\n\nTanjong Awar or Aur. \"Awar\" (Aur) is the large kind of bamboo (Dendrocalamus). This is the point known as St James' in the New Harbour.\n\nTanjong Malang, or \"Malay Spit.\" \"Malang\" in navigation means \"a black rock,\" and the name is given to the patch of rocks running out to seaward from Fort Palmer. This is the place where Sir Stamford Raffles hung in chains the body of Syed Yasin, the man who stabbed Colonel Farquhar, the story of which is told by Abdullah in his \"Hikaiat.\"\n\nTanjong Mengkuang. \"Mengkuang\" is the well-known thorny plant out of which kajangs and mats are made.\n\nTanjong Merawang. \"Merawang\" means \"ragged,\" \"full of holes,\" and the point is so called from its appearance. The word is derived from \"Rawang,\" \"a bog.\" This point is wrongly marked both in the charts and the Government Map (1885). In the charts Tanjong\nM\u0113rawang is called Tanjong Kampong, evidently from a confusion with Tanjong Karang the next point.\n\nThe point marked as Tanjong M\u0113rawang in the charts is really Tanjong Tuas.\n\nTanjong Pagar. I presume this name was given on account of the Wharf. The old name of the place is S\u0113lintar.\n\nTanjong Ru. \"Ru\" is the Casuarina littoria.\n\nTanjong S\u0113linsing. \"S\u0113linsing\" is a kind of fish about six inches long. It is also a jungle variety of the Pandanus.\n\nTanjong Teregeh. \"Teregeh\" I imagine to be a corruption of the native name of the place T\u0113r\u012bta. \"T\u0113r\u012bta\" is the small kind of cuttle fish. \"Teregeh\" is neither English nor Malay, as far as I know.\n\nT\u0113lok Baru. \"Baru\" is a species of Hibiscus, and the word is, I think, correctly written \"baru\" and not \"bharu\" (new).\n\nT\u0113lok Saga. \"Saga\" a kind of bean, Abrus peccatorius or Adenanthus pavonina.\n\nCHINESE NAMES.\n\nAng Mo Kio, lit., \"The red-haired (i.e., European) bridge.\"\n\nToa Payoh. \"Toa\" is \"big\" and \"Payoh\" is the Chinese form of \"Paya\" the Malay word meaning a \"swamp.\"\n\nChan Chu Kang, &c. Chan Chu Kang, Choa Chu Kang, &c., apparently mean the river (Kang) of the Chan Chu, the Choa Chu tribe, &c.\n\nH. T. HAUGHTON.\nJOURNAL OF A TRIP TO PAHANG, &c.\n\nWITH\n\nH. E. THE GOVERNOR.\n\nAugust, 17th to 27th, 1889.\n\nStarted from Singapore in the Sea Belle at 4.45 p.m. on Saturday, the 17th August. Reached Pulau Tioman before daylight on the 18th. Put into a bay on the S.E. side of the island, but, owing to the heavy swell, had to go on to Nipah Bay on the western side.\n\nThe Island of Tioman is hilly, very rocky, and heavily wooded. We landed at Nipah Bay soon after 6 a.m., and returned on board soon after 9 a.m. At the spot where we landed there is a small Malay Settlement called Kampong Nipah. The beach is sandy, with a large admixture of coral detritus. Beyond high-water mark, the beach is covered with grass and a variety of plants, the most conspicuous being the Goat's-foot Convolvulus. Beyond the beach, and running parallel with the sea-line, is a creek twenty to thirty feet wide, discharging into the sea at the base of a hill about a couple of hundred yards to the south of where we landed. The ground commences to rise almost immediately behind this creek. The whole place is heavily wooded, and everywhere there crop up boulders, of all sizes and shapes, of granite. There are a good number of coco-nut trees, but they appear to have been badly attacked by beetles. There was one splendid grove of durian trees, and many others scattered about the kampong. I noticed also several lime-trees, one with a large number of unripe fruit on it.\n\nOf birds, mammals, reptiles and insects, I saw hardly anything. Of birds, I only saw one snipe (Tringoides hypoleucus).\nand a few specimens of the Eastern pied robin (*Copsychus musicus*). I heard some hornbills flying overhead, but could not see them, and so could not determine the species. I saw also a few pigeons, but could not obtain a shot. I only actually procured two specimens of the red-headed tailor-bird (*Sutorius ruficeps*), and two specimens of the common Malayan sunbird (*Cinnyris malaccensis*). These latter were moulting and not fit for preserving.\n\nOf mammals, I obtained one specimen of the common squirrel (*Sciurus atrodorsalis*), and I saw a few small bats, which I failed to obtain.\n\nI did not see any reptiles, and of insects the best thing I got was about a dozen specimens of a Caddis-fly (*Trichoptera sp.*?). These I obtained over a small stream that came down behind the village. The butterflies I observed were the common species of Singapore, the most common being *Papilio polytes* and *Danais vulgaris*. Of these, I obtained specimens, as well as a few small blues belonging to the *Lycenedix*.\n\nIn the stump of an old coco-nut tree examined by Mr. RIDLEY we obtained one perfect specimen of the coco-nut weevil (*Rhyacophilus ferrugeneus*), and a number of its cocoons, and a few cockroaches. Mr. RIDLEY, also obtained for me, from a stream up which he worked, some specimens of a small fresh-water shrimp.\n\nFlying about over the sea I noticed a number of terns (*Sterna melananchen*), a few gulls, probably the laughing gull (*Xena ridibunda*), and a noddy (*Anous stolidus*).\n\nSoon after getting on board we commenced to steam along the western side of the island, keeping close inshore. The appearance of the island was much the same throughout, being heavily wooded, with indications of existing or abandoned kampongs.\n\nWe arrived off Kwala Pahang in the afternoon, and went ashore soon after, and met Mr. RODGER and Mr. WISE.\n\nAlmost as soon as we landed, a drizzling rain set in, which continued more or less the whole time we were ashore, so that it was almost impossible to obtain any specimens. All I obtained was one tailor-bird and one edible-nest swiftlet.\nI saw a number of other birds, but as they were all of the common species obtainable at any time in Singapore, I contented myself with merely noting their occurrence.\n\nAt 7.45 on the morning of Monday, the 19th, we started for Pekan two boats being towed by the steam launch. The river was very winding and full of sand-banks, so that the journey took more than two hours. Immediately after breakfast, about 11 A.M., Mr. Ridley and I started to collect.\n\nThe country in the immediate vicinity of Pekan is quite flat, the plains being covered with short grass. Here and there the ground is more or less swampy, the swampy ground is everywhere covered with clumps of the palm from which the sticks known as \"Penang Lawyer\" is obtained. On the higher and drier ground, are larger or smaller patches of scrub or secondary jungle, and occasionally a Malay house, surrounded with plantain, durian, and other fruit trees, is met with. Far in the distance could be seen heavy forest, but within many miles of Pekan nearly all the larger forest has been felled.\n\nBirds and insects were not very numerous, and, as at Pulau Tioman, they appeared to be only of the commoner species found on the western side of the islands. The bird that was most numerous was the little white-headed finch (Mania maya). Of these I found several new nests, but Mr. Ridley was fortunate in finding one with four fresh eggs. The yellow-wattled myna (Enicurus javanicus) and the metallic starling (Calornis chalybeus) were also common. I heard and saw at a distance several parties of the common Malayan hornbill (Hydrocitta convexa). Omar Khan Government Peon shot a specimen of the lesser serpent eagle (Spilornis baha), which he gave me for the Museum. Green pigeons were not uncommon, but seemed to consist of but one species (Osmotriccus teresani). The above were the most noticeable birds, and I saw nothing else during our three days' stay in Pekan worth recording. I forgot to mention that the common Indian black raven or corby (Corvus macrorhynchos) was very common, and the maroon kite (Haliastur indus) was frequently seen.\nOn the evening of Tuesday, the 20th, I accompanied His Excellency across the river, landing a few miles above Pekan. The country here was flat, the soil sandy, and everywhere covered with bushes, and fringed with secondary jungle. Here the green pigeon (O. vernans) was very numerous, flying overhead, in parties of five to ten or more, back and forwards between the clumps of jungle. The best bird I obtained while at Pekan was a specimen of Raffles hawk owl (*Minax scutulata*). This bird had flown into the room the night before our arrival, and had been captured by Mr. Owen. It had died during the night, and had been thrown away, but on hearing about it, I searched and found it. It was not injured as to its plumage, and has made a very fine specimen, the only one we at present have in the Museum.\n\nI obtained specimens of all the butterflies and other insects that I possibly could, but, as before mentioned, they were all of the common forms obtainable on the western side of Peninsula.\n\nAt 3.30 p.m. on Wednesday, the 21st, we left Pekan, and arrived off Tringganu early next morning. A delay occurred in landing, as a Dato had to be sent ashore to make arrangements for the reception of His Excellency the Governor. After breakfast we started, and on landing at the town Mr. Ridley and I started at once to look for collecting ground. The only bit of likely ground in sight was the hill on which the fort was placed, but we were not allowed to ascend this, so we crossed the river and landed on a narrow spit of sand, sparsely covered with vegetation, which consisted chiefly of the Madagascar periwinkle. Though apparently fair ground for botanizing, it yielded nothing zoologically. All I got was a rare butterfly (*Papilio cyrta*) and a number of small bivalves that had been left stranded on the beach.\n\nThe town of Tringganu is very thickly populated, the number of women and children being remarkable. The women there and at Kelantan are not shy, and mingle freely with the men. At a small market that was being held, the sales were being conducted by women. I noticed in several places in the town large quantities of salted limes put out in the\nsun to dry, so this fruit is evidently largely produced. Coco-\nnuts, too, were numerous, and are largely exported to Siam.\nThe coco-nut trees from Tringganu northwards do not\nseem to be attacked by beetles. Fishing seems to be the\ngreat occupation of the place, and on the morning of our\narrival we passed through a fleet of over a hundred boats\nstanding out to sea, each boat having from eight to ten men.\nThe Chinese, of whom there are several hundred in the town,\nare kept to the further end of the town, and not allowed to\nmingle with the Mahomedan population.\n\nWe arrived off Kelantan early on the morning of the 23rd\n(Friday). Soon after anchoring, the Dato started in the\nsteam launch to make the necessary arrangements for the\nreception of His Excellency, but it was nearly dark before he\nreturned, in consequence we were detained the entire day on\nboard, and were unable to land. Being unable to land, we\nstarted dredging by dragging a bucket along the length of\nthe ship and then carefully washing the bucket-full of dark\ntenacious clay so obtained. A number of small shells were\nobtained, mostly dead, one fine specimen alive, of a beautiful\nstar-fish (Ophiocoma sp.), but so brittle that, before it could\nbe safely stowed away in spirit, it had become imperfect.\nWe also got half-a-dozen specimens of a Holothurus or sea\nslug, small but apparently adult.\n\nAt 8 A.M. next morning (Saturday, 24th) His Excellency\nstarted for Kelantan, Mr. RUDLEY and I following in the\nwhale-boat very soon after. We sailed up the river, and first\nlanded at a kampong, but did not obtain much. We then\nlanded on a low sandy and marshy island, covered for the\nmost part with a sedge, in which I saw specimens of the white-\nbreasted water-hen (Erythra phoenicura) and the banded rail\n(Rallus striatus), a small sedge warbler (Cetticola exilis),\nand the lesser coucal (Centrococcyx bengalensis). I here\nalso got, on some small flowering shrubs, a number of\ngood insects, the best being a green fly (Sibium) which\nwill not unlikely prove to be an undescribed species.\nAt present only two species of this genus are recorded from\nthese parts (Sibium splendidum and S. occulata), and it is\nneither of these. I also obtained specimens of several species of wasps. After leaving the island, we proceeded a couple of miles further up the river, where there was a small kampong. The place looked, and proved, a good collecting-ground, both zoologically and botanically. The country was flat, chiefly paddy-land, but now dry, margined with strips of secondary forest, and, on the higher and drier parts, everywhere dotted with clumps of bamboo.\n\nThe first bird I got was a fine female of one of the serpent eagles (Spilornis rutherfordi). I also noticed a flock of the pink-breasted parrotquet (Palawanus fasciatus). Vultures (Pseudogyps bengalensis) were also common. A few Indian ravens were seen, but they were not so numerous as at Pekan. No snakes were seen here or at any other place visited, but at this kampong I shot two lizards\u2014one a species of Varanus, which I have not yet identified, and the other a burrowing lizard feeding on vegetable substances, and which will probably prove to be Liolepis guttatus or a closely-affined species. A few insects were obtained at this spot, but none calling for particular notice.\n\nKelantan differs considerably from Tringganu, in that at the latter place fishing seems to be the chief industry. The manufacture of sarongs, krisses, &c., is largely carried on, while to agriculture but small attention seems to be paid. At Kelantan it is different, the people being apparently chiefly agriculturists, paddy and coco-nuts being extensively grown, Indian corn and tobacco to a lesser extent, and such minor products as croton and castor-oil seeds are not overlooked. Buffaloes and cattle are numerous, and the sheep are sheep, not the miserable hybrid-looking animals called sheep in Tringganu and Pekan. Poultry is abundant, and fine large fowls cost about five cents each. Fishing is carried on to only a small extent, and sarongs, krisses, &c. are not made, these being imported from Tringganu. In Kelantan, as in Tringganu the women, though Mahomedans, mingle freely with the men, and are not in the least shy. The inhabitants very markedly show the admixture of Siamese blood, and this is specially noticeable in the women, who are above the\naverage height of the Malays, some indeed being very tall, and men, women, and children, instead of, like the Malays, being shy, retiring, and silent, are vivacious, talkative, and rather forward.\n\nThe banks of the Kelantan River are very beautiful; the admixture of coco-nuts and clumps of bamboos, with stretches of bright green paddy, with a back ground of dark forest, makes a pretty picture. The coinage differs from Pahang, consisting only of the silver dollar and small circular tin coins, about the size of, but not so thick as a cent with a hole in the centre. Five hundred of these coins are the equivalent of a dollar. Copper cents, or the smaller silver parts of a dollar, are not accepted.\n\nGot back to the steamer about noon, and left in the afternoon for the Cheranting River, where we arrived at 8 A.M. the next morning (Sunday, the 25th).\n\nThe river is situated at the head of a fine bay, but is a miserably small stream, with its mouth completely blocked up with fallen trees, and with only sufficient water to float a dugout drawing but a few inches of water. Landed on the right bank just at the entrance of the stream, and stayed a short time on shore. Tracks of game, such as deer, pigs, tiger, and peacock, were numerous along the beach, but we did not actually see anything. I obtained two shore plover, which were interesting, shewing as they did the remains of the rufous breeding plumage. One was the larger shore plover (*Egialitis geoffrion*), the other the lesser shore plover (*Egialitis mongolica*). The most northern point where these birds have been found breeding is in Siberia, on the banks of the Yenesei.\n\nAfter lunch started for the Rumpin River, fifty miles south of Cheranting, and twenty to the north of the Endau River, the boundary between Johor and Pahang. Anchored about 7 P.M., off the mouth and about four miles from shore.\n\nOn Monday, the 26th, at 5 30 P.M., steamed close in to shore, and landed on the right bank, where a Police Station is being erected. His Excellency and Mr. Rodger proceeded up the river to the Settlement, about twenty minutes'\nsteam in the launch. This was quite the best collecting-ground I had met with; birds were numerous, and the sandy soil round the new station was full of the burrowing lizards (*Liolepis*). I obtained six fine specimens. Of birds, I got four specimens of the beautiful tree swifts (*Dendrochelidon comatus* and *D. longipennis*). I also got male and female of an aberrant cuckoo (*Phaenicophaeus erythrogaster*). The plumage in both sexes of this species is alike, but the irides of the male are pale blue, those of the female bright yellow. I obtained also a number of other species of birds.\n\nWe returned to the steamer about 10 A.M., and started almost immediately back for Kuala Pahang, where we arrived at 5 P.M., and there Mr. Rodger left to return. We then steamed south on route for Singapore, where we arrived at 9.20 A.M. on Tuesday.\n\nThe coast-line between the Cheranting and Rompin Rivers is very fine, the hills coming in many cases to the water's edge, and tier above tier rising away into the interior. In some cases the hills that we could see in the far distance must have been from eight to ten thousand feet high. On Pulau Tioman and in the Rompin River mangrove was met with, but the other places visited seemed to be free from it. The beach, or rather only that portion of it covered during the N.E. monsoon, was covered with pumice-stone. In many places, as at Cheranting and Rompin, the pieces were often about six inches across.\n\nAt Tringganu, on the beach, His Excellency the Governor collected a number of the shells of an oyster. These are so delicate and translucent that at first I mistook them for the scales of a large fish. They are small, barely two inches across, but as pearly on the outer as on the inner surface. His Excellency has kindly given me for the Museum the best pair he collected.\n\nIt was rather remarkable that during the entire trip no land snake was met with; a few sea snakes were seen.\n\nWM. DAVISON,\nSecretary, Raffles Library and Museum.\nSingapore, 30th August, 1889.\nA LIST OF THE BIRDS OF THE BORNEAN GROUP OF ISLANDS\n\nBY\n\nA. H. EVERETT, C.M.Z.S.\n\nNOTE.\n\nHE only complete lists of the Birds of Borneo and its adjacent islands hitherto published appear to be the well known \"Catalogo Sistematico degli Uccelli di Borneo\" of Count Salvadori and a \"Liste des Oiseaux de Borneo\" by M. VordeMan. The first named work appeared as the fourteenth volume of the Annals of the Civic Museum of Genoa in 1874, and although still indispensable to students of Indo-Malayan ornithology, it has now fallen out of date in many important respects, while the list of M. VordeMan is simply a catalogue of titles without references, brought out at Batavia in 1886, and it also is already out of date. Such being the case, I have endeavoured, in the following list, to compile a fresh catalogue of all the species of birds authentically recorded up to the present date as inhabiting or visiting the Bornean group of islands, with the object of providing a provisional hand-list to be of temporary use to field collectors and others until material shall have been so far further accumulated as to enable some competent ornithologist to take up the Bornean avifauna and treat it in an exhaustive manner. This cannot be done until more adequate series of authentic Bor-\nnean specimens of many of the species are available for study, and until the eastern, south-western, and central districts of Borneo itself, and a proportion of the outlying islets intervening between it and the Philippines, Celebes, Java, &c., together with the mountains of Palawan, have been worked by collectors.\n\nThe area of the Bornean group may be defined for the purposes of this list by a line which, starting from a point immediately to the west of St. Julian I. in the Tambelan Archipelago and being drawn to the south of the Great Natuna, passes northward of Labuan, and follows thence the 100-fathom line so as to embrace Balabac, Palawan (Paragua), the Calamianes, and the Cuyo islands, and, returning along the same line of soundings on the southern side of Palawan, is drawn immediately to the eastward of the islands of Cagayan Sulu and Sibutu\u2014whence it is continued through the Macassar Straits south of the Paternoster, Lauriot (Laet Ketil) and Solombo islets, and in a north-westerly direction up through the Carimata Strait back to the island of St. Julian.\n\nIn thus attempting to define the area within which the adjacent smaller islands may be regarded as being affiliated zoologically to Borneo, there exists no guide, in many cases, beyond their greater proximity to the latter island than to the other neighbouring large masses of land by which they are surrounded, and the evidence afforded by the soundings shown on our Admiralty Charts. The limits above adopted must, therefore, be looked upon as being in some degree approximate. But as there are no islands of considerable size of which the fauna is wholly unknown, except the Great Natuna, bordering upon the line of delimitation, it is not probable that any material extension or contractions of the boundary here assumed for the Bornean group will be necessitated by the results of future field-work.\n\nThe present list and its arrangement being of a provisional and tentative character, no attempt has been made to compile a complete synonymy of the species enumerated. Such references as are given are only sufficient, as a general rule, to\nserve as authority for the title which I have adopted, and for the inclusion of the species in the Bornean avifauna. For the same reason, all field-notes are excluded, with the exception that the distribution of each species within the limits of the Bornean group is noted so far as is at present feasible.\n\nAs many of the localities indicated do not appear on the accompanying maps, I may mention that Matang, Sirambu, Jambusan, Puak, Bidi, Busau, Paku and Buntal are all within a radius of 15 miles of the town of Kuching in Sarawak; Marintaman, Mengalong, Kalias and Lumbidan are on the coast of Borneo immediately opposite Labuan; Sigalind and Gomanton are in the vicinity of Sandakan in North-east Borneo; Kupang, Kuala Kapoeas, Tumbang Hiang, Telang, Tamiang, Rangas, Meratus Mountains and Lihong Bahaja are in the South-east portion of the island. The locality Kuala Kapoeas is not to be confounded with the great river called Kapoeas, which debouches on the west coast of Borneo, and on which the town of Pontianak is situated.\n\nNo family of birds is exclusively confined to the Bornean group, and but few genera even are peculiar. *Allocotops*, *Chlocharis*, *Androphilus* and *Ptilopyga* among the *Timeliidae*; *Tricophoropsis* and *Orcocistes* among the *Brachypodidae*; *Pityriasis* (?) among the *Laniidae*; *Chlamydochorea* among the *Campophagidae*; *Heteroscops* among the *Baboniidae*; *Lobiophasis* among the *Phaxianidae*; and *Hematortyx* among the *Tetraonidae*. These all appear to be peculiar to the island of Borneo alone; while we have *Ptilocichla* among the *Timeliidae* and *Dryococcyx* among the *Cocobidae* restricted apparently to the Palawan sub-group. Of the species, however, a considerable proportion seem to be exclusively confined to the group, as will be observed from the following enumeration, in which those which are restricted to the Palawan subgroup are distinguished by the prefix of an asterisk:\n\n1.

latter districts become better known. On the other hand, it may be anticipated with confidence that further exploration of the highlands of Borneo and Palawan will add many more really peculiar species, and perhaps some genera, to the foregoing list.\n\nIn concluding this introductory note, I have to express my great obligation to Mr. R. B. Sharpe for much kindly assistance in the identification of many of the species herein catalogued, and also for permission to include the titles of several which will be described as new to science in his papers on Mr. Whitehead's collections now in process of publication in the \"Ibis.\" To the latter gentleman I am also much indebted, he having freely placed at my disposal, for examination, his entire collection from Borneo and Palawan.\n\nA.

Borneo by Croockewit as existing in the Leiden Museum. Through the kindness of Professor B\u00fcttikofer one of these skins has recently been sent to London, and on comparison with a series of *O. maculatus* it was found to be identical with that species and not with *O. indicus*. A single skin of *O. maculatus* purporting to have come from N. W. Borneo is preserved in the British Museum collection. It is registered as having been procured from Sir H.\nLow in 1846. I include the species with considerable doubt, for it is very singular that so conspicuous a bird has not occurred to any one of the numerous collectors since 1846.\n\n117.\u2014Oriolus xanthonotus.\n\n*Oriolus xanthonotus*, Salvad., Ucc.

Borneo,\" but some of which had still attached to them their original labels showing them to have been collected in Sarawak by Mr. H. Everett. There is, therefore, doubt as to which part of Borneo this bird came from. It is dissimilar from all known immature individuals of *O. xanthonotus* and belongs rather to the *O. steerii* group.\n\n119.\u2014Oriolus vulneratus.\n\n*Oriolus vulneratus*, Sharpe, Ibis, 1887, p. 437.\nKina Balu Mt. at 4,000 ft.

The Lumbidan specimen exhibits a fairly well-defined black chin, which character does not seem to have been present in the type, of which the throat is described simply as white, and it is so depicted in the plate. Hence perhaps Mr. Sharpe was led to identify *P. bertae* with *P. orcas*, in which the absence of a black chin was deemed by Swinhoe to distinguish it from *P. nympha* of China. There is only a single skin of *P. nympha* in the British Museum and in it the chin, which is partly denuded of feathers, seems to have been white. Probably when a series of skins of the three species can be brought together, it will be found that *P. bertae* is identical with *P. nympha*, the individuals found in Borneo being occasional migrants from China.\n\n263.\u2014*Pitta ussheri.*\n\n*Pitta ussheri*, Sharpe, P.

A comparison of Mr. Sharpe's type with four examples of the Bornean species, two of which want the yellow shoulder spot and agree otherwise in plumage with *I. malayanus*, shows that the latter does not differ materially in dimensions from the Borneo birds. I think, therefore, that *I. malayanus* must take place as a synonym of *I. archipelagicus*, which thus ceases to be a species peculiar to Borneo.\n\nSub-Order\u2014COCCYGEO.\n\nFAMILY\u2014CUCULID\u00c6\n\nSub-Family\u2014CUCULIN\u00c6.\n\nGENUS\u2014CUCULUS.\n\n361.\u2014Cuculus canorinus.\n\n*Cuculus canorinus*, Salvad., Ucc.

Ridgway, Mr. Stejneger has been good enough to re-compare it, with the result that he entertains but little doubt in referring *C. fucatus* (Peale) as a synonym to *C. striatus* (Drap.) of Oates' Birds of Burma\u2014a species with which Mr. Oates regards *C. himalayanus* of Vigore to be identical. Mr. Stejneger writes that Peale's bird agrees perfectly with Oates' description of the coloration, while the following are the measurements:\n\n|          | Oates' | Peale's (\u2642) |\n|----------|--------|-------------|\n| Wing     | 6.8    | 6.9         |\n| Tail     | 6.0    | 5.9         |\n| Tarsus   | 0.7    | 0.7         |\n| Bill from gape | 1.1 | 1.06       |\n\n365.\u2014Cuculus sonnerati.\n\n*Cuculus sonnerati*, Walden, Tr.

There are, however, two skins of true *C. sepulchralis* in the British Museum from Borneo fide Verreaux.

Princesa (Platen).\nTrue *Chrysococcyx basalis* is, judging from the single skin in the British Museum, a very distinct species, and is confined apparently to Java. *Heterococcyx neglectus* (Schleg.), which is enumerated as a distinct species peculiar to Borneo in Count Salvadori's Catalogue, is omitted in the present list. The title was founded upon a single skin apparently, which was collected by S. M\u00fcller and is said to be preserved in the Leyden Museum. The bird was described as being adult, but there is a possibility that it represents a style of *C. xanthorhynchus*, and a re-comparison of the type seems desirable.\n\n**GENUS\u2014COCCYSTES.**\n\n374.\u2014Coccystes coromandus.\n\n*Coccystes coromandus*, Salvad., Ucc.

It is quite the most abundant of the migratory as Haliastur intermedius is of the resident birds of prey in those parts of the island. Observed as high as 1,000 ft. on Kina Balu by Mr. Whitehead.

Blasius, Abhandl. Nat. Ver. Bremen, v, p. 47.\nPontianak (Diard).\nThere is one specimen of this bird in the Norwich Museum \"said to be from Borneo, but probably incorrectly\" (Gurney, Ibis, 1880, p. 467). In the British Museum Catalogue B. jerdonii appears as a synonym of B. reinwardti, but Mr. Sharpe informs me that, unless proved to be a distinct species, its place will probably be with Baza sumatrensis. Until the precise affinity of the Bornean bird is settled, I follow provisionally Count Salvadori's nomenclature.\n\n426.\u2014Baza leucopias.\nBaza leucopias, Sharpe, Ibis, 1888, p. 195.\nTaguso (Whitehead).\nRepresentative form of B. sumatrensis (Lafreon.).\n\nGENUS\u2014MICROHIERAX.\n\n427.\u2014Microhierax fringillarius.\nMicrohierax fringillarius, Sharpe, Cat.

B. Pryer); Silam (Guillemard).\nThis distinct species appears to entirely replace M. fringillarius in Northern Borneo. According to Mr. Gurney it occurs also in the Nicobar Islands (S. F., viii, p. 476), but I cannot but think that his informant must have been in error as to the origin of the specimen.\nGenus\u2014FALCO.\n\n429.\u2014Falco communis.\nFalco communis, Salvad., Ucc.

Pryer); Banjarmasin (Mottley); Taguso, Palawan (Whitehead); Puerto Princesa (Platen).\nIt is still a matter of doubt whether the Australian F. melanogenys (Gould) ranges as far north as Borneo. A very dark and richly-coloured Peregrine from Lawas in the British Museum is referred by Mr. Gurney (Ibis, 1882, p. 302) to Falco melanogenys. On the other hand this specimen with the dark birds recorded from Java are believed by Mr. Sharpe to be representatives of a local race of Peregrines permanently resident in the islands above-mentioned. The birds ordinarily met with in Labuan and Northern Borneo appear in the N. E. Monsoon, and are doubtless regular winter migrants, probably from China. Mr. Whitehead, although he identified a Peregrine on Kina Balu, failed to obtain a specimen from that locality.\n\n430.\u2014Falco severus.\nFalco severus, Brugg., Abhandl. Nat. Ver.

Although it is possible that stragglers may visit the Southern districts of Borneo, this species has not been noticed by any modern collector, and it is desirable that its occurrence should be confirmed before it is definitely admitted among the birds of Borneo.\n\n**Sub-Order\u2014PANDIONES.**\n\n**Genus\u2014PANDION.**\n\n432.\u2014Pandion haliaetus.\n\n*Pandion haliaetus*, Salvad., Ucc.

S., 1886, p. 350, and 1887, p. 431), it was so easy to prophecy that his future explorations would bring to light the existence of more Himalayan genera in the high mountains of the Malay Peninsula, that I can take little credit for my prognostications; but the foreshadowing of Mr. WRAY's accomplishments does not impair the credit of that explorer's success in his last expedition into the mountain ranges of the interior of the Peninsula.\n\nHe states that the mountains, on which he has lived for six months, \"contain really very few more birds than the Larut range, though they are so much more extensive,\" and he collected up to an altitude of 7,000 feet.\n\nBy the present collection several interesting forms have been revealed, representatives of allied species in Tenasserim, and the ranges of several birds are extended southwards. The genera hitherto unrecorded from the mountains of Malacca are Anthipos, Brachypteryx, Gamsorhynchus, and Cutia\u2014all Himalayan in Tenasserim forms, of which, so far as we know, only Brachypteryx has occurred in Sumatra. The Avifauna of the latter island is further linked to that of the mountain ranges of the Malay Peninsula by the discovery of a black Babbling Thrush representing the Melanocichla bicolor of Sumatra.\n\nThe unexampled success which has attended Mr. WRAY's efforts so far will, we hope, encourage him to still further investigations of the interesting region in which he is domiciled.\n\nThe references in the present paper are chiefly to Mr. OATES' \"Handbook of the Birds of British Burma,\" which\nincludes an allusion to the paper on the birds of Tenasserim by Messrs. Hume & Davison. I have also referred to Count Salvadori's essay on Dr. Beccari's collections from high Sumatra (Ann. Mus. Civic. Genov. xiv, p. 169), whenever there occurs any affinity in the Avifauna of that island with the collection under discussion.\n\nMr. Wray's original remarks, by far the most important part of the present paper, are placed in inverted commas.\n\n**Fam.\u2014Falconid\u00e6.**\n\n*Neopus malayensis* (Temm.).\n\n*Neopus malayensis*, Sharpe, P.

Batang Padang mountains, Perak.\"\n\nI can hardly believe that this is the species I identified and returned to Mr. Wray as *Pericrocotus igneus* (P. Z. S., 1887, p. 435). If such be the case, I was greatly in error, for the pair of birds now sent are decidedly distinct from that species. *P. wrayi* has the quill-lining red, instead\nof yellow, and also the under wing-coverts, and it has the throat slaty grey and the ear-coverts slaty black, instead of glassy black like the head. Total length 6.3 in., culmen 0.5, wing 3.1, tail 3.2, tarsus 0.55. The female of *P. igneus* differs very much from the female of *P. wrayi* in being entirely bright yellow below and in having a scarlet rump. The nearest ally of *P. wrayi* as regards the female plumage is that of *P. brevirostris*, but *P. wrayi* is of a darker slate-grey, has a brighter yellow lower back and rump, no yellow on the forehead, and the chin white.\n\nThe males of *P. neglectus* and *P. brevirostris* differ in their glassy black throat and heavy crimson, not scarlet, under surface.\n\nWhile on the subject of the genus *Pericrocotus*, I may mention that Count Salvadori very kindly sent me over the types of his new species from Tenasserim, and I am able to state with certainty that *P. rubrolimbatus*, Salvad., Ann. Mus. Civic. Genov. (3) v. p. 582, is = *P. solaris*, and *P. pulcherrimus*, Salvad., f. c., p. 580, is \u2014 *P. neglectus* of Hume.\n\n**Pericrocotus croceus**, Sp. n.\n\n\"No 107. 3 ad. Gunong Batu Puteh (4300 feet).\n\n\"Trides dark brown, legs and feet black.\"\n\nThis is a beautiful bird, but I feel grave doubts whether it is anything more than a yellow variety of *P. wrayi*, the red part in *P. wrayi* being golden yellow in *P. croceus*, and the throat is darker, being black like the cheeks and sides of face. Total length 6.1 inches, culmen 0.45, wing 3.4, tail 2.95, tarsus 0.55.\n\n**Fam. \u2014MUSCICAPID.E.**\n\n*Muscicapula hyperythra* (Blyth).\n\n*Muscicapula hyperythra*, Sharpe, Cat. B. Brit. Mus., iv, p. 206; Salvad., f. c., p. 203.\n\n\"No 93. 3 ad. Ulu Batang Padang (4200 feet).\n\n\"Trides dark brown, legs and feet flesh-colour. Frequent the undergrowth in the forests.\"\n\nThis little Flycatcher is now recorded from the Malay\nPeninsula for the first time. Its presence was, however, to be suspected, as the species occurs in the Eastern Hymalayas and again in Java and Sumatra.\n\n*Muscicapula westermannii*, Sp. n.\n\"No. 115. \u2642 ad. Gunong Ulu Batang Padang (4,200 feet).\n\"Irides light brown.\"\n\nAdult male.\u2014General colour above blue grey, with a slight brown wash on the scapulars and lower back; rump ochreous brown; upper tail-coverts a little more refuscent; wing-coverts dusky, edged with ochreous brown; bastard-wing, primary-coverts, and quills blackish, fringed with olive-brown, the secondaries rather more rufescent on the base of the outer web, tail feathers brown, externally rufous brown; head blue-grey like the back, a little more hoary on the forehead; lores and eyelid white; ear-coverts and sides of face blue-grey, with a few whitish lines on the former; throat white, with a slight ashy tinge; remainder of under surface of body white, the sides of the breast ashy grey; sides of the body also washed with ashy grey; under tail-coverts white; thighs ashy; axillaries and under wing-coverts white, the edge of the wing blackish; quills dusky below, white along the edge of the inner web. Total length 3.7 inches, culmen 0.45, wing 2.2, tail 1.55, tarsus 0.55.\n\nThis is a very curious form, recalling the characters of several of the other *Muscicapula*. It may not be the fully adult of its species, but I believe it to be so. The reddish upper tail-coverts and tail remind one of the female of *M. maculata*, but the blue-grey upper surface distinguishes it at a glance. The female and young male of *M. supercilialis* have generally an ochreous tinge on the throat which distinguish them; but one specimen from Sikhim is white below like *M. westermannii*, while the upper surface is brown and the shade of blue which is seen on it (it is apparently a young male) is not slaty blue, but bright blue as in the adults.\n\n*Tersiphone affinis* (Blyth.).\n*Tersiphone affinis*, Oates, B.

The stomach contained one large hairy caterpillar and the partly digested remains of various insects, and the egg of one of the Phasmid\u00e6.\n\"This bird gave me a great deal of trouble, for every night and early each morning a small party of them used to pass the camp, sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other. They made a loud shrill cry something like the cry of the\nKrekah monkey, and flew quickly from tree to tree. Day after day we went out into the jungle to watch for them, but as there was no certainty which side of the camp they would take, and they always passed when it was so dark in the forest that neither they nor the sight of the gun could be distinguished, we were never successful until nearly the last day of our stay at that camp, in shooting one. The strange thing was that we never saw these birds in the daytime. They passed up the hill to roost at night-fall and down again at dawn. Their note is so loud and distinctive, and they are so noisy, that they could not easily be overlooked or mistaken for any other bird.\n\n\"They are evidently rare, as only this one small party was seen.\"\n\nThis new species is very closely allied to G. torquatus (Hume) from Tenasserim, but is altogether of much darker colour, the upper surface being more rufous-brown.

Mus Civic, Genov., (2) v, p. 600) expressed his non-concurrence in the views of Captain Wardlaw Ramsay and myself that Pterodactylus cameranoid of Sumatra is identical with P. aralatus of Tickell. The male of P. cameranoid is said by him to want the rosy tinge on the flanks, which is present in Tenasserim specimens, which are also larger; while the female of P. cameranoid differs from that of P. aralatus in the grey of the head being less pure, the back more olivaceous, and in the rufous colour of the under parts being brighter and more extended towards the throat. I therefore once more compared our series of these two birds in the British Museum, including the specimens in the Tweeddale collection. I agree with Count Salvadoni that the females are rather different, as described by him, and the female from Perak is grey-headed like the Tenasserim bird, but the male agrees with the Sumatran P. cameranoid better than with the true P. aralatus. There is a slight difference in the gloss of the head in the males from Tenasserim and Sumatra, the latter having a bluish black gloss, and the Tenasserim birds being rather greenish black on the head. The Sumatra birds have decidedly more pink on the flanks.\n\nFAM.\u2014PARIDAE.\n\nMelanochlorella sultanea (Hodgs.).\n\nMelanochlorella sultanea, Hume and Davison, Str.

The territory acquired by Sir James Brooke in 1841 and known as Sarawak Proper, was a small district with a coast line of sixty miles and with an average depth inland of fifty miles an area of three thousand square miles. Since that date, however, rivers and districts lying to the northward have been acquired by cessions for annual payments from the Brunei Government and have been incorporated with the original district of Sarawak, which has given its name to the enlarged territory, and the present area of Raja Brooke's possessions is stated to be about 40,000 square miles, supporting a population of 280,000 souls, and possessing a coast line of 380 miles. The most recent acquisition of territory was in 1884, so that the young State has shown a very vigorous growth since its birth in 1841 at the rate of about 860 square miles a year, or an increase of thirteen times its original size in the space of forty-three years.\n\nNow, alas, there are no \"more lands to conquer,\" or acquire, unless the present kingdom of Brunei, or Borneo Proper, as it is styled by the old geographers, is altogether swal-\nlowed up by its offspring, which, under its white ruler, has developed a vitality never evinced under the rule of the Royal house of Brunei in its best days.*\n\nThe limit of Sarawak's coast line to the South-West is Cape, or Tanjong, Datu, on the other side of which commences the Dutch portion of Borneo, so that expansion in that direction is barred. To the North-East the boundary is Labuk Pulai the Eastern limit of the watershed, on the coast, of the important river Barram which was acquired by Raja Brooke, in 1881, for an annual payment of \u00a31,000. Beyond this commences what is left of the Brunei Sultanate, there being but one stream of any importance between the Barram river and that on which the capital\u2014Brunei\u2014is situated. But Sarawak does not rest here; it acquired, in 1884, from the then Pangeran Tumonggong, who is now Sultan, the Trusan, a river to the East of the Brunei, under somewhat exceptional circumstances. The natives of the river were in rebellion against the Brunei Government, and in November, 1884, a party of Sarawak Dyaks, who had been trading and collecting jungle produce in the neighbourhood of the capital, having been warned by their own Government to leave the country because of its disturbed condition, and having further been warned also by the Sultan not to enter the Trusan, could not refrain from visiting that river on their homeward journey, in order to collect some outstanding trade debts. They were received in so friendly a manner, that their suspicions were not in the slightest degree aroused, and they took no precautions, believing themselves to be amongst friends. Suddenly in the night they were attacked while asleep in their boats, and the whole party, numbering about seventeen, massacred, with the exception of one man who, though wounded, managed to effect his escape and ultimately found his way to Labuan, where he was treated in the Government Hospital and made a recovery. The heads of the murdered men were, as is customary, taken by the murderers. No very distinct reason can be given for the attack, except that the Trusan\n\n* On the 17th March, 1890 the Lumbang River was forcibly annexed by Sarawak, subject to the Queen's sanction.\npeople were in a \"slaying\" mood, being on the \"war-path\" and in arms against their own Government, and it has also been said that those particular Dyaks happened to be wearing trousers instead of their ordinary chawat, or loin cloth, and, as their enemies, the Brunais, were trouser-wearers, the Trusan people thought fit to consider all natives wearing such extravagant clothing as their enemies. The Sarawak Government, on hearing of the incident, at once despatched Mr. Maxwell, the Chief Resident, to demand redress. The Brunei Government, having no longer the warlike Kyans at their beck and call, that tribe having passed to Raja Brooke with the river Barram, were wholly unable to undertake the punishment of the offenders. Mr. Maxwell then demanded as compensation the sum of $22,000, basing his calculations on the amount which some time previously the British Government had exacted in the case of some British subjects who had been murdered in another river.\n\nThis demand the bankrupt Government of Brunei was equally incompetent to comply with, and, thereupon, the matter was settled by the transfer of the river to Raja Brooke in consideration of the large annual payment of $4,500, two years' rental\u2014$9,000, being paid in advance, and Sarawak thus acquired, as much by good luck as through good management, a pied \u00e0 terre in the very centre of the Brunei Sultanate and practically blocked the advance of their northern rivals\u2014the Company\u2014on the capital. This river was the kouripan (see ante, page 38 of Journal No. 20) of the present Sultan, and a feeling of pique which he then entertained against the Government of British North Borneo, on account of their refusing him a monetary loan to which he conceived he had a claim, caused him to make this cession with a better grace and more readily than might otherwise have been the case, for he was well aware that the British North Borneo Company viewed with some jealousy the extension of Sarawak territory in this direction, having, more than probably, themselves an ambition to carry their own southern boundary as near to Brunei as circumstances would admit. The same feeling on the part of the Tumonggong induced him to listen to Mr. Maxwell's proposals for the cession to Sarawak of a still\nmore important river\u2014the Limbang\u2014one on which the existence of Brunei itself as an independent State may be said to depend. But the then reigning Sultan and the other Ministers of State refused their sanction, and the Tumonggong, since his accession to the throne, has also very decidedly changed his point of view, and is now in accord with the large majority of his Brunei subjects to whom such a cession would be most distasteful. It should be explained that the Limbang is an important sago-producing river, close to the capital and forming an actual portion of the Brunei river itself, with the waters of which it mingles; indeed, the Brunei river is probably the former mouth of the Limbang, and is itself but a salt-water inlet, producing nothing but fish and prawns. As the Bruneis themselves put it, the Limbang is their pruak nasi, their rice pot, an expression which gains the greater force when it is remembered that rice is the chief food with this eastern people, in a more emphatic sense even than bread is with us. This question of the Limbang river will afford a good instance and specimen of the oppressive government, or want of government, on the part of the Brunei rulers, and I will return to it again, continuing now my short glance at Sarawak's progress. Raja Brooke had had little difficulty in establishing his authority in the districts acquired from time to time, for not only were the people glad to be freed from the tyranny of the Brunei Rajas, but the fame of both the present Raja and of his famous uncle Sir James had spread far and wide in Borneo, and, in addition, it was well known that the Sarawak Government had at its back its war-like Dyak tribes, who, now that \"head-hunting\" has been stopped amongst them, would have heartily welcomed the chance of a little legitimate fighting and \"at the commandment of the Magistrate to wear weapons and serve in the wars,\" as the XXXVIIth Article of our Church permits. In the Trusan, the Sarawak flag was freely distributed and joyfully accepted, and in a short time the Brunei river was dotted with little roughly \"dug-out\" canoes, manned by repulsive-looking, naked, skin-diseased savages, each proudly flying an enormous Sarawak ensign, with its Christian symbol of the Cross, in the Muhammadan capital.\nA fine was imposed and paid for the murder of the Sarawak Dyaks, and the heads delivered up to Mr. A. H. Everett, the Resident of the new district, who thus found his little launch on one occasion decorated in an unusual manner with these ghastly trophies, which were, I believe, forwarded to the sorrowing relatives at home.\n\nIn addition to these levies of warriors expert in jungle fighting, on which the Government can always count, the Raja has a small standing army known as the \"Sarawak Rangers,\" recruited from excellent material\u2014the natives of the country\u2014under European Officers, armed with breech-loading rifles, and numbering two hundred and fifty or three hundred men. There is, in addition, a small Police Force, likewise composed of natives, as also are the crews of the small steamers and launches which form the Sarawak Navy. With the exception, therefore, of the European Officers, there is no foreign element in the military, naval and civil forces of the State, and the peace of the people is kept by the people themselves, a state of things which makes for the stability and popularity of the Government, besides enabling it to provide for the defence of the country and the preservation of internal order at a lower relative cost than probably any other Asiatic country, the Government of which is in the hand of Europeans. Sir James Brooke did not marry, and died in 1868, having appointed as his successor the present Raja Charles Johnson, who has taken the name of Brooke, and has proclaimed his eldest son, a youth of sixteen, heir apparent, with the title of Raja Muda. The form of Government is that of an absolute monarchy, but the Raja is assisted by a Supreme Council composed of two European officials and four natives nominated by himself. There is also a General Council of some fifty members, which is not usually convened more frequently than once in two or three years. For administrative purposes, the country is divided into Divisions, each under a European Resident with European and Native Assistants. The Resident administers justice, and is responsible for the collection of the Revenue and the preservation of order in the district, reporting direct to the Raja. Salaries are on an equitable scale and the regulations for leave and pension on retirement are conceived in a liberal spirit.\nThere is no published Code of Laws, but the Raja, when the occasion arises, issues regulations and proclamations for the guidance of officials, who, in criminal cases, follow as much as possible the Indian Criminal Code. Much is left to the common sense of the Judicial Officers, native customs and religious prejudices receive due consideration, and there is a right of appeal to the Raja. Slavery was in full force when Sir James Brooke assumed the Government, all captives in the numerous tribal wars and piratical expeditions being kept or sold as slaves.\n\nMeans were taken to mitigate as much as possible the condition of the slaves, not, as a rule, a very hard one in these countries, and to gradually abolish the system altogether, which latter object was to be accomplished by 1888.\n\nThe principal item of revenue is the annual sum paid by the person who secures from the Government the sole right of importing, preparing for consumption, and retailing opium throughout the State. The holder of this monopoly is known as the \"Opium Farmer,\" and the monopoly is termed the \"Opium Farm.\" These expressions have occasionally given rise to the notion that the opium-producing poppy is cultivated locally under Government supervision, and I have seen it included among the list of Borneo products in a recent geographical work. It is evident that the system of farming out this monopoly has a tendency to limit the consumption of the drug, as, owing to the heavy rental paid to the Government, the retail price of the article to the consumer is very much enhanced.\n\nWere the monopoly abolished, it would be impossible for the Government efficiently to check the contraband importation of so easily smuggled an article as prepared opium, or chandu, and by lowering the price the consumption would be increased.\n\nThe use of the drug is almost entirely confined to the Chinese portion of the population. A poll-tax, customs and excise duties, mining royalties and fines and fees make up the rest of the revenue, which in 1884 amounted to $237,752 and in 1885 to $315,264. The expenditure for the same years is given by Vice-Consul Cadell as $234,161 and $321,264.\nrespectively. In the early days of Sarawak, it was a very serious problem to find the money to pay the expenses of a most economical Government. Sir James Brooke sunk all his own fortune\u2014\u00a330,000\u2014in the country, and took so gloomy a view of the financial prospects of his kingdom that, on the refusal of England to annex it, he offered it first to France and then to Holland. Fortunately these offers were never carried into effect, and, with the assistance of the Borneo Company (not to be confused with the British North Borneo Company), who acquired the concession of the right to work the minerals in Sarawak, bad times were tide over, and, by patient perseverance, the finances of the State have been brought to their present satisfactory condition. What the amount of the national public debt is, I am not in a position to say, but, like all other countries aspiring to be civilized, it possesses a small one. The improvement in the financial position was undoubtedly chiefly due to the influx of Chinese, especially of gambier and pepper planters, who were attracted by liberal concessions of land and monetary assistance in the first instance from the Government. The present Raja has himself said that \"without the Chinese we can do nothing,\" and we have only to turn to the British possession in the far East\u2014the Straits Settlements, the Malay Peninsula, and Hongkong\u2014to see that this is the case. For instance, the revenue of the Straits Settlements in 1887 was $3,847,475, of which the opium farm alone\u2014that is a tax practically speaking borne by the Chinese population\u2014contributed $1,779,600, or not very short of one half of the whole, and they of course contribute in many other ways as well. The frugal, patient, industrious, go-ahead, money-making Chinaman is undoubtedly the colonist for the sparsely inhabited islands of the Malay archipelago. Where, as in Java, there is a large native population and the struggle for existence has compelled the natives to adopt habits of industry, the presence of the Chinaman is not a necessity, but in a country like Borneo, where the inhabitants, from time immemorial, except during unusual periods of drought or epidemic sickness, have never found the problem of existence bear hard upon them, it is impossible to impress upon the natives that they ought to have \"wants,\" whether\nthey feel them or not, and that the pursuit of the dollar for the sake of mere possession is an ennobling object, differentiating the simple savage from the complicated product of the higher civilization. The Malay, in his ignorance, thinks that if he can obtain clothing suitable to the climate, a hut which adequately protects him from sun and rain, and a wife to be the mother of his children and the cooker of his meals, he should therewith rest content; but, then, no country made up of units possessed of this simple faith can ever come to anything\u2014can ever be civilized, and hence the necessity for the Chinese immigrant in Eastern Colonies that want to show an annual revenue advancing by leaps and bounds. The Chinaman, too, in addition to his valuable properties as a keen trader and a man of business, collecting from the natives the products of the country, which he passes on to the European merchant, from whom he obtains the European fabrics and American \"notions\" to barter with the natives, is also a good agriculturist, whether on a large or small scale; he is muscular and can endure both heat and cold, and so is, at any rate in the tropics, far and away a superior animal to the white labourer, whether for agricultural or mining work, as an artizan, or as a hewer of wood and drawer of water, as a cook, a housemaid or a washerwoman. He can learn any trade that a white man can teach him, from ship-building to watchmaking, and he does not drink and requires scarcely any holidays or Sundays, occasionally only a day to worship his ancestors.\n\nIt will be said that if he does not drink he smokes opium. Yes! he does, and this, as we have seen, is what makes him so beloved of the Colonial Chancellors of the Exchequer. At the same time he is, if strict justice and firmness are shewn him, wonderfully law-abiding and orderly. Faction fights, and serious ones no doubt, do occur between rival classes and rival secret societies, but to nothing like the extent that would be the case were they white men. It is not, I think, sufficiently borne in mind, that a very large proportion of the Chinese there are of the lower, I may say of the lowest, orders, many of them of the criminal class and the scourgings of some of the large cities of China, who arrive at their destination in possession of nothing but a pair of trousers and a jacket and,\nmay be, an opium pipe, in addition to this they come from different provinces, between the inhabitants of which there has always been rivalry, and the languages of which are so entirely different that it is a usual thing to find Chinese of different provinces compelled to carry on their conversation in Malay or \"pidgeon\" English, and finally, as though the elements of danger were not already sufficient, they are pressed on their arrival to join rival secret societies, between which the utmost enmity and hatred exists. Taking all these things into consideration, I maintain that the Chinaman is a good and orderly citizen and that his good qualities, especially as a revenue-payer in the Far East, much more than counterbalance his bad ones. The secret societies, whose organization permeates Chinese society from the top to the bottom, are the worst feature in the social condition of the Chinese colonists, and in Sarawak a summary method of suppressing them has been adopted. The penalty for belonging to one of these societies is death. When Sir James Brooke took over Sarawak, there was a considerable Chinese population, settled for generations in the country and recruited from Dutch territory, where they had been subject to no supervision by the Government, whose hold over the country was merely nominal. They were principally gold diggers, and being accustomed to manage their own affairs and settle their disputes amongst themselves, they resented any interference from the new rulers, and, in 1857, a misunderstanding concerning the opium revenue having occurred, they suddenly rose in arms and seized the capital. It was some time before the Raja's forces could be collected and let loose upon them, when large numbers were killed and the majority of the survivors took refuge in Dutch territory.\n\nThe scheme for introducing Chinese pepper and gambier planters into Sarawak was set on foot in 1878 or 1879, and has proved a decided success, though, as Vice-Consul Cadell remarked in 1886, it is difficult to understand why even larger numbers have not availed themselves of the terms offered \"since coolies have the protection of the Sarawak Government, which further grants them free passages from Singapore, whilst the climate is a healthy one, and there are\nno dangers to be feared from wild animals, tigers being unknown in Sarawak.\" The fact remains that, though there is plenty of available land, there is an insufficiency of Chinese labour still. The quantity of pepper exported in 1885 was 392 tons, valued at \u00a319,067, and of gambier 1,370 tons, valued at \u00a323,772.\n\nSarawak is said to supply more than half of the sago produce of the world. The value of the sago it exported in 1885 is returned at \u00a335,953. Of the purely uncultivated jungle products that figure in the exports the principal are gutta-percha, India rubber, and rattans.\n\nBoth antimony ores and cinnabar (an ore of quicksilver) are worked by the Borneo Company, but the exports of the former ore and of quicksilver are steadily decreasing, and fresh deposits are being sought for. Only one deposit of cinnabar has so far been discovered, that was in 1867. Antimony was first discovered in Sarawak in 1824, and for a long time it was from this source that the principal supplies for Europe and America were obtained. The ores are found \"generally as boulders deep in clayey soil, or perched on tower-like summits and craggy pinnacles and, sometimes, in dykes in situ.\" The ores, too poor for shipment, are reduced locally, and the regulus exported to London. Coal is abundant, but is not yet worked on any considerable scale.* The Borneo Company excepted, all the trade of the country is in the hands of Chinese and Natives, nor has the Government hitherto taken steps to attract European capital for planting; but experiments are being made with the public funds under European supervision in the planting of cinchona, coffee, and tobacco. The capital of Sarawak is Kuching, which in Malay signifies a \"cat.\" It is situated about fifteen miles up the Sarawak river and, when Sir James first arrived, was a wretched native town, with palm leaf huts and a population, including a few Chinese and Kling (natives of India), of some two thousand. Kuching now possesses a well built \"Istana,\" or Palace of the Raja, a Fort, impregnable to natives, a substan-\n\n*Since this was written Raja Sir Charles Brooke has acquired valuable coal concessions at Muara at the mouth of the Brunei river, and the development of the coal resources of the State is being energetically pushed forward.\nBRITISH BORNEO.\n\ntial Gaol, Court House, Government Offices, Public Market and Church, and is the headquarters of the Bishop of Singapore and Sarawak, who is the head of the Protestant Mission in the country. There is a well built brick Chinese trading quarter, or \"bazaar,\" the Europeans have comfortable bungalows, and the present population is said to number twelve thousand.\n\nIn the early days of his reign, Sir James Brooke was energetically assisted in his great work of suppressing piracy and rendering the seas and rivers safe for the passage of the peaceful trader, by the British men-of-war on the China Station, and was singularly fortunate in having an energetic co-adjutor in Captain (now Admiral) Sir Henry Keppel, K.C.B.\n\nIt will give some idea of the extent to which piracy, then almost the sole occupation of the Illanun, Balinini, and Sea Dyak tribes, was indulged in that the \"Headmoney,\" then paid by the British Government for pirates destroyed, amounted in these expeditions to the large total of \u00a320,000, the awarding of which sum occasioned a great stir at the time and led to the abolition of this system of \"payment by results.\" Mr. Hume took exception altogether to the action of Sir James Brooke, and, in 1851, charges were brought against him, and a Royal Commission appointed to take evidence on the spot, or rather at Singapore.\n\nA man like Brooke, of an enthusiastic, impulsive, unselfish and almost Quixotic disposition, who wore his heart on his sleeve and let his opinions of men and their actions be freely known, could not but have incurred the enmity of many meaner, self-seeking minds. The Commission, after hearing all that could be brought against him, found that there was nothing proved, but it was not deemed advisable that Sir James should continue to act as the British representative in Borneo and as Governor of the Colony of Labuan, positions which were indeed incompatible with that of the independent ruler of Sarawak. Sarawak independence was first recognised by the Americans, and the British followed suit in 1863, when a Vice-Consulate was established there. The question of formally proclaiming a British Protectorate over Sarawak is now being\nconsidered, and it is to be hoped, will be carried into effect.* The personnel of the Government is purely British, most of the merchants and traders are of British nationality, and the whole trade of the country finds its way to the British Colony of the Straits Settlements.\n\nWe can scarcely let a country such as this, with its local and other resources, so close to Singapore and on the route to China, fall into the hands of any other European Power, and the only means of preventing such a catastrophe is by the proclamation of a Protectorate over it\u2014a Protectorate which, so long as the successors of Raja Brooke prove their competence to govern, should be worked so as to interfere as little as possible in the internal affairs of the State. The virulently hostile and ignorant criticisms to which Sir James Brooke was subjected in England, and the financial difficulties of this little kingdom, coupled with a serious dispute with a nephew whom he had appointed his successor, but whom he was compelled to depose, embittered the last years of his life. To the end he fought his foes in his old, plucky, honest, vigorous and straightforward style. He died in June, 1868, from a paralytic stroke, and was succeeded by his nephew, the present Raja. What Sir James Brooke might have accomplished had he not been hampered by an opposition based on ignorance and imperfect knowledge at home, we cannot say; what he did achieve, I have endeavoured briefly to sketch, and unprejudiced minds cannot but deem the founding of a prosperous State and the total extirpation of piracy, slavery and head-hunting, a monument worthy of a high, noble and unselfish nature.\n\nIn addition to that of the Church of England, there has, within the last few years, been established a Roman Catholic Mission, under the auspices of the St Joseph's College, Mill Hill.\n\nThe Muhammadans, including all the true Malay inhabitants, do not make any concerted effort to disseminate the doctrines of their faith.\n\nThe following information relative to the Church of England Mission has been kindly furnished me by the Right\n\n* This has since been formally proclaimed.\nReverend Dr. Hose, the present Bishop of \"Singapore, Labuan and Sarawak,\" which is the official title of his extensive See which includes the Colony of the Straits Settlements\u2014Penang, Province Wellesley, Malacca and Singapore\u2014and its Dependencies, the Protected States of the Malay Peninsula, the State of Sarawak, the Crown Colony of Labuan, the Territories of the British North Borneo Company and the Congregation of English people scattered over Malaya.\n\nThe Mission was, in the first instance, set on foot by the efforts of Lady Burdett-Coutts and others in 1847, when Sir James Brooke was in England and his doings in the Far East had excited much interest and enthusiasm, and was specially organized under the name of the \"Borneo Church Mission.\" The late Reverend T. McDougall, was the first Missionary, and subsequently became the first Bishop. His name was once well known, owing to a wrong construction put upon his action, on one occasion, in making use of firearms when a vessel, on which he was aboard, came across a fleet of pirates. He was a gifted, practical and energetic man and had the interest of his Mission at heart, and, in addition to other qualifications, added the very useful one, in his position, of being a qualified medical man. Bishop McDougall was succeeded on his retirement by Bishop Chambers, who had experience gained while a Missionary in the country. The present Bishop was appointed in 1881. The Mission was eventually taken over by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and this Society defrays, with unimportant exceptions, the whole cost of the See.\n\nDr. Hose has under him in Sarawak eight men in holy orders, of whom six are Europeans, one Chinese and one Eurasian. The influence of the Missionaries has spread over the Skerang, Balau and Sibuyan tribes of Sea-Dyaks, and also among the Land-Dyaks near Kuching, the Capital, and among the Chinese of that town and the neighbouring pepper plantations.\n\nThere are now seven churches and twenty-five Mission chapels in Sarawak, and about 4,000 baptized Christians of the Church of England. The Mission also provides means of\neducation and, through its press, publishes translations of the Bible, the Prayer Book and other religious and educational works, in Malay and in two Dyak dialects, which latter have only become written languages since the establishment of the Mission. In their Boys' School, at Kuching, over a hundred boys are under instruction by an English Master, assisted by a staff of Native Assistants; there is also a Girls' School, under a European Mistress, and schools at all the Mission Stations. The Government of Sarawak allows a small grant-in-aid to the schools and a salary of \u00a3200 a year to one of the Missionaries, who acts as Government Chaplain.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Mission commenced its works in Sarawak in 1881, and is under the direction of the Reverend Father JACKSON, Prefect Apostolic, who has also two or three Missionaries employed in British North Borneo. In Sarawak there are six or eight European priests and schoolmasters and a sisterhood of four or five nuns. In Kuching they have a Chapel and School and a station among the Land-Dyaks in the vicinity. They have recently established a station and erected a Chapel on the Kanowit River, an affluent of the Rejang. The Missionaries are mostly foreigners and, I believe, are under a vow to spend the remainder of their days in the East, without returning to Europe.\n\nTheir only reward is their consciousness of doing, or trying to do good, and any surplus of their meagre stipends which remains, after providing the barest necessaries of life, is refunded to the Society. I do not know what success is attending them in Sarawak, but in British North Borneo and Labuan, where they found that Father QUARTERON's labours had left scarcely any impression, their efforts up to present have met with little success, and experiments in several rivers have had to be abandoned, owing to the utter carelessness of the Pagan natives as to matters relating to religion. When I left North Borneo in 1887, their only station which appeared to show a prospect of success was one under Father PUNDELEIDER, amongst the semi-Chinese of Bundu, to whom reference has been made on a previous page. But these people, while permitting their children to be educated and baptized by the\nFather, did not think it worth their while to join the Church themselves.\n\nNeither Mission has attempted to convert the Muhammadan tribes, and indeed it would, at present, be perfectly useless to do so and, from the Government point of view, impolitic and inadvisable as well.\n\nChapter V.\n\nI will now take a glance at the incident of the rebellion of the inhabitants of the Limbang, the important river near Brunei to which allusion has already been made, as from this one sample he will be able to judge of the ordinary state of affairs in districts near the Capital, since the establishment of Labuan as a Crown Colony and the conclusion of the treaty and the appointment of a British Consul-General in Brunei, and will also be able to attempt to imagine the oppression prevalent before those events took place. The river, being a fertile and well populated one and near Brunei, had been from old times the common purse of the numerous nobles who, either by inheritance, or in virtue of their official positions, as I have explained, owned as their followers the inhabitants of the various villages situated on its banks, and many were the devices employed to extort the uttermost farthing from the unfortunate people, who were quite incapable of offering any resistance because the warlike Kyan tribe was ever ready at hand to sweep down upon them at the behest of their Brunei oppressors. The system of *dagang sara* (forced trade) I have already explained. Some of the other devices I will now enumerate. *Chukei basoh battu*, or the tax of washing feet, a contribution, varying in amount at the sweet will of the imposer, levied when the lord of the village, or his chief agent, did it the honour of a visit. *Chukei bongkar-sauh*, or tax on weighing anchor, similarly levied when the lord took his departure and perhaps therefore, paid with more willingness. *Chukei talongan*, or tax of assistance, levied when the lord had need of funds for some special purpose or on a special occasion such as a wedding\u2014and these are numerous amongst polygamists\u2014a birth,\nthe building of a house or of a vessel. Chop bibas, literally a free seal, this was a permission granted by the Sultan to some noble and needy favourite to levy a contribution for his own use anywhere he thought he could most easily enforce it. The method of inventing imaginary crimes and delinquencies and punishing them with heavy fines has been already mentioned. Then there are import and export duties as to which no reasonable complaint can be made, but a real grievance and hindrance to legitimate trade was the effort which the Malays, supported by their rulers, made to prevent the interior tribes trading direct with the Chinese and other foreign traders\u2014acting themselves as middlemen, so that but a very small share of profit fell to the aborigines. The lords, too, had the right of appointing as many orang kayas, or headmen, from among the natives as they chose, a present being expected on their elevation to that position and another on their death. In many rivers there was also an annual poll-tax, but this does not appear to have been collected in the Limbang. Sir Spencer St John, writing in 1856, gives, in his \"Life in the Forests of the Far East,\" several instances of the grievous oppression practiced on the Limbang people. Amongst others he mentions how a native, in a fit of desperation, had killed an extortionate tax-gatherer. Instead of having the offender arrested and punished, the Sultan ordered his village to be attacked, when fifty persons were killed and an equal number of women and children were made prisoners and kept as slaves by His Highness. The immediate cause of the rebellion to which I am now referring was the extraordinary extortion practised by one of the principal Ministers of State. The revenues of his office were principally derived from the Limbang River and, as the Sultan was very old, he determined to make the best possible use of the short time remaining to him to extract all he could from his wretched feudatories. To aid him in his design, he obtained, with the assistance of the British North Borneo Company, a steam launch, and the Limbang people subsequently pointed out to me this launch and complained bitterly that it was with the money forced out of them that this means of oppressing them had been purchased. He then employed the\nmost unscrupulous agents he could discover, imposed outrageous fines for trifling offenses, and would even interfere if he heard of any private disputes among the villagers, adjudicate unasked in their cases, taking care always to inflict a heavy fine which went, not to the party aggrieved, but into his own pocket. If the fines could not be paid, and this was often the case, owing to their being purposely fixed at such a high rate, the delinquent's sago plantation\u2014the principal wealth of the people in the Limbang River\u2014would be confiscated and become the private property of the Minister, or of some of the members of his household. The patience of the people was at length exhausted, and they remembered that the Brunei nobles could no longer call in the Kayans to enforce their exactions, that tribe having become subjects to Raja Brooke. About the month of August, 1884, two of the Minister's messengers, or tax collectors, who were engaged in the usual process of squeezing the people, were fired on and killed by the Bisayans, the principal pagan tribe in the river. The Tumonggong determined to punish this outrage in person and probably thought his august presence on the spot in a steam-launch would quickly bring the natives to their knees and afford him a grand opportunity of replenishing his treasury.\n\nHe accordingly ascended the river with a considerable force in September, and great must have been his surprise when he found that his messenger, sent in advance to call the people to meet him, was fired on and killed. He could scarcely have believed the evidence of his own ears; however, when shortly afterwards his royal launch and little fleet were fired on from the river banks. For two days was this truce kept up, the Bruneis having great difficulty in returning it, owing to the river being low and the banks steep and lined with large trees, behind which the natives took shelter, and a few casualties having occurred on board and one of the Royal guns having burst, which was known as the Amiral Mummia, the Tumonggong deemed it expedient to retire and returned ignominiously to Brunei. The rebels, emboldened by the impunity they had so far enjoyed, were soon found to be hovering round the outskirts of the capital, and every\nnow and then an outlying house would be attacked during the night and the headless corpses of its occupants be found on the morrow. There being no forts and no organized force to resist attack, the houses, moreover, being nearly all constructed of highly inflammable palm leaf thatch and matting, a universal panic prevailed amongst all classes, when the Limbang people announced their intention of firing the town. Considerable distress too prevailed, as the spirit of rebellion had spread to all the districts near the capital, and the Brunei people who had settled in them were compelled to flee for their lives, leaving their property in the hands of the insurgents, while the people of the city were unable to follow their usual avocations\u2014trading, planting, sago washing and so forth, the Brunei River, as has been pointed out, producing nothing itself. British trade being thus affected by the continuance of such a state of affairs, and the British subjects in the city being in daily fear from the apprehended attack by the rebels, the English Consul-General did what he could to try and arrange matters. A certain Datu Klassie, one of the most influential of the Bisaya Chiefs, came into Brunei without any followers, but bringing with him, as a proof of the friendliness of his mission, his wife. Instead of utilizing the services of this Chief in opening communication with the natives, the Tumonggong, maddened by his ignominious defeat, seized both Datu Klassie and his wife and placed them in the public stocks, heavily ironed.\n\nI was Acting Consul-General at the time, and my assistance in arranging matters had been requested by the Brunei Government, while the Bisayas also had expressed their warm desire to meet and consult with me if I would trust myself amongst them, and I at once arranged so to do, but, being well aware that my mission would be perfectly futile unless I was the bearer of terms from the Sultan and unless Datu Klassie and his wife were released, I refused to take any steps until these two points were conceded.\n\nThis was a bitter pill for the Brunei Rajas and especially for the Tumonggong, who, though perfectly aware that he was quite unable, not only to punish the rebels, but even to defend the city against their attacks, yet clung to the vain hope that\nthe British Government might be induced to regard them as pirates and so interfere in accordance with the terms of the treaty, or that the Raja of Sarawak would construe some old agreement made with Sir James Brooke as necessitating his rendering armed assistance.\n\nHowever, owing to the experience, tact, perseverance and intelligence of Inche Mahomet, the Consular Agent, we gained our point after protracted negotiations, and obtained the seals of the Sultan, the Bandahara, the Di Gadong and the Tumonggong himself to a document, by which it was provided that, on condition of the Limbang people laying down their arms and allowing free intercourse with Brunei, all arbitrary taxation such as that which has been described should be forever abolished; but that, in lieu thereof, a fixed poll-tax should be paid by all adult males, at the rate of $3 per annum by married men and $2 by bachelors; that on the death of an orang kaya the contribution to be paid to the feudal lord should be fixed at one pikul of brass gun, equal to about $21; that the possession of their sago plantations should be peaceably enjoyed by their owners, that jungle products should be collected without tax, except in the case of gutta percha, on which a royalty of 5% ad valorem should be paid, instead of the 20% then exacted, that the taxes should be collected by the headmen punctually and transmitted to Brunei, and that four Brunei tax-gatherers, who were mentioned by name and whose rapacious and criminal action had been instrumental in provoking the rebellion, should be forbidden ever again to enter the Limbang River, that a free pardon should be granted to the rebels.\n\nAccompanied by Inche Mahomet and with some Bisaya interpreters, I proceeded up the Limbang River, on the 21st October, in a steam-launch, towing the boats of Pangeran Istri Naga and of the Datu Ahamat, who were deputed to accompany us and represent the Brunei Government.\n\nSeveral hundred of the natives assembled to meet us, and the Government conditions were read out and explained. It was evident that the people found it difficult to place much reliance in the promises of the Rajas, although the document was formally attested by the seals of the Sultan and of his\nthree Ministers, and a duplicate had been prepared for them to keep in their custody for future reference. It was seen, too, that there were a number of Muhammadans in the crowd who appeared adverse to the acceptance of the terms offered, and, doubtless, many of them were acting at the instigation of the Tumonggong's party, who by no means relished so peaceful a solution of the difficulties their chief's action had brought about.\n\nWhilst the conference was still going on and the various clauses of the firman were being debated, news arrived that the Rajas had, in the basest manner, let loose the Trusan Muruts on the district the day we had sailed for the Limbang, and that these wretches had murdered and carried off the heads of four women, two of whom were pregnant, and two young unmarried girls and of two men who were at work in their gardens.\n\nThis treacherous action was successful in breaking up the meeting, and was not far from causing the massacre of at any rate the Brunei portion of our party, and the Pangoran and the Datu quickly betook themselves to their boats and scuttled off to Brunei not waiting for the steam-launch.\n\nBut we determined not to be beaten by the Rajas' manoeuvres, and so, though a letter reached me from the Sultan warning me of what had occurred and urging me to return to Brunei, we stuck to our posts, and ultimately were rewarded by the Bisayas returning and the majority of their principal chiefs signing, or rather marking the document embodying their new constitution, as it might be termed, in token of their acquiescence\u2014a result which should be placed to the credit of the indefatigable Inche Mahomet, whose services I am happy to say were specially recognised in a despatch from the Foreign Office. Returning to Brunei, I demanded the release of Datu Klassie, as had been agreed upon, but it was only after I had made use of very plain language to his messengers that the Tumonggong gave orders for his release and that of his wife, whom I had the pleasure of taking up the river and restoring to their friends.\n\nH. M. S. Pegasus calling at Labuan soon afterwards, I seized the opportunity to request Captain Bickford to make a little demonstration in Brunei, which was not often visited\nby a man-of-war, with the double object of restoring confidence to the British subjects there and the traders generally and of exacting a public apology for the disgraceful conduct of the Government in allowing the Muruts to attack the Limbang people while we were up that river. Captain BICKFORD at once complied with my request, and, as the Pegasus drew too much water to cross the bar, the boats were manned and armed and towed up to the city by a steam-launch. It was rather a joke against me that the launch which towed up the little flotilla designed to overawe Brunei was sent for the occasion by one of the principal Ministers of the Sultan. It was placed at my disposal by the Pangeran Di Gadong, who was then a bitter enemy of the Tumonggong, and glad to witness his discomfiture. This was on the 3rd November, 1884.\n\nWith reference to the heads taken on the occasion mentioned above, I may add that the Muruts were allowed to retain them, and the disgusting sight was to be seen, at one of the watering places in the town, of these savages \"cooking\" and preparing the heads for keeping in their houses.\n\nAs the Brunei Government was weak and powerless, I am of opinion that the agreement with the Limbang people might have been easily worked had the British Government thought it worth while to insist upon its observance. As it was, hostilities did cease, the headmen came down and visited the old Sultan and trade recommenced. In June, 1885, Sultan MUMIM died, at the age, according to Native statements, which are very unreliable on such points, of 114 years, and was succeeded by the Tumonggong, who was proclaimed Sultan on the 5th June of the same year, when I had the honour of being present at the ceremony, which was not of an imposing character. The new Sultan did not forget the mortifying treatment he had received at the hands of the Limbang people, and refused to receive their Chiefs. He retained, too, in his own hands the appointment of Tumonggong, and with it the rights of that office over the Limbang River, and it became the interest of many different parties to prevent the completion of the pacification of that district. The gentleman for whom I had been acting as Con-\nsul-General soon afterwards returned to his post. In May, 1887, Sir Frederick Weld, Governor of the Straits Settlements, was despatched to Brunei by Her Majesty's Government, on a special mission, to report on the affairs of the Brunei Sultanate and as to recent cessions of territory made, or in course of negotiation, to the British North Borneo Company and to Sarawak. His report has not been yet made public. There were at one time grave objections to allowing Raja Brooke to extend his territory, as there was no guarantee that some one of his successors might not prefer a life of inglorious ease in England to the task of governing natives in the tropics, and sell his kingdom to the highest bidder\u2014say France or Germany\u2014but if the British Protectorate over Sarawak is formally proclaimed, there would appear to be no reasonable objection to the Brookes establishing their Government in such other districts as the Sultan may see good of his own free will to cede, but it should be the duty of the British Government to see that their ally is fairly treated and that any cessions he may make are entirely voluntary and not brought about by coercion in any form\u2014direct or indirect.\n\nChapter VI.\n\nThe British Colony of Labuan was obtained by cession from the Sultan of Brunei and was in the shape of a quid pro quo for assistance in suppressing piracy in the neighbouring seas, which the Brunei Government was supposed to have at heart, but in all probability, the real reason of the willingness on the Sultan's part to cede it was his desire to obtain a powerful ally to assist him in reasserting his authority in many parts of the North and West portions of his dominions, where the allegiance of the people had been transferred to the Sultan of Sulu and to Illanun and Baliniini piratical leaders. It was a similar reason which, in 1774, induced the Brunei Government to grant to the East India Company the monopoly of the trade in pepper, and is explained in Mr. Jesse's letter to the Court of Directors as follows. He says that he found the reason of their unanimous inclination to cultivate the friendship and alliance of the Company was their desire for\n\"protection from their piratical neighbours, the Sulus and Mindanaos, and others, who make continual depredations on their coast, by taking advantage of their natural timidity.\"\n\nThe first connection of the British with Labuan was on the occasion of their being expelled by the Sulus from Balambangan, in 1775, when they took temporary refuge on the island.\n\nIn 1844, Captain Sir Edward Belcher visited Brunei to enquire into rumours of the detention of a European female in the country\u2014rumours which proved to be unfounded. Sir James Brooke accompanied him, and on this occasion the Sultan, who had been terrified by a report that his capital was to be attacked by a British squadron of sixteen or seventeen vessels, addressed a document, in conjunction with Raja Muda Hassim, to the Queen of England, requesting her aid \"for the suppression of piracy and the encouragement and extension of trade; and to assist in forwarding these objects they are willing to cede to the Queen of England, the Island of Labuan, and its islets on such terms as may hereafter be arranged by any person appointed by Her Majesty. The Sultan and the Raja Muda Hassim consider that an English Settlement on Labuan will be of great service to the natives of the coast, and will draw a considerable trade from the northward, and from China, and should Her Majesty the Queen of England decide upon the measure, the Sultan and the Raja Muda Hassim promise to afford every assistance to the English authorities.\" In February of the following year, the Sultan and Raja Muda Hassim, in a letter accepting Sir James Brooke as Her Majesty's Agent in Borneo, without specially mentioning Labuan, expressed their adherence to their former declarations, conveyed through Sir Edward Belcher, and asked for immediate assistance \"to protect Borneo from the pirates of Marudu,\" a Bay situated at the northern extremity of Borneo\u2014assistance which was rendered in the following August, when the village of Marudu was attacked and destroyed, though it is perhaps open to doubt whether the chief, Osman, quite deserved the punishment he received. On the 1st March of the same year (1845) the Sultan verbally asked Sir James Brooke whether and at what time the English\nproposed to take possession of Labuan. Then followed the episode already narrated of the murder by the Sultan of Raja Muda Hassim and his family and the taking of Brunei by Admiral Cochrane's Squadron. In November, 1846, instructions were received in Singapore, from Lord Palmerston, to take possession of Labuan, and Captain Rodney Mundy was selected for this service. He arrived in Brunei in December, and gives an amusing account of how he proceeded to carry out his orders and obtain the voluntary cession of the island. As a preliminary, he sent \"Lieutenant Little in charge of the boats of the Iris and Wolf, armed with twenty marines, to the capital, with orders to moor them in line of battle opposite the Sultan's palace, and to await my arrival.\" On reaching the palace, Captain Mundy produced a brief document, to which he requested the Sultan to affix his seal, and which provided for eternal friendship between the two countries, and for the cession of Labuan, in consideration of which the Queen engaged to use her best endeavours to suppress piracy and protect lawful commerce. The document of 1844 had stated that Labuan would be ceded \"on such terms as may hereafter be arranged,\" and a promise to suppress piracy, the profits in which were shared by the Sultan and his nobles, was by no means regarded by them as a fair set off; it was a condition with which they would have readily dispensed. The Sultan ventured to remark that the present treaty was different to the previous one, and that a money payment was required in exchange for the cession of territory. Captain Mundy replied that the former treaty had been broken when Her Majesty's Ships were fired on by the Brunei forts, and \"at last I turned to the Sultan, and exclaimed firmly, 'Bobo chop bobo chop!'\" followed up by a few other Malay words, the tenor of which was, that I recommended His Majesty to put his seal forthwith.\" And he did so. Captain Mundy hoisted the British Flag at Labuan on the 24th December, 1846, and there still exists at Labuan in the place where it was erected by the gallant Captain, a granite slab, with an inscription recording the fact of the formal taking possession of the island in Her Majesty's name.\nIn the following year, Sir James Brooke was appointed the first Governor of the new Colony, retaining his position as the British representative in Brunei, and being also the ruler of Sarawak, the independence of which was not formally recognised by the English Government until the year 1863. Sir James was assisted at Labuan by a Lieutenant-Governor and staff of European Officers, who on their way through Singapore are said to have somewhat offended the susceptibilities of the Officials of that Settlement by pointing to the fact that they were Queen's Officers, whereas the Straits Settlements were at that time still under the Government of the East India Company. Sir James Brooke held the position of Governor until 1851, and the post has since been filled by such well-known administrators as Sir Hugh Low, Sir John Pope Hennessy, Sir Henry E. Bulwer and Sir Charles Lfes, but the expectations formed at its foundation have never been realized and the little Colony appears to be in a moribund condition, the Governorship having been left unfilled since 1881. On the 27th May, 1847, Sir James Brooke concluded the Treaty with the Sultan of Brunei which is still in force. Labuan is situated off the mouth of the Brunei River and has an area of thirty square miles. It was uninhabited when we took it, being only occasionally visited by fishermen. It was then covered, like all tropical countries, whether the soil is rich or poor, with dense forest, some of the trees being valuable as timber, but most of this has since been destroyed, partly by the successive coal companies, who required large quantities of timber for their mines, but chiefly by the destructive mode of cultivation practised by the Kadyans and other squatters from Borneo, who were allowed to destroy the forest for a crop or two of rice, the soil, except in the flooded plains, being not rich enough to carry more than one or two such harvests under such primitive methods of agriculture as only are known to the natives. The lands so cleared were deserted and were soon covered with a strong growth of fern and coarse useless latang grass, difficult to eradicate, and it is well known that, when a tropical forest is once destroyed and the land left to itself, the new jungle which may in time spring up rarely contains any\nof the valuable timber trees which composed the original forest.\n\nA few cargoes of timber were also exported by Chinese to Hongkong. Great hopes were entertained that the establishment of a European Government and a free port on an island lying alongside so rich a country as Borneo would result in its becoming an emporium and collecting station for the various products of, at any rate, the northern and western portions of this country and perhaps, too, of the Sulu Archipelago. Many causes prevented the realization of these hopes. In the first place, no successful efforts were made to restore good government on the mainland, and without a fairly good government and safety to life and property trade could not be developed. Then again Labuan was overshadowed by the prosperous Colony of Singapore, which is the universal emporium for all these islands, and, with the introduction of steamers, it was soon found that only the trade of the coast immediately opposite to Labuan could be depended upon, that of the rest including Sarawak and the City of Brunei, going direct to Singapore, for which port Labuan became a subsidiary and unimportant collecting station. The Spanish authorities did what they could to prevent trade with the Sulu Islands, and, on the signing of the Protocol between that country and Great Britain and Germany freeing the trade from restrictions, Sulu produce has been carried by steamers direct to Singapore. Since 1881, the British North Borneo Company having opened ports to the North, the greater portion of the trade of their possessions likewise finds its way direct by steamers to the same port.\n\nLabuan has never shipped cargoes direct to England, and its importance as a collecting station for Singapore is now diminishing, for the reasons above-mentioned.\n\nMost or a large portion of the trade that now falls to its share comes from the southern portion of the British North Borneo Company's territories, from which it is distant, at the nearest point, only about six miles, and the most reasonable solution of the Labuan question would certainly appear to be the proclamation of a British Protectorate over North Borneo, to which, under proper guarantees, might be assigned the\ntask of carrying on the government of Labuan, a task which it could easily and economically undertake, having a sufficiently well organised staff ready to hand.* By the Royal Charter it is already provided that the appointment of the Company's Governor in Borneo is subject to the sanction of Her Majesty's Secretary of State, and the two Officers hitherto selected have been Colonial servants, whose service have been lent by the Colonial Office to the Company.\n\nThe Census taken in 1881 gives the total population of Labuan as 5,995, but it has probably decreased considerably since that time. The number of Chinese supposed to be settled there is about 300 or 400\u2014traders, shopkeepers, coolies and sago-washers; the preparation of sago flour from the raw sago, or lamuntah, brought in from the mainland by the natives, being the principal industry of the island and employing three or four factories, in which no machinery is used. All the traders are only agents of Singapore firms and are in a small way of business. There is no European firm, or shop, in the island. Coal of good quality for raising steam is plentiful, especially at the North end of the island, and very sanguine expectations of the successful working of these coal measures were for a long time entertained, but have hitherto not been realised. The Eastern Archipelago Company, with an ambitious title but too modest an exchequer, first attempted to open the mines soon after the British occupation, but failed, and has been succeeded by three others, all I believe Scotch, the last one stopping operations in 1878. The cause of failure seems to have been the same in each case\u2014insufficient capital, local mismanagement, difficulty in obtaining labour. In a country with a rainfall of perhaps over 120 inches a year, water was naturally another difficulty in the deep workings, but this might have been very easily overcome had the Companies been in a position to purchase sufficiently powerful pumping engines.\n\nThere were three workable seams of coal, one of them, I think, twelve feet in thickness; the quality of the coal, though\n\n* My suggestion has taken shape more quickly than I expected. In 1889 Labuan was put under the administration of the Company.\ninferior to Welsh, was superior to Australian, and well reported on by the engineers of many steamers which had tried it, the vessels of the China squadron and the numerous steamers engaged in the Far East offered a ready market for the coal.\n\nIn their effort to make a \"show,\" successive managers have pretty nearly exhausted the surface workings and so honeycombed the seams with their different systems of developing their resources, that it would be, perhaps, a difficult and expensive undertaking for even a substantial company to make much of them now.*\n\nIt is needless to add that the failure to develop this one internal resource of Labuan was a great blow to the Colony, and on the cessation of the last company's operations the revenue immediately declined, a large number of workmen\u2014European, Chinese and Natives\u2014being thrown out of employment, necessitating the closing of the shops in which they spent their wages. It was found that both Chinese and the Natives of Borneo proved capital miners under European supervision.\n\nNotwithstanding the ill-luck that has attended it, the little Colony has not been a burden on the British tax-payer since the year 1860, but has managed to collect a revenue\u2014chiefly from opium, tobacco, spirits, pawnbroking and fish \"farms\"\u2014and from land rents and land sales\u2014sufficient to meet its small expenditure, at present about \u00a34,000 a year. There have been no British troops quartered in this island since 1871, and the only armed force is the Native Constabulary, numbering, I think, a dozen rank and file. Very seldom are the inhabitants cheered by the welcome visit of a British gun-boat. Still, all the formality of a British Crown Colony is kept up. The administrator is by his subjects styled \"His Excellency\" and the Members of the Legislative Council, Native and Europeans, are addressed as the \"Honourable so and so.\" An Officer, as may be supposed, has to play many parts. The present Treasurer, for instance, is an ex-Lieutenant of\n\n* Since the above was written, a fifth company, the Central Borneo Company Limited, of London\u2014has taken in hand the Labuan coal, and, finding plenty of coal to work on without sinking a shaft, confidently anticipate success. Their \u00a31 shares recently went up to \u00a34.\nHer Majesty's Navy, and is at the same time Harbour Master, Postmaster, Coroner, Police Magistrate, likewise a Judge of the Supreme Court, Superintendent of Convicts, Surveyor-General, and Clerk to the Legislative Council, and occasionally has, I believe, to write official letters of reprimand or encouragement from himself in one capacity to himself in another.\n\nThe best thing about Labuan is, perhaps, the excellence of its fruit, notably of its pumeloes, oranges and mangos, for which the Colony is indebted to the present Sir Hugh Low, who was one of the first officials under Sir James Brooke, and a man who left no stone unturned in his efforts to promote the prosperity of the island. His name was known far and wide in Northern Borneo and in the Sulu Archipelago. As an instance, I was once proceeding up a river in the island of Basilan, to the North of Sulu, with Captain C. E. Buckle, R.N., in two boats of H. M. S. Frolic, when the natives, whom we could not see, opened fire on us from the banks. I at once jumped up and shouted out that we were Mr. Low's friends from Labuan, and in a very short time we were on friendly terms with the natives, who conducted us to their village. They had thought we might be Spaniards, and did not think it worth while to enquire before firing. The mention of the Frolic reminds me that on the termination of a somewhat lengthy cruise amongst the Sulu Islands, then nominally undergoing blockade by Spanish cruisers, we were returning to Labuan through the difficult and then only partially surveyed Malawalli Channel, and after dinner we were congratulating one another on having been so safely piloted through so many dangers, when before the words were out of our mouths, we felt a shock and found ourselves fast on an unmarked rock which has since had the honour of bearing the name of our good little vessel.\n\nBesides Mr. Low's fruit garden, the only other European attempt at planting was made by my Cousin, Dr Treacher, Colonial Surgeon, who purchased an outlying island and opened a coco-nut plantation. I regret to say that in neither case, owing to the decline of the Colony, was the enterprise of the pioneers adequately rewarded.\nLabuan* at one time boasted a Colonial Chaplain and gave its name to the Bishop's See; but in 1872 or 1873, the Church was \"disestablished\" and the few European Officials who formed the congregation were unable to support a Clergyman. There exists a pretty little wooden Church, and the same indefatigable officer, whom I have described as filling most of the Government appointments in the Colony, now acts as unpaid Chaplain, having been licensed thereto by the Bishop of Singapore and Sarawak, and reads the service and even preaches a sermon every Sunday to a congregation which rarely numbers half a dozen.\n\nChapter VII.\n\nThe mode of acquisition of British North Borneo has been referred to in former pages; it was by cession for annual money payments to the Sultans of Brunei and of Sulu, who had conflicting claims to be the paramount power in the northern portion of Borneo. The actual fact was that neither of them exercised any real government or authority over by far the greater portion, the inhabitants of the coast on the various rivers following any Brunei, Illanun, Bajan, or Sulu Chief who had sufficient force of character to bring himself to the front. The pagan tribes of the interior owned allegiance to neither Sultan, and were left to govern themselves, the Muhammadan coast people considering them fair game for plunder and oppression whenever opportunity occurred, and using all their endeavours to prevent Chinese and other foreign traders from reaching them, acting themselves as middlemen, buying (bartering) at very cheap rates from the aborigines and selling for the best price they could obtain to the foreigner.\n\nI believe I am right in saying that the idea of forming a Company, something after the manner of the East India Company, to take over and govern North Borneo, originated in the fol-\n\n---\n\n* The administration of this little Crown Colony has since been entrusted to the British North Borneo Company, their present Governor Mr. C. V Creagh, having been gazetted Governor of Labuan.\nlowing manner. In 1865 Mr. Moses, the unpaid Consul for the United States in Brunei, to whom reference has been made before, acquired with his friends from the Sultan of Brunei some concessions of territory with the right to govern and collect revenues, their idea being to introduce Chinese and establish a Colony. This they attempted to carry out on a small scale in the Kinabatangan River, on the West Coast, but not having sufficient capital the scheme collapsed, but the concession was retained. Mr. Moses subsequently lost his life at sea, and a Colonel Torrey became the chief representative of the American syndicate. He was engaged in business in China, where he met Baron von Overbeck, a merchant of Hongkong and Austrian Consul-General, and interested him in the scheme. In 1875 the Baron visited Borneo in company with the Colonel, interviewed the Sultan of Brunei, and made enquiries as to the validity of the concessions, with apparently satisfactory results. Mr. Alfred Dent* was also a China merchant well known in Shanghai, and he in turn was interested in the idea by Baron Overbeck. Thinking there might be something in the scheme, he provided the required capital, chartered a steamer, the America, and authorised Baron Overbeck to proceed to Brunei to endeavour, with Colonel Torrey's assistance, to induce the Sultan and his Ministers to transfer the American concessions to himself and the Baron, or rather to cancel the previous ones and make out new ones in their favour and that of their heirs, associates, successors and assigns for so long as they should choose or desire to hold them. Baron von Overbeck was accompanied by Colonel Torrey and a staff of three Europeans, and, on settling some arrears due by the American Company, succeeded in accomplishing the objects of his mission, after protracted and tedious negotiations, and obtained a \"chop\" from the Sultan nominating and appointing him supreme ruler, \"with the title of Maharaja of Sabah (North Borneo) and Raja of Gaya and Sandakan, with power of life and death over the inhabitants, with all the absolute rights of\n\n* Now Sir Alfred Dent K.C.M.G.\nproperty vested in the Sultan over the soil of the country, and\nthe right to dispose of the same, as well as of the rights over\nthe productions of the country, whether mineral, vegetable, or\nanimal, with the rights of making laws, coining money, creat-\ning an army and navy, levying customs rates on home and\nforeign trade and shipping, and other dues and taxes on the\ninhabitants as to him might seem good or expedient, together\nwith all other powers and rights usually exercised by and be-\nlonging to sovereign rulers, and which the Sultan thereby\ndelegated to him of his own free will, and the Sultan called\nupon all foreign nations, with whom he had formed friendly\ntreaties and alliances, to acknowledge the said Maharaja as\nthe Sultan himself in the said territories and to respect his\nauthority therein; and in the case of the death or retirement\nfrom the said office of the said Maharaja, then his duly ap-\npointed successor in the office of Supreme Ruler and Governor-\nin-Chief of the Company's territories in Borneo should like-\nwise succeed to the office and title of Maharaja of Sabah and\nRaja of Gaya and Sandakan, and all the powers above enu-\nmerated be vested in him.\" I am quoting from the preamble\nto the Royal Charter. Some explanation of the term \"Sa-\nbah\" as applied to the territory\u2014a term which appears in the\nPrayer Book version of the 72nd Psalm, verse 10, \"The kings\nof Arabia and Sabah shall bring gifts\"\u2014seems called for, but I\nregret to say I have not been able to obtain a satisfactory one from\nthe Brunei people, who use it in connection only with a small\nportion of the West Coast of Borneo, North of the Brunei\nriver. Perhaps the following note, which I take from Mr. W.\nE. Maxwell's \"Manual of the Malay Language,\" may have\nsome slight bearing on the point\u2014\"Sawa, Jawa, Saha, Jaba,\nZaba, etc., has evidently in all times been the capital local\nname in Indonesia. The whole archipelago was pressed into\nan island of that name by the Hindus and Romans. Even\nin the time of Marco Polo we have only a Java Major\nand a Java Minor. The Bugis apply the name of Jawa, Ja-\nwaka (comp. the Polynesian Savaiki, Ceramese Sava) to the\nMoluccas. One of the principal divisions of Battaland in Su-\nmatra is called Tanah Jawa. Ptolemy has both Jaba and Sa-\nba.\"\u2014Logan, Journ. Ind. Arch., iv, 338.\" In the Brunei use of\nthe term, there is always some idea of a Northerly direction; for instance, I have heard a Brunei man who was passing from the South to the Northern side of his river, say he was going Saba. When the Company's Government was first inaugurated, the territory was, in official documents, mentioned as Sabah, a name which is still current amongst the natives, to whom the now officially accepted designation of North Borneo is meaningless and difficult of pronunciation.\n\nHaving settled with the Brunei authorities, Baron Von Overbeck next proceeded to Sulu, and found the Sultan driven out of his capital, Sugh or Jolo, by the Spaniards, with whom he was still at war, and residing at Malibun, in the principal island of the Sulu Archipelago. After brief negotiations, the Sultan made to Baron Von Overbeck and Mr. Alfred Dent a grant of his rights and powers over the territories and lands tributary to him on the mainland of the island of Borneo, from the Pandassan River on the North West Coast to the Sibuko River on the East, and further invested the Baron, or his duly appointed successor in the office of supreme ruler of the Company's territories in Borneo, with the high sounding titles of Datu Bandahara and Raja of Sandakan.\n\nOn a company being formed to work the concessions, Baron Von Overbeck resigned these titles from the Brunei and Sulu Potentates and they have not since been made use of, and the Baron himself terminated his connection with the country.\n\nThe grant from the Sultan of Sulu bears date the 22nd January, 1878, and on the 22nd July of the same year he signed a treaty, or act of re submission to Spain. The Spanish Government claimed that, by previous treaties with Sulu, the suzerainty of Spain over Sulu and its dependencies in Borneo had been recognised and that consequently the grant to Mr. Dent was void. The British Government did not, however, fall in with this view, and in the early part of 1879, being then Acting Consul-General in Borneo, I was despatched to Sulu and to different points in North Borneo to publish, on behalf of our Government a protest against the claim of Spain to any portion of the country. In March, 1885, a\nprotocol was signed by which, in return for the recognition by England and Germany of Spanish sovereignty throughout the Archipelago of Sulu, Spain renounced all claims of sovereignty over territories on the Continent of Borneo which had belonged to the Sultan of Sulu, including the islands of Balambangan, Banguey and Malawati, as well as all those comprised within a zone of three maritime leagues from the coast.\n\nHolland also strenuously objected to the cessions and to their recognition, on the ground that the general tenor of the Treaty of London of 1824 shows that a mixed occupation by England and the Netherlands of any island in the Indian Archipelago ought to be avoided.\n\nIt is impossible to discover anything in the treaty which bears out this contention. Borneo itself is not mentioned by name in the document, and the following clauses are the only ones regulating the future establishment of new Settlements in the Eastern Seas by either Power.\u2014\" Article 6. It is agreed that orders shall be given by the two Governments to their Officers and Agents in the East not to form any new Settlements on any of the islands in the Eastern Seas, without previous authority from their respective Governments in Europe. Art. 12 His Britannic Majesty, however, engages, that no British Establishment shall be made on the Carimon islands or on the islands of Battam, Bintang, Lingin, or on any of the other islands South of the Straits of Singapore, nor any treaty concluded by British authority with the chiefs of those islands.\"\n\nWithout doubt, if Holland in 1824 had been desirous of prohibiting any British Settlement in the island of Borneo, such prohibition would have been expressed in this treaty. True, perhaps half of this great island is situated South of the Straits of Singapore, but the island cannot therefore be correctly said to lie to the South of the Straits and, at any rate, such a business-like nation as the Dutch would have noticed a weak point here and have included Borneo in the list with Battam and the other islands enumerated. Such was the view taken by Mr. Gladstone's Cabinet, and Lord Granville informed the Dutch Minister in 1882 that the Xlith Article of the Treaty could not be taken to apply to Borneo, and \"that as a matter of international right they would have no ground to\nobject even to the absolute annexation of North Borneo by Great Britain,\" and, moreover, as pointed out by his Lordship, the British had already a settlement in Borneo, namely the island of Labuan, ceded by the Sultan of Brunei in 1845 and confirmed by him in the Treaty of 1847. The case of Raja Brooke in Sarawak was also practically that of a British Settlement in Borneo.\n\nLord Granville closed the discussion by stating that the grant of the Charter does not in any way imply the assumption of sovereign rights in North Borneo, i.e., on the part of the British Government.\n\nThere the matter rested, but now that the Government is proposing* to include British North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak under a formal \"British Protectorate,\" the Netherlands Government is again raising objections, which they must be perfectly aware are groundless. It will be noted that the Dutch do not lay any claim to North Borneo themselves, having always recognized it as pertaining, with the Sulu Archipelago, to the Spanish Crown. It is only to the presence of the British Government in North Borneo that any objection is raised. In a \"Resolution\" of the Minister of State, Governor-General of Netherlands India, dated 28th February, 1896, occurs the following\u2014\"The parts of Borneo on which the Netherlands does not exercise any influence are\u2014\n\na. The States of the Sultan of Brunei or Borneo Proper;\n\nb. The State of the Sultan of the Sulu Islands, having for boundaries on the West, the River Kimanis, the North and North-East Coasts as far as 3\u00b0 N.L., where it is bounded by the River Atas, forming the extreme frontier towards the North with the State of Berow dependant on the Netherlands.\n\nc. All the islands of the Northern Coasts of Borneo.\"\n\nKnowing this, Mr Alfred Dent put the limit of his cession from Sulu at the Sibuku River, the South bank of which is in N. Lat. 4\u00b0 5'; but towards the end of 1879, that is, long\n\n* The Protectorate has since been proclaimed.\nafter the date of the cession, the Dutch hoisted their flag at Batu Tinagat in N. Lat. 4\u00b0 16', thereby claiming the Sibuko and other rivers ceded by the Sultan of Sulu to the British Company. The dispute is still under consideration by our Foreign Office, but in September, 1883, in order to practically assert the Company's claims, I, as their Governor, had a very pleasant trip in a very small steam launch and steaming at full speed past two Dutch gun-boats at anchor, landed at the South bank of the Sibuko, temporarily hoisted the North Borneo flag, fired a feu-de-joie, blazed a tree, and returning, exchanged visits with the Dutch gun-boats, and entertained the Dutch Controleur at dinner. Having carefully given the Commander of one of the gun-boats the exact bearings of the blazed tree, he proceeded in hot haste to the spot, and, I believe, exterminated the said tree. The Dutch Government complained of our having violated Netherland territory, and matters then resumed their usual course, the Dutch station at Batu Tinagat, or rather at the Tawas River, being maintained unto this day.\n\nAs is hereafter explained, the cession of coast line from the Sultan of Brunei was not a continuous one, there being breaks on the West Coast in the case of a few rivers which were not included. The annual tribute to be paid to the Sultan was fixed at $12,000, and to the Pangeran Tumonggong $3,000\u2014extravagantly large sums when it is considered that His Highness' revenue per annum from the larger portion of the territory ceded was nil. In March, 1881, through negotiations conducted by Mr. A. H. Everett, these sums were reduced to more reasonable proportions, namely, $5,000 in the case of the Sultan, and $2,500 in that of the Tumonggong.\n\nThe intermediate rivers which were not included in the Sultan's cession belonged to Chiefs of the blood royal, and the Sultan was unwilling to order them to be ceded, but in 1883 Resident Davies procured the cession from one of these Chiefs of the Pangalat River for an annual payment of $300, and subsequently the Putalan River was acquired for $1,000 per annum, and the Kawang River and the Muntanani Islands for lump sums of $1,300 and $350 respectively. In 1884, after prolonged negotiations, I was also enabled to obtain the ces-\nvision of an important Province on the West Coast, to the South of the original boundary to which the name of Dent Province has been given, and which includes the Padas and Kalias Rivers, and in the same deed of cession were also included two rivers which had been excepted in the first grant\u2014the Tawaran and the Bangawan. The annual tribute under this cession is \u00a33,100. The principal rivers within the Company's boundaries still unleased are the Kwala Lama, Membakut, Inanam and Menkabong. For fiscal reasons, and for the better prevention of the smuggling of arms and ammunition for sale to head-hunting tribes, it is very desirable that the Government of these remaining independent rivers should be acquired by the Company.\n\nOn the completion of the negotiations with the two Sultans, Baron von Overbeck, who was shortly afterwards joined by Mr. Dent, hoisted his flag\u2014the house flag of Mr. Dent's firm\u2014at Sandakan, on the East Coast, and at Tampassuk and Pappar on the West, leaving at each a European, with a few so-called Police to represent the new Government, agents from the Sultans of Sulu and Brunei accompanying him to notify to the people that the supreme power had been transferred to Europeans. The common people heard the announcement with their usual apathy, but the officer left in charge had a difficult part to play with the headmen who, in the absence of any strong central Government, had practically usurped the functions of Government in many of the rivers. These Chiefs feared, and with reason, that not only would their importance vanish, but that trade with the inland tribes would be thrown open to all, and slave dealing be put a stop to under the new regime. At Sandakan, the Sultan's former Governor refused to recognise the changed position of affairs, but he had a resolute man to deal with in Mr. W. B. Pryer, and before he could do much harm, he lost his life by the capsizing of his prahu while on a trading voyage.\n\nAt Tampassuk, Mr. Prudeman, the Resident, had a very uncomfortable post being in the midst of lawless, cattle-lifting and slave-dealing Bajaus and Illanans. He, with the able assistance of Mr. F. X. Witt, an ex-Naval officer of the\nAustrian Service, who subsequently lost his life while exploring in the interior, and by balancing one tribe against another, managed to retain his position without coming to blows, and, on his relinquishing the service a few months afterwards, the arduous task of representing the Government without the command of any force to back up his authority developed on Mr. Witti. In the case of the Pappar River, the former Chief, Datu Bahar, declined to relinquish his position, and assumed a very defiant attitude. I was at that time in the Labuan service, and I remember proceeding to Pappar in an English man-of-war, in consequence of the disquieting rumours which had reached us, and finding the Resident, Mr. A. H. Everett, on one side of the small river with his house strongly blockaded and guns mounted in all available positions, and the Datu on the other side of the stream, immediately opposite to him, similarly armed to the teeth. But not a shot was fired, and Datu Bahar is now a peaceable subject of the Company.\n\nThe most difficult problem, however, which these officers had to solve was that of keeping order, or trying to do so, amongst a lawless people, with whom for years past might have been right, and who considered kidnapping and cattle-lifting the occupations of honourable and high spirited gentlemen. That they effected what they did, that they kept the new flag flying and prepared the way for the Government of the Company, reflects the highest credit upon their pluck and diplomatic ingenuity, for they had neither police nor steam launches, nor the prestige which would have attached to them had they been representatives of the British Government, and under the well known British flag. They commenced their work with none of the delat which surrounded Sir James Brooke in Sarawak where he found the people in successful rebellion against the Sultan of Brunei, and was himself recognised as an agent of the British Government, so powerful that he could get the Queen's ships to attack the head hunting pirates, killing such numbers of them that, as I have said, the Head money claimed and awarded by the British Government reached the sum of \u00a320,000. On the other hand, it is but fair to add that the fame of Sir James' exploits and the\naction taken by Her Majesty's vessels, on his advice, in North-West Borneo years before, had inspired the natives with a feeling of respect for Englishmen which must have been a powerful factor in favour of the newly appointed officers. The native tribes, too, inhabiting North Borneo were more sub-divided, less warlike, and less powerful than those of Sarawak.\n\nThe promoters of the scheme were fortunate in obtaining the services, for the time being, as their chief representative in the East of Mr. W. H. Read, C.M.G., an old friend of Sir James Brooke, and who, as a Member of the Legislative Council of Singapore, and Consul-General for the Netherlands, had acquired an intimate knowledge of the Malay character and of the resources, capabilities and needs of Malayan countries.\n\nOn his return to England, Mr. Dent found that, owing to the opposition of the Dutch and Spanish Governments, and to the time required for a full consideration of the subject by Her Majesty's Ministers, there would be a considerable delay before a Royal Charter could be issued; meanwhile, the expenditure of the embryo Government in Borneo was not inconsiderable, and it was determined to form a \"Provisional Association\" to carry on till a Chartered Company could be formed.\n\nMr. Dent found an able supporter in Sir Rutherford Alcock, K.C.B., who energetically advocated the scheme from patriotic motives, recognising the strategic and commercial advantages of the splendid harbours of North Borneo and the probability of the country becoming in the near future a not unimportant outlet for English commerce, now so heavily weighted by prohibitive tariffs in Europe and America.\n\nThe British North Borneo Provisional Association Limited, was formed in 1881, with a capital of \u00a3300,000, the Directors being Sir Rutherford Alcock, Mr. A. Dent, Mr. R. B. Martin, Admiral Mayne, and Mr. W. H. Read. The Association acquired from the original lessers the grants and commissions from the Sultans with the object of disposing of these territories, lands and property to a Company to be incorporated by Royal Charter. This Charter passed the Great\nSeal on the 1st November, 1881, and constituted and incorporated the gentlemen above-mentioned as \"The British North Borneo Company.\"\n\nThe Provisional Association was dissolved, and the Chartered Company started on its career in May, 1882. The nominal capital was two million pounds, in \u00a320 shares, but the number of shares issued, including 4,500 fully paid ones representing \u00a390,000 to the vendors, was only 33,030, equal to \u00a3660,600, but on 23,449 of these shares only \u00a312 have so far been called up. The actual cash, therefore, which the Company has had to work with and to carry on the development of the country from the point at which the original concessionaires and the Provisional Association had left it is, including some \u00a31,000 received for shares forfeited, about \u00a3384,000, and they have a right of call for \u00a3187,592 more. The Charter gave official recognition to the concessions from the Native Princes, conferred extensive powers on the Company as a corporate body, provided for the just government of the natives and for the gradual abolition of slavery, and reserved to the Crown the right of disapproving of the person selected by the Company to be their Governor in the East, and of controlling the Company's dealings with any Foreign Power.\n\nThe Charter also authorised the Company to use a distinctive flag, indicating the British character of the undertaking, and the one adopted, following the example of the English Colonies, is the British flag, \"defaced,\" as it is termed, with the Company's badge\u2014a lion. I have little doubt that this selection of the British flag, in lieu of the one originally made use of, had a considerable effect in imbuing the natives with an idea of the stability and permanence of the Company's Government.\n\nMr. Dent's house flag was unknown to them before and, on the West Coast, many thought that the Company's presence in the country might be only a brief one, like that of its predecessor, the American syndicate, and, consequently, were afraid to tender their allegiance, since, on the Company's withdrawal, they would be left to the tender mercies of their former Chiefs. But the British flag was well-known to those of them who were traders, and they had seen it flying\nfor many a year in the Colony of Labuan and on board the vessels which had punished their piratical acts in former days.\n\nThen, too, I was soon able to organise a Police Force mainly composed of Sikhs, and was provided with a couple of steam-launches. Owing doubtless to that and other causes, the refractory chiefs, soon after the Company's formation, appeared to recognize that the game of opposition to the new order of things was a hopeless one.\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nThe area of the territory ceded by the original grants was estimated at 20,000 square miles, but the additions which have been already mentioned now bring it up to about 31,000 square miles including adjacent islands so that it is somewhat larger than Ceylon, which is credited with only 25,385 square miles. In range of latitude, in temperature and in rainfall, North Borneo presents many points of resemblance to Ceylon, and it was at first thought that it might be possible to attract to the new country some of the surplus capital, energy and aptitude for planting which had been the foundation of Ceylon's prosperity.\n\nEven the expression \"The New Ceylon\" was employed as an alternative designation for the country and a description of it under that title was published by the well-known writer\u2014Mr. Joseph Hatton.\n\nThese hopes have not so far been realized, but on the other hand North Borneo is rapidly becoming a second Sumatra, Dutchmen, Germans and some English having discovered the suitability of its soil and climate for producing tobacco of a quality fully equal to the famed Deli leaf of that island.\n\nThe coast line of the territory is about one thousand miles, and a glance at the map will show that it is furnished with capital harbours, of which the principal are Gaya Bay on the West, Kudat in Marudu Bay on the North, and Sandakan Harbour on the East. There are several others, but at those enumerated the Company have opened their principal stations.\nOf the three mentioned, the more striking is that of Sandakan, which is 15 miles in length, with a width varying from 1\u00bc miles at its entrance, to 5 miles at the broadest part. It is here that the present capital is situated\u2014Sandakan, a town containing a population of not more than 5,000 people, of whom perhaps thirty are Europeans and a thousand Chinese.\n\nFor its age, Sandakan has suffered serious vicissitudes. It was founded by Mr. Pryer, in 1878, well up the bay, but was soon afterwards burnt to the ground. It was then transferred to its present position, nearer the mouth of the harbour, but in May, 1886, the whole of what was known as the \"Old Town\" was utterly consumed by fire, in about a couple of hours there being nothing left of the atap-built shops and houses but the charred piles and posts on which they had been raised above the ground. When a fire has once laid hold of an atap town, probably no exertions would much avail to check it; certainly our Chinese held this opinion, and it was impossible to get them to move hand or foot in assisting the Europeans and Police in their efforts to confine its ravages to as limited an area as possible. They entertain the idea that such futile efforts tend only to aggravate the evil spirits and increase their fury. The Hindu shopkeepers were successful in saving their quarter of the town by means of looking glasses, long prayers and chants. It is now forbidden to any one to erect atap houses in the town, except in one specified area to which such structures are confined. Most of the present houses are of plank, with tile, or corrugated iron roofs, and the majority of the shops are built over the sea, on substantial wooden piles, some of the principal \"streets,\" including that to which the ambitious name of \"The Praya\" has been given, being similarly constructed on piles raised three or four feet above high water mark. The reason is that, owing to the steep hills at the back of the site, there is little available flat land for building on, and, moreover, the pushing Chinese trader always likes to get his shops as near as possible to the sea\u2014the highway of the \"prahus\" which bring him the products of the neighbouring rivers and islands. In time, no doubt, the Sandakan hills will be used to reclaim more land from the sea, and the town will cease to\nbe an amphibious one. In the East there are, from a sanitary point of view, some points of advantage in having a tide-way passing under the houses. I should add that Sandakan is a creation of the Company's and not a native town taken over by them. When Mr. PRYER first hoisted his flag, there was only one solitary Chinaman and no Europeans in the harbour, though at one time, during the Spanish blockade of Sulu, a Singapore firm had established a trading station, known as \"Kampong German,\" using it as their head-quarters from which to run the blockade of Sulu, which they successfully did for some considerable time, to their no small gain and advantage. The success attending the Germans' venture excited the emulation of the Chinese traders of Labuan, who found their valuable Sulu trade cut off and, through the good offices of the Government of the Colony, they were enabled to charter the Sultan of Brunei's smart little yacht the Sultan, and engaging the services as Captain of an ex-member of the Labuan Legislative Council, they endeavoured to enact the roll of blockade runner. After a trip or two, however, the Sultan was taken by the Spaniards, snugly at anchor in a Sulu harbour, the Captain and Crew having time to make their escape. As she was not under the British flag, the poor Sultan could obtain no redress, although the blockade was not recognised as effective by the European Powers and English and German vessels, similarly seized, had been restored to their owners. The Sultan proved a convenient despatch boat for the Spanish authorities. The Sultan of Sulu to prove his friendship to the Labuan traders, had an unfortunate man cut to pieces with krisses, on the charge of having betrayed the vessel's position to the blockading cruisers.\n\nSandakan is one of the few places in Borneo which has been opened and settled without much fever and sickness ensuing, and this was due chiefly to the soil being poor and sandy and to there being an abundance of good, fresh, spring water. It may be stated, as a general rule, that the richer the soil the more deadly will be the fever the pioneers will have to encounter when the primeval jungle is first felled and the sun's rays admitted to the virgin soil.\nSandakan is the principal trading station in the Company's territory, but with Hongkong only 1,200 miles distant in one direction, Manila 600 miles in another, and Singapore 1,000 miles in a third, North Borneo can never become an emporium for the trade of the surrounding countries and islands, and the Court of Directors must rest content with developing their own local trade and pushing forward, by wise and encouraging regulations, the planting interest, which seems to have already taken firm root in the country and which will prove to be the foundation of its future prosperity. Gold and other minerals, including coal, are known to exist, but the mineralogical exploration of a country covered with forest and destitute of roads is a work requiring time, and we are not yet in a position to pronounce on North Borneo's expectations in regard to its mineral wealth.\n\nThe gold on the Segama River, on the East coast, has been several times reported on, and has been proved to exist in sufficient quantities to, at any rate, well repay the labours of Chinese gold diggers, but the district is difficult of access by water, and the Chinese are deterring operations on a large scale until the Government has constructed a road into the district. A European Company has obtained mineral concessions on the river, but has not yet decided on its mode of operation, and individual European diggers have tried their luck on the fields, hitherto without meeting with much success, owing to heavy rains, sickness and the difficulty of getting up stores. The Company will probably find that Chinese diggers will not only stand the climate better, but will be more easily governed, be satisfied with smaller returns, and contribute as much or more than the Europeans to the Government Treasury, by their consumption of opium, tobacco and other excisable articles, by fees for gold licenses, and so forth.\n\nAnother source of natural wealth lies in the virgin forest with which the greater portion of the country is clothed, down to the water's edge. Many of the trees are valuable as timber, especially the Bitian, or Borneo iron-wood tree, which is impervious to the attacks of white-ants ashore and almost equally so to those of the teredo navalis afloat, and is wonderfully enduring of exposure to the tropical sun and the tropical\ndownpours of rain. I do not remember having ever come across a bit of bilihan that showed signs of decay during a residence of seventeen years in the East. The wood is very heavy and sinks in water, so that, in order to be shipped, it has to be floated on rafts of soft wood, of which there is an abundance of excellent quality, of which one kind\u2014the red serrayah\u2014is likely to come into demand by builders in England.\n\nOther of the woods, such as mirahau, penagah and rengas, have good grain and take a fine polish, causing them to be suitable for the manufacture of furniture. The large tree which yields the Camphor barks of commerce also affords good timber. It is a Dryobalanops, and is not to be confused with the Cinnamomum camphora, from which the ordinary \"camphor\" is obtained and the wood of which retains the camphor smell and is largely used by the Chinese in the manufacture of boxes, the scented wood keeping off ants and other insects which are a pest in the Far East. The Borneo camphor tree is found only in Borneo and Sumatra. The camphor which is collected for export, principally to China and India, by the natives, is found in a solid state in the trunk, but only in a small percentage of the trees, which are killed by the collectors. The price of this camphor barkis as it is termed, is said to be nearly a hundred times as much as that of the ordinary camphor, and it is used by the Chinese and Indians principally for embalming purposes.\n\nBihan and other woods enumerated are all found near the coast and, generally, in convenient proximity to some stream and so easily available for export. Sandakan harbour has some thirteen rivers and streams running into it, and, as the native population is very small, the jungle has been scarcely touched, and no better locality could, therefore, be desired by a timber merchant. Two European Timber Companies are now doing a good business there, and the Chinese also take their share of the trade. China affords a ready market for Borneo timber, being itself almost forestless, and for many years past it has received ironwood from Sarawak. Borneo timber has also been exported to the Straits Settlements, Australia and Mauritius, and I hear that an order has been given for England. Ironwood is only found in certain districts, notably in Sandakan Bay and on\nthe East coast, being rarely met with on the West coast. I have seen a private letter from an officer in command of a British man-of-war who had some samples of it on board which came in very usefully when certain bearings of the screw shaft were giving out on a long voyage, and were found to last three times as long as lignum vitae.\n\nIn process of time, as the country is opened up by roads and railways, doubtless many other valuable kinds of timber trees will be brought to light in the interior.\n\nA notice of Borneo Forests would be incomplete without a reference to the mangroves, which are such a prominent feature of the country as one approaches it by sea, lining much of the coast and forming, for mile after mile, the actual banks of most of the rivers. Its thick, dark-green, never changing foliage helps to give the new comer that general impression of dull monotony in tropical scenery, which, perhaps, no one, except the professed botanist, whose trained and practical eye never misses the smallest detail, ever quite shakes off.\n\nThe wood of the mangrove forms most excellent firewood, and is often used by small steamers as an economical fuel in lieu of coal, and is exported to China in the timber ships. The bark is also a separate article of export, being used as a dye and for tanning, and is said to contain nearly 42% of tannin.\n\nThe value of the general exports from the territory is increasing every year, having been $145,444 in 1881 and $525,879 in 1888. With the exception of tobacco and pepper, the list is almost entirely made up of the natural raw products of the land and sea\u2014such as bees-wax, camphor, damar, gutta percha, the sap of a large forest tree destroyed in the process of collection of gutta, India rubber, from a creeper likewise destroyed by the collectors, rattans, well known to every school boy, sago, timber, edible birds' nests, seed-pearls, Mother-of-pearl shells in small quantities, dried fish and dried sharks' fins, trepang (sea-slug or b\u00e9che de mer), aga, or edible sea-weed, tobacco (both Native and European grown), pepper, and occasionally elephants' tusks\u2014a list which shews the country to be a rich store house of natural productions, and one which will be added to, as the land is brought under cultivation with coffee,\ntea, sugar, cocoa, Manila hemp, pineapple fibre, and other tropical products for which the soil, and especially the rainfall, temperature and climatic conditions generally, including entire freedom from typhoons and earthquakes, eminently adapt it, and many of which have already been tried with success on an experimental scale. As regards pepper, it has been previously shewn that North Borneo was in former days an exporter of this spice. Sugar has been grown by the natives for their own consumption for many years, as also tapioca, rice and Indian corn. It is not my object to give a detailed list of the productions of the country, and I would refer any reader who is anxious to be further enlightened on these and kindred topics to the excellent \"Hand-book of British North Borneo\" prepared for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of 1886, at which the new Colony was represented, and published by Messrs William Clowes & Sons.\n\nThe edible birds' nests are already a source of considerable revenue to the Government, who let out the collection of them for annual payments, and also levy an export duty as they leave the country for China, which is their only market. The nests are about the size of those of the ordinary swallow and are formed by innumerable hosts of swifts\u2014Collocalia fuciphaga\u2014entirely from a secretion of the glands of the throat. These swifts build in caves, some of which are of very large dimensions, and there are known to be some sixteen of them in different parts of British North Borneo. With only one exception, the caves occur in lime-stone rocks and, generally, at no great distance from the sea, though some have been discovered in the interior, on the banks of the Kinabatangan River. The exception above referred to is that of a small cave on a sand-stone island at the entrance of Sandakan harbour. The Collocalia fuciphaga appears to be pretty well distributed over the Malayan islands, but of these, Borneo and Java are the principal sources of supply. Nests are also exported from the Andaman Islands, and a revenue of \u00a330,000 a year is said to be derived from the nests in the small islands in the inland sea of Tab Sab, inhabited by natives of Malay stock.\n\nThe finest caves, or rather series of caves, as yet known in the Company's territories are those of Gomanton, a limestone\nhill situated at the head of the Sapa Gaia, one of the streams running into Sandakan harbour.\n\nThese grand caves, which are one of the most interesting sights in the country, are, in fine weather, easily accessible from the town of Sandakan, by a water journey across the harbour and up the Sapa Gaia, of about twelve miles, and by a road from the point of debarkation to the entrance of the lower caves, about eight miles in length.\n\nThe height of the hill is estimated at 1,000 feet, and it contains two distinct series of caves. The first series is on the \"ground floor\" and is known as Simud Hitam, or \"black entrance.\" The magnificent porch, 250 feet high and 100 broad, which gives admittance to this series, is on a level with the river bank, and, on entering, you find yourself in a spacious and lofty chamber well lighted from above by a large open space, through which can be seen the entrance to the upper set of caves, some 300 to 300 feet up the hill side. In this chamber is a large deposit of guano, formed principally by the myriads of bats inhabiting the caves in joint occupancy with the edible-nest-forming swats. Passing through this first chamber and turning a little to the right you come to a porch leading into an extensive cave, which extends under the upper series. This cave is filled half way up its roof with an enormous deposit of guano, which has been estimated to be 40 to 50 feet in depth. How far the cave extends has not been ascertained, as its exploration, until some of the deposit is removed, would not be an easy task for the explorer would be compelled to walk along on the top of the guano, which in some places is so soft that you sink in it almost up to your waist. My friend Mr. C. A. Bampfylde, in whose company I first visited Gomanton, and who, as \"Commissioner of Birdsnest Caves,\" drew up a very interesting report on them, informed me that, though he had found it impossible to explore right to the end, he had been a long way in and was confident that the cave was of very large size. To reach the upper series of caves, you leave Simud Hitam and clamber up the hill side\u2014a steep but not difficult climb, as the jagged limestone affords sure footing. The entrance to this series, known as Simud Putih, or \"white entrance,\" is estimated to be at an\nelevation of 300 feet above sea level, and the porch by which you enter them is about 30 feet high by about 50 wide. The floor slopes steeply downwards and brings you into an enormous cave, with smaller ones leading off it, all known to the nest collectors by their different native names. You soon come to a large black hole, which has never been explored, but which is said to communicate with the large guano cave below, which has been already described. Passing on, you enter a dome-like cave, the height of the roof or ceiling of which has been estimated at 800 feet, but for the accuracy of this guess I cannot vouch. The average height of the cave before the domed portion is reached is supposed to be about 150 feet, and Mr. Bampfylde estimates the total length, from the entrance to the furthest point, at a fifth of a mile. The Simud Putih series are badly lighted, there being only a few \"holes\" in the roof of the dome, so that torches or lights of some kind are required. There are large deposits of guano in these caves also, which could be easily worked by lowering quantities down into the Simud Hitam caves below, the floor of which, as already stated, is on a level with the river bank, so that a tramway could be laid right into them and the guano be carried down to the port of shipment, at the mouth of the Sapa Gaia River. Samples of the guano have been sent home, and have been analysed by Messrs Vorlicker & Co. It is rich in ammonia and nitrogen and has been valued at \u00a35 to \u00a37 a ton in England. The bat-guano is said to be richer as a manure than that derived from the swifts. To ascend to the top of Gomanton, one has to emerge from the Simud Putih entrance and, by means of a ladder, reach an overhanging ledge, whence a not very difficult climb brings one to the cleared summit, from which a fine view of the surrounding country is obtained, including Kinabalu, the sacred mountain of North Borneo. On this summit will be found the holes already described as helping to somewhat lighten the darkness of the dome-shaped cave, on the roof of which we are in fact now standing. It is through these holes that the natives lower themselves into the caves, by means of rattan ladders and, in a most marvellous manner, gain a footing on the ceiling and construct cane stages, by means of which they can reach any part of the roof.\nand, either by hand or by a suitable pole to the end of which is attached a lighted candle, secure the wealth-giving luxury for the epicures of China. There are two principal seasons for collecting the nests, and care has to be taken that the collection is made punctually at the proper time, before the eggs are all hatched, otherwise the nests become dirty and fouled with feathers, &c., and discoloured and injured by the damp, thereby losing much of their market value. Again, if the nests are not collected for a season, the birds do not build many new ones in the following season, but make use of the old ones, which thereby become comparatively valueless.\n\nThere are, roughly speaking, three qualities of nests, sufficiently described by their names\u2014white, red, and black\u2014the best quality of each fetching, at Sandakan, per catty of 1\u00bd lbs., $16, $7 and 8 cents respectively.\n\nThe question as to the true cause of the difference in the nests has not yet been satisfactorily solved. Some allege that the red and black nests are simply white ones deteriorated by not having been collected in due season. I myself incline to agree with the natives that the nests are formed by different birds, for the fact that, in one set of caves, black nests are always found together in one part, and white ones in another, though both are collected with equal care and punctuality, seems almost inexplicable under the first theory. It is true that the different kinds of nests are not found in the same season, and it is just possible that the red and black nests may be the second efforts at building made by the swilts after the collectors have disturbed them by gathering their first, white ones. In the inferior nests, feathers are found mixed up with the gelatinous matter forming the walls, as though the glands were unable to secrete a sufficient quantity of material, and the bird had to eke it out with its own feathers. In the substance of the white nests no feathers are found.\n\nThen, again, it is sometimes found in the case of two distinct caves, situated at no great distance apart, that the one yields almost entirely white nests, and the other nearly all red, or black ones, though the collections are made with equal regularity in each. The natives, as I have said, seem to think that there are two kinds of birds, and the Hon. R. Aber-\nCROMBY reports that, when he visited Gomanton, they showed him eggs of different size and explained that one was laid by the white-nest bird and the other by the black-nest builder. Sir HUGH LOW, in his work on Sarawak, published in 1848, asserts that there are \"two different and quite dissimilar kinds of birds, though both are swallows\" (he should have said swifts), and that the one which produces the white nest is larger and of more lively colours, with a white belly, and is found on the sea-coast, while the other is smaller and darker and found more in the interior. He admits, however, that though he had opportunities of observing the former, he had not been able to procure a specimen.\n\nThe question is one which should be easily settled on the spot, and I recommend it to the consideration of the authorities of the British North Borneo Museum, which has been established at Sandakan.\n\nThe annual value of the nests of Gomanton, when properly collected, has been reckoned at \u00a323,000, but I consider this an excessive estimate. My friend Mr. A. COOK, the Treasurer of the Territory, to whose zeal and perseverance the Company owes much, has arranged with the Buludupin tribe to collect these nests on payment to the Government of a royalty of \u00a37,500 per annum, which is in addition to the export duty at the rate of 10% ad valorem paid by the Chinese exporters.\n\nThe swifts and bats\u2014the latter about the size of the ordinary English bat\u2014avail themselves of the shelter afforded by the caves without incommoding one another, for, by a sort of Box and Cox arrangement, the former occupy the caves during the night and the latter by day.\n\nStanding at the Simud Putih entrance about 5 P.M., the visitor will suddenly hear a whirring sound from below, which is caused by the myriads of bats issuing, for their nocturnal banquet, from the Simud Itam caves through the wide open space that has been described. They come out in a regularly ascending continuous spiral or corkscrew coil, revolving from left to right in a very rapid and regular manner. When the top of the spiral coil reaches a certain height, a colony of bats breaks off, and continuing to revolve in a well kept ring from left to right gradually ascends higher and higher, until all of\na sudden the whole detachment dashes off in the direction of the sea, towards the mangrove swamps and the nipas. Sometimes these detached colonies reverse the direction of their revolutions after leaving the main body, and, instead of from left to right, revolve from right to left. Some of them continue for a long time revolving in a circle, and attain a great height before darting off in quest of food, while others make up their minds more expeditiously, after a few revolutions. Amongst the bats, three white ones were, on the occasion of my visit, very conspicuous, and our followers styled them the Raja, his wife and child. Hawks and sea-eagles are quickly attracted to the spot, but only hover on the outskirts of the revolving coil, occasionally snapping up a prize. I also noticed several hornbills, but they appeared to have been only attracted by curiosity. Mr. Bampfylde informed me that, on a previous visit, he had seen a large green snake settled on an overhanging branch near which the bats passed and that occasionally he managed to secure a victim. I timed the bats and found that they took almost exactly fifty minutes to come out of the caves, a thick stream of them issuing all that time and at a great pace, and the reader can endeavour to form for himself some idea of their vast numbers. They had all got out by ten minutes to six in the evening, and at about six o'clock the swifts began to come home to roost. They came in in detached, independent parties, and I found it impossible to time them, as some of them kept very late hours. I slept in the Simud Puthi cave on this occasion, and found that next morning the bats returned about 5 A.M., and that the swifts went out an hour afterwards.\n\nAs shewing the mode of formation of these caves, I may add that I noticed, imbedded in a boulder of rock in the upper caves, two pieces of coral and several fossil marine shells, bivalves and others.\n\nThe noise made by the bats going out for their evening promenade resembled a combination of that of the surf breaking on a distant shore and of steam being gently blown off from a vessel which has just come to anchor.\n\nThere are other interesting series of caves, and one\u2014that of Madai, in Darvel Bay on the East coast\u2014was\nvisited by the late Lady BRASSEY and Miss BRASSEY in April, 1887, when British North Borneo was honoured by a visit of the celebrated yacht the Sunbeam, with Lord BRASSEY and his family on board.\n\nI accompanied the party on the trip to Madai, and shall not easily forget the pluck and energy with which Lady BRASSEY, then in bad health, surmounted the difficulties of the jungle track, and insisted upon seeing all that was to be seen, or the gallant style in which Miss BRASSEY unwearied after her long tramp through the forest, led the way over the slippery boulders in the dark caves.\n\nThe Chinese ascribe great strengthening powers to the soup made of the birds' nests, which they boil down into a syrup with barley sugar, and sip out of tea cups. The gelatinous looking material of which the substance of the nests is composed is in itself almost flavourless.\n\nIt is also with the object of increasing their bodily powers that these epicures consume the uninviting sea-slug or b\u00e9che-de-mer, and dried sharks' fins and cuttle fish.\n\nTo conclude my brief sketch of Sandakan Harbour and of the Capital, it should be stated that, in addition to being within easy distance of Hongkong, it lies but little off the usual route of vessels proceeding from China to Australian ports, and can be reached by half a day's deviation of the ordinary track.\n\nShould, unfortunately, war arise with Russia, there is little doubt their East Asiatic squadron would endeavour both to harass the Australian trade and to damage, as much as possible, the coast towns, in which case the advantages of Sandakan, midway between China and Australia, as a base of operations for the British protecting fleet would at once become manifest. It is somewhat unfortunate that a bar has formed just outside the entrance of the harbour, with a depth of water of four fathoms at low water, spring tides, so that ironclads of the largest size would be denied admittance.\n\nThere are at present, no steamers sailing direct from Borneo to England, and nearly all the commerce from British North Borneo ports is carried by local steamers to that great emporium of the trade of the Malayan countries, Singapore.\ndistant from Sandakan a thousand miles, and it is a curious fact, that though many of the exports are ultimately intended for the China market, e.g., edible birds' nests, the Chinese traders find it pays them better to send their produce to Singapore in the first instance, instead of direct to Hongkong. This is partly accounted for by the further fact that though the Government has spent considerable sum in endeavouring to attract Chinamen from China, the large proportion of our Chinese traders and of the Chinese population generally has come to us via Singapore, after as it were having undergone there an education in the knowledge of Malayan affairs.\n\nAs further illustrating the commercial and strategical advantages of the harbours of British North Borneo, it should be noted that the course recommended by the Admiralty instructions for vessels proceeding to China, from the Straits, and the Palawan passage, brings them within ninety miles of the harbours of the West Coast.\n\nAs to postal matters, British North Borneo, though not in the Postal Union, has entered into arrangements for the exchange of direct closed mails with the English Post Office, London, with which latter also, as well as with Singapore and India, a system of Parcel Post and of Post Office Orders has been established.\n\nThe postal and inland revenue stamps, distinguished by the lion, which has been adopted as the Company's badge, are well executed and in considerable demand with stamp collectors, owing to their rarity.\n\nThe Government also issues its own copper coinage, one cent and half-cent pieces, manufactured in Birmingham and of the same intrinsic value as those of Hongkong and the Straits Settlements.\n\nThe revenue derived from its issue is an important item to the Colony's finances, and considerable quantities have been put into circulation, not only within the limits of the Company's territory, but also in Brunei and in the British Colony of Labuan, where it has been proclaimed a legal tender on the condition of the Company, in return for the profit which they reap by its issue in the island, contributing to the impoverished Colonial Treasury the yearly sum of $3,000.\nTrade, however, is still, to a great extent, carried on by a system of barter with the Natives. The primitive currency medium in vogue under the native regime has been described in the Chapters on Brunei.\n\nThe silver currency is the Mexican and Spanish Dollar and the Japanese Yen, supplemented by the small silver coinage of the Straits Settlements. The Company has not yet minted any silver coinage, as the profit thereon is small, but in the absence of a bank, the Treasury, for the convenience of traders and planters, carries on banking business to a certain extent, and issues bank notes of the values of $1, $5 and $25, cash reserves equal to one-third of the value of the notes in circulation being maintained.*\n\nSir Alfred Dent is taking steps to form a Banking Company at Sandakan, the establishment of which would materially assist in the development of the resources of the territory.\n\nBritish North Borneo is not in telegraphic communication with any part of the world, except of course through Singapore, nor are there any local telegraphs. The question, however, of supplementing the existing cable between the Straits Settlements and China by another touching at British territory in Borneo has more than once been mooted, and may yet become a fait accompli. The Spanish Government appear to have decided to unite Sulu by telegraphic communication with the rest of the world, vid Manila, and this will bring Sandakan within 180 miles of the telegraphic station.\n\nChapter IX.\n\nIn the eyes of the European planter, British North Borneo is chiefly interesting as a field for the cultivation of tobacco, in rivalry to Sumatra, and my readers may judge of the importance of this question from a glance at the following figures, which shew the dividends declared of late years by three of the principal Tobacco Planting Companies in the latter island:\n\n* Agencies of Singapore Banks have since been established at Sandakan.\n### Dividends paid by\n\n| Year | The Deli Maatschappi | The Tabak Maatschappi | The Amsterdam Deli Co. |\n|------|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| 1882 | 65 per cent         | 25 per cent           | 10 per cent           |\n| 1883 | 101                 | 50                    | 30                    |\n| 1884 | 77                  | 60                    | 30                    |\n| 1885 | 107                 | 100                   | 60                    |\n| 1886 | 108                 |                       |                       |\n\nIn Sumatra, under Dutch rule, tobacco culture can at present only be carried on in certain districts, where the soil is suitable and where the natives are not hostile, and, as most of the best land has been taken up, and planters are beginning to feel harassed by the stringent regulations and heavy taxation of the Dutch Government, both Dutch and German planters are turning their attention to British North Borneo, where they find the regulations easier, and the authorities most anxious to welcome them, while, owing to the scanty population, there is plenty of available land. It is but fair to say that the first experiment in North Borneo was made by an English, or rather an Anglo-Chinese Company, the China-Sabah Land Farming Company, who, on hurriedly selected land in Sandakan and under the disadvantages which usually attend pioneers in a new country, shipped a crop to England which was pronounced by experts in 1886 to equal in quality the best Sumatra-grown leaf. Unfortunately, this Company, which had wasted its resources on various experiments, instead of confining itself to tobacco planting, was unable to continue its operations, but a Dutch planter from Java, Count G.F.L.OES D'ELSLOO, having carefully selected his land in Marudu Bay, obtained, in 1887, the high average of $1 per lb. for his trial crop at Amsterdam, and, having formed an influential Company in Europe, is energetically bringing a large area under culti-\nvation, and has informed me that he confidently expects to rival Sumatra, not only in quality, but also in quantity of leaf per acre, as some of his men have cut twelve pikuls per field, whereas six pikuls per field is usually considered a good crop. The question of \"quantity\" is a very important one, for quality without quantity will never pay on a tobacco estate. Several Dutchmen have followed Count GELOES' example, and two German Companies and one British are now at work in the country. Altogether, fully 350,000 acres* of land have been taken up for tobacco cultivation in British North Borneo up to the present time.\n\nIn selecting land for this crop, climate, that is, temperature and rainfall, has equally to be considered with richness of soil. For example, the soil of Java is as rich, or richer than that of Sumatra, but owing to its much smaller rainfall, the tobacco it produces commands nothing like the prices fetched by that of the former. The seasons and rainfall in Borneo are found to be very similar to those of Sumatra. The average recorded annual rainfall at Sandakan for the last seven years is given by Dr. WALKER, the Principal Medical Officer, as 124.34 inches, the range being from 156.9 to 101.26 inches per annum.\n\nBeing so near the equator, roughly speaking between N. Latitudes 4 and 7, North Borneo has, unfortunately for the European residents whose lot is cast there, nothing that can be called a winter, the temperature remaining much about the same from year's end to year's end. It used to seem to me that during the day the thermometer was generally about 83 or 85 in the shade, but, I believe, taking the year all round, night and day, the mean temperature is 81, and the extremes recorded on the coast line are 67.5 and 94.5. Dr. WALKER has not yet extended his stations to the hills in the interior, but mentions it as probable that freezing point is occasionally reached near the top of the Kinabalu Mountains, which is 13,700 feet high; he adds that the lowest recorded temperature he has found is 36.5, given by Sir SPENCER ST. JOHN in his \"Life in the Forests of the Far East.\" Snow has never\n\n---\n\n* Governor CREAGH tells me 600,000 acres have now been taken up\nbeen reported even on Kinabalu, and I am informed that the Charles Louis Mountains in Dutch New Guinea, are the only ones in tropical Asia where the limit of perpetual snow is attained. I must stop to say a word in praise of Kinabalu, \"the Chinese Widow,\"* the sacred mountain of North Borneo whither the souls of the righteous Dusuns ascend after death. It can be seen from both coasts, and appears to rear its isolated, solid bulk almost straight out of the level country, so dwarfed are the neighbouring hills by its height of 13,680 feet. The best view of it is obtained, either at sunrise or at sunset, from the deck of a ship proceeding along the West Coast, from which it is about twenty miles inland. During the daytime the Widow, as a rule, modestly veils her features in the clouds.\n\nThe effect when its huge mass is lighted up at evening by the last rays of the setting sun is truly magnificent.\n\nOn the spurs of Kinabalu and on the other lofty hills, of which there is an abundance, no doubt, as the country becomes opened up by roads many suitable sites for sanatoria will be discovered, and the day will come when these hill sides, like those of Ceylon and Java, will be covered with thriving plantations.\n\nFailing winter, the Bornean has to be content with the change afforded by a dry and a wet season, the latter being looked upon as the \"winter,\" and prevailing during the month of November, December and January. But though the two seasons are sufficiently well defined and to be depended upon by planters, yet there is never a month during the dry season when no rain falls, nor in the wet season are fine days at all rare. The driest months appear to be March and April, and in June there generally occurs what Doctor Walker terms an \"intermediate\" and moderately wet period.\n\nTobacco is a crop which yields quick returns, for in about 110 to 120 days after the seed is sown the plant is ripe for cutting. The modus operandi is somewhat after this fashion. First select your land, virgin soil covered with untouched\n\n* For the native derivation of this appellation see page 66 of Journal No. 30.\nBRITISH BORNEO.\n\njungle, situated at a distance from the sea, so that no salt breezes may jeopardise the proper burning qualities of the future crop, and as devoid as possible of hills. Then, a point of primary importance which will be again referred to, engage your Chinese coolies, who have to sign agreements for fixed periods, and to be carefully watched afterwards, as it is the custom to give them cash advances on signing, the repayment of which they frequently endeavour to avoid by slipping away just before your vessel sails and probably engaging themselves to another master.\n\nWithout the Chinese cooly, the tobacco planter is helpless, and if the proper season is allowed to pass, a whole year may be lost. The Chinaman is too expensive a machine to be employed on felling the forest, and for this purpose, indeed, the Malay is more suitable and the work is accordingly given him to do under contract. Simultaneously with the felling, a track should be cut right through the heart of the estate by the natives, to be afterwards ditched and drained and made passable for carts by the Chinese coolies.\n\nThat as much as possible of the felled jungle should be burned up is so important a matter and one that so greatly affects the individual Chinese labourer, that it is not left to the Malays to do, but, on the completion of the felling, the whole area which is to be planted is divided out into \"fields,\" of about one acre each, and each \"field\" is assigned by lot to a Chinese cooly, whose duty it is to carefully burn the timber and plant, tend and finally cut the tobacco on his own division, for which he is remunerated in accordance with the quality and quantity of the leaf he is able to bring into the drying sheds. Each \"field,\" having been cleared as carefully as may be of the felled timber, is next thoroughly hoed up, and a small \"nursery\" prepared in which the seeds provided by the manager are planted and protected from rain and sun by palm leaf mats (kajangs) raised on sticks. In about a week, the young plants appear, and the Chinese tenant, as I may call him, has to carefully water them morning and evening. As the young seedlings grow up, their enemy, the worms and grubs, find them out and attack them in such numbers that at least once a day, sometimes oftener, the anxious planter\nhas to go through his nursery and pick them off, otherwise in a short time he would have no tobacco to plant out. About thirty days after the seed has been sown, the seedlings are old enough to be planted out in the field, which has been all the time carefully prepared for their reception. The first thing to be done is to make holes in the soil, at distances of two feet one way and three feet the other, the earth in them being loosened and broken up so that the tender roots should meet with no obstacles to their growth. As the holes are ready for them, the seedlings are taken from the nursery and planted out, being protected from the sun's rays either by fern, or coarse grass, or, in the best managed estates, by a piece of wood, like a roofing shingle, inserted in the soil in such a way as to provide the required shelter. The watering has to be continued till the plants have struck root, when the protecting shelter is removed and the earth banked up round them, care being taken to daily inspect them and remove the worms which have followed them from the nursery. The next operation is that of \"topping\" the plants, that is, of stopping their further growth by nipping off the heads.\n\nAccording to the richness of the soil and the general appearance of the plants, this is ordered to be done by the European overseer after a certain number of leaves have been produced. If the soil is poor, perhaps only fourteen leaves will be allowed, while on the richest land the plant can stand and properly ripen as many as twenty-four leaves. The signs of ripening, which generally takes place in about three months from the date of transplantation, are well known to the overseers and are first shewn by a yellow tinge becoming apparent at the tips of the leaves.\n\nThe cooly thereupon cuts the plants down close to the ground and lightly and carefully packs them into long baskets so as not to injure the leaves, and carries them to the drying sheds. There they are examined by the overseer of his division, who credits him with the value, based on the quantity and quality of the crop he brings in, the price ranging from $1 up to $8 per thousand trees. The plants are then tied in rows on sticks, heads downwards, and hoisted up in tiers to dry in the shed.\nAfter hanging for a fortnight, they are sufficiently dry and, being lowered down, are stripped of their leaves, which are tied up into small bundles, similar leaves being roughly sorted together.\n\nThe bundles of leaves are then taken to other sheds, where the very important process of fermenting them is carried out. For this purpose, they are put into orderly arranged heaps\u2014small at first, but increased in size till very little heat is given out, the heat being tested by a thermometer, or even an ordinary piece of stick inserted into them. When the fermentation is nearly completed and the leaves have attained a fixed colour, they are carefully sorted according to colour, spottness and freedom from injury of any kind. The price realized in Europe is greatly affected by the care with which the leaves have been fermented and sorted. Spottness is not always considered a defect, as it is caused by the sun shining on the leaves when they have drops of rain on them, and to this the best leaves are liable, but spotted leaves, broken leaves and in short leaves having the same characteristics should be carefully sorted together. After this sorting is completed as regards class and quality, there is a further sorting in regard to length, and the leaves are then tied together in bundles of thirty-five. These bundles are put into large heaps and, when no more heating is apparent, they are ready to be pressed under a strong screw press and sewn up in bags which are carefully marked and shipped off to Europe\u2014to Amsterdam as a rule.\n\nAs the coolies' payment is by \"results,\" it is their interest to take the greatest care of their crops; but for any outside work they may be called on to perform, and for their services as sorters, etc., in the sheds, they are paid extra. During the whole time, also, they receive, for \"subsistence\" money, $4 or $3 a month. At the end of the season their accounts are made up, being debited with the amount of the original advance subsistence money and cost of implements, and credited with the value of the tobacco brought in and any wages that may be due for outside work. Each estate possesses a hospital, in which bad cases are treated by a qualified practitioner, while in trifling cases the European overseer dispenses drugs,\nquite a small rush to the country, as the Dutch Government, I hear, is not popular in Sumatra, and land available for tobacco there is becoming scarcer.\"\n\nMy anticipations have been verified, and the rush is already taking place.\n\nThe localities at present in favour with tobacco planters are Marudu Bay and Bangguy Island in the North, Labuk Bay and Darvel Bay in the neighbourhood of the Silam Station, and the Kinabatangan River on the East.\n\nThe firstcomers obtained their land on very easy terms, some of them at 30 cents an acre, but the Court has now issued an order that in future no planting land is to be disposed of for a less sum than $1* per acre, free of quit-rent and on a lease for 999 years, with clauses providing that a certain proportion be brought under cultivation.\n\nAt present no export duty is levied on tobacco shipped from North Borneo, and the Company has engaged that no such duty shall be imposed before the 1st January, 1892, after which date it will be optional with them to levy an export royalty at the rate of one dollar cent, or a halfpenny, per lb., which rate, they promise, shall not be exceeded during the succeeding twenty years.\n\nThe tobacco cultivated in Sumatra and British North Borneo is used chiefly for wrappers for cigars, for which purpose a very fine, thin, elastic leaf is required and one that has a good colour and will burn well and evenly, with a fine white ash. This quality of leaf commands a much higher price than ordinary kinds, and, as stated, Count Geloes' trial crop, from the Ranan Estate in Marudu Bay, averaged 1.83 guilders, or about $1 (3/2) per lb. It is said that 2 lbs. or 2\u00bd lbs. weight of Bornean tobacco will cover 1,000 cigars.\n\nTobacco is not a new culture in Borneo, as some of the hill natives on the West Coast of North Borneo have grown it in a rough and ready way for years past, supplying the population of Brunei and surrounding districts with a sun-dried article, which used to be preferred to that produced in Java. The Malay name for tobacco is tambako, a corruption of the\n\n---\n\n* Raised in 1890 to $6 an acre.\nSpanish and Portuguese term, but the Brunei people also know it as sigup.\n\nIt was probably introduced into Malay countries by the Portuguese, who conquered Malacca in 1511, and by the Spanish, who settled in the Philippines in 1565. Its use has become universal with men, women and children, of all tribes and of all ranks. The native mode of using tobacco has been referred to in my description of Brunei.\n\nFibre-yielding plants are also now attracting attention in North Borneo, especially the Manila hemp (*Musa textilis*) a species of banana, and pine-apples, both of which grow freely. The British Borneo Trading and Planting Company have acquired the patent for Borneo of Death's fibre-cleaning machines, and are experimenting with these products on a considerable scale and, apparently, with good prospects of success.* For a long time past, beautiful cloths have been manufactured of pine-apple fibre in the Philippines, and as it is said that orders have been received from France for Borneo pine-apple fibre, we shall perhaps soon see it used in England under the name of French silk.\n\nIn the Government Experimental Garden at Silam, in Darvel Bay, cocoa, cinnamon and Liberian coffee have been found to do remarkably well. Sappan-wood and kapok or cotton flock also grow freely.\n\nChapter X.\n\nMany people have a very erroneous idea of the objects and intentions of the British North Borneo Company. Some, with a dim recollection of untold wealth having been extracted from the natives of India in the early days of the Honourable East India Company, conceive that the Company can have no other object than that of fleecing our natives in order to pay dividends, but the old saying, that it is a difficult matter to steal a Highlander's pantaloons, is applicable to North Borneo, for only a magician could extract anything much worth having in the shape of loot from the easy-going natives.\n\n* The anticipated success has not been achieved as yet.\nof the country, who, in a far more practical sense than the Christians of Europe, are ready to say \"sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,\" and who do not look forward and provide for the future, or heap up riches to leave to their posterity.\n\nSome years ago, a correspondent of an English paper displayed his ignorance on the matter by maintaining that the Company coerced the natives and forced them to buy Manchester goods at extortionate prices. An Oxford Don, when I first received my appointment as Governor, imagined that I was going out as a sort of slave-driver, to compel the poor natives to work, without wages, on the Company's plantations. But, as a matter of fact, though entitled to do so by the Royal Charter, the Company has elected to engage neither in trade nor in planting, deeming that their desire to attract capital and population to their territory will be best advanced by their leaving the field entirely open to others, for otherwise there would always have been a suspicion that rival traders and planters were handicapped in the race with a Company which had the making and the administration of laws and the imposition of taxation in its hands.\n\nIt will be asked, then, if the Company do not make a profit out of trading, or planting, or mining, what could have induced them to undertake the Government of a tropical country, some 10,000 miles or more distant from London, for Englishmen, as a rule, do not invest hundreds of thousands of pounds with the philanthropic desire only of benefitting an Eastern race?\n\nThe answer to this question is not very plainly put in the Company's prospectus, which states that its object \"is the carrying on of the work begun by the Provisional Association\" (said in the previous paragraphs of the prospectus to have been the successful accomplishment of the completion of the pioneer work) \"and the further improvement and full utilization of the vast natural resources of the country, by the introduction of new capital and labour, which they intend shall be stimulated, aided and protected by a just, humane and enlightened Government.\" The benefits likely to flow from the accomplishment of this object, in the opening up of new fields of tropical agriculture, new channels of enterprise, and new\nmarkets for the world's manufactures, are great and incontestable.\" I quite agree with the framer of the prospectus that these benefits are great and incontestable, but then they would be benefits conferred on the world at large at the expense of the shareholders of the Company, and I presume that the source from which the shareholders are to be recouped is the surplus revenues which a wisely administered Government would ensure, by judiciously fostering colonisation, principally by Chinese, by the sale of the vast acreages of \"waste\" or Government lands, by leasing the right to work the valuable timber forests and such minerals as may be found to exist in workable quantities, by customs duties and the \"farming out\" of the exclusive right to sell opium, spirits, tobacco, etc., and by other methods of raising revenue in vogue in the Eastern Colonies of the Crown. In fact, the sum invested by the shareholders is to be considered in the light of a loan to the Colony\u2014its public debt\u2014to be repaid with interest as the resources of the country are developed. Without encroaching on land worked, or owned by the natives, the Company has a large area of unoccupied land which it can dispose of for the highest price obtainable. That this must be the case is evident from a comparison with the Island of Ceylon, where Government land sales are still held. The area of North Borneo, it has been seen, is larger than that of Ceylon, but its population is only about 160,000, while that of Ceylon is returned as 2,825,000; furthermore, notwithstanding this comparatively large population, it is said that the land under cultivation in Ceylon forms only about one-fifth of its total area. From what I have said of the prospects of tobacco-planting in British North Borneo, it will be understood that land is being rapidly taken up, and the Company will soon be in a position to increase its selling price. Town and station lands are sold under different conditions to that for planting purposes, and are restricted as a rule to lots of the size of 60 feet by 33 feet. The lease is for 999 years, but there is an annual quit-rent at the rate of $6 per lot, which is redeemable at fifteen years' purchase. At Sandakan, lots of this size have at auction realized a premium of $350. In all cases, coal, minerals, precious stones, edible nests and guano\nare reserved to the Government, and, in order to protect the native proprietors, it is provided that any foreigner desirous of purchasing land from a native must do so through the Government.\n\nTitles and mutations of titles to land are carefully registered and recorded in the Land Office, under the provisions of the Hongkong Registration of Documents Ordinance, which has been adopted in the State.\n\nThe local Government is administered by a Governor, selected by the Court of Directors subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. He is empowered to enact laws, which require confirmation by the Court, and is assisted in his executive functions by a Government Secretary, Residents, Assistant Residents, a Treasurer-General, a Commissioner of Lands, a Superintendent of Public Works, Commandant, Postmaster-General and other Heads of Departments usually to be found in Crown Colonies, and the British Colonial Regulations are adhered to as closely as circumstances admit. The title of Resident is borrowed from the Dutch Colonies, and the duties of the post are analogous to those of the Resident Councillors of Penang or Malacca, under the Governor of Singapore, or of the Government Agents in Ceylon. The Governor can also call to assist him in his deliberations a Council of Advice, composed of some of the Heads of Departments and of natives of position nominated to seats therein.\n\nThe laws are in the form of \"Proclamations\" issued by the Governor under the seal of the Territory. Most of the laws are adaptations, in whole or in part, of Ordinances enacted in Eastern Colonies, such as the Straits Settlements, Hongkong, Labuan and Fiji.\n\nThe Indian Penal Code, the Indian Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence and Contract Acts have been adopted in their entirety, \"so far as the same shall be applicable to the circumstances of this Territory.\"\n\nThe Proclamation making these and other Acts the law in North Borneo was the first formal one issued, and bears date the 23rd December, 1881.\nThe law relating to the protection of estate coolies and labourers has been already referred to.\n\nThe question of domestic slavery was one of the first with which the Company had to grapple, the Royal Charter having ordained that \"the Company shall to the best of its power discourage and, as far as may be practicable, abolish by degrees, any system of domestic servitude existing among the tribes of the Coast or interior of Borneo; and no foreigners whether European, Chinese or other, shall be allowed to own slaves of any kind in the Company's territories.\" Slavery and kidnapping were rampant in North Borneo under native regime and were one of the chief obstacles to the unanimous acceptance of the Company's rule by the Chiefs. At first the Residents and other officers confined their efforts to prohibiting the importation of slaves for sale, and in assisting slaves who were ill-treated to purchase their liberty. In 1883, a Proclamation was issued which will have the effect of gradually abolishing the system, as required by the Charter. Its chief provisions are as follows.\u2014No foreigners are allowed to hold slaves, and no slaves can be imported for sale, nor can the natives buy slaves in a foreign country and introduce them into Borneo as slaves, even should there be no intention of selling them as such. Slaves taking refuge in the country from abroad will not be surrendered, but slaves belonging to natives of the country will be given up to their owners unless they can prove ill-treatment, or that they have been brought into the territory subsequently to the 1st November, 1883, and it is optional for any slave to purchase his or her freedom by payment of a sum, the amount of which is to be fixed, from time to time, by the Government.\n\nA woman also becomes free if she can prove that she has cohabited with her master, or with any person other than her husband, with the connivance of her master or mistress, and finally \"all children born of slave parents after the first day of November, 1883, and who would by ancient custom be deemed to be slaves, are hereby proclaimed to be free, and any person treating or attempting to treat any such children as slaves shall be guilty of an offence under this Proclamation.\" The punishment for offences against the provisions\nof this Proclamation extends to imprisonment for ten years and to a fine up to five thousand dollars.\n\nThe late Mr. Wittl, one of the first officers of the Association, at my request, drew up, in 1881, an interesting report on the system of Slavery in force in the Tampassuk District, on the West Coast, of which the following is a brief summary. Slaves in this district are divided into two classes\u2014those who are slaves in a strict and rigorous sense, and those whose servitude is of a light description. The latter are known as anak mas, and are the children of a slave mother by a free man other than her master. If a female, she is the slave or anak mas of her mother's master, but cannot be sold by him; if a boy, he is practically free, cannot be sold and, if he does not care to stay with his master, can move about and earn his own living, not sharing his earnings with his master, as is the case in some other districts. In case of actual need, however, his master can call upon him for his services.\n\nIf an anak mas girl marries a freeman, she at once becomes a free woman, but a brihan, or marriage gift, of from two to two and a half pikuls of brass gun\u2014valued at $20 to $25 a pikul\u2014is payable by the bridegroom to the master.\n\nIf she marry a slave, she remains an anak mas, but such cases are very rare and only take place when the husband is in a condition to pay a suitable brihan to the owner.\n\nIf an ordinary slave woman becomes concubine by her owner, she and her offspring are henceforth free and, she may remain as one of her late master's wives. But the jealousy of the inmates of the harem often causes abortion to be procured.\n\nThe slaves, as a rule, have quite an easy time of it, living with and, as their masters, sharing the food of the family and being supplied with tobacco, betel-nut and other native luxuries. There is no difference between them and free men in the matter of dress and in the arms which all carry, and the mere fact that they are allowed to wear arms is pretty conclusive evidence of their not being bullied or oppressed.\n\nThey assist in domestic duties and in the operations of harvest and trading and so forth, but there is no such institution as a slave-gang, working under task masters, a picture which\nis generally present to the Englishman's mind when he hears of the existence of slavery. The slave gang was an institution of the white slave-owner. Slave couples, provided they support themselves, are allowed to set up house and cultivate a patch of land.\n\nFor such minor offences as laziness and attempting to escape, the master can punish his slaves with strokes of the rattan, but if an owner receives grave provocation and kills his slave, the matter will probably not be taken notice of by the elders of the village.\n\nAn incorrigible slave is sometimes punished by being sold out of the district.\n\nIf a slave is badly treated and insufficiently provided with food, his offence in endeavouring to escape is generally condoned by public opinion. If a slave is, without sufficient cause, maltreated by a freeman, his master can demand compensation from the aggressor. Slaves of one master can, with their owner's consent, marry, and no brihan is demanded, but if they belong to different masters, the woman's master is entitled to a brihan of one pikul, equal to $20 or $25. They continue to be the slaves of their respective masters, but are allowed to live together, and in case of a subsequent separation they return to the houses of their masters. Should a freeman, other than her master, wish to marry a slave, he practically buys her from her owner with a brihan of $60 or $75.\n\nSometimes a favourite slave is raised to a position intermediate between that of an ordinary slave and an anak mas, and is regarded as a brother, or sister, father, mother, or child; but if he or she attempt to escape, a reversion to the condition of an ordinary slave is the result. Occasionally, slaves are given their freedom in fulfilment of a vow to that effect made by the master in circumstances of extreme danger, experienced in company with the slave.\n\nA slave once declared free can never be claimed again by his former master.\n\nDebts contracted by a slave, either in his own name, or in that of his master, are not recoverable.\nBy their own extra work, after performing their service to their owners, slaves can acquire private property and even themselves purchase and own slaves.\n\nInfidel slaves, of both sexes, are compulsorily converted to Muhammedanism and circumcised and, even though they should recover their freedom, they seldom relapse.\n\nThere are, or rather were, a large number of debt slaves in North Borneo. For a debt of three pikuls\u2014$60 to $75\u2014a man might be enslaved if his friends could not raise the requisite sum, and he would continue to be a slave until the debt was paid, but, as a most usurious interest was charged, it was almost always a hopeless task to attempt it.\n\nSometimes an inveterate gambler would sell himself to pay off his debts of honour, keeping the balance if any.\n\nThe natives, regardless of the precepts of the Koran, would purchase any slaves that were offered for sale, whether infidel or Muhammedan. The importers were usually the Illanun and Sulu kidnappers, who would bring in slaves of all tribes\u2014Bajaus, Illanuns, Sulus, Brunais, Manilamen, natives of Palawan and natives of the interior of Magindanau\u2014all was fish that came into their net. The selling price was as follows:\n\nA boy, about 2 pikuls, a man 3 pikuls. A girl, 3 to 4 pikuls, a young woman, 3 to 5 pikuls. A person past middle age about 1\u00bd pikuls. A young couple, 7 to 8 pikuls, an old couple, about 5 pikuls. The pikul was then equivalent to $20 or $25. Mr. Witti further stated that in Tampassuk the proportion of free men to slaves was only one in three, and in Marudu Bay only one in five. In Tampassuk there were more female than male slaves.\n\nMr. A. H. Everett reported that, in his district of Pappar-Kimanis, there was no slave trade, and that the condition of the domestic slaves was not one of hardship.\n\nMr. W. B. Pryer, speaking for the East Coast, informed me that there were only a few slaves in the interior, mostly Sulus who had been kidnapped and sold up the rivers. Among the Sulus of the coast, the relation was rather that of follower and lord than of slave and master. When he first settled at Sandakan, he could not get men to work for him for wages, they deemed it degrading to do so, but they said they\nwould work for him if he would buy them! Sulu, under Spanish influence, and Bulungan, in Dutch Borneo, were the chief slave markets, but the Spanish and Dutch are gradually suppressing this traffic.\n\nThere was a colony of Illanuns and Balinini settled at Tunku and Teribas on the East Coast, who did a considerable business in kidnapping, but in 1879 Commander E. Edwards, in H.M.S. Kestrel, attacked and burnt their village, capturing and burning several piratical boats and prahus.\n\nSlavery, though not yet extinct in Borneo, has received a severe check in British North Borneo and in Sarawak, and is rapidly dying out in both countries; in fact it is a losing business to be a slave-owner now.\n\nApart from the institution of slavery, which is sanctioned by the Muhammadan religion, the religious customs and laws of the various tribes \"especially with respect to the holding, possession, transfer and disposition of lands and goods, and testate or intestate succession thereto, and marriage, divorce and legitimacy, and the rights of property and personal rights\" are carefully regarded by the Company's Government, as in duty bound, according to the terms of Articles 8 and 9 of the Royal Charter. The services of native headmen are utilised as much as possible, and Courts composed of Native Magistrates have been established, but at the same time efforts are made to carry the people with the Government in ameliorating and advancing their social position, and thus involves an amendment of some of the old customs and laws.\n\nMoreover, customs which are altogether repugnant to modern ideas are checked or prohibited by the new Government; as, for example, the time-honoured custom of a tribe periodically balancing the account of the number of heads taken or lost by it from or to another tribe, an audit which, it is strange to say, almost invariably results in the discovery on the part of the stronger tribe that they are on the wrong side of the account and have a balance to get from the others. These hitherto interminable feuds, though not altogether put a stop to in the interior, have been in many districts effectually brought to an end. Government officers having been asked by the natives themselves to undertake the examina-\ntion of the accounts and the tribe who was found to be on the debtor side paying, not human heads, but compensation in goods at a fixed rate per head due. Another custom which the Company found it impossible to recognize was that of summungap, which was, in reality, nothing but a form of human sacrifice, the victim being a slave bought for the purpose, and the object being to send a message to a deceased relative. With this object in view, the slave used to be bound and wrapped in cloth, when the relatives would dance round him and each thrust a spear a short way into his body, repeating, as he did so, the message which he wished conveyed. This operation was performed till the slave succumbed.\n\nThe Muhammadan practice of cutting off the hair of a woman convicted of adultery, or of men flogging her with a rattan, and that of cutting off the head of a thief, have also not received the recognition of the Company's Government.\n\nIt has been shewn that the native population of North Borneo is very small, only about five to the square mile, and as the country is fertile and well-watered and possesses, for the tropics, a healthy climate, there must be some exceptional cause for the scantiness of the population. This is to be found chiefly in the absence, already referred to, of any strong central Government in former days, and to the consequent presence of all forms of lawlessness, piracy, slave-trading, kidnapping and head-hunting.\n\nIn more recent years, too, cholera and small-pox have made frightful ravages amongst the natives, almost annihilating some of the tribes, for the people knew of no remedies and, on the approach of the scourge, deserted their homes and their sick and fled to the jungle, where exposure and privation rendered them more than ever liable to the disease. Since the Company's advent, efforts are being successfully made to introduce vaccination, in which most of the people now have confidence.\n\nThis fact of a scanty native population has, in some ways, rendered the introduction of the Company's Government a less arduous undertaking than it might otherwise have proved, and has been a fortunate circumstance for the shareholders, who have the more unowned and virgin land to dispose of.\nIn British North Borneo, luckily for the Company, there is not, as there is in Sarawak, any one large, powerful tribe, whose presence might have been a source of trouble, or even of danger to the young Government, but the aborigines are split up into a number of petty tribes, speaking very distinct dialects and, generally, at enmity amongst themselves, so that a general coalition of the bad elements amongst them is impossible.\n\nThe institution and amusement of head-hunting appears never to have been taken up and followed with so much energy and zeal in North Borneo as among the Dyaks of Sarawak. I do not think that it was as a rule deemed absolutely essential with any of our tribes that a young man should have taken at least a head or two before he could venture to aspire to the hand of the maiden who had led captive his heart. The heads of slain enemies were originally taken by the conquerors as a substantial proof and trophy of their successful prowess, which could not be gainsaid, and it came, in time, to be considered the proper thing to be able to boast of the possession of a large number of these ghastly tokens; and so an ambitious youth, in his desire for applause, would not be particularly careful from whom, or in what manner he obtained a head, and the victim might be, not only a person with whom he had no quarrel, but even a member of a friendly tribe, and the mode of acquisition might be, not by a fair stand-up fight, a test of skill and courage, but by treachery and ambush. Nor did it make very much difference whether the head obtained was that of a man, a woman or a child, and in their petty wars it was even conceived to be an honourable distinction to bring in the heads of women and children, the reasoning being that the men of the attacked tribe must have fought their best to defend their wives and children.\n\nThe following incident, which occurred some years ago at the Colony of Labuan, serves to show how immaterial it was whether a friend, or foe, or utter stranger was the victim. A Murut chief of the Trusan, a river on the mainland over against Labuan, was desirous of obtaining some fresh heads on the occasion of a marriage feast, and put to sea to a district inhabited by a hostile tribe. Meeting with adverse\nwinds, his canoes were blown over to the British Colony; the Muruts landed, held apparently friendly intercourse with some of the Kadaian (Muhammadan) population and, after a visit of two or three days, made preparations to sail; but meeting a Kadaian returning to his home alone, they shot him and went off with his head\u2014though the man was an entire stranger to them, and they had no quarrel with any of his tribe.\n\nWith the assistance of the Brunei authorities, the chief and several of his accomplices were subsequently secured and sent for trial to Labuan. The chief died in prison, while awaiting trial, but one or two of his associates paid the penalty of their wanton crime.\n\nA short time afterwards, Mr. COOK and I visited the Lamas River for sport, and took up our abode in a Murut long house, where, I remember, a large basket of skulls was placed as an ornament at the head of my sleeping place. One night, when all our men, with the exception of my Chinese servant, were away in the jungle, trying to trap the then newly discovered \"Bulwer pheasant,\" some Muruts from the Trusan came over and informed our hosts of the fate of their chief. On the receipt of this intelligence, all the men of our house left it and repaired to one adjoining, where a great \"drank\" was held, while the women indulged in a loud, low, monotonous, heart-breaking wail, which they kept up for several hours. Mr. COOK and myself agreed that things looked almost as bad for us as they well could, and when, towards morning, the men returned to our house, my Chinese boy clung to me in terror and\u2014nothing happened! But certainly I do not think I have ever passed such an uncomfortable period of suspense.\n\nWriting to the Court of Directors of the East India Company a hundred and thirteen years ago, Mr. YESSE, who concluded the pepper monopoly agreement with the Brunei Government, referring to the Murut predilection for head-hunting says:\u2014\n\n\"With respect to the Idaan, or Muruts, as they are called here, I cannot give any account of their disposition; but from what I have heard from the Borneyans, they are a set of abandoned idolaters; one of their tenets, so strangely inhuman, I cannot pass unnoticed, which is, that their future in-\nterest depends upon the number of their fellow creatures they have killed in any engagement or common disputes and count their degrees of happiness to depend on the number of human skulls in their possession; from which, and the wild, disorderly life they lead, unrestrained by any bond of civil society we ought not to be surprised if they are of a cruel and vindictive disposition.\" I think this is rather a case of giving a dog a bad name.\n\nI heard read once at a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, an eloquent paper on the Natives of the Andaman Islands, in which the lecturer, after shewing that the Andamanese were suspicious, treacherous, blood-thirsty, ungrateful and untruthful, concluded by giving it as his opinion that they were very good fellows and in many ways superior to white man.\n\nI do not go quite so far as he does, but I must say that many of the aborigines are very pleasant good-natured creatures, and have a lot of good qualities in them, which, with care and discriminating legislation on the part of their new rulers, might be gradually developed, while the evil qualities which they possess in common with all races of men, might be pari passu not extinguished, but reduced to a minimum. But this result can only be secured by officers who are naturally of a sympathetic disposition and ready to take the trouble of studying the natives and entering into their thoughts and aspirations.\n\nIn many instances, the Company has been fortunate in its choice of officials, whose work has brought them into intimate connection with the aborigines.\n\nA besetting sin of young officers is to expect too much\u2014they are conscious that their only aim is to advance the best interests of the natives, and they are surprised and hurt at what they consider, the want of gratitude and backwardness in seconding their efforts evinced by them. They forget that the people are as yet in the schoolboy stage, and should try and remember how, in their own schoolboy days, they offered opposition to the efforts of their masters for their improvement, and how little gratitude they felt, at the time, for all that was done for them. Patience and sympathy are the two\nqualifications especially requisite in officers selected for the management of native affairs.\n\nIn addition to the indigenous population, there are, settled along the coast and at the mouths of the principal rivers, large numbers of the more highly civilized tribes of Malays, of whose presence in Borneo an explanation has been attempted on a previous page. They are known as Brunais\u2014called by the Natives, for some unexplained reason, orang abai\u2014Sulus, Bajows, Ilaouns and Balininis; there are also a few Bugis, or natives of Celebes.\n\nThese are the people who, before the Company's arrival, lorded it over the more ignorant interior tribes, and prevented their having direct dealings with traders and foreigners, and to whom, consequently, the advent of a still more civilized race than themselves was very distasteful.\n\nThe habits of the Brunai people have already been sufficiently described.\n\nThe Sulus are, next to the Brunais, the most civilized race and, without any exception, the most warlike and powerful. For nearly three centuries, they have been more or less in a state of war with the Spaniards of the Philippine Islands, and even now, though the Spaniards have established a fortified port in their principal island, their subjugation is by no means complete.\n\nThe Spanish officials dare not go beyond the walls of their settlement, unless armed and in force, and it is no rare thing for fanatical Sulus, singly or in small parties, to make their way into the Spanish town, under the guise of unarmed and friendly peasants, and then suddenly draw their concealed krises and rush with fury on officers, soldiers and civilians, generally managing to kill several before they are themselves cut down.\n\nThey are a much bolder and more independent race than the Brunais, who have always stood in fear of them, and it was in consideration of its undertaking to defend them against their attacks that the Brunai Government conceded the exclusive trade in pepper to the East India Company. Their religion\u2014Muhammadanism\u2014sits even more lightly on the Sulus than on the Brunais, and their women, who are fairer and better looking than their Brunai sisters, are never secluded\nor veiled, but often take part in public deliberations and, in matters of business, are even sharper than the men.\n\nThe Sulus are a bloodthirsty and hard-hearted race, and, when an opportunity occurs, are not always averse to kidnapping even their own countrymen and selling them into slavery. They entertain a high notion of their own importance, and are ever ready to resent with their krises the slightest affront which they may conceive has been put upon them.\n\nIn Borneo, they are found principally on the North-East Coast, and a good many have settled in British North Borneo under the Company's Government. They occasionally take contracts for felling jungle and other work of similar character, but are less disposed than the Brunei men to perform work for Europeans on regular wages. Among their good qualities, it may be mentioned that they are faithful and trustworthy followers of any European to whom they may become attached. Their language is distinct from ordinary Malay, and is akin to that of the Bisaias, one of the principal tribes of the Philippines, and is written in the Arabic character; but many Malay terms have been adopted into the language, and most of the trading and seafaring Sulus know enough Malay to conclude a bargain.\n\nThe most numerous Muhammadan race in British North Borneo is that of the Bajows, who are found on both coasts, but, on the West Coast, not South of the Pappar River. These are the orang-laut (men of the sea) or sea-gypsies of the old writers, and are the worst class that we have to deal with, being of a treacherous and thievish disposition, and confirmed gamblers and cattle-jifters.\n\nThey also form a large proportion of the population of the Sulu Islands, where they are, or used to be, noted kidnappers and pirates, though also distinguished for their skill in pearl fisheries. Their religion is that of Mahomet and their language Malay mixed, it is said, with Chinese and Japanese elements; their women are not secluded, and it is a rare thing for a Borneo Bajow to take the trouble of making the pilgrimage to Mecca. They are found along the coasts of nearly all the Malay Islands and, apparently, in former days lived entirely in their boats. In British North Borneo, a large major-\nity have taken to building houses and residing on the shore, but when Mr. PRYER first settled at Sandakan, there was a considerable community of them in the Bay, who had no houses at all, but were born, bred, married and died in their small canoes.\n\nOn the West Coast, the Bajows, who have for a long time been settled ashore, appear to be of smaller build and darker colour than the other Malays, with small sparkling black eyes, but on the East Coast, where their condition is more primitive, Mr. PRYER thinks they are much larger in stature and stronger and more swarthy than ordinary Malays.\n\nOn the East Coast, there are no buffaloes or horned cattle, so that the Bajows there have, or I should say had, to be content with kidnapping only, and as an example of their daring I may relate that in, I think, the year 1875, the Austrian Frigate Friedrich, Captain Baron OESTERREICHER, was surveying to the South of Darvel Bay, and, running short of coal, sent an armed party ashore to cut firewood. The Bajows watched their opportunity and, when the frigate was out of sight, seized the cutter, notwithstanding the fire of the party on the shore, who expended all their ammunition in vain, and carried off the two boat-keepers, whose heads were subsequently shewn round in triumph in the neighbouring islands. Baron OESTERREICHER was unable to discover the retreat of these Bajows, and they remain unpunished to this day, and are at present numbered among the subjects of the British North Borneo Company. I have been since told that I have more than once unwittingly shaken hands and had friendly intercourse with some of them. In fairness to them I should add that it is more than probable that they mistook the Friedrich for a vessel belonging to Spain, with whom their sovereign, the Sultan of Sulu, was at that time at war. After this incident, and by order of his Government, Baron OESTERREICHER visited Sandakan Bay and, I believe, reported that he could discover no population there other than monkeys. Altogether, he could not have carried away with him a very favourable impression of Northern Borneo. On the West Coast, gambling and cattle-lifting are the main pursuits of the gentlemanly Bajow, pursuits which soon brought him into close and\nvery uncomfortable relations with the new Government, for which he entertains anything but feelings of affection.\n\nOne of the principal independent rivers on the West Coast\u2014i.e., rivers which have not yet been ceded to the Company\u2014is the Mengkabong, the majority of the inhabitants of which are Bajows, so that it has become a sort of river of refuge for the bad characters on the coast, as well as an entrep\u00f4t for the smuggling of gunpowder for sale to the head-hunting tribes of the interior. The existence of these independent and intermediate rivers on their West Coast is a serious difficulty for the Company in its efforts to establish good government and put down lawlessness, and every one having at heart the true interests of the natives of Borneo must hope that the Company will soon be successful in the negotiations which they have opened for the acquisition of these rivers. The Kawang was an important river, inhabited by a small number of Bajows, acquired by the Company in 1884, and the conduct of these people on one occasion affords a good idea of their treachery and their hostility towards good government. An interior tribe had made itself famous for its head-hunting proclivities, and the Kawang was selected as the best route by which to reach their district and inflict punishment upon them. The selection of this route was not a politic one, seeing that the inhabitants were Bajows, and that they had but recently come under the Company's rule. The expedition was detained a day or two at the Bajow village, as the full number of Dusun baggage-carriers had not arrived, and the Bajows were called upon to make up the deficiency, but did not do so. Matters were further complicated by the Dusuns recognising some noted cattle-lifters in the village, and demanding a buffalo which had been stolen from them. It being impossible to obtain the required luggage carriers, it was proposed to postpone the expedition, the stores were deposited in some of the houses of the village and the Constabulary were \"dismissed\" and, piling their arms, laid down under the shelter of some trees. Without any warning one of two Bajows, with whom Dr. Fraser was having an apparently friendly chat, discharged his musket point blank at the Doctor, killing him on the spot, and seven others rushed among the unarmed\nConstables and speared the Sikh Jemmadhar and the Sergeant-Major and a private and then made off for the jungle. Captain De Fontaine gallantly, but rashly started off in pursuit, before any one could support him. He tripped and fell and was so severely wounded by the Bajows, after killing three of them with his revolver, that he died a few days afterwards at Sandakan. By this time the Sikhs had got their rifles and firing on the retreating party killed three and wounded two. Assistant Resident Little, who had received a spear in his arm, shot his opponent dead with his revolver. None of the other villagers took any active part, and consequently were only punished by the imposition of a fine. They subsequently all cleared out of the Company's territory.\n\nIt was a sad day for the little Colony at Sandakan when Mr. Whitehead, a naturalist who happened to be travelling in the neighbourhood at the time, brought us the news of the melancholy affray, and the wounded Captain De Fontaine and several Sikhs, to whose comfort and relief he had, at much personal inconvenience, attended on the tedious voyage in a small steam-launch from the Kawang to the Capital. On the East Coast, also, their slave-dealing and kidnapping propensities brought the Bajows into unfriendly relations with the Government, and their lawlessness culminated in their kidnapping several Eraan birds' nest collectors, whom they refused to surrender, and making preparations for resisting any measures which might be taken to coerce them. As these same people had, a short time previously, captured at sea some five Dutch subjects, it was deemed that their offences brought them within the cognizance of the Naval authorities, and Captain A. K. Hope, R.N., at my request, visited the district, in 1886, in H. M. S. Zephyr and, finding that the people of two of the Bajow villages refused to hold communication with us, but prepared their boats for action, he opened fire on them under the protection of which a party of the North Borneo Constabulary landed and destroyed the villages, which were quickly deserted, and many of the boats which had been used on piratical excursions. Happily, there was no loss of life on either side, and a very wholesome and useful lesson was given to the pirates without the shedding\nof blood, thanks to the good arrangements and tact of Captain Hope. In order that the good results of this lesson should not be wasted, I revisited the scene of the little engagement in the Zephyr a few weeks subsequently, and not long afterwards the British flag was again shewn in the district, by Captain A. H. Alington in H. M. S. Satellite, who interviewed the offending chiefs and gave them sound advice as to their conduct in future.\n\nAkin to the Bajows are the Illanuns and Balinini, Muhammadan peoples, famous in former days as the most enterprising pirates of the Malayan seas. The Balinini, Balignini or Balanguini\u2014as their name is variously written\u2014originally came from a small island to the north of Sulu, and the Illanuns from the south coast of the island of Mindanao\u2014one of the Philippines, but by the action of the Spanish and British cruisers their power has been broken and they are found scattered in small numbers throughout the Sulu Islands and on the seaboard of Northern Borneo, on the West Coast of which they founded little independent settlements, arrogating to their petty chiefs such high sounding titles as Sultan, Maharajah and so forth.\n\nThe Illanuns are a proud race and distinguished by wearing a much larger sword than the other tribes, with a straight blade about 28 inches in length. This sword is called a kampilan, and is used in conjunction with a long, narrow, wooden shield, known by the name of klassap, and in the use of these weapons the Illanuns are very expert and often boast that, were it not for their gunpowder, no Europeans could stand up to them, face to face. I believe, that it is these people who in former days manufactured the chain armour of which I have seen several specimens, but the use of which has now gone out of fashion. Those I have are made of small brass rings linked together, and with plates of brass or buffalo horn in front. The headpiece is of similar construction.\n\nThere are no Negritos in Borneo, although they exist in the Malay Peninsula and the Philippines, and our explorers have failed to obtain any specimens of the \"tailed\" people in whose existence many of the Brunei people believe. The late Sul-\ntan of Brunei gravely assured me that there was such a tribe, and that the individuals composing it were in the habit of carrying about chairs with them, in the seat of each of which there was a little hole, in which the lady or gentleman carefully inserted her or his tail before settling down to a comfortable chat. This belief in the existence of a tailed race appears to be widespread, and in his \"Pioneering in New Guinea\" Mr. Chalmers gives an amusing account of a detailed description of such a tribe by a man who vowed he had lived with them, and related how they were provided with long sticks, with which to make holes in the ground before squatting down, for the reception of their short stumpy tails! I think it is Mr. H. F. Romilly who, in his interesting little work on the Western Pacific and New Guinea, accounts for the prevalence of \"yarns\" of this class by explaining that the natives regard Europeans as being vastly superior to them in general knowledge and, when they find them asking such questions as, for instance, whether there are tailed-people in the interior, jump to the conclusion that the white men must have good grounds for believing that they do exist, and then they gradually come to believe in their existence themselves.\n\nThere is, however, I think, some excuse for the Brunei people's belief, for I have seen one tribe of Muruts who, in addition to the usual small loin cloth, wear on their backs only a skin of a long-tailed monkey, the tail of which hangs down behind in such a manner as, when the men are a little distance off, to give one at first glance the impression that it is part and parcel of the biped.\n\nIn Labuan it used to be a very common occurrence for the graves of the Europeans, of which unfortunately, owing to its bad climate when first settled, there are a goodly number, to be found desecrated and the bones scattered about. The perpetrators of these outrages have never been discovered, notwithstanding the most stringent enquiries. It was once thought that they were broken open by head-hunting tribes from the mainland, but this theory was disproved by the fact that the skulls were never carried away. As we know of no Borneo tribe which is in the habit of breaking open graves, the only conclusion that can be come to is that the\ngraves were rifled under the supposition that the Europeans buried treasure with their dead, though it is strange that their experiences of failure never seemed to teach them that such was not the case.\n\nThe Muhammadan natives are buried in the customary Muhammadan manner in regular graveyards kept for the purpose.\n\nThe aborigines generally bury their dead near their houses, erecting over the graves little sheds adorned, in the case of chiefs, with bright coloured clothes, umbrellas, etc. I once went to see the lying-in state of a deceased Datoh, who had been dead nine days. On entering the house I looked about for the corpse in vain, till my attention was drawn to an old earthen jar, tilted slightly forward, on the top of the old Chief's goods\u2014his sword, spear, gun and clothing.\n\nIn this jar were the Datoh's remains, the poor old fellow having been doubled up, head and heels together, and forced through the mouth of the vessel, which was about two feet in diameter. The jar itself was about four feet high. Over the corpse was thickly sprinkled the native camphor, and the jar was closed with a piece of buffalohide, well sealed over with gum dammar. They told us the Datoh was dressed in his best clothes and had his pipe with him, but nothing else. He was to be buried that day in a small grave excavated near the house, just large enough to contain the jar, and a buffalo was being killed and intoxicating drink prepared for the numerous friends and followers who were flocking in for the wake. Over his grave cannon would be fired to arouse the spirits who were to lead him to Kinabalu, the people shouting out \"Turn neither to the right nor to the left, but proceed straight to Kinabalu\"\u2014the sacred mountain where are collected the spirits of all good Dusuns under, I believe, the presidency of a great spirit known as Kinaringan.\n\nChapter XI.\n\nThe population of North Borneo, as has been shewn, is very scanty, and the great object of the new Government should be\npreface to the second edition of his \"Life in the Forests of the Far East,\" lays great stress on the suitability of North Borneo for the immigration of Chinese on a very large scale, and prophesied that \"should the immigration once commence, it would doubtless assume great proportions and continue until every acre of useless jungle is cleared away, to give place to rice, pepper, gambier, sugar-cane, cotton, coffee, indigo and those other products which flourish on its fertile soil.\" No doubt a considerable impetus would be given to the immigration of Chinese and the introduction of Chinese as well as of European capital, were the British Government to proclaim* formally a Protectorate over the country, meanwhile the Company should try the effect of the offer of free passages from China and from Singapore and of liberal allotments of suitable land to bond jute agriculturists.\n\nThe sources of the Company's revenues have been referred to on a previous page, and may be summarised here under the following principal heads:\u2014The \"Parms\" of Opium, Tobacco, Spirits, and of Pawnbroking, the Rent of the edible birds' nest caves, Market Dues, Duties on Imports and Exports, Court Fines and Fees, Poll Tax on aborigines, House and Store Rents, profit accruing from the introduction of the Company's copper or bronze token coinage\u2014a considerable item\u2014Interest and Commission resulting from the Banking business carried on by the Treasury pending the establishment of a Banking Company, Land Sales and Quit-rents on land alienated, and Postal Receipts.\n\nThe Poll Tax is a source of revenue well-known in the East and not objected to by most of our natives, with whom it takes the place of the land rent which the Government of India imposes. To our aborigines a land rent would be most distasteful at present, and they infinitely prefer the Poll Tax and to be allowed to own and farm what land they like without paying premium or rent. The more civilized tribes, especially on the West coast, recognize private property in land, the boundaries of their gardens and fields being carefully\n\n* Now accomplished\nmarked and defined, and the property descending from fathers to children. The rate of the Poll Tax is usually $2 for married couples and $1 for adult bachelors per annum, and I believe this is about the same rate as that collected by the British Government in Burma. At first sight it has the appearance of a tax on marriage, but in the East generally women do a great deal of the outdoor as well as of the indoor work, so that a married man is in a much better position than a bachelor for acquiring wealth, as he can be engaged in collecting jungle produce, or in trading, or in making money in other ways, while his womenkind are planting out or gathering in the harvest.\n\nThe amounts received by the Company for the sale of their waste lands has been as follows\u2014\n\n| Year | Amount |\n|------|--------|\n| 1882 | $16,340 |\n| 1883 | $25,449 |\n| 1884 | $15,460 |\n| 1885 | $2,860 |\n| 1886 | $12,035 |\n| 1887* | $14,595 |\n\nThe receipts for 1888, owing to the rush for tobacco lands already alluded to, and to the fact that the balances of the premia on lands taken up in 1887 becomes due in that year, will be considerably larger than those of any previous period.\n\nThe most productive, and the most elastic source of revenue is that derived from the Excise on the retail of opium and, with the comparatively small number of Chinese at present in the country, this amounted in 1887 to $19,080, having been only $4,537 in 1882.\u2020 The next most substantial and promising item is the Customs Duties on Import and Export, which from about $8,300 in 1882 have increased to $19,080 in 1887.\u2021\n\nThe local expenditure in Borneo is chiefly for salaries of the officials, the armed Constabulary and for Gaols and Public Works, the annual \"rental\" payable to the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu and others, the subsidizing of steamers, Medical\n\n---\n\n* In 1888, $246,457\n\u2020 In 1888, $22,755 were realized and the Estimate for 1890 is $70,000 for the Opium Farm.\n\u2021 In 1888, $22,755.\nServices, Printing, Stationery, Prospecting, Experimental Gardens and Harbour and Postal Services. The designations of the principal officials employed by the Company in Borneo have been given on a previous page; the salaries allowed them, as a rule, can scarcely be called too liberal, and unfortunately the Court of Directors does not at present feel that it is justified in sanctioning any pension scheme. Those of my readers who are conversant with the working of Public Offices will recognize that this decision of the Directors deprives the service of one great incentive to hard and continuous work and of a powerful factor in the maintenance of an effective discipline, and it speaks volumes for the quality of the officials whose services the Company has been so fortunate as to secure without this attraction, that it is served as faithfully, energetically and zealously as any Government in the world.\n\nIf I may be allowed to say so here, I can never adequately express my sense of the valuable assistance and support I received from the officers, with scarcely any exception, during my six years' tenure of the appointment of Governor. An excellent spirit pervades the service and, when the occasions have arisen, there have never been wanting officers ready to risk their lives in performing their duties, without hope of rewards or distinctions, Victoria Crosses or medals.\n\nThe figures below speak for the advance which the country is making, not very rapidly, perhaps the shareholders may think, but certainly, though slowly, surely and steadily.\n\nRevenue in 1883, \u00a351,654, with the addition of Land Sales, \u00a325,449, a total of \u00a377,103.\n\nRevenue in 1887, \u00a3142,687, with the addition of Land Sales, \u00a314,505, a total of \u00a3157,192.\n\nExpenditure in 1883, including expenditure on Capital Account, \u00a3391,547.\n\nExpenditure in 1887, including expenditure on Capital Account, \u00a3209,862.\n\nFor reasons already mentioned, the revenue for 1888 is expected to considerably exceed that of any previous year,\nwhile the expenditure will probably not be more and may be less than that of 1887.*\n\nThe expenses of the London office average, I believe, about \u00a33,000 a year.\n\nAs Sir Rutherford Alcock, their able and conscientious Chairman, explained to the shareholders at a recent meeting, \"with reference to the important question of expenditure, the position of the Company was that of a man coming into possession of a large estate which had been long neglected, and which was little better than a wilderness. If any rent roll was to be derived from such a property there must be, in the first place, a large outlay in many ways before the land could be made profitable or indeed tenantable. That was what the Company had had to do and what they had been doing, and that had been the history of all our Colonies.\" I trust that the few observations I have offered will have shewn my readers that, though British North Borneo might be described as a wilderness so far as regards the absence of development when the Company took possession of it, such a description is by no means applicable to it when regard is had to its great and undoubted natural resources.\n\nBritish North Borneo not being a Crown Colony, it has to provide itself for the maintenance of order, both ashore and afloat, without assistance from the Imperial Army or Navy, except such temporary assistance as has been on two occasions accorded by Her Majesty's vessels, under circumstances which have been detailed. There are no Imperial Troops stationed either in Labuan or in any portion of Borneo, and the Company has organized an armed Police Force to act both in a military and in a civil capacity.\n\nThe numbers of their Force do not much exceed two hundred of all ranks, and are composed principally of Sikhs from the Punjab and a few Dyaks from Sarawak\u2014an excellent mixture for fighting purposes, the Dyaks being sufficiently\n\n---\n\n* Revenue in 1888, $148,286, with addition of Land Sales, $246,457, a total of $394,743.\n\nExpenditure in 1888, including Padas war expenses, $210,985 and expenditure on Capital Account, $25,283\u2014total $236,268.\ncourageous and expert in all the arts of jungle warfare, while the pluck and cool steadiness under fire of the Sikhs is too well-known to need comment here. The services of any number of Sikhs can, it appears, be easily obtained for this sort of work, and some years ago a party of them even took service with the native Sultan of Sulu, who, however, proved a very indifferent paymaster and was soon deserted by his mercenaries, who are the most money-grabbing lot of warriors I have ever heard of. Large bodies of Sikhs are employed and drilled as Armed Constables in Hongkong, in the Straits Settlements and in the Protected Native States of the Malay Peninsula, who, after a fixed time of service, return to their country, their places being at once taken by their compatriots, and one cannot help thinking what effect this might have in case of future disturbances in our Indian Empire, should the Sikh natives make common cause with the malcontents.\n\nFault has been found with the Company for not following the example of Sarawak and raising an army and police from among its own people. This certainly would have been the best policy had it only been feasible; but the attempt was made and failed.\n\nAs I have pointed out, British North Borneo is fortunate in not possessing any powerful aboriginal tribe of pronounced warlike instincts, such as the Dyaks of Sarawak.\n\nThe Muhammadan Bajows might in time make good soldiers, but my description of them will have shewn that the Company could not at present place reliance in them.\n\nWhile on the subject of \"fault finding,\" I may say that the Company has also been blamed for its expenditure on public works and on subsidies for steam communication with the outer world.\n\nBut our critics may rest assured that, had not the Company proved its faith in the country by expending some of its money on public works and in providing facilities for the conveyance of intending colonists, neither European capital nor Chinese population, so indispensable to the success of their scheme, would have been attracted to their Territory as is now being done\u2014for the country and its new Government lacked the prestige which attaches to a Colony opened by\nthe Imperial Government. The strange experiment, in the present day, of a London Company inaugurating a Government in a tropical Colony, perhaps not unnaturally caused a certain feeling of pique and uncharitableness in the breasts of that class of people who cannot help being pleased at the non-success of their neighbours' most cherished schemes, and who are always ready with their \"I told you so.\" The measure of success attained by British North Borneo caused it to come in for its full share of this feeling, and I am not sure that it was not increased and aggravated by the keen interest which all the officers took in the performance of their novel duties\u2014an interest which, quite unintentionally, manifested itself, perhaps, in a too enthusiastic and somewhat exaggerated estimate of the beauties and resources of their adopted country and of the grandeur of its future destiny and of its rapid progress, and which, so to speak, brought about a reaction towards the opposite extreme in the minds of the class to whom I refer. This enthusiasm was, to say the least, pardonable under the circumstances, for all men are prone to think that objects which intensely engross their whole attention are of more importance than the world at large is pleased to admit. Every man worth his salt thinks his own geese are swans.\n\nA notable exception to this narrow-mindedness was, however, displayed by the Government of Singapore, especially by its present Governor, Sir Cecil Clementi Smith, who let no opportunity pass of encouraging the efforts of the infant Government by practical assistance and unprejudiced counsel.\n\nLord Brassey, whose visit to Borneo in the Sunbeam I have mentioned, showed a kindly appreciation of the efforts of the Company's officers, and practically evinced his faith in the future of the country by joining the Court of Directors on his return to England.\n\nIn the number of the \"Nineteenth Century\" for August, 1887, is a sketch of the then position of the portion of Borneo which is under the British influence, from his pen.\n\nAs the country is developed and land taken up by European planters and Chinese, the Company will be called upon\nfor further expenditure on public works, in the shape of roads, for at present, in the interior, there exist only rough native tracks, made use of by the natives when there does not happen to be a river handy for the transport of themselves and their goods. Though well watered enough, British North Borneo possesses no rivers navigable for European vessels of any size, except perhaps the Sibuku River, the possession of which is at the present moment a subject of dispute with the Dutch. This is due to the natural configuration of the country Borneo, towards the North, becoming comparatively narrow and of roughly triangular shape, with the apex to the North. The only other river of any size and navigable for vessels drawing about nine feet over the bar, is the Kinabatangan, which, like the Sibuku, is on the East side, the coast range of mountains, of which Kinabalu forms a part, being at no great distance from the West coast and so preventing the occurrence of any large rivers on that side. From data already to hand, it is calculated that the proceeds of Land Sales for 1887 and 1888 will equal the total revenue from all other sources, and a portion of this will doubtless be set aside for road making and other requisite public works.\n\nThe question may be asked what has the Company done for North Borneo?\n\nA brief reply to this question would include the following points. The Company has paved the way to the ultimate extinction of the practice of slavery, it has dealt the final blow to the piracy and kidnapping which still lingered on its coasts; it has substituted one strong and just Government for numerous weak, cruel and unjust ones; it has opened Courts of Justice which know no distinction between races and creeds, between rich and poor, between master and slave; it is rapidly adjusting ancient blood feuds between the tribes and putting a stop to the old custom of head-hunting; it has broken down the barrier erected by the coast Malays to prevent the aborigines having access to the outer world and is thus enabling trade and its accompanying civilisation to reach the interior races; and it is attracting European and Chinese capital to the country and opening a market for British traders.\nThese are some, and not inconsiderable ones, of the achievements of the British North Borneo Company, which, in its humble way, affords another example of the fact that the \"expansion of Britain\" has been in the main due not to the exertions of its Government so much as to the energy and enterprise of individual citizens, and Sir Alfred Dent, the founder, and Sir Rutherford Alcock, the guide and supporter of the British North Borneo Company, cannot but feel a proud satisfaction in the reflection that their energy and patient perseverance have resulted in conferring upon so considerable a portion of the island of Borneo the benefits above enumerated and in adding another Colony to the long list of the Dependencies of the British Crown.\n\nIn the matter of geographical exploration, too, the Company and its officers have not been idle; as the map brought out by the Company sufficiently shews, for previous maps of North Borneo will be found very barren and uninteresting, the interior being almost a complete blank, though possessing one natural feature which is conspicuous by its absence in the more recent and trustworthy one, and that is the large lake of Kinabalu, which the explorations of the late Mr. F. K. Witt have proved to be non-existent. Two explanations are given of the origin of the myth of the Kinabalu Lake\u2014one is that in the district, where it was supposed to exist, extensive floods do take place in very wet seasons, giving it the appearance of a lake, and, I believe there are many similar instances in Dutch Borneo, where a tract of country liable to be heavily flooded has been dignified with the name of Danau, which is Malay for lake, so that the mistake of the European cartographers is a pardonable one. The other explanation is that the district in question is known to the aboriginal inhabitants as Danau, a word which, in their language, has no particular meaning, but which, as above stated, signifies, in Malay, a lake. The first European visitors would have gained all their information from the Malay coast tribes, and the reason for their mistaken supposition of the existence of a large lake can be readily understood. The two principal pioneer explorers of British North Borneo were Witt and Frank Hallon, both of whom met with violent deaths. Witt's\nservices as one of the first officers stationed in the country, before the British North Borneo Company was formed, have already been referred to, and I have drawn on his able report for a short account of the slave system which formerly prevailed. He had served in the Austrian Navy and was a very energetic, courageous and accomplished man. Besides minor journeys, he had traversed the country from West to East and from North to South, and it was on his last journey from Pappar, on the West Coast, inland to the headwaters of the Kinabatangan and Sambakong Rivers, that he was murdered by a tribe, whose language none of his party understood, but whose confidence he had endeavoured to win by reposing confidence in them, to the extent even of letting them carry his carbine. He and his men had slept in the village one night, and on the following day some of the tribe joined the party as guides, but led them into the ambuscade, where the gallant Witti and many of his men were killed by sumptans.* So far as we have been able to ascertain the sole reason for the attack was the fact that Witti had come to the district from a tribe with whom these people were at war, and he was, therefore, according to native custom, deemed also to be an enemy. Frank Hatton joined the Company's service with the object of investigating the mineral resources of the country and in the course of his work travelled over a great portion of the Territory, prosecuting his journeys from both the West and the East coasts, and undergoing the hardships incidental to travel in a roadless, tropical country with such ability pluck and success as surprised me in one so young and slight and previously untrained and inexperienced in rough pioneering work.\n\nHe more than once found himself in critical positions with inland tribes, who had never seen or heard of a white man, but his calmness and intrepidity carried him safely through\n\n---\n\n* The sumptan or native blow-pipe, has been frequently described by writers on Borneo. It is a tube 6\u00bd feet long carefully perforated lengthwise and through which is fired a poisoned dart, which has an extreme range of about 80 to go yards, but is effective at about 30 to 50 yards. It takes the place in Borneo of the bow and arrow of savage tribes, and is used only by the aborigines and not by the Muhammadan natives.\nsuch difficulties, and with several chiefs he became a sworn brother, going through the peculiar ceremonies customary on such occasions. In 1883, he was ascending the Segama River to endeavour to verify the native reports of the existence of gold in the district when, landing on the bank, he shot at and wounded an elephant, and while following it up through the jungle, his repeating rifle caught in a rattan and went off, the bullet passing through his chest, causing almost immediate death. Hatton, before leaving England, had given promise of a distinguished scientific career, and his untimely fate was deeply mourned by his brother officers and a large circle of friends. An interesting memoir of him has been published by his father, Mr Joseph Hatton, and a summary of his journeys and those of Wittl, and other explorers in British North Borneo, appeared in the \"Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society and Monthly Record of Geography\" for March, 1888, being the substance of a paper read before the Society by Admiral R. C. Mayne, C.B., M.P. A memorial cross has been erected at Sandakan, by their brother officers, to the memory of Wittl, Hatton, de Fontaine and Sikh officers and privates who have lost their lives in the service of the Government.\n\nTo return for a moment to the matter of fault-finding, it would be ridiculous to maintain that no mistakes have been made in launching British North Borneo on its career as a British Dependency, but then I do not suppose that any single Colony of the Crown has been, or will be inaugurated without similar mistakes occurring, such, for instance, as the withholding money where money was needed and could have been profitably expended, and a too lavish expenditure in other and less important directions. Examples will occur to every reader who has studied our Colonial history. If we take the case of the Colony of the Straits Settlements, now one of our most prosperous Crown Colonies and which was founded by the East India Company, it will be seen that in 1826-7 the \"mistakes\" of the administration were on such a scale that there was an annual deficit of \u00a3100,000, and the presence of the Governor-General of India was called for to abolish useless offices and effect retrenchments throughout the service.\nThe British North Borneo Company possesses a valuable property, and one which is daily increasing in value, and if they continue to manage it with the care hitherto exhibited, and if, remembering that they are not yet quite out of the wood, they are careful to avoid, on the one hand, a too lavish expenditure and, on the other, an unwise parsimony, there cannot, I should say, be a doubt that a fair return will, at no very distant date, be made to them on the capital they have expended.\n\nAs for the country per se, I consider that its success is now assured, whether it remains under the rule of the Company or is received into the fellowship of bond fide Colonies of the Empire.\n\nIn bringing to a conclusion my brief account of the Territory, some notice of its suitability as a residence for Europeans may not be out of place, as bearing on the question of \"what are we to do with our boys?\"\n\nI have my own experience of seventeen years' service in Northern Borneo, and the authority of Dr. Walker, the able Medical Officer of the Government, for saying that in its general effect on the health of Europeans, the climate of British North Borneo, as a whole, compares not unfavourably with that of other tropical countries.\n\nThere is no particular \"unhealthy season,\" and Europeans who lead a temperate and active life have little to complain of, except the total absence of any cold season, to relieve the monotony of eternal summer. On the hills of the interior, no doubt, an almost perfect climate could be obtained.\n\nOne great drawback to life for Europeans in all tropical places is the fact that it is unwise to keep children out after they have attained the age of seven or eight years, but up to that age the climate appears to agree very well with them and they enjoy an immunity from measles, whooping cough and other infantile diseases. This enforced separation from wife and family is one of the greatest disadvantages in a career in the tropics.\n\nWe have not, unfortunately, had much experience as to how the climate of British North Borneo affects English ladies, but, judging from surrounding Colonies, I fear it will be found\nthat they cannot stand it quite so well as the men, owing, no doubt, to their not being able to lead such an active life and to their not having official and business matter to occupy their attention during the greater part of the day, as is the case with their husbands.\n\nOf course, if sufficient care is taken to select a swampy spot, charged with all the elements of fever and miasma, splendidly unhealthy localities can be found in North Borneo, a residence in which would prove fatal to the strongest constitution, and I have also pointed out that on clearing new ground for plantations fever almost inevitably occurs, but, as Dr. Walker has remarked, the sickness of the newly opened clearings does not last long when ordinary sanitary precautions are duly observed.\n\nAt present the only employers of Europeans are the Governing Company, who have a long list of applicants for appointments, the Tobacco Companies, and two Timber Companies. Nearly all the Tobacco Companies at present at work are of foreign nationality and, doubtless, would give the preference to Dutch and German managers and assistants. Until more English Companies are formed, I fear there will be no opening in British North Borneo for many young Englishmen not possessed of capital sufficient to start planting on their own account. It will be remembered that the trade in the natural products of the country is practically in the hands of the Chinese.\n\nAmong the other advantages of North Borneo is its entire freedom from the presence of the larger carnivora\u2014the tiger or the panther. Ashore, with the exception of a few poisonous snakes\u2014and during seventeen years' residence I have never heard of a fatal result from a bite\u2014there is no animal which will attack man, but this is far from being the case with the rivers and seas, which, in many places, abound in crocodiles and sharks. The crocodiles are the most dreaded animals, and are found in both fresh and salt water. Cases are not unknown of whole villages being compelled to remove to a distance, owing to the presence of a number of man-eating crocodiles in a particular bend of a river; this happened\nto the village of Sebongan on the Kinabatangan River, which has been quite abandoned.\n\nCrocodiles in time become very bold and will carry off people bathing on the steps of their houses over the water, and even take them bodily out of their canoes.\n\nAt an estate on the island of Daat, I had two men thus carried off out of their boats, at sea, after sunset, in both cases the mutilated bodies being subsequently recovered. The largest crocodile I have seen was one which was washed ashore on an island, dead, and which I found to measure within an inch of twenty feet.\n\nSome natives entertain the theory that a crocodile will not touch you if you are swimming or floating in the water and not holding on to anything, but this is a theory which I should not care to put practically to the test myself.\n\nThere is a native superstition in some parts of the West Coast, to the effect that the washing of a mosquito curtain in a stream is sure to excite the anger of the crocodiles and cause them to become dangerous. So implicit was the belief in this superstition, that the Brunei Government proclaimed it a punishable crime for any person to wash a mosquito curtain in a running stream.\n\nWhen that Government was succeeded by the Company, this proclamation fell into abeyance, but it unfortunately happened that a woman at Mempakul, availing herself of the laxity of the law in this matter, did actually wash her curtain in a creek, and that very night her husband was seized and carried off by a crocodile while on the steps of his house. Fortunately, an alarm was raised in time and his friends managed to rescue him, though badly wounded, but the belief in the superstition cannot but have been strengthened by the incident.\n\nSome of the aboriginal natives on the West Coast are keen sportsmen and, in the pursuit of deer and wild pig, employ a curious small dog, which they call assu, not making use of the Malay word for dog\u2014anjing. The term assu is that generally employed by the Javanese, from whose country possibly the dog may have been introduced into Borneo. In Brunei, dogs\nare called kuyok, a term said to be of Sumatran origin.\n\nOn the North and East there are large herds of wild cattle said to belong to two species, Bos Banteng and Bos Gaurus or Bos Sondaicus. In the vicinity of Kudat they afford excellent sport, a description of which has been given, in a number of the \"Borneo Herald,\" by Resident G. L. Davies, who, in addition to being a skilful manager of the aborigines, is a keen sportsman. The native name for them on the East Coast is Lissang or Seladang, and on the North, Tambadau. In some districts the water buffalo, Bubalus Buffetus, has run wild and affords sport.\n\nThe deer are of three kinds\u2014the Rusa or Sambur (Rusa Aristotelis), the Kijang or roe, and the Plandok, or mousedeer, the latter a delicately shaped little animal, smaller and lighter than the European hare. With the natives it is an emblem of cunning, and there are many short stories illustrating its supposed more than human intelligence. Wild pig, the Sus barbatus, a kind distinct from the Indian animal, and, I should say, less ferocious, is a pest all over Borneo, breaking down fences and destroying crops. The jungle is too universal and too thick to allow of pig-sticking from horseback, but good sport can be had, with a spear, on foot, if a good pack of native dogs is got together.\n\nIt is on the East Coast only that elephants and rhinoceroses, called Gajah and Badak respectively, are found. The elephant is the same as the Indian one and is fairly abundant; the rhinoceros is Rhinoceros sumatranus, and is not so frequently met with.\n\nThe elephant in Borneo is a timid animal and, therefore, difficult to come up with in the thick jungle. None have been shot by Europeans so far, but the natives, who can walk through the forest so much more quietly, sometimes shoot them, and dead tusks are also often brought in for sale.\n\nThe natives in the East Coast are very few in numbers and on neither coast is there any tribe of professional hunters, or shikaris, as in India and Ceylon, so that, although game abounds, there are not, at present, such facilities for Euro-\npeans desirous of engaging in sport as in the countries named.*\n\nA little Malay bear occurs in Borneo, but is not often met with, and is not a formidable animal.\n\nMy readers all know that Borneo is the home of the Orangutan or Man, as it is called by the natives. No better description of the animal could be desired than that given by Wallace in his \"Malay Archipelago.\" There is an excellent picture of a young one in the second volume of Dr. Guillebard's \"Cruise of the Marchesa.\" Another curious monkey, common in mangrove swamps, is the long-nosed ape, or Pakaian, which possesses a fleshy proboscis some three inches long. It is difficult to tame, and does not live long in captivity.\n\nAs in Sumatra, which Borneo much resembles in its fauna and flora, the peacock is absent, and its place taken by the Argus pheasant. Other handsome pheasants are the Fireback and the Butaer pheasants, the latter so named after Governor Sir Henry Bulwer, who took the first specimen home in 1874. These pheasants do not rise in the jungle and are, therefore, uninteresting to the Borneo sportsman. They are frequently trapped by the natives. There are many kinds of pigeons, which afford good sport. Snipe occur, but not plentifully. Curlew are numerous in some localities, but very wild. The small China quail are abundant on cleared spaces, as also is the painted plover, but cleared spaces in Borneo are somewhat few and far between. So much for sport in the new Colony.\n\nLet me conclude my paper by quoting the motto of the British North Borneo Company\u2014Pergo et perago\u2014I under-\n\n* Dr. Guillebard in his fascinating book, \"The Cruise of the Marchesa,\" states, that two English officers, both of them well-known sportsmen, devoted four months to big game shooting in British North Borneo and returned to Hongkong entirely unsuccessful. Dr. Guillebard was misinformed. The officers were not more than a week in the country on their way to Hongkong from Sarawak and Brunei, and did not devote their time to sport. Some other of the author's remarks concerning British North Borneo are somewhat incorrect and appear to have been based on information derived from a prejudiced source.\ntake a thing and go through with it. Dogged persistence has, so far, given the Territory a fair start on its way to prosperity, and the same perseverance will, in time, be assuredly rewarded by complete success.*\n\nW. H. TREACHER.\n\nP.S.\u2014I cannot close this article without expressing my great obligations to Mr. C. V. CREAGH, the present Governor of North Borneo, and to Mr. KINDERSLEY, the Secretary to the Company in London, for information which has been incorporated in these notes.\n\n* In 1889, the Company declared their first Dividend.\nJOURNAL OF A COLLECTING EXPEDITION TO THE MOUNTAIN OF BATANG PADANG, PERAK.\n\nBY\n\nL. WRAY, JR.\n\nOn Monday, the 6th of June, 1888, in accordance with instructions received, I left Taiping and proceeded to Telok Anson in the S.S. Kinta, and after seeing the baggage put on board a river-boat, and paying a visit to the Superintendent, Lower Perak, started at about 10 A.M. on the 7th for Tapa. At the half-way Resthouse I was met by a pony, and rode the rest of the way, reaching Tapa at 6.30 P.M.\n\nThe first four or five miles of road from Durian Sabatang passes through a nearly level country, which, judging from appearances, is eminently suited to the growth of padi or sugar-cane. The surface soil is rich and black, and, from what can be seen of it by inspecting the ditches, is of considerable depth. The upper part of the road near Tapa also passes through some fine land, but it is of quite a different character, being hilly and with a reddish yellow soil, light and quite sandy in places. Its quality is shown by the luxuriant growth of the various products which have been already planted, such as bananas, pepper, coco-nuts, Indian corn, &c. The latter can be planted many times in succession on the same land without manure. The rule in other parts of the State is that only one crop of this plant can be taken off even virgin forest land. So that it is evident there must be in the soil near Tapa considerable quantities of some inorganic substance which is essential to the growth of maize, and which is present in the soil of other parts of Perak only in minute quantities. The rock from which much of this soil is derived is a paleozoic schistose formation. There is also, of necessity, in\nthe soil a considerable admixture of the detritus of the granite formations of which the higher hills in Batang Padang, as in other parts of the State, are exclusively composed.\n\nMy party consisted of Mr. JELLAH, the Collector and Taxidermist of the Museum, a Kling called HARISON, whom I engaged to help in the collection of botanical specimens\u2014he having had three or four years' experience in the same work with the late Mr. KUNZLER\u2014a Malay called MAHRASIT, and a Malay \"boy\" who accompanied the late Mr. CAMERON on many of his explorations. The two former came up in the boat to Tapa with the baggage, and the two latter overland with me.\n\nThe boat arrived on the evening of the 11th, having been five days and-a-half coming a distance of about 20 miles as the crow flies, and on the 12th the baggage was moved into an empty shop in the village.\n\nThe great amount of impedimenta which it is necessary to take about with one on a collecting expedition, is a most serious drawback, when once the roads are left; but without it nothing can be done, and one might just as well stay at home. The worst part of it is, that the longer the trip lasts the more the baggage increases, instead of decreasing as it does on an ordinary occasion.\n\nToh BIAS, the Penghulu of Tapa, having a few days before I arrived married a new wife, could not be induced to leave his bride and go to Kuala Woh to look for Sakais to carry up the baggage to Gunong Batu Puteh, till the 14th, and then he went very unwillingly, and it was six days more before they began to arrive at Tapa, and then only ten men came. My brother, Mr. CECIL WRAY, then sent to Chendariang for some, but without success. The difficulty at that time in obtaining Sakais was that they were all illing and burning the jungle to plant rice for the next season's crop.\n\nDuring this enforced stay at Tapa, we went out every day collecting, and got 32 species of plants, 27 bird skins, and 3 mammals, besides many insects. I also took some photographs of some of the most typical of the Sakais.\n\nOn the 25th we were able to leave Tapa. We then had 22 Sakais, and the heavy baggage had to be put into two boats.\nand poled up the river to Kuala Woh, which place we reached after a walk of two-and-a-half hours, the track crossing the Batang Padang River twice. The whole way, wherever there was an opening in the jungle, we met with swarms of yellow butterflies. There must have been millions of them spread over the country. In places they were settled so thickly that the ground could not be seen. Some of these patches were two and three feet in diameter, and after driving away the butterflies the ground was quite yellow from pieces of their wings and dead ones. I have never seen such a sight before, almost any sweep of a butterfly net would catch a dozen or more. In the afternoon it came on to blow, just before a shower of rain, and all the butterflies at once took up positions on the undersides of the leaves of trees and plants and on the lee sides of the stems and roots. They were all of one species of Terias (Terias heinbe), and the Malays said that they had appeared about a week before we saw them. The whole of the next day's march they were quite as numerous, though we rose to an altitude of 1,130 feet above sea level, and they were also fairly common as high as the camp on Gunong Batu Puteh, which we reached on the day after.\n\nAlmost the whole of the land passed through, lying between Tapa and Kuala Woh, is of most excellent quality, a great deal of it being covered with bamboo forest. The bamboo seemed to belong to one species only, and is known by the Malay name of buluh telor.\n\nThe track passes through several Sakai clearings, one of which was in a most creditable state of cultivation. In another there was a typical Sakai house on very tall posts and with a considerable sized raised platform on a level with the lanti floor. There were also two Sakai graves near the track. They were raised like the Malay ones, and well taken care of. On them were the remains of fruit, flowers, Indian corn, coco-nut shells, bottle-gourds, roots, &c., which had been placed there probably as offerings to the dead.\n\nOne of the boats containing the baggage arrived at Kuala Woh at 5 p.m., having been eight hours on the way, and the other did not arrive till about 6 a.m. on the morning of the 26th, and at 9 a.m. on that day we started up the valley of the\nWoh with 21 Sakais as baggage carriers, but as they could take only a small part of it, I was forced to leave a great quantity at Kuala Woh in charge of Jellat and Harrison.\n\nFor the first few miles after leaving Kuala Woh, the jungle is almost exclusively bamboo. This land is undulating and of fine quality, but it ends at Changkat Berchiling, and then the track passes over some considerable hills and down into some valleys of which the soil is apparently good, but the slopes are steep and the Sakais have spoiled large portions of it by making ladangs.\n\nIt is as well to mention that there is no reason why the track should go over all these hills, except that native tracks always do go over the extreme tops of all hills which are anywhere near the line of route.\n\nWe reached the foot of Gunong Batu Puteh at 12.50 p.m., and camped for the night on the banks of the Woh. This place is 1,030 feet above sea level. The thermometer showed the following temperatures:\u2014at 3 p.m. 76\u00b0 F., and at 9 p.m. 72\u00b0; and at another visit on August 7th it showed at 2.15 p.m. 78\u00b0, at 5 p.m. 72\u00b0, and the next morning at 6 A.M. 68\u00b0.\n\nAt the foot of Batu Puteh, bamboo jungle again appears, and as this is at an elevation of 1,030 feet, it would be most valuable tea land if of sufficient extent, and looked at from the top of the rocky spur on Gunong Batu Puteh it seems to be of considerable area. In fact a track of bamboo jungle appears to run right up the valley of the Woh from its kuala to the camp, and possibly much farther.\n\nAt 7.40 A.M. on the 27th we left the camp on the Woh and reached the south-west spur of Gunong Batu Puteh at 12.50 p.m. This spot is 4,300 feet above sea level by aneroid, and is the place on which the previous expedition camped.\n\nHaving set all hands to work re-making the old huts, we climbed the rock on the top of the spur, but the driving clouds hid almost everything, and we had several sharp showers of rain while there. There were firs, myrtles and other mountain plants on the top and sides of the rock, and we found a few pretty ground orchids, one in particular with a bunch of large yellow flowers on a stalk two or three feet high, and a\nwhite flowered species which is common on the summit of Gunong Hijau in Larut.\n\nIt rained the greater part of the night, and as the hut was not weather-tight we got very wet, cold and miserable. The next morning, the 28th, was cloudy and cold, with frequent showers of rain, so that not much could be done in any direction. Eleven of the Sakais ran away early in the morning, leaving us with only 10 men. Four of these men, and a Malay I engaged at Tapai, were sent down to Kuala Woh to bring up some more baggage and the remaining six with the Malays began putting the house in order and trying to make it waterproof.\n\nI went out into the jungle, but only saw a few birds, which were all of the same species as those I previously collected on the Larut hills. In the afternoon, as it seemed to be clearing up, we ascended the rock again, which by the bye is a very stiff climb, and got a fleeting sight between the masses of drifting cloud of the real top of the mountain, which I estimated to be at least 2,000 feet higher than the top of the rock, which is 400 feet above the camp.\n\nFrom the rocky point, a splendid view is to be had, comprising almost the whole district of Batang Padang, and further in the distance Lower Perak, the Dindings and the Larut hills, Bujang Malaka and the hills to the north end off Kinta, and the summit of Batu Puteh itself hides the northern continuation of the main range.\n\nLooking down from this rock, there appears to be a nice piece of planting land at about 2,000 or 2,500 feet elevation. It does not seem steep, and there is a fine stream near it. It is situated in the valley formed by the spur on which I then was, on the one side, and the spur extending out in the direction of Gunong Brapit on the other. Most of the higher lands on Batu Puteh are very steep, although of fine quality as far as soil goes.\n\nOn the rocks near the summit, a quantity of a plant called *climbing* grows. This plant is much valued by the Malays, as it is supposed to act as a love-philter. It probably belongs to the *Ophioglossaceae*, and is a delicate rush-like plant about three inches high, having its spores in little tassels on the tops of the leaves.\nThe next day, the 29th, I took a photograph of the camp and Sakais, and took the measures of the latter, and at about noon Mr. C. Wray and all the Sakais left. The former had gone up with the intention of trying to make the ascent of the real summit of Batu Puteh, but the running away of the Sakais and the bad weather rendered this impossible.\n\nMahrasit and the \"boy\" went on with the house, but as there were only small palm leaves to be had at that elevation, it was not easy to make a weather-tight house, and if it had not been for the waterproof sheets kindly lent by the Commissioner, Perak Sikhs, I do not know how we should have got on, as the preservation of botanical and other specimens would have been almost impossible.\n\nOn the 30th six Sakais came up with more things, and on the 1st July, Jellah, Harison and 9 Sakais arrived. From this day to the 7th I have nothing particular to record. During that time the remainder of the baggage arrived, and I had drying stages put up for sunning plants, cut a track in a northerly direction across to another ridge, and collected birds, plants and insects. I had one of the Malay ground bird-traps set, first in one place, and then in another, but without any result. I had hopes that there might have been some representatives of the Indian hill pheasants, partridges and other ground birds on the Perak mountains, but if there are any we failed to catch them. The trap that I used consists of a small hedge made of branches and leaves with openings every few yards. On the ground across the openings are placed light wicker-work frames, which being trodden on, release bent sticks, which are attached to nooses laid on the frames and which the bent sticks draw up, so as to catch the legs of any birds which may tread on the frames. I also had an English trap, the \"Rutland,\" but it also caught nothing.\n\nI was fortunate enough, on the 6th, to shoot a fine example of the Black Eagle (Neophas malyensis) not far from camp.\n\nA pair of them were circling round the tops of some tall trees in the jungle, and I brought down the female. It measured 5 feet 10 inches across the wings, and its plumage was far darker than that of the two specimens I obtained last year on the Larut hills, but it is evidently of the same species. In its\nstomach I found two eggs and the half digested remains of a rat. The presence of the eggs shows it to have the same habit of robbing the nests of other birds as its Indian congener.\n\nOn the 8th I started at 8 A.M. with MAHRASIT, HARISON and a Saxai along the track to the North, which I have already mentioned, and then struck up the spur until we reached the top of the ridge joining the western peak with the main hill, and then followed that ridge, which runs in an easterly direction up and down hills until we came to the Batu Puteh itself, after which it was nearly all steady up-hill work. We had to cut a track the whole way through a particularly thick and thorny undergrowth, and it was 2 P.M. before we reached the extreme summit which the aneroid made 6,700 feet above sea level.\n\nI took up my gun in the hopes of getting some new birds, but only saw a few of one species, one specimen of which I shot. It is a Mesa of a species I have not seen before. Although I was disappointed in the matter of birds, still had I not taken the gun we should not, on that occasion, have reached the top of the hill, for a tiger had preceded us by a few hours, from the ridge right up to the very summit of the mountain and as may be imagined, there was not any anxiety amongst my companions to follow up the tracks, and they would most certainly have refused to do so if there had been no fire arms amongst the party, though for that matter, as I had no ball cartridges, it would have been no earthly use, but for obvious reasons I kept this fact to myself. Only two days before a tiger, probably the same one, was seen by HARISON not 200 yards from the camp in the middle of the day.\n\nIt seems strange to find tigers in such a place, for there appeared to be absolutely no game, not a single track of a pig, deer or any other animal having been seen by us during our stay on Gunong Batu Puteh.\n\nThe forest near the top of the mountain is most curious, consisting of twisted, stunted, wind-blown trees covered all over with a dense shaggy coating of moss, the ground, rocks, roots and dead trees being all hidden in the same manner. The moss is of all tints of greens, greenish-yellow, browns, red-browns and pinks, and is of many kinds. Some of them\nbeing extremely elegant, both in form and colouring. Such a luxuriant and beautiful growth of moss I had never seen before. In the scrub near the summit, Rhododendrons of many species are common, one of them growing into quite a large tree, but unfortunately no flowers of this plant could be found. Another species has the petals of the flower yellow and the tube orange-red, another white, and a pretty little round-leaved one has crimson flowers.\n\nAn orchid of considerable beauty grows not far from the top, and seems to be a very free flowerer. It is a purplish flowered Dendrobium. I also collected some plants of a very pretty Anectochilus; it resembles A. setaceus very closely, but the leaves instead of being dark red-brown veined with yellow, are rather pale velvety green, with pure white veining. Unfortunately it was not in flower, so I had to take the plants, which when planted in baskets may, if they live, yield flowers, and the species may ultimately be determined. In all we collected over 50 botanical specimens, and had there been time and some more men to carry them we might have got many more.\n\nIt was a beautifully fine day, but the distance, as is so often the case in dry, hot weather, was rather hazy. The view, however, from the summit was splendid, but it is quite impossible to describe it, and owing to want of time, I could not make any sketches. To the East, looking down into Pahang, there is nothing to be seen in the way of mountains, as far as the eye could reach. The country seems to consist of large broad valleys, with a few ranges of small hills. On these hills we could see many Sakai clearings as well as clearings in the valleys, which are probably Malay. The thickness of the range at this point is very little. I should not think it can be more than eight miles. To the South no large hills are visible for many miles, but to the North the hill country expands and broadens out, and peak upon peak can be made out stretching away into the far distance.\n\nGunong Batu Puteh is, therefore, the end of the range of higher hills going southwards, though the range again rises into some lofty peaks in Slim.\nHaving collected all the plants we could carry, we returned, reached the camp again at 6 P.M., having been 10 hours on the tramp.\n\nThe next day, the 9th, I spent in putting the previous day's collection of plants into paper, and on the 10th I took three photographs from the rocky ridge connecting the spur with the main mountains\u2014one of the rocks which form the top of the spur, one of the summit of Batu Puteh, and one of the hills looking over in the direction of Gunong Bujang Malaka.\n\nThe next day I looked over the dried plants and put all those which were dry into Chinese paper, and sent them down to Tapa on the 12th. Up to that time I had collected 241 species of plants and 61 specimens of birds. One serious drawback to the place was the great quantity of blow-flies, which, unless great care was taken, spoiled all the bird-skins, as well as woollen clothes, blankets, food, &c. The strange thing about these flies is the question where they can be bred in the jungle, for as I have already noticed, there is such a great scarcity of animal life, and consequently there can be but little decomposing matter for them to breed in.\n\nWoollen things are evidently taken by them for the fur of animals, hence dead animals are clearly the natural food of the larvae of these flies. Last year, near the Resident's Cottage, I shot a krekah monkey, and hung it up to a tree till I returned, which was in about one hour's time, when it was flecked all over with white eggs; but the blow-flies are not anything like so numerous on the Larut hills as they are on those of Batang Padang, probably because they are lower. The lowest altitude at which they are met with seem to be 3,600 feet, but they are not abundant till 4,000 feet is reached.\n\nOn the 15th I went down the hill (900 feet by aneroid) and fixed on a site for a new camp, and set the men to work felling the jungle. This place seemed to be more frequented by birds than the higher and bleaker camp, which was not at all a good collecting station for birds, and by that time I had about exhausted all the plants that were in fruit or flower near it. A good number of the trees felled were either in fruit or flower and I was able to add them to my collection.\nOn the top of one tree was a rather pretty *Vanda* with red flowers spotted with a darker shade of the same colour and on another was a wild raspberry in full fruit. A tree top is certainly one of the last places on which one would have looked for raspberries.\n\nOn the 17th sixteen Sakais came up to carry my things down to Tapa, and I arranged with them to get attaps and finish felling the jungle on the new site on the 18th, on the morning of which day I went down with them, and then up again to the camp and from there to the rock on the top of the spur and afterwards to the gorge to the North of the camp to collect orchids and ferns to take down for the Resident. Then packed them up in baskets and also packed up the bird-skins and put the day's collection of botanical specimens in paper, cleaned guns, and made other preparations for leaving on the morrow.\n\nUp to that time 77 birds and 320 species of plants had been collected, and the object of going down to Tapa was to properly dry and pack away this large collection, and free the pressing paper, so as to be able to use it again.\n\nI had been away from Tapa about a month, and I must say it had been anything but a pleasant time; for the hut was of the leakiest, draughtiest and most uncomfortable description for the bleak climate at that altitude, it being made of rattan and small palm leaves the only material available within a distance of three or four miles. The temperature ranged from 56\u00b0 to 68\u00b0 in the house, and the wind, rain and mist drifted right through it.\n\nMost of my party were out of sorts, and I rather hesitated as to leaving, but transport is so difficult to get that I decided to risk it. Jellah had ague, Mahrasji nettle-rash and swollen legs and feet, Harison bad legs, and the \"boy\" a very much inflamed and swollen eye. I gave a supply of medicine to Jellah, and the boy and Harison were doctored at Tapa.\n\nWhile at the upper camp I had an attack of what is known as hill diarrhoea, a disease often met with at the Himalayan hill stations of Simla and Nymee Tal, but I do not think that it has been recorded in the Malay Peninsula before.\nAt about 8 A.M. on the 19th I left the camp with Harison, the \"boy\" and 18 Sakais, and reached Kuala Woh at 2 P.M. The Sakais were too tired to go on any farther that day, and so I forded the Woh and went with the \"boy\" only to Breumen, and after much trouble got a boat and reached Tapa at 7 P.M.\n\nThe exposures of rock along the banks of the Batang Padang River from Kuala Woh to Tapa are all, as far as I saw, of the ancient stratified series. The beds are much twisted, contorted and upheaved, in places the strata being nearly vertical.\n\nOverlying these rocks are usually thick beds of river sands, similar to that on which the village of Tapa stands. In places these beds rise to 30 feet above the level of the river.\n\nThe rock exposures on the Woh are all apparently granitic. The granite there and on Gunong Batu Puteh from base to extreme summit is a coarse grained rock, with large white felspar crystals and largely mixed with dull blue quartz. The sand in the streams derived from this rock is very characteristic, being quite blueish in appearance. The subsoil formed by its decomposition is also much redder than that formed by the granite of the Larut hills. The surface soil both there and in other parts of Perak seems to depend, in a great measure, as regards its vegetable constituents or humus, on the presence or absence of white ants (termites). When the height at which these insects cease to thrive is passed on the hills, a very marked difference in the colour and depth of the surface soil is noticeable, and the same thing is to be seen in the low country in swampy land which is unsuited to their existence.\n\nThat the soil is really any poorer for its loss of vegetable matter is not at all certain, for the inorganic constituents of the humus are still present, though they have been altered by passing through an animal organism. This may account for the fertility of some of the apparently very poor soils to be seen in some parts of the State.\n\nNothing particular happened during the walk down from Gunong Batu Puteh beyond the usual experiences of a long jungle tramp, except that near Kuala Woh I saw in the middle of the track just in front of me the head of a black cobra looking out from under a root, a knock on the neck with my walking stick rendering it powerless. I got it out of its hole, and\nwhile the \"boy\" way looking for a piece of jungle root to carry it by, another smaller one glided out of the same hole, passed me and took to the river before I had time to stop it.\n\nThe first one being a fine large specimen and quite uninjured, I took it to Tapa and put it into spirits. These black cobras are fairly common in Batang Padang, but are very scarce in other parts of Perak, so scarce that I had never seen any till I went there.\n\nI have called it a cobra, but it is not quite certain that it is referable to the genus *Naga*. Possibly it may be a black variety of the *Homadryas*, but if so it must either not attain a large size, or it must quite change its livery as it grows older; for I was informed that it is unknown of a larger size than between 5 and 6 feet.\n\nThe next day, the 26th, the Sakais brought on the baggage from Kuala Woh, and I had the plants unpacked and put out into the sun to dry as soon as possible. They seemed in good condition, and there was no sign of their having heated, as half-dried botanical specimens have a very unpleasant way of doing, when packed up for long in this climate. I then went to work on the live plants, which I brought down with me, and by the next day they, together with a quantity more that Mr. C. Wray had collected, were all planted and packed up and sent down the river in a boat to Telok Anson.\n\nMr. C. Wray and I went on the 22nd to see the new mine at Chendariang. We left at between 7 and 8 A.M., and reached Naga Bharu at 11 A.M., and from there went to the Sri Muka mines. There are two very distinct varieties of tin-sand obtained from these mines. The one being black, fine-grained and bright-looking; while the other is reddish, brown, or white and very coarse-grained, varying from pieces the size of the tip of the little finger to masses 100 or so pounds in weight.\n\nI think it may safely be predicted that when *tampan* workings are carried on, on the hills near Sri Muka, that some lodes of considerable size and richness will be discovered; for undoubtedly these large blocks of tin ore must have come from such lodes, and probably at no very great distance from their present resting place. The fine-grained black tin-sand, I imagine, has been derived either from another formation, or,\nmore probably, it may have been disseminated through the body of the rock, and the pale-coloured coarse-grained sand and blocks of ore from lodes running through the same formation.\n\nI bought one fine large lump of tin ore besides some smaller ones for the Museum, and engaged a Chinese cooly to carry them to Tapa.\n\nThe mine which is turning out so well, is that which formerly belonged to the Shanghai Company, and is within a hundred yards of the Manager's old house. We saw a large quantity of tin-sand and also a good many slabs of tin, and we were informed that the owners estimated the sand then raised would yield 70 bharas of tin.\n\nThere seems every reason to suppose that there is a very large extent of land equally as good as this piece has turned out to be, and that this valley will take many years to work out, the area being quite as large as the Larut tin mining districts of Tupai, Taiping and Kamunting.\n\nThe only drawback to the place is the transport. At the time I was there, the river was so low that boats could not go up it, and the road to Tapa was little more than begun.\n\nIn consequence of this, the shops were all shut up, as they had nothing left to sell, and the chief Towkay told us he only had 30 bags of rice left, and that he had 300 coolies to feed, and in a few days if the drought continued he would have to begin carrying rice from Tapa, a distance of between 8 and 9 miles over about as vile a track as can well be imagined. The usual price of rice is from 3\u00bd to 4 gantangs per dollar, but at the time I am speaking of, it was not to be had cheaper than 3 gantangs.\n\nThe opening up of this district depends entirely on the completion of the cart-road from Tapa, for at all times the Chendariang River is very difficult to navigate, and in times of drought it is shut up altogether. It usually takes a cargo boat 20 days to go from Telok Anson to Chendariang, a distance by road (when made) of only twenty-nine miles. The high price of provisions, consequent on this expensive transport, is a serious tax on the miners, and it speaks a great deal for the extreme richness of the land, that any mining can be carried\non with profit. Though at the same time it is evident that only the best of the land can be now worked, and that therefore the State is the loser of a great deal of revenue, as land which has had all the best parts of it worked out will not pay to re-open and will probably be unworked for many years to come.\n\nWith the exception of the first two miles, which has in great part a laterite subsoil, lithologically identical with the exposure on the road to Kamunting near Drummond's house, the land the whole way along the track from Tapa to Chendariang is of splendid quality and admirably suited for any low country cultivation. A great part of this land is covered with forest (rimba), and only a small part with bluak. The Chendariang valley above Naga Bharu is well suited to wet padi cultivation, and there are now in existence some considerable bendangs, which as there is an abundant supply of water and level land, may be enlarged to a great extent without much trouble.\n\nBefore leaving the mines, I looked over the heaps of mining metal, and found a few interesting mineralogical specimens, and on returning collected a good many botanical specimens. At one place along the road the telegraph line was hanging near the ground and touching a small sapling and at about 60 feet distance it was attached to an insulator fastened to the trunk of a tree. Running up the sapling and along the wire to the distant tree, were hundreds of red-ants (keringa) carrying green caterpillars each about one inch long; six or eight ants to one caterpillar. The caterpillars were very numerous, and all of one species.\n\nOn the 23rd I was all day shifting plants that were dry into Chinese paper and tying them up ready to pack up in boxes.\n\nI did not collect any more plants, as my object was to get as large a stock of empty paper to take up the hill again as possible, because the hill plants are more likely to be unknown than those of the plains.\n\nFrom this date to the 2nd of August, I continued drying botanical specimens and transferring them into Chinese paper when dry enough, and dried and packed up the bird-skins.\nOn the 3rd August I sent off the baggage up the river from Tapa in a boat, and then followed overland to Kuala Woh. On the road near Broumen I collected flowering specimens of the bamboo which forms the greater part of the bamboo forests. It goes by the native name of buluh telor, and has a stem usually striped with pale greenish white of 24 inches or so in diameter, and forty to sixty feet long.\n\nI reached Woh at about 4 p.m., and the boat half-an-hour afterwards. On arrival I was greatly disappointed to find that though Toh Bias had assured me there were Sakais at Kuala Woh awaiting me, not one man was to be found. I was told that Toh Bias had neither been there himself to collect them, nor had he sent any one else to do so. It was not till Sunday, the 7th, that enough Sakais were got together to carry up the baggage. During these three days I collected plants and visited some of the Sakai ladangs near Woh.\n\nThe parcelling out of the baggage to the Sakais is always a work of time. They all, of course, look out for the lightest packages and you find them going off and leaving a good half of it behind. Then comes a re-arrangement and perhaps a second and even a third before it is equally divided, but afterwards there is no more trouble, each man keeping to his own load. I had one little box of shot which took some of the men in in a most ridiculous manner. They all thought it a charming little package until they came to try its weight.\n\nAt 9.45 on the morning of the 7th, having distributed the baggage, we left Kuala Woh and reached the camp at Ulu Woh at 12.30 p.m., and on the following morning at 7.30 a.m. started again and passed the new camp on Batu Puteh at 10 a.m., and reached the higher one at noon.\n\nOn the morning of the 9th we found that eleven of the fifteen Sakais had left during the night, so that we only had four left to help carrying the baggage up to the top of the hill. We left the camp at 8 a.m., and halted at noon at a cave I had noticed on my first visit, and which seemed likely to form a shelter from the rain. It was not exactly a cave, but a cavity formed by one huge rock lying on and supported on either side by two other masses of rock. The space beneath it was about 30 feet long by 10 feet wide, and from\n5 feet high on one side to about one foot on the other. Having set the men to work to cut wood to make a lante floor and a wall of sticks and leaves to keep out some of the wind, we went on up to the summit, but it was so thick and cloudy that nothing could be seen. However, we collected a quantity of plants and returned to the cave at a quarter past three and shortly afterwards it began to rain, and continued raining nearly the whole of the time we were up there.\n\nI have before mentioned that the fresh tracks of a tiger were seen on the first ascent of this hill and on the second they were again seen. In fact the tiger had been right through the cave in which we camped. The presence of fresh marks on two occasions with an interval of a month between them seems to show that the higher hills of Perak are regularly inhabited by tigers. I have previously often seen tracks on the Larut hills, but then they are more than two thousand feet lower. The last time I was at the Resident's Cottage I noticed that the same habit which is common amongst domestic cats, of eating grass as an emetic, is also in vogue amongst the larger felidae; but as grass was not at hand, rattan leaves had been eaten instead, and apparently with equally satisfactory results as regards the patient.\n\nA fact which does not seem to be in conformity with the generally received ideas of the habits of the gibbons, is that on both of my ascents of the summit of Gunong Batu Puteh I heard the cries of siamangs at between 6 and 7,000 feet altitude. One would have thought that the climate was too cold and bleak for such delicate animals, but it appears that they can and do voluntarily stand a considerable degree of cold without any inconvenience. It is, therefore, probable that want of exercise and proper food has been the real difficulty in the way of sending them to Europe, and not the climate.\n\nAt the higher camp they were to be heard nearly every day, and on one occasion they were making a great noise in the middle of the night, which, by the bye, was a moonless one. On the other hand the whole time I afterwards stayed at the lower camp I never heard them once.\n\nIn the evening the wind rose and howled through the cave, making us all shiver again with the cold.\nThe Sakais made a large fire in the end of the cave opposite to that from which the wind came, and they and the King sat shivering and groaning round it all night and the rest of us had very little sleep, for besides the cold and wet, the floor was slanting and made of the most crooked, windblown and uncomfortable pieces of wood that could be well imagined.\n\nWhen it began to get light on the morning of the 10th the wind and mist were still drifting through the cave, everything inside it was glistening with dew-like drops of water, and the rain was still falling outside. Then that most trying of all trying jungle operations had to be gone through\u2014that is, getting out of bed and into one's cold sopping wet clothes of the day before.\n\nAt about 8 A.M. we again went to the summit and stayed there about an hour and a-half, but instead of clearing, the fog got thicker and the rain heavier and so we returned to the cave and packed up the plants and the other things and then as the rain was all finished proceeded down the hill to the camp, the rain continuing heavily the whole way.\n\nThe summit, looked at from Tapa, gives the impression that it is rounded in outline and of considerable area, but in reality it is a sharp, thin ridge running in a N.N.E. & S.S.W. westerly direction, and if viewed from either of these directions it would probably present a pointed, conical appearance.\n\nThe following temperatures were taken at the cave\u201412.30 P.M. 58\u00b0; 3.15 P.M. 57\u00b0; 6 P.M. 56\u00b0; 7 A.M. 55\u00b0; 9.30 A.M. 56\u00b0.\n\nI am sorry I had no minimum thermometer with me, as it must have gone down in the night several degrees lower than the reading here recorded. I should think that on the grass on the summit, during clear calm starlight nights, the freezing point must sometimes be reached.\n\nOn our arrival at the camp we found letters containing the sad news of Mr Evans' death from cholera at Tapa on the 7th and in consequence Mr C. Wray who had joined me at Kuala Woh on the 6th and made the ascent of Batu Puteh in the hopes of getting a view, went straight on down the hill to the camp on the Woh. Mr Evans arrived in Tapa on the day I left, and I saw him for a few minutes at the Rest House. Almost all those who have been engaged in the work I have been\ndoing, have died within the last nine months. That is, Messrs. Scortechini, Kunstler, Cameron, and now Mr. Evans.\n\nI found when I came to put the collection of plants into paper, that they numbered 34 species, so that although owing to the state of the weather we were not able to make any topographical notes, the number of plants compensated, in a measure, for the discomforts of the trip.\n\nIn the evening Harison was taken ill with diarrhoea, and was writhing and groaning with violent pains in the stomach, which we thought might be the beginning of an attack of cholera, but it fortunately passed off after one dose of chlorodyne and brandy, which quieted him and sent him off to sleep.\n\nSix Sakais had come up in the afternoon with the remainder of the things, which they left at the lower camp, and on the 11th they carried down the baggage from the upper camp, and we all moved down in the afternoon. Unfortunately Jellah had an attack of fever, and Mahrasit was laid up with swollen feet and legs, thus reducing the workers by two. Quite close to the house was a tall tree which had been partly cut through, but had not fallen, so I got the Sakais to go on cutting it, as the cut had been begun so high up the stem that my remaining Malay would not attempt it, for it required the agility of a monkey to climb down from the stage to get clear of the tree when falling. The wood was very tough and hard and it was not till about 8 o'clock that it came crashing down. For about an hour or so the Sakais had to work by the light of dammars.\n\nNext morning (12th) I found it was a species of oak, and obtained fruiting specimens of it and of three other trees knocked down by it. I also collected 21 other species of plants, and caught a butterfly, a new species of the genus Loxura, besides several other insects. That rare and beautiful butterfly Clerome fannula seemed to be quite common, and also a Delias nearly allied to D. parthenope. The latter extends up to the summit and was the only butterfly I noticed there. Clerome fannula I find to be a very variable species, the variation being present in both sexes. The extremes of variation I took at first to be distinct species, but a larger series of specimens showed that there were intermediate, connecting links, joining the two.\nI found that a considerable portion of the flora of the higher mountains was continued down to quite moderate altitudes, but whereas on the summits of the hills it grows in the ground, lower down it grows on the tops of tall trees. In telling the jungle for the lower camp many rhododendrons, epiphytes, myrtles and other plants which occur on the extreme summits of the hills were found. This seems to show that temperature is not so essential to their growth as free exposure to the sunlight and air, and that epiphytism may be only an acquired habit in many and perhaps in all plants.\n\nOn the 13th and 14th the house and drying stages for sunning the botanical specimens were finished, and collecting was carried on. I obtained a snake that I have not seen before, in the attaps of the house, with a sharp dorsal ridge and light red eyes, also a tree frog of the same species as the one I collected on the Larut hills last year (Phrymella pulchra, Blyth). These little creatures live in holes in trees, and at night make the whole jungle of the hills resound with their pretty flute-like notes. They are in appearance something like little brown bladder with four legs, the head forming only a slight projection between the front legs. They are very difficult to collect, as they refuse to quit their holes, which by the way are usually high up in the trees, and it was not till I hit on a method of expelling them that I was certain as to what produced the nightly chorus of musical notes. This method is to climb up the tree and fill the hole with water, then drop in some salt. In a minute or two out hops the little frog, and if it is well washed in fresh water it is none the worse for its saline bath, as I have proved by keeping several of them alive for some weeks afterwards to watch their habits. At the higher camp on Brum Patch they are very scarce, apparently it is the top of the zone inhabited by them and the bottom seems to be reached at a little below 3,000 feet, so that it may be said that their range is from slightly below 3,000 feet to a little above 1,000 feet. Higher up the hills their place is taken by a species with a loud deep, low-pitched booming but musical note, and lower down by a species with a note resembling that of the common crow, repeated twice. The lower limits of this\nspecies I have not ascertained but I cannot recall hearing it below 2,000 feet. These heights hold good both here and on the Larut Hills and, therefore, I presume generally in this part of the Peninsula, and as these zones seem to be much more constant than those formed by various plants, in the absence of an aneroid, the \"frog barometer\" may be very advantageously employed in the rough estimation of altitudes.\n\nI captured an extremely beautiful leaf-like grasshopper. It was pale emerald green with claret edging to the wings and claret legs and cheeks. On the body and wings were rows of dark centred blue spots and the feet were bright yellow. It measured 4\u00bd inches in length and had black and white banded antennae, 8 inches long. It was one of the most elegantly coloured insects that could be imagined, but the colouring is almost certain to fade in drying, as it unfortunately nearly always does in this class of insect.\n\nI caught a specimen of a rare Mycalesis and a very handsome Elymnias; an almost perfect mimic of the common Euptera midamus. I watched it for some time flying about, but fancying it a common insect left it alone. Afterwards when it was settled I examined it more closely thinking it might be the rarer E mulcher which is distinguished by having no marginal row of white spots on the posterior wings, but the row of spots was there; then I noticed that the margins of these wings were serrated, which being a character absent in the Daniedrae, I at once caught it and found it to be an Elymnias. Two other rare butterflies were also obtained, a Stiboges nymphidus and a species of the genus Prioneris. The latter being almost certainly a new insect.\n\nFrom the 15th to the 23rd we continued collecting as well as possible, but owing to the rain we could not go out much, and the rain also caused much trouble in our attempts to dry the botanical specimens. All hands being continually at work putting them out in the sun and bringing them in again to escape the frequent showers of rain.\n\nAmongst other plants that were collected during this time was a singular anomalous tree, which had long, flexible, leafless branches on the lower part of the stem.\nThese branches reached down to the earth and, for a great part of their length were buried and cut off sight but the extreme ends stood up nearly vertically from the ground at perhaps 6 or 7 feet from the tree and bore pretty sweet-scented, cream coloured flowers and bunches of dark velvety brown coloured fruit. The object of such an arrangement and the cause which have led to it form a scientific puzzle well worthy of solution.\n\nOn the 21st I went up to the higher camp, and from there to the rock on the top of the spur, and found a very handsome Rhododendron in flower; it was quite a small bush and was growing on a piece of moss-covered rock. The flowers, which were nearly two inches across, were borne in large bunches and were of a colour resembling the yellow Allamanda commonly grown in the gardens in the Straits. I brought down the root and planted it in a basket and I also brought down young plants of 5 or 6 other species, some of which I had previously planted in baskets while living at the higher camp. Near the place where the Rhododendron was growing were three roots of a large and pretty fern, the fronds were about sixteen feet long and the stem was covered with a bluish bloom. The spores were contained in small oval capsules, which opened by a single slit along their greater diameter. These were the only three plants of this beautiful fern I had then seen, though on the hills near Ulu Batang Padang I afterwards saw others.\n\nOn the way down while going after a monkey I came upon a large fir tree of a different species to that which is so common on the summit. It had light, graceful, feathery branches and the leaves were extremely minute. In appearance it is much like the Casuarina that is so much grown in Penang. Unfortunately, it was not in fruit, nor did a prolonged search beneath it reward us with any old cones.\n\nI had the bird trap set again, but without success. Among other birds shot during this time was a large and handsome red-headed trogon. This may be Harpactes erythrocephalus, Gould, which is recorded from the hills of Eastern Bengal, the Himalayas and the hills of Tenasserim, but has not been met with in the Malay Peninsula as yet. Another was a broad-bill, closely allied to, but apparently distinct from, Corydon\nsumatranus, Kafl., also a blue-backed flycatcher, a red and a green-backed, yellow-crested woodpecker. Most of these will, I hope, turn out to be either new or at least new to the Peninsula. I also succeeded in catching two more of the little tree frogs I have already mentioned, and three of a much larger frog which, however, has nearly the same habits and vocal powers. It is of a very rugged appearance and of a chocolate colour with cherry red bands and feet and beneath it is mottled with black and white.\n\nIt has been identified provisionally by Dr. A. G\u00fcnther as Polypedates leprosus. When on the trunk of a tree it is quite invisible, from its exact resemblance both in colour and texture to a piece of reddish brown bark, and is a very good example of mimicry of an inanimate object. This frog was spawning, and last year near the Resident's Cottage on the Larut Hills, in the month of September, I found a quantity of its tadpoles. The spawn is a jelly-like mass deposited just above the water line on the wooden sides of the hole.\n\nThere is on Batu Puteh a rather pretty snail. The shell is light brown with a white stripe running round it, bordered on each side by a band of green. It appears to belong to the Helicidae and in a full grown specimen measures nearly 2 inches in diameter. It is evidently nearly allied to the large Helix which occurs on the higher parts of the Larut Hills. Near the extreme summit of Batu Puteh I found a snail of a species I have not seen before.\n\nAt this time I suffered a good deal from the bites of a minute mite, probably a Tetranychus, which produced inflamed lumps all over me, each lump lasting for several days and itching and smarting intolerably, particularly at nights. This insect has much the same effect as the well known English \"harvest bug\" which is also a Tetranychus. Ticks of both the large and small variety were unpleasantly abundant in the jungle near the camp, but fortunately leeches were seldom met with.\n\nOn the 22nd in climbing up out of a steep rocky ravine, with a gun in one hand and some fungus I had just been collecting in the other, I slipped and fell, giving my back a strain which kept me in bed for the next two days and hurt more or less for over a month afterwards.\nThe 23rd and 24th were both very wet days, and on the latter it hardly stopped raining at all, so that not much could be done; but I had some trees cut down to get a specimen of the gigantic rattan known by the Malay name of *rotan kumbah*.\n\nIt was about 200 feet in length and at the thickest part of the cane, which is near the top it measured 5 inches in diameter. Near the root, however, the cane only measured $\\frac{3}{4}$ of an inch. The leaves were 24 feet in length and armed with most formidable hooked thorns. The fruit is borne on the terminal shoot and forms a tassell-shaped bunch some 8 or 10 feet in length. From what I have seen of this rattan I believe it only fruits once and then dies. Four of the trees that were felled were either in fruit or flower so that the work was not thrown away. We also collected a rather handsome bird, with a bright orange-vermilion bill. It appears to be a species of the genus *Rhinocichla*. In the evening of the 24th we got a second specimen of the large red-headed trogon.\n\nThe weather from the 25th to the 31st continued very wet and cold, with the exception of one day, the 26th; on the preceding evening the thermometer went down to 62\u00b0 in the house at about 8 p.m., the coldest I saw at the lower camp. The highest temperature I noticed while there was 78\u00b0. The climate, therefore, corresponds very closely with that of Maxwell's Hill in Larut.\n\nI had a great many trees felled during this period and preserved specimens of all that were either in fruit or flower. By this means I secured specimens of some of the larger trees, which, of course, it is hopeless to get in any other way. Had I had a telescope or a binocular this work would have been much easier. As it was many of the trees when felled were found to have neither fruit nor flower. However on some of these I found epiphytes, parasites and creepers of interest. Among the parasites were two plants closely allied to the English mistletoe, one being an almost exact resemblance of it but slightly smaller, the other had rather rounder leaves.\n\nIn the jungle near the camp I found a fine fir tree. It was fully one hundred feet in height and had a trunk of between 4 and 5 feet in diameter. From what I could see of it I fancy it is a different variety to that I mentioned a short time ago, but\nagain a careful search under it gave no results in the shape of cones.\n\nI found 4 or 5 species of *Burmannia* on Batu Puteh, at different elevations. They are small, mostly leafless plants, often parasitical on the roots of other plants. *Burmannia longiflora* is very plentiful with pretty pale blush flowers. This species is also found on the mountains of Borneo, Ambonina, New Guinea and on Mount Ophir in Malacca. The other species are very much smaller and require diligent searching amongst the dead leaves before they are discoverable. The flower of one was primrose yellow, another dull crimson, one purple and another pale straw colour. All these latter are delicate, fragile, semitransparent little plants.\n\nOn the 27th I sent down two men loaded with bundles of dried plants and I sent letters asking for coolies to take all the baggage down to Tapa on the 3rd or 4th of September. By which time I considered we ought to have about exhausted the place. Early on the mornings of the 26th and 27th a tiger was heard quite close to the camp making that peculiar noise which cannot be properly described as growling. I must say it would have been far pleasanter if the tigers had not kept hanging round our camps in the way they did.\n\nSome way below the camp I caught three specimens of a very handsome butterfly. It was a species of the genus *Thaumantis*. Above, it is various shades of rich brown with a diagonal band of azure blue on each fore wing. This lovely insect only frequents the forest of the higher hills as far as my observation goes, and like all the members of the genus is very difficult to catch, because the undersides of the wings are, although when examined closely of singular beauty, still when seen from a little distance so like the tints of a dead leaf that it is usually not seen till with a flash of brilliant blue light it flies off perhaps from almost under your feet. There is no doubt that insects are well aware of the colour on which they will be least exposed to the observation and attacks of enemies. This *Thaumantis* always settles on dead leaves or in a position when it may be mistaken for one. There is a moth, very common in the jungle near the lower camp on Batu Puteh, which is of a pale tawny colour and it is perfectly astonishing\nhow it always alights on a leaf of its exact shade of colour. Although so plentiful I had great difficulty in capturing a few specimens from this habit of rendering itself invisible.\n\nOn the 1st and 2nd of September tree felling was continued, and I obtained 41 varieties of plants, a considerable portion of them being large trees. Growing as a creeper on one of the trees was a very pretty fruited *Chilocarpus*. The fruit of which was of a bright orange colour. The effect of the brilliantly coloured fruit amongst the shiny dark green foliage was very striking and was increased by the yellow flowers and bright red terminal buds to the shoots. These terminal buds are very curious. The colour is caused by the buds, being enclosed in a semitransparent cap of bright red resin. These caps may be detached and are found to be slightly flexible, but at the same time so brittle as to be easily crushed up into powder. They take the form, in a great measure, of the enclosed buds, which the flexibility of the material under continued pressure renders possible.\n\nA plant which deserves to be grown is a small tree with large velvety green leaves, bright crimson beneath. I saw one tree here and several more afterwards in the valley of the Telum. The flowers though inconspicuous are very sweet scented, smelling like sandal-wood. This tree if it would grow in the lowlands would be a great addition to the ornamental trees now grown in the Straits and though more brilliant, would have much the same effect as the copper-beach has in a group of ornamental trees in an English garden.\n\nOf other plants that I met with on Batu Puteh which would repay cultivation I may mention six or seven species of *Didymocarpus* and allied genera, with flowers ranging in colour from white to primrose yellow, and from that to shades of violet and deep claret. Some of the leaves being also very ornamental, both in colour and form. The various species of *Eschynanthus* with their rich red flowers and almost equally beautiful bell-like calyxes deserve far more attention than they receive in the Straits; and some of the *Sonerilus* with quaintly white spotted leaves, from the lower hills, are also worth cultivation.\nOf birds we got a specimen of a fine large green woodpecker and another woodpecker of large size that I have not seen before, a handsome-plumaged, yellow-breasted trogon (*Harpactes oreskios*) and a species I do not know, besides three specimens of the pretty little yellow-crested sultan tit. This bird does not seem to differ from that met with in the low country. While hunting in the undergrowth for one of these birds I was stung on the face and hand by one of those handsomely coloured hairy caterpillars. The effect is like receiving several stings from a wasp, and for a few hours is extremely painful. The stinging is apparently produced in the same way as in the common stinging nettle, that is to say, the hairs are hollow and have near their bases enlargements containing a poisonous fluid which is expelled from the points, when the hairs enter the flesh. Other caterpillars have stinging powers, but then the irritation is mechanical and is produced by the hair being barbed and breaking off into the flesh. The large scarlet caterpillar met with in the jungle of the low country and much dreaded by the natives is of this latter class. The Malayan stinging nettle known as *jelatang*, I have examined under the microscope, and it stings in the same way as its English representative.\n\nWhile writing this I was interrupted by JELLAH, who had just found a large dark metallic green scorpion (*Buthus spiniger*) in his bed. A chase ensued with the aid of lanterns, but the disagreeable bed fellow escaped through the lanti floor of the house.\n\nOn the third we got one new bird, and on the fourth I shot two small brown barbets which I have not seen up so high on the hills before. On the 5th another new bird was shot besides a male yellow trogon and several others.\n\nSome more trees were felled, among them being a fine oak with very large acorns. I shot down a specimen of the fir tree I have previously mentioned and found it to be, as I thought, another species. There are, therefore, three species on Batu Puteh and a fourth on the Larut Hills (*Dammara alba*), but this latter has large broad leaves unlike those on the main range.\n\nSeven Sakais from Cheroh came up to carry down baggage, so I packed up things that were not wanted, as it seemed un-\nCOLLECTING EXPEDITION TO BATANG PADANG.\n\ncertain when the remainder of the men were coming up. In the afternoon I measured them and tested their eyesight. I have now tested the sight of between thirty and forty of both sexes, and there seems to be no doubt that they have very good sight as a race. Of those tested in Batang Padang, the shortest distance that the Army test spots could be seen was 32 feet, and the longest 91 feet. Testing recruits for the British Army 20 feet is considered an average distance for these spots to be read, and a man reading at over that distance is classed as long-sighted, and under as short-sighted. In measuring the women there was great difficulty, as they did not know Malay and could not count. This same difficulty has been met with by observers of other savages, but I got over it by giving the subject a handful of matches and explaining by signs that I wanted a match for each spot on the card held up.\n\nEarly on the 5th these Sakais went down the hill and reached Tapa on the next evening.\n\nAll the botanical pressing paper was finished by this time, so I had to stop collecting plants.\n\nOn the evening of the 6th I shot a very handsome bird, with a snow white head, yellow breast and brown back, wings and tail, the latter being white tipped. The eyes were bright yellow and the bill pale flesh colour. It appears to be closely allied to the white-headed shrike-thrush of Burma and the mountains of India. (*Campylorhynchus rufulus*, Bl.) This bird gave us a great deal of trouble, for every night and early each morning a small party of them used to pass the camp, sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other. They made a loud, shrill noise something like the *krekak* monkey, and flew quickly from tree to tree. Day after day we went out into the jungle to watch for them, but as there was no certainty which side of the camp they would take, and as they always passed when it was so dark in the forest that neither they nor the sight of the gun could be distinguished, we were never successful until this night in shooting one although we fired at them on five different occasions. The strange thing was that we never saw these birds in the daytime. They passed up the hill to roost at nightfall and down again the\nfirst thing in the morning. Their note is so loud and distinctive and they are so noisy that they could not be mistaken for any other bird, or overlooked.\n\nFrom the 7th to the 10th we continued collecting, but got nothing of special interest. I had some trees felled so as to get a view of two fine *duduk* palms, and then took a photograph of them and afterwards had one cut down to get specimens as it happened to be in flower.\n\nOn the 7th and 8th I saw the fresh marks of a bear on the trunks of two trees, one above the camp and one below. These are the only animal marks, excepting those of tigers, which I saw on Batu Puteh.\n\nAt about 10 A.M. on the 10th some Sakais and Malays began to arrive, and so we all set to work packing up the collections and other things, and at 7.30 on the 11th we started for Tapa. On the way I stopped at the camp on the banks of the Woh at the foot of the hill and took a photograph looking down the stream, with some Sakais crossing the tree trunk which forms a natural bridge over the river at this point. I reached Kuala Woh at about 1 P.M., but the men with the baggage did not begin to arrive till about 4 P.M., and it was not till nearly 5 that I set off down the river in the smaller of the two boats, a dug-out, which had been sent to meet us, with MAHRSUL, my Malay boy and a Sakai to pole. I was just preparing to have something to eat when the boat shot down a small rapid, then across a pool so deep that the poles could not touch the bottom and alter her course and the next instant she ran on to a rock and turned right over and we and all the baggage went floating down the stream. I made for the photographic apparatus and shouted to one of the men to catch the gun cases as being the most valuable things. After a delay of about half-an-hour, occupied in collecting the various floating things, catching, turning over and bailing out the canoe we made a fresh start, and, with the exception of grounding several times, reached Tapa without further mishap at about 7 P.M. The river the whole way is a succession of small rapids with here and there deep pools. I heard that the place where our canoe capsized has been the scene of many a similar misfortune.\n\nThe next day, the 12th, the rest of my party and the remain-\nCOLLECTING EXPEDITION TO BATANG PADANG.\n\nder of the baggage arrived, and I was busy in cleaning and drying the photographic instruments, guns and other things which had been wetted in the river, and in the evening, when I opened the dark slides I was sorry to find that the water had got into them all and spoiled the plates.\n\nOn the 13th I had a quantity of Chinese paper cut to size and began shifting dried plants from the pressing paper into it, and early the next day, the 14th, some men were sent with my boy to dive for the things which had been lost when the dug-out upset. They recovered some of them, but a good many still remained at the bottom of the river, though, fortunately, they were of no great value.\n\nShortly after seven the same morning, I accompanied Mr. STALLARD and my brother to the valley of the Sungei Klian Mas. We struck the stream near its junction with the Batang Padang River and waded up it for three or four miles. We made several trials of the earth forming the banks, and in nearly all obtained good shows of not only tin-sand but also of gold. Some fifteen years ago or so there was a Malay kampung on the banks of this stream, and the inhabitants subsisted principally by mining, but as they refused to pay blackmail to Sheik MAHOMED of Lower Perak, he came up with some fighting men, and burned the houses down and drove away the inhabitants.\n\nWe saw many of the old workings in our progress up the river, which we followed to near its source, and then ascended a low range of hills which forms the watershed between the streams flowing into the Batang Padang above the River Tapa and the streams flowing into the Bidor River. We then followed along on the top of this ridge until we came to another river, and from there we went to a place on a tributary of it called the Sungei Chuchu, where some Malays were going to begin mining. We washed some of the earth of the banks of the stream, and obtained samples of very good coarse grained tin-sand containing gold. The tin was found to occur from the surface of the ground down to the bed rock, which, both here and in the valley of the Sungei Klian Mas, consists of beds of slates and clay slates with frequent veins of quartz intersecting them. No trace of granite is to be found.\neither on the range of low hills from which these streams take their rise or in beds of the streams themselves, so that it seems clear that the minerals found in the \"wash\" in these valleys must have been derived from these stratified formations. The more I see of this district, the more I feel convinced that all the gold has come from these rocks and that if any auriferous lodes are hereafter discovered, they will be found intersecting these ancient stratified beds. I have seen specimens from the gold mining district of Patani, which could not be differentiated from the rocks of the gold mining districts of Batang Padang, and I have no doubt that the same formations will be found in the Pahang gold fields as well.\n\nThe grains of gold are not much waterworn, and some of them have adherent fragments of quartz. The tin-sand is coarse grained, blackish, dull and considerably rounded, and would give from 65 to 70 per cent. of metallic tin, according to the rare taken in cleaning the sample.\n\nAfter having well examined the wash and also the bed rock and its contained veins of quartz, and obtaining sufficient tin-sand to make a good sample, we returned to Tapa, reaching that town in one and three-quarter hours. The track is extremely crooked and much longer than there is any necessity for it to be, and I do not think that this newly found tin and gold land can be more than 3 or 4 miles from Tapa.\n\nThere seems to be every reason to suppose that on both sides of the Batang Padang, between Tapa and Kuala Woh, auriferous tin mining land will be found to extend, for, as I have already mentioned, the geological exposures along the river between these two places are all of one formation and of that formation from which it may be with certainty said that the gold, at least, has been derived.\n\nSome time ago I made a series of experiments on some quartz specimens from Klian Mas, and in every case, except one, gold was obtained, though in unremitting quantities (one to two pennyweights per ton).\n\nFrom the 16th September to the 4th of October, I remained at Tapa and, as many trees and plants were in flower, did a large amount of botanical collecting. I also looked over and\ndried all the collections from the hills and packed them up, and made preparations for the trip to Ulu Batang Padang and Gunong Brumbum.\n\nJellah had an attack of ague and then dysentery and was unfit for work most of the time, so that not many birds or animals were collected. Mahrasit was also in the hands of the Apothecary most of the time, and Mahmot was so ill with fever that I paid him off and engaged another man in his place. I paid another visit to Chendariang and also to Klian Mas and Sungai Chuchu, to which a new track had been traced, suitable for a cart-road, and was found to measure only two and a-half miles from Tapa.\n\nOn the 5th October we left Tapa and proceeded to Kuala Woh and put up for the night in an empty house at that place, and at 8 15 A.M. on the morning of the 6th continued our way up the valley of the Batang Padang. The party consisted of 60 in all and even then we had to leave a quantity of rice and other things at Kuala Woh for want of transport. The difficulty on these expeditions is that the rice, fish and other necessaries for the transport coolies, employ more than half of their number and so leave only a few men available for the baggage of the rest of the party.\n\nBoth branches of the river having risen about 4 feet during the heavy rain of the preceding night, the Batang Padang was not fordable, and so we all had to cross it in boats, which was safely accomplished with the exception that one Sakai with his load tumbled head over heels into the river. There was great excitement amongst our Malays, as it was thought that his load consisted of the salt and sugar, but an investigation showed it to be only rice.\n\nWe then followed a N. E. and subsequently a N. W. course keeping close to the river all the way. The river is practicable for boats only for about half a mile above Kuala Woh, beyond that there are many small waterfalls and boiling rapids through which no boat could pass. At Lubo Tiang, where we camped for the night, the angle at which a long reach of the river is falling is 1.10\u00b0 or about 1 in 45.\n\nAfter leaving Kuala Woh we passed over many exposures of stratified rocks and it was only in the latter part of the\nday's march that we met with granite, and then only in patches.\n\nThe granite is very like that of the Larut hills and quite distinct from that of Gunong Batu Puteh and the Woh valley, but there are in the river rolled pieces of granite with the bluish quartz in them. These are probably derived from tributaries flowing into the river from the South-East, which have their sources near Batu Puteh and Brapit. At the camp we made a washing of some of the surface soil, and got a very fair show of tin-sand.\n\nOn the 7th, we reached Rantau Tipus and camped on the banks of the river after a six hours' march. The height of this place was 1,530 feet above sea level.\n\nDuring the day we saw a quantity of that most graceful of all bamboos, known by the native name of buluh arker, as well as an abundance of buluh telor, and several clumps of buluh bersumpit. This latter is the bamboo which is used by the Sakais to make the long straight tubes of their national weapon\u2014the blow-pipe. During the latter part of the day we came on the gigantic bamboo, buluh betom, with stems six to eight inches in diameter and sixty to eighty feet high.\n\nThe young shoots of this plant are edible, but not very nice to an European palate, though both the Malays and Sakais greedily devoured them, cooked and uncooked. Many of our Sakais made boxes of these bamboos and crammed into them all their clothes, and thenceforth appeared clad only in a two-inch wide strip of bark cloth.\n\nThe next day's march (the 8th) took us to the Kuala of the Sengum, where we camped. With the exception of a few patches of stratified rock, all that we passed over during the previous day's march was granitic, and granite again was the most plentiful rock met with between Rantau Tipus and Kuala Sengum, with here and there a patch of gneiss. Several large quartz lodes were seen, but they contained no indications of being metalliferous. One washing was made during the day in a ravine, and a fair show of tin-sand obtained.\n\nA great part of the track lay in the bed of the river, and wading through the cold water, and climbing over the slippery stones and rocks was anything but pleasant when continued for hours at a time.\nThe flora of this part of the valley of the Batang Padang seems very different to anything I have yet seen on the hills of Perak. The height of this part of the valley is about 2,000 feet. One noticeable plant was a very handsome member of the Melastomaceae with large bunches of coral pink flowers, succeeded by equally handsome bunches of bright red or purple fruits. I collected 30 plants during the day, and could have got many more, but considerations of transport and preservation deterred me. In an evil moment we were induced by assurances and example of some of the Sakais to eat some pretty apple-like fruit with which a tree, growing by the side of the river, was laden. The fruit, though pleasant at first, left a very disagreeable aftertaste, and we suffered for the remainder of the day with sore mouths and lips. It was a species of the genus Garima, of which the buah gluga is a well-known and closely allied example.\n\nOn the 9th we did not break up the camp, as we had decided to await the arrival of Kalana and the Sakais with him.\n\nI sent Jellar out shooting, and then we went up Gunong Chunam Prah, and reached a height of 3,550 feet. I saw a considerable number of new plants, and collected 18 species\u2014some horse tails (Equisetum) an Arundina A. bambusotela), (2), a large cream-coloured Dendrobium, &c. I then saw for the first time a blackberry, which grows amongst the bluka on the old Sakai ladangs. The berry is red and long and has something of the same flavour as its English ally. The leaf and method of growth is also very similar. Raspberries were also common in the same situations, but the fruit was small and nearly tasteless. Fan palms of a size exceeding a coco-nut tree were very plentiful, and formed quite a feature in the jungle of the surrounding hills and valleys. The leaves are used by the Sakais to thatch their houses, and, owing to the extreme hardness of the stems, they are not in the habit of cutting the palms down when felling the jungle for their ladangs, which probably accounts for their great abundance.\n\nA great part of the tops of the ridges running up to Gunong Chunam Prah are bare of trees and covered with ferns, grass, and the handsome Arundina I have already mentioned.\n\nOn returning to the camp I found that Jellar had not seen\nany new birds, and all those I had seen during the day were of the same species as those we had previously collected on Gunong Batu Puteh. Later on in the afternoon, Kalana and 14 Sakais arrived with more rice and stores.\n\nEarly on the morning of the 10th we sent back Karem and 16 Sakais to Kuala Won to bring on more baggage and stores, and then started on again up the river. Mahrope having a bad foot we had to leave him and a Kling, who came up with Kalana the day before at Kuala Sengum, until he was well enough to follow us. We passed a pretty waterfall during the day, formed by a tributary falling into the Batang Padang from the right, as you go up stream. There was a fine rainbow formed by the spray, which the Malays would have it was a hantu.\n\nWe camped again on the banks of the river, and on the 11th followed it up for some hours. The track taking us over some places which were anything but easy walking, or rather climbing. We then left the river, shortly after passing a fine waterfall, or more properly succession of falls, and ascended Gunong Ulu Batang Padang, and camped on its N. E. face at a height of 4,170 feet above the sea.\n\nOn the 12th we went up to the summit of the mountain, and from the \"Crow's Nests\" on the top of the trees, that were made some six months before by Kalana during the first expedition to these mountains; and were so fortunate as to obtain fine views of the Kinta Hills and the intervening country. I took two photographs, from one of these unsteady and perilous perches, of the hills and valleys which constitute what is so inaccurately described as \"Cameron's Plateau.\"\n\nWe decided that the route taken by the late Mr. Cameron must have been through the valley next to that of the Batang Padang, and divided from it only by the Laut Tingal ridge, and not more than four miles distant, as the crow flies, from the mountain we were then on.\n\nOn the 13th we again went up to the \"Crow's Nests\" to make sure of some of the hills which we could not make out on the previous day, and to settle on the course to take to reach Gunong Brumbum. This day we distinctly saw Batu Gaja in Kinta, bearing 283\u00b0 30'. This sight removed all doubt as to the\ncourse taken by Mr. Cameron in his journey from the Sungei Ryah to Pahang. Gunong Brumbun was exactly E. S. E. from us, but there was a valley and then a mountain, rather higher than the one we were then on which was 5,270 feet high, and then another deep valley to be traversed before the real ascent of it could be commenced.\n\nOn our return in the afternoon to the camp, we found Mahrope had arrived. His foot was nearly well again, we were glad to see. With him were the Sakais who were sent back on the 12th to bring on the baggage left at Kuala Ser-gum.\n\nOn the 14th we moved to a new camp which had been prepared during the two preceding days on a better site than that occupied by the old one and with a small clearing round it, so as to allow of the sun drying off the numerous botanical specimens we had been collecting.\n\nEarly on the morning of the 15th we, that is, 3 Malays, 2 Klinghs, 16 Sakais and ourselves, left the new camp in charge of Jelliah and a Malay, after having discharged all the other Sakais, and ascended nearly to the summit of Gunong Ulu Batang Padang, then struck down the S. E. face of it, passing the old camp made by the previous expedition, and skirted round the hill till we came to the Gunong Ulu Sekum, round the eastern face of which, we also went, then crossed two long projecting spurs of it, and descended by a gully to the valley of a tributary of the River Jalai, on the banks of which we camped, at an elevation of 4,590 feet. This stream takes the drainage of the N. W. slopes of Brumbun and the S. E. slopes of Gunong Ulu Sekum and flows down in an L. N. E direction to join the Jillah, as the upper part of the Pahang River is called.\n\nNear our camp I again saw the same handsome yellow-flowered Rhododendron that I previously met with on Batu Puteh, but this time it was growing as an epiphyte high up on a huge tree.\n\nI captured in the evening a particularly handsome member of the Glomerida family, probably belonging to the genus Zephyronia. It was one of those creatures much like a large woodlouse, but really nearly related to the Julida (Millepedes). It was black striped transversely with pale blue-green and\norange. Each pale blue-green stripe having three spots of a deeper shade of the same colour on it.\n\nDuring the night the rain came down in torrents, and as the roof leaked badly we had a very disturbed and uncomfortable night.\n\nOn the 16th we ascended a ridge near the camp and after many hours of climbing, through a singularly dense and thorny undergrowth, we came to a sort of saddle where there were some small pools of water, at a height of 5,890 feet, where all decided to camp.\n\nWhile the huts were building we went on up the hill and reached the lower of the three points of the mountain, as seen from Tapa, but everything was wrapped in thick drifting fog, so we could see nothing of the view.\n\nAgain we had a miserable night, as the hut leaked worse than that at the last night's camp and there was nothing for it but to roll up our bedding, place it so as to escape the worst leaks, and sit on it, while the rain lasted, which, unfortunately, was a good many hours. Next morning, the 17th, we again ascended the hill, and reached the highest point, and left a bottle there with a record of the ascent. We had our bedding and other things brought up, and laid out to dry, but it soon began raining and after waiting till between 11 and 12 o'clock and seeing no indication of the clouds either lifting or drifting away, we reluctantly returned to the camp and packed up, and started down to the permanent camp on Ulu Batang Padang, which we reached at a little before 6 p.m.\n\nOn making this ascent I fully expected to see a great change in the flora as the summit was reached, and was much disappointed to find it nearly the same as that on Gunong Batu Puteh.\n\nThere was one very handsome Rhododendron, with large white flowers delicately tinged with apple-blossom pink, growing freely and plentifully on the extreme bush covered summits. Another member of the same family had tiny bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers and small roundish, shiny, dark green leaves. One very marked difference between the flora of Batu Puteh and Brumbun is the total absence of fir trees on the latter mountain. The small bamboo called by\nthe Malays *butuh perindu* is, on the other hand, extremely plentiful on Brumbun and comparatively scarce on the other hill. I was fortunate in being able to collect flowering specimens of this elegant little bamboo, which is credited with mystic properties by the natives, and is in much request by love-lorn swains, whose mistresses are cold and irresponsible. In all I added 47 species of plants to my collection, but this number fell far short of what I had expected.\n\nThe height of the highest point of Brumbun as shown by the aneroid was only 6,850 feet, but I think that there must be some mistakes about this, but whether arising from any fault in the instrument or from the disturbed state of the weather at the time of the ascent, I am unable to say. Unfortunately we could not see Batu Puteh, and on neither of my two ascents of that mountain was I able to get a sight of Brumbun, but undoubtedly the latter is much the loftier of the two. One thing is certain, that within a radius of 20 miles, there is no other mountain higher than Brumbun, with the possible exception of Yang Yop. Mr. Sweitenham, some few years back published a note in the Straits Royal Asiatic Society's Journal on a new mountain seen in Perak from Gunong Arang Para, and from that description and the bearing he gives (102\u00b0) Brumbun is most probably the peak he then saw. This mountain is in Pahang, as the water from all faces of it flows either into the Sungai Inchii or the Jillah, and subsequently into the Pahang River. The valleys at the base of the mountain contain much excellent planting land, at about a mean elevation of 4,000 feet. There is also good land on the lower slopes of the mountain itself, but the higher portions of it are very steep, though the soil appears to be of exceptional richness.\n\nThe 18th was occupied in drying clothes and bedding, and packing up everything ready for a start the next day, as we had decided to try and cut across into the valley of the Telum, and follow up that river to its source, and then cross the hills and descend into Kinta, so as to settle beyond dispute the situation of the planting land explored by Mr. Cameron. Accordingly on the 19th we left the camp on Gunong Ulu Batang Padang and directed our course so as to reach the head\nof the Batang Padang valley, to ascertain the height of the pass or watershed dividing the waters flowing into Perak on the one side, and Pahang on the other, which we found to be 3,800 feet above sea level.\n\nOur party consisted of 16 Sakais, two Malay boys, Kalana the Malay kranti, one Kling coolie and ourselves. We only took provisions sufficient for 5 days, besides our clothes; all the collecting things, guns, &c., we left at the camp in charge of JILLAH and my other two men.\n\nThe course taken to find the top of the pass was about North-East and the consequence was that we went a long way out of our proper direction, which ought to have been W. N. W. Our progress was very slow, as we had, as on the ascent of Gunong Brumbun, to cut a track the whole way. We camped by the side of a small stream, and while the banana leaf huts were being built, Mr. C. WRAY and I went up a hill near by in the hopes of getting a sight of some hills whose outlines we know, but beyond catching a glimpse of Brumbun we saw nothing that could be recognised.\n\nThe next day, the 20th, we took a westerly course which led us diagonally across the Batang Padang valley, and eventually on to the ridge dividing it from the valley of the Telum. On the top of this ridge there was a good Sakai track, which we followed for some time until it began to take a S. W. course, when we left it and struck down a spur in a northerly direction into what we hoped was the Telum Valley, and at about 4 p.m. came to that river, which was about 60 feet broad at the place we first saw it, at an elevation of 3,200 feet. We here camped on the site of one of Mr CAMERON's old camps, and by the side of the river was a track which was undoubtedly his track. The elephant marks being still distinctly visible. MAHROPE, who was with Mr. CAMERON on his journey through this valley, told us that two days' march further down the stream would take us to a place where the river was navigable for rakets.\n\nGrowing along the banks of the river, we found quantities of violets with pale coloured, but sweet-scented flowers, which have been identified by Dr. KING as Viola Thomsoni, and are said by him to be common to the mountains of India, Java, and Sumatra. There were also a considerable number of species\nof Compositae. It was quite a surprise to us to find these temperate forms of plants in a valley at quite a low elevation when the mountain tops had been found to be covered with distinctly tropical vegetation. The birds I saw here were all hill forms, but I saw nothing that I had not previously met with, either on the Larut Hills or on Batu Puteh; though it is probable that a stay of a month or two would be rewarded by many new species.\n\nThis valley and those adjoining it contain some of the finest planting (and which I suppose is to be found anywhere on the mountains of the Peninsula, particularly when it is remembered that when the railway is constructed to Tapa and the cart-road from there up the valley of the Batang Padang it will be within a day's journey of a fine port. Such combined advantages of elevation, exposure, easy transport and good soil, are, I believe, not to be met with either in Ceylon or in the hill districts of India.\n\nMr. Cameron's original description of this hill country is fairly accurate if the Malay word \"pamor,\" is translated correctly as \"valley\" instead of \"plateau\" land. The lofty mountains range closing in the hill country to the East that is mentioned by him and estimated to be over 8,000 feet high is Gunong Brumbun, and another large hill mass to the East of it. To the North it is closed in by the Yang Yop range. Two large tributaries having their source on Yang Yop itself and one of them seems to be the largest of the many streams which, flowing down from the North, West and South, eventually form the Pahang River.\n\nOn the 21st we followed the elephant track up the valley, but after going some way lost it amongst some half-grown up Sakai ladangs. We then sometimes cut through the jungle and at others followed any Sakai tracks which went in the direction we wished to take. At about one o'clock we came to a place where the river divided, and we followed up the northern branch to near its source and on the top of a hill came on a Sakai house and decided to put up in it for the night.\n\nThe owners fled at our approach, so we sent some of our Sakais after them, and about an hour or so afterwards three\nsome stream and there is thus nothing to guide anyone in attempting to follow one. This, we were informed, is intentional and, in times past, was a necessary measure to prevent their being followed and hunted out of their mountain homes by the Malays.\n\nThe last crossing of the Kampar was made on a huge tree trunk, by the bare-footed portion of the party and then we took a track leading to Gopeng, which we reached at about 6 p.m., after a march of nearly 12 hours. The ragged and travel stained appearance of the whole party seemed to afford much amusement to the Chinese in the streets of Gopeng, and we were received with shouts of derisive laughter by the crowd round the gambling farm. We put up in the Resthouse, and thoroughly enjoyed sleeping on the plank floor (the beds being engaged) after a three weeks' spell of beds made of jungle sticks.\n\nAfter buying knives and sarongs for the guides, on the morning of the 24th we proceeded to Kota Bharu and on the 25th continued our way, following the Kuala Dipang Road. When about four miles had been traversed MAHROPE was taken ill with fever and became light-headed, and could not walk any further, so he had to be carried to Kampong Plikat and left there in a Malay house, with two of the Sakais to look after him. On reaching Kuala Dipang we sent KALANA and five men, who had arrived by another road from Gopeng, back to Kampong Plikat, to bring him on the next morning. On the 26th KALANA arrived bringing MAHROPE, and we then started, leaving the Kling to look after him, and reached Tapa in 7 hours including stoppages.\n\nThe wet weather had by this time set in in earnest, so that I decided not to go up to the camp on Ulu Batang Padang again, but only to send up some Sakais to bring down all the collections left there.\n\nOn the 2nd November, KAREM and 15 Sakais therefore left Tapa, and on the 10th the whole of the party returned, and on the 16th we went down the river in two boats to Telok Anson, and reached Larut on the 19th in the S.S. Mena.\n\nThe botanical specimens collected during the trip numbered 1,200 species, and the birds 187 skins. The plants have all\nbeen sent to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Calcutta, to be worked out, and the birds to the British Museum. I am informed by Mr. Bowdler Sharpe that there are 9 or 10 new species amongst the collection, thus bringing up the number of new species from the mountains of Perak to 16.\n\nMammals were very scarce, and did not number more than a dozen specimens.\n\nOf insects and other natural history objects, I made fairly good collections, and added much to the series of Sakai objects in the Museum as well as collecting others to send to the British Museum.\n\nL.

ISNARD,\nIng\u00e9nieur Civil des Mines.\n\nRES-PEU de personnes connaissent m\u00eame de nom le pays de \"Gemencheh.\" Ses ressources, son rapprochement avec Malacca, ses facilit\u00e9s de communication pour l'explorateur comme pour l'exploiteur, sa richesse en un mot, sont absolument ignor\u00e9es du public. Et cependant ce pays est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 48 heures \u00e0 peine de Singapore.\n\nGemencheh est un des \u00e9tats de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration du Negri Sembilan, par cons\u00e9quent englob\u00e9 dans le groupe des petits \u00e9tats actuellement sous le protectorat britannique qui a pour ville de r\u00e9sidence Kwala Pilah.\n\nCe district est born\u00e9 au Nord et \u00e0 l'Ouest par Johol, \u00e0 l'Est par Johor, et au Sud par la colonie de Malacca. Il est travers\u00e9 sur sa plus grande longueur par un affluent du Muar, le Gemencheh, qui a donn\u00e9 son nom au pays. Plusieurs tributaires de cette rivi\u00e8re arrosant ce pays en tous sens en ferait une contr\u00e9e d'une grande fertilit\u00e9, si le nombre d'habitants \u00e9tait en rapport avec ces immensit\u00e9s de terrain. Ses limites de fronti\u00e8re avec Malacca lui permettent de se servir des routes de cette colonie jusqu'\u00e0 Malacca m\u00eame, soit 30 milles. Une autre route carrossable de Batang Malacca le met \u00e9galement en rapport avec Tampin, ville fronti\u00e8re du Negri Sembilan. Et de Batang Malacca on peut se rendre au village de Gemencheh par un chemin pratiqu\u00e9 pour faciliter la sortie\ndes plantations, soit 6 milles. Il suffirait d'une somme relativement infime pour faire de ce chemin une route de grand voie.\n\nMaintenant dans l'int\u00e9rieure une foule de sentiers vous mettent \u00e0 m\u00eame de vous rendre dans les diff\u00e9rents endroits de cette contr\u00e9e sans trop de d\u00e9tours, avantage consid\u00e9rable pour l'explorateur prospecteur. Il est certain que devant le d\u00e9veloppement que ce pays commence \u00e0 prendre et la tr\u00e8s-grande place qu'il occupera sous peu, non seulement dans le Negri Sembilan mais encore dans la presqu'\u00eele de Malacca, le Gouvernement fera le sacrifice imm\u00e9diat d'une grosse somme pour cr\u00e9er des voies de communication afin de faciliter l'entr\u00e9e et la sortie des denr\u00e9es et produits des exploitations mini\u00e8res et agricoles.\n\nCe pays de Gemencheh est essentiellement minier. Point d'\u00e9tain, mais de l'or. Il est situ\u00e9 dans les derniers contreforts de la grande cha\u00eene s\u00e9parative de la p\u00e9ninsule. Ces collines quoique peu \u00e9lev\u00e9es sont tr\u00e8s abruptes et en forme de c\u00f4ne pour le plus grand nombre. Couvertes de for\u00eat de bois de premier choix elles seront dans l'exploitation mini\u00e8re un puissant auxiliaire. Comme bois de chauffage leur calorique est suffisant pour servir aux machines \u00e0 vapeur, et comme bois de constructions, menuiserie, traverses de chemin de fer, poteaux t\u00e9l\u00e9graphiques leur r\u00f4le est tout trac\u00e9.\n\nUn m\u00eame soul\u00e8vement aurif\u00e8re traverse Gemencheh dans toute sa longueur comme dans toute sa largeur. Ce soul\u00e8vement, que j'ai \u00e0 maintes reprises observ\u00e9, a une direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de N.N.W. et S.S.E. Il part de la colonie de Malacca o\u00f9 je l'ai relev\u00e9, traverse tout le Gemencheh, coupe le Muar et le Serling, enrichit leurs affluents au passage atteint Tasoh, continue sa marche \u00e0 travers Pahang, o\u00f9 je le laisse. Ce soul\u00e8vement, que j'ai observ\u00e9 dans toute sa marche, n'est point le fait d'un hasard ou d'un exc\u00e8s d'imagination mais bien un effet des observations consciencieusement prises et nettement \u00e9tablies.\n\n1\u00b0. La formation aurif\u00e8re commence tr\u00e8s-avant dans la colonie de Malacca. Sur une grande partie du parcours de la route reliant Malacca \u00e0 Tampin elle n'\u00e9chappera pas \u00e0 l'\u0153il d'un observateur. En laissant ce chemin (au 10\u00e8me mille\nde Malacca par exemple) et en en p\u00e9n\u00e9trant un peu \u00e0 l'Est dans l'int\u00e9rieur des terres \u00e0 2 ou 3 milles, vous vous trouvez en face des travaux de lavage d'alluvions aurif\u00e8res ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s avec tant de poursuite qu'il ne laissent aucun doute sur la valeur primitive de ces gisements. Il est \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que les filons qui ont enrichi ces cours d'eau ne sont pas loin, car le peu d'eau et le peu de pente de ces ruisseaux ne permettent pas un grand entra\u00eenement de ce m\u00e9tal si lourd. De ce point en prenant une direction N. S. vous arrivez dans le Gemencheh.\n\n2\u00b0. Le premier endroit et aussi le plus important qui s'offre est Chendras. On peut dire que presque de tout temps les Malais ont travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 Chendras. Leurs travaux quoique peu consid\u00e9rables n'en d\u00e9notent pas moins une certaine habilet\u00e9 dans le travail des mines, surtout si l'on consid\u00e8re dans quelles conditions d\u00e9plorables ces travaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s. Sans outils, sans pompe, sans poudre, ils ont fonc\u00e9 des puits qui ont 150 pieds de profondeur. Une compagnie europ\u00e9enne s'est form\u00e9e dans la suite, mais ses affaires n'ont pas repondu aux grandes esp\u00e9rances que l'on avait con\u00e7ues; elle liquida. Le m\u00eame reef d'abord travaill\u00e9 par les Malais fut continu\u00e9 par la nouvelle compagnie. Ce reef appartient au r\u00e9seau E.-W. dont la largeur est tr\u00e8s consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 en juger par les travaux l\u00e9gers faits jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour; quant \u00e0 la longueur elle est encore \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer, on n'en peut rien dire encore. Ce soul\u00e8vement de E.-W. est de formation ant\u00e9rieure au soul\u00e8vement N.-S.\n\nLes filons dans cette derni\u00e8re formation sont, je pense, aussi nombreux que dans la premi\u00e8re. Ils croisent les filons E.-W. \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 angle droit, ce qui donne lieu \u00e0 de nombreux tron\u00e7ons E.-W. qui rendront l'exploitation de ces filons difficile, mais aussi tr\u00e8s-riche \u00e0 cause des nombreuses points de contact. Quant \u00e0 la richesse de ces filons N.-S elle semble jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent \u00eatre tr\u00e8s inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle des filons E.-O. Leur puissance est plus grande et leur quartz d'aspect salin est fort dur m\u00eame \u00e0 l'affleurement. Les filons E.-W. \u00e9tant plus d\u00e9compos\u00e9s \u00e0 la surface et donnant l'or visible \u00e0 l'\u0153il nu on peut conclure que la richesse des alluvions proviennent de la d\u00e9sagregation de ces filons.\nLes alluvions de ce district de Chendras ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en grande partie travaill\u00e9es.\n\nSi l'ancienne compagnie de Chendras, pour des raisons dans lesquelles je n'ai pas entrer, n'a pas r\u00e9ussi, ce n'est pas \u00e0 dire que celle qui se cr\u00e9era \u00e0 l'avenir auront le m\u00eame sort, d'autant plus qu'il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 qu'elle ait travaill\u00e9 le filon le plus riche de ce district, ce que nous sommes appel\u00e9s peut \u00eatre \u00e0 constater avant longtemps.\n\nDes \u00e9tudes s\u00e9rieuses de recherches mettront \u00e0 jour, j'en ai la conviction, des richesses comme la p\u00e9ninsule n'en a pas encore vues et qui r\u00e9compenseront largement l'\u00e9nergie et la tenacit\u00e9 de ceux qui ont su vouloir.\n\n3\u00b0. En continuant toujours ce voyage \u00e0 travers le Gemencheh et en suivant toujours ce soul\u00e8vement aurif\u00e8re dans la direction W., j'arrive \u00e0 Ulu Gedoh.\n\nCette concession appartient aujourd'hui \u00e0 un syndicat, aussi je ne m'appesantirai pas. Deux reefs sont d\u00e9couverts ; le premier d'une direction E.-O., et le second N.-S. Ce que je viens de dire plus haut, quant \u00e0 la formation des filons, peut s'appliquer ici, c'est le m\u00eame soul\u00e8vement. Le premier filon E.-O. donne de grandes esp\u00e9rances, je suis persuad\u00e9 qu'il les tiendra. D\u00e8s la surface, l'or est visible \u00e0 l'\u0153il nu, les travaux en profondeur montreront que la richesse va toujours \"crescendo.\" Dans les travaux superficiels faits par ce syndicat j'ai vu la richesse aller en augmentant au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les fouilles descendaient.\n\nJe continue mon voyage \u00e0 travers le Gemencheh dans une direction N.N.E. et j'arrive au Muar apr\u00e8s avoir travers\u00e9 ses affluents, tels que \"Kendong,\" Jelei, Klebang, &c., &c., tous travaill\u00e9s en tant qu'alluvions, et j'arrive au Serling et d\u00e9j\u00e0 en traversant le Cheras et le Sebaling, affluents du Serling, j'arrive \u00e0 la fronti\u00e8re de Pahang.\n\nQuant \u00e0 la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale on peut s'en rendre compte en la suivant sur la carte, et en relevant les points que je viens d'indiquer, on tombera en plein dans le territoire de la colonie de Malacca apr\u00e8s avoir travers\u00e9 tout le pays de Gemencheh.\n\nSi maintenant le voyageur plac\u00e9 sur la fronti\u00e8re de Pahang jette ses regards vers le pays de Pahang dans la direction de\nd\u00e9couvertes d\u2019or de cette contr\u00e9e, tel que Raub, il verra que tous ces points se trouvent dans le m\u00eame soul\u00e8vement que je vien d\u2019indiquer.\n\nSi j\u2019ai pu par ces quelques lignes interesser le lecteur au point de lui croire par ma demonstration que l\u2019or dans la p\u00e9ninsule Malaise n\u2019en pas seulement tributaire d\u2019un pays mais bien de trois, qui sont la colonie de Malacca, le Gemencheh (Negri Sembilan), et Pahang, je serai enti\u00e8rement satisfait; mon but sera atteint.\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSTRAITS BRANCH\nOF THE\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nDECEMBER, 1890.\n\nSINGAPORE:\nPRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE.\n\nAGENTS OF THE SOCIETY:\n\nLondon and America, ...

Guided by a catalogue, I selected a thin, discoloured manuscript described as \"Sharur Aceh,\" wondering that there should have been a poem about Aceh in Logan's time; though the Dutch expeditions to Aceh have made us familiar with the effusions of Malay poetsasters therein in later days. The first verse contained an allusion to Selangor, and it soon became apparent that the document had nothing to do with Aceh, but was a ballad relating the adventures and death of a certain Raja Haji in Malacca. The names of persons, including those of the Dutch commanders who led the attack in which the Malay hero of the ballad lost his life, were given, so it was evidently a work contemporaneous with the events which it described. I borrowed the manuscript from the Library and set to work to collect all available information about Raja Haji's attack upon Malacca in the last century. Materials were plentiful. Beagle* devotes five pages (pp. 65-69) to the subject and Netscher \u2020 has published (in Dutch) the text of the official diary kept in the fortress of Malacca from day to day during the stirring events of 1783-4, the source, apparently, from which Beagle got his information. And besides the English and Dutch accounts I found a long description of Raja Haji's invasion of Malacca in a Malay historical work called \"Tobkat-Senafis,\" which treats of the Malay Rajas of Bugus extraction in the Straits of Malacca.\n\nI subjoin the text (Romanised) of the Malay ballad preserved by Logan, and probably acquired by him during one of his visits to Malacca some forty years ago. It is evidently the work of a Malacca Malay, friendly to the Dutch and perhaps in their service, who looked upon the Selangor invaders as robbers and the Bugis\n\n* \"The Malay in Peninsular,\" Madras, 1841.\n\u2020 \"Twee Belageringen van Malakka.\"\nas pirates. I have not ventured to attempt to translate it. The character of Malay poetry makes it almost impossible to make panduns readable in an English dress. The story is carried on in the third and fourth lines of each stanza only, the first two lines being either mere tags on which to hang the rhyme, or, at the best, some figurative statement, a kind of background against which to set the picture. To read ninety-five stanzas like the following would give little idea of the effect of the original:\n\nNear the house of Indra Suhlu,\nThe angkak fish from the sea of Banea.\nThe corpse was cast into a cleft of the rocks,\nOf him who had boasted he would take Malacca.\n\nThe angkak fish from the sea of Banea,\nSi Tush runs away with the tray.\nHis intention was to take Malacca,\nLittle aware that his life would be lost.\n\nSi Tush runs off with the tray,\nWood is turned by Si Naga Wangsa.\nLittle thought he that his life would be lost.\nThe body was removed by the Governor of Malacca.\n\nThe literary merit of the poem is not great, but it is of considerable historical interest and will be valued in Malacca as the work of some local bard of the last century, who celebrated in the best language he could command the successful repulse of the raid attempted on his native city.\n\nBegbie's account of the cause of the quarrel between the Yang-di-per-tuan Muda of Blouw and the Dutch, and of the fighting that ensued is an appropriate preface to the Malacca ballad:\n\n\"At this period (A.D. 1782; Heg. 1194) Pieter Geraldas de Briga was the Governor of Malacca, being assisted by five other individuals as Members of Council; these were (1) the President of the Court of Justice, (2) the Commanding Officer of the Troops, (3) the Master Attendant, (4) the Fiscal, and (5) the Winkellier, or Superintendent of the Company's trade. Few readers need to be reminded that a severe contest was being maintained at this epoch by the English against the united strength of the French and Dutch nations, Gerrit Pangal was also Resident of the island of Rhio, another Dutch settlement in the vicinity of Singapore. Rajah Hadgi was the Rajah Moodah, or Iyang de Portuan Moodah, of the same place, and Sulthaun Mahomed Shah, Sulthaun of the\n\n* The spelling of the original has been retained.\nsmall island of Linggan. An English merchantman was attacked by a French man-of-war somewhere in the Indian Archipelago, but, managing to make her escape, put into Riau for protection. It must be remembered that, although the Dutch possessed a Colony here, it was as yet but in its infancy, and their authority merely nominal. The Englishman consequently relied upon the neutrality of the Rajah Moodah.\"\n\n\"Pangal, anxious as he was to obtain the merchantman as a prize, was therefore unable to seize her without the permission of Rajah Hadgi, which he accordingly sought and obtained upon condition that he should receive a fair proportion of the booty. Pangal lost no time in communicating with the Governor of Malacca, who forthwith despatched a fast sailing French corvette that was lying in the roads, by whom she was seized, carried to Batavia, and sold, the French and Dutch dividing the proceeds between them.\"\n\n\"Rajah Hadgi in vain demanded his proportion of the prize, for the more powerful confederates laughed at his pretensions. Indignant at this shameless breach of agreement by the Dutch, who were nationally concerned in it, the disappointed Rajah Moodah declared war against them the following year. To meet this declaration Francis Lenckner, the President of the Court of Justice, was despatched to Riau from Malacca at the close of the year in command of about seventeen small vessels and six hundred troops, a most incongruous appointment for a man of law. Lenckner's expedition terminated as might have been foreseen. He was not only totally defeated, and obliged to crowd all canvas in his retreat, taking with him the settlers of Riau, but also to leave behind one of his vessels, which had been stranded on the bar, and could not be floated off.\"\n\n\"Flushed with this success, Rajah Hadgi determined the ensuing year to attack Malacca; he therefore equipped a fleet of one hundred and seventy vessels, carrying a large body of men, with which he sailed for the Monr River.\"\n\n\"The Dutch, as timorous in the hour of peril as they had been perfidious when the rule of the strongest was theirs, despatched one of their number, Abraham D'Wind, a gentleman whose influence with the natives was very considerable, to expostulate with the exasperated Rajah Moodah, and deprecate his vengeance. But if the Dutch really hoped that they could again cajole him, they were quickly undeceived by the rapid return of their\nambassador, who accounted himself but too happy in having been able to effect his escape with his life.\"\n\n\"Rajah Hadji, having weighed anchor, now came off Katapang, a small village situated about five miles easterly of Malacca, and opposite the Water Islands; here he disembarked and erected a stockade on the sea shore, in which he took up his head-quarters, having with him about 1,000 armed followers, and 300 women. Close to this village is a spot called Ponggoor, where Mr. D'Wind had a house and grounds, but the communication between it and Malacca being merely a narrow footpath leading through a dense jungle, Rajah Hadji was convinced that regular troops would never think of passing through so dangerous a defile as long as there were more eligible points of attack. He therefore left the stockade open on this face,* throwing up a simple piggah, or stout bamboo fence, in lieu of it, as an additional source of security he advanced a party to Mr. D'Wind's house.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, the Rajah of Salangore, an independent State about forty miles to the westward of Malacca, who had married a daughter of Rajah Hadji, sailed up the Linggy river, which disembogues itself about twenty-five miles from Malacca, and having captured some Malacca Kings (or natives of Coreanad) who were residing at Rumbeh, returned down the river; he then sailed along the coast, reducing the whole country to the westward as far as Tanjong Kling, seven miles from Malacca.\"\n\n\"At the period of which I am treating, the new populous neighbourhood of Tranquarah, which forms the western suburb of Malacca, consisted merely of a few houses spotted here and there in a thick jungle, which was peculiarly favourable for the operation of a Malayan enemy; the Dutch, thus beleaguered both eastward and westward, were unable to prevent the approach of the Rajah of Salangore to the second Tranquarah bridge which is only about one mile from the fort of Malacca, whilst Rajah Hadji advanced as far as Opopong Passer, the whole of the country to the northward, as far as Pangkallang Ramnah, being in the hands of the confederates.\"\n\n* The side of a Malayan stockade is always left open for the convenience of retreat, as the defenders may retreat if the day be lost. As this side is generally resting on the jungle and all the path, except where they retreat by, are plants with runners, the tree is scarcely telling, being screened by their work from the enemy's fire in the last instance, and safe from pursuit in the second.\"\n\"At this crisis of their affairs, the Dutch were unhappily at variance amongst themselves. Togar Aboo, the commander of a 36-gun frigate, then lying in the Malacca roads, roundly charged D'Wind with treachery, and the latter was accordingly arrested. The charge not being substantiated he was subsequently set at liberty by order of the Batavian Government, and shortly afterwards the frigate accidentally blew up, thus adding to the difficulties of the Dutch.\"\n\n\"They were at length considerably relieved by the appearance of a fleet consisting of three ships and two brigs from Batavia under the command of Admiral Van Braam, who dropped anchor between the Water islands and Katapang on the main land and maintained a constant fire on the stockade of Rajah Hadji, who returned it as briskly. Van Braam, taking advantage of a dark night, laid down a succession of anchors, with hawsers attached to each, between his vessels and the shore. Having on board six hundred Javanese bayonets, he landed this party about four in the morning without noise by means of the hawsers, and directed it to remain concealed at Purino till daylight. In order to divert the enemy's attention from that quarter, the fleet continued its cannonade until the signal was made for the attack of the land column which, falling suddenly upon the stockade, dispersed the enemy with the loss of 450 killed. Rajah Hadji was murdered amongst the slain having been killed by nearly the last round shot fired from the fleet.\"\n\n\"Directly that the Admiral saw the Dutch colours flying over the stockade he landed, but, not having as yet learned the death of the Rajah, he concluded that he had marched for Malacca after having evacuated the stockade. He therefore put his troops in rapid motion for that place, but discovered the real state of affairs on arriving at Poonagar. Rajah Hadji's body was found after some search, and brought into Malacca, where it was interred on St. Paul's Hill.\"\n\nThe following is the Romanised text of the Malay ballad:\n\nSILVER RAJA HAJI.\n\nBentangan batang meriam\nPelung di lalun pantai kap\nRaja Slanggul, la la Ramhan\nOrang Kini hitu terbangkap\nRAJA HAJI.\n\nPerling di-dalam perangkap\nRaya di hulu be-rampas-an\nOrang Kling lalu ter-tangkap\nDato' Penghulu me-lepas-kan.\n\nRaya di hulu be-rampas-an\nTer-layang batang lembing\nDato' Penghulu me-lepas-kan\nDi-suroh Pa'Sayang * membawa Kling\n\nTer-layang batang lembing\nRumpun temu di-dalam raga\nDi-suroh Pa'Sayang membawa Kling\nLalu ber-temu pada Wolanda.\n\nRumpun temu di-dalam raga\nBenang di kayu laka\nSudah ber-temu pada Wolanda\nPa'Sayang ter-bilang di Malaka.\n\nBilang pinang di kayu laka\nChina menampi di-dalam prahu\nPa'Sayang ter-bilang di Malaka\nShina Tambi \u2020 di-jumput men-jamu.\n\nChina menampi di-dalam prahu\nDi-dalam dulang ikan belanak\nShina Tambi jumput men-jamu\nPa'Sayang pulang mengambil anak.\n\nDi dalam dulang ikan belanak\nBentangor kayu ber-batang\nPa'Sayang pulang mengambil anak\nOrang Salangor pun sudah datang.\n\nBentangor kayu ber-batang\nBunga tanjung ber-tali-tali\nOrang Salangor pun sudah datang\nRaiyat Tanjong \u2021 pun sudah lari.\n\nBunga tanjung ber-tali-tali\nBentangor batang ber-duri\nOrang Tanjong pun sudah lari\nRaiyat Salangor masok men-churi.\n\n* Pa'Sayang: apparently an influential Malay.

observed the excellent practice of keeping an official record of passing events, probably for the information of the Government in Batavia, and this diary is still preserved in the archives of the Resident Councillor at Malacca. Some thirty years ago Mr Netscher, the Dutch Resident of Bencoolen, obtained the permission of the Governor of the Straits Settlements (Colonel Cavenagh, now Sir Ordeur Cavenagh, K.C.B.), to examine and make extracts from them, and he published under the title of \"Two Sieges of Malacca,\" a little pamphlet containing the text of the Dutch records relating to the attack on Malacca by Daing Kamoja in 1756 and the invasion of Raja Haji in 1784. In each case the invaders were Bugis from Ranau, aided by their friends and relations from Selangor, where a Bugis colony had been successfully established. Portions of the history of the attack of 1756 have already been published in this Journal (No. 12, December, 1883, p. 261), and I now give the Dutch official account of the war of 1784, which has been kindly translated for me, from Netscher's \"Twee Belegeringen,\" by my sister Mrs. Isomonger:\n\nTHE SIEGE OF 1784\n\nExtracts from the Malacca Journal of the year 1784.\n\nJan. 7.\u2014There returned from Luggi the ship Meerenberg and the private bark Authentica Elisabeth, which had left for that place on the 2nd instant. The Captain of the first-named boat, Jan Montanje, produced a copy of the journal which he had kept during the expedition, wherein amongst other things it was stated that while lying at the mouth of the river Luggi on the 5th instant he saw about fifty of the enemy's vessels come out of the river, and sail along the coast towards the north, or Strait of Kalang, but that on account of the calm, and the distance of the vessels, he was unable to pursue them, and taking into consideration the superior force of the enemy, and the fact that as they had left Luggi he could not find out the reason of their visit, he returned here.\n\nJan. 14.\u2014Arrived in the afternoon at about 4 o'clock, six barges, at Tandjong Kling, and in the evening the unpleasant news was received, through the people of the Chinaman San Somko, that the Selangore vessels had landed their crews, in all about one hundred men, in the bay of Batang Tera, that they had not only pursued and fired at him and his slaves, but they had taken one slave prisoner, and that he and the rest had saved themselves by flight.\nThe Governor, therefore, immediately had a company of thirty native soldiers detached to the Lazarusveld to reinforce the outer battery.\n\nJan 15. The detached company, sent yesterday evening to the outer battery of Tranqueba, with a few armed volunteers, and a company of fifty Malays raised this morning, marched from the Lazarusveld, and by midday had reached the stream near Batang Tiga. They encountered there the Selangoer men who had landed the previous day, and a fight ensued. Some additional men were sent to their assistance and ammunition, but before this reinforcement could reach them the first troops had been obliged to retire, on account of the superior strength of the enemy who numbered about 200 men, with the loss of one man who was shot dead and two wounded. They marched back, however, the enemy not daring to follow them, to the before-mentioned battery which they reached as it got dark.\n\nDuring the night the enemy set on fire several abandoned Malay huts, and fired a few shots at our advanced posts, but without any effect.\n\nJan. 16.\u2014It was reported that the enemy were actively occupied in preparing stockades at Batang Tiga, and in burning houses at Batang Tiga and at Tandjong Kling. Fighting continued there during the whole day, and the following night.\n\nJan. 17. At daybreak, by the orders of Lieut. Auguste Gravestein, a detachment was sent to Batang Tiga consisting of two hundred Native and twenty European soldiers, besides two bombardiers and eight musketeers with two field-pieces of 3 lb., and one small gun with their appurtenances. To this force was added from two to three hundred volunteers\u2014Chinese, Malays and Gentoes (Jentoeven)\u2014armed with pikes, cutlasses, and some with blunderbusses, commanded by Abraham Couperus, merchant, and Fiscal* of this Government.\u2020\n\nMarching from the Lazarusveld, they embarked there and rowed to the bay of Batang Tiga, two steenbokken\u2021 commanded by\n\n* In 1576 a Regulation was issued that the Admiralty Court should consist of the \"Fiskal,\" the Recorder (\"Treffer\") and seven members.

These arrived in the bay in front of the enemy's stockade at about 3 o'clock and began to bombard it.\n\nThe fight continued between the stockade and the boats for an hour, when the before-mentioned force also approached the enemy, and attacked by land, and the general combat was fierce by land and sea; and three of the guns which had been brought burst and caused a fire, which, however, was soon extinguished.\n\nThe enemy attempted once to make a sally on our right wing, but a few volleys from our muskets obliged them to retire into their intrenchments, from which they offered a desperate resistance, and thus saved themselves from being overmastered by our force. The latter from weariness, and in order not to be overtaken by darkness in the jungle, were obliged to cease fighting at 4 o'clock and to retreat. They returned at about 8 o'clock to the outer battery of the Lazarusveldt; the armed boats above mentioned also returned. On our side eight men were wounded, of whom one died this evening.\n\nJan 22.\u2014The merchant vessel Shaw Beyramore, by Thomas Maughan, arrived from China after a voyage of fifteen days. She brought the unpleasant news that the Company's fleet, after the loss of a ship blown up, had raised the blockade of Brouw, and immediately sailed away, and moreover were already somewhere about the Formosa Rock, where the aforesaid English ship had spoken them in passing.\n\nJan. 23.\u2014At daybreak sails were noticed towards the south, which soon proved to be a portion of the Company's fleet which had blockaded Brouw. On account of contrary winds they were obliged at nightfall to anchor outside the harbour.\n\nMeanwhile, the Company's ship Mercenbergy sailed towards the south to bring into the harbour a vangkong which had been in sight since yesterday morning.\n\nJan 24\u2014Arrived in the roads the Company's ships Delphijn, Hofter Linden, De Jonge Hugo, besides the galleys* De Smidtend, the galvat\u2020 Concordia, and the pantjakangans Rodeberg and Philippine.\n\n* Ghazek, the Arab name for a galley, a large flat-bottomed vessel called grib by the English in the last century.

From this is derived the English term \"jolly-boat.\" See Yale's Glossary, sub voce Gallevat.\nTwo Commissioners from the Government landed from the Riauw fleet last night, and also an und r-factor, Reinier Bernhard Hoijenek van Papendrecht, who confirmed the sad news that the small vessel Molucca's Willekeven, on board of which, amongst others, was Mr. Arnoldus Franciscus Lemker, the Commander of the aforesaid expedition, had been blown up with a number of people, and that the fleet, because of this and an unsuccessful landing, was forced to break up the blockade and to sail away.\n\nJan. 26. Arrived in the roads the second part of the squadron from Riauw, consisting of the Company's vessels Diamant and Hoop and the cutter Patriot.\n\nJan. 27. There arrived successively in the roads of the Company's returning fleet from Riauw the cutter Onderneem and the sloops of war Johanna and Cieera. The Commander of the last-named craft that the day before he had spoken the bark Gertruda Susanna near the Formosa Rock, since when he had not seen her, that they were out of drinking-water on board, but on account of their own scarcity he had not been able to assist them; consequently the above-mentioned cutter the Onderneem, with the pantjalang Philippine, was sent at once to the south in search of the missing bark, the Gertruda, to render the necessary assistance.\n\nFeb. 1. Returned from the south the cutter Onderneem and the pantjalang Philippine sent out on January 27 last, without having met the Gertruda Susanna, the missing bark of the Company's returning war fleet.\n\nFeb. 4. The cutters Patriot and Onderneem, cruising between Tandjong Kling and the Lazarusveld, together with the Handelaar and the galvot Concordia, having approached the shore with the rising tide, began at 2 o'clock to fire at the enemy's vessels which were hauled up on the beach, and soon entered into a fight with the enemy's batteries or stockades all along the shore, which fight lasted until sundown when it was observed that they were leaving the shore, and were in pursuit of some of the enemy's vessels which had arrived on the north side of Tandjong Kling.\n\nThough no more could be seen of them because of the darkness, report of cannon was heard now and then until ten o'clock in the evening.\n\nFeb. 5. A halo of the enemy's, captured last night on the north of Tandjong Kling, was brought up by the cutter Patriot. It was mounted with two guns of 3 lb., and loaded with two chests and some balls of opium, some pieces of blue and white linen, about two\nkoyans of rice in kajanga, some bags of cummin seed, etc., as stated in the manifest. The master of the first-mentioned cutter reported that the Company's vessels suffered little or nothing in yesterday's fight, and had lost none of their crews, and of the seven of the enemy's vessels, which they had chased yesterday evening, two which were stranded were disabled, and the halo which he had brought was taken after a fight, the crew having been forced to jump overboard, but that the four others had escaped through the darkness of the night.\n\nFeb 8 In the afternoon, under command of Lieut. Stecher, Ensigns Maurer, Duverg, and Lutter, and ex-Ensign of the Burghers Kilman, and three Malay Captains, were sent on board for an expedition against the Selangor Bigas by the vessels lying off Tandjong Kling viz., the Dolphin, the cutters Patriot and Ondermeer, the hooker Hundehuer, the pantjolanes Philippin and Rustenberg, besides the galaret Coneida, with thirty-one European and 184 Malay soldiers from the garrison here, fully armed, besides a large number of volunteers, Herr E Hoijack van Papendrecht also went on board the ship Dolphin, he being appointed Receiver and License Master\u2020 of the expedition.\n\nAt nightfall several of the ships destined for this expedition left the river for the roads with several other vessels, mounted with one 6 lb. gun, four of 3 lb., and one of 1 lb.; some rantakas of native manufacture, and one howitzer of 4 inches. Besides skilful men for rowing and other ordinary work, there were also placed on board the ships, one extra gunner, one bombardier, three gunners, and twenty-seven musketeers.\n\nFurther, in the garden of the late Soeratter Malek Fazullah, outside Tranquilla, were posted 200 Nanningers and Achinese from up-country, to be transported next day to Tandjong Kling if the landing there was decided on.\n\nFeb 9 In the morning at 4 o'clock the Dolphin and the rest of the vessels destined for the expedition against the Selangor\n\n---\n\n\u2020 Semi-military rank.\n\u2021 In 1763 local coins, signed the money paid for permits to sell goods, purchased in the Prince's territory, in the territory of the enemy. It became a sort of tax, levied as a kind of export duty.\n\u00a7 The lieutenant-governors were charged with collecting these monies. The East India Company paid considerable amounts annually for licences (licences). Later in 1777 an agreement was entered into between the Company and the Admiralties, by virtue whereof the Company paid a fixed sum annually.\nBugis left the roads near Tandjong Kling, but remained the whole day lying at anchor before the place without doing anything.\n\nMeantime, at daybreak, with the opening of the gates the news was received that 100 Nanningers, posted in the deceased Malek Faizullah's garden, had run away in the night, but that 100 Achinese who had been with them had already gone on the ships appointed to transport them, and had pushed off intending to go to Tandjong Kling. But they were sent back to land in the afternoon by the Council of War of the above mentioned expedition.\n\nFeb 10 All the vessels and people returned from Tandjong Kling without having done anything.\n\nFeb 13. A large number of native vessels, large and small, were observed to the south which all put in to Telok Katapun, and afterwards news was received that they belonged to Radja Hadji and that his people landed at the above-named place.\n\nFeb 14 More Riouw vessels with men and ammunition arrived at Telok Katapun.\n\nFeb 15. The disastrous news was received that the enemy who landed yesterday and the day before at Telok Katapun, had not only already advanced as far as Poeegger and Tandjong and taken possession of them and the country lying round, but that also the inhabitants, except a few who had fled to the hills, had put themselves under the protection of Radja Hadji.\n\nFeb 16. News was brought by several Semabok people escaping to the town, that the Riouw Bugis had already arrived there, and had taken possession of the hill.\n\nFeb 21. Some volunteers marching to Semabok came into action with the enemy. On our side we lost no one, but on the enemy's, as far as we could see, three men were killed, and the head of one was cut off and brought to town to be exposed.\n\nFeb 22 In the morning at 4 o'clock a detachment marched, under command of Lieutenant Duverge, to Semabok consisting of twenty-seven Europeans, and sixty-two Malay soldiers, besides one extra vuurwerker, one bombardier, two gunners and twelve musketeers, from the garrison, taking with them also two cannon of 3 lb and a kattkop* of 4 inches, with all their appurtenances. This force was also joined by the Naval Captains Fogel Abo and Jacob Frederiks, with some Malay soldiers and their officers, together with some armed European sailors from their ships, and\n\n* An obsolete piece of artillery.\nthe head administrator of the place, Abraham Couperus, who took with him between two and three hundred Chinese volunteers armed with pikes and other hand weapons.\n\nThis corps having approached the enemy's stockade on this side of Serabik began at half-past six or break of day to fire on it with the cannons, and the fight became general and lasted till about half-past nine; when although a breach had been made in the enemy's stockade and several shells had been thrown in, our men were obliged to retire on account of the excessive heat and their fatigue, and arrived together about 11 o'clock in the castle inside the town. The loss of the enemy could not be estimated, but that on our side consisted of one man killed, namely, the third mate of the ship *Dolphijn*, William Marse, and thirty-one wounded, among whom were the bombardier and four European sailors; the 2nd Lieutenant Daverg\u00e9 had three, and Captain Frederiks of the Navy one bullet through the hat.\n\nFeb. 26.\u2014A force of one captain, one lieutenant, one ensign, four sergeants, six corporals, and fifty Malay soldiers, including some volunteers, marched from the town lines to the garden of the late Serata Malek Fatullah, situated outside Tranquera, where they came into action with the enemy, in the course of which three of the soldiers were wounded, of whom one died of his wounds in the hospital, but it is supposed that the loss of the enemy must have been much greater because they retired hastily behind their intrenchments, and it was seen that several men were carried inside.\n\nFeb. 27.\u2014There were sent from the town lines to the outskirts of Tranquera, together with a few volunteers, Adrian Keek, the Captain-lieutenant of a regular company of volunteers, a Malay captain, two ensigns, four sergeants, six corporals and fifty privates, besides one gunner and four musketeers with a field-piece. This corps having advanced to the Lazarusfeld attacked the enemy's stockade erected there, and as it was at the same time shelled from the sea by the *Concordia* the enemy were soon forced to abandon it, taking with them, however, their ammunition, baggage, dead and wounded.\n\nIn the meantime it was getting dark and our force was therefore obliged to return, on which the enemy soon took possession again of the deserted and much shattered stockade. The loss on our side was one Malay soldier wounded.\n\nFeb. 29.\u2014At daybreak the ships which had gone to Telol,\nKatapen\u2014viz., the Dolphin, Piemont, Hoop, the cutters Patriot and Onderneem, and the galvett Concordia, attacked the Riouw vessels which were lying there disabled, most of them.\n\nMarch 3.\u2014On receipt of the news that a body of Selangorese and Mamakters had advanced as far as the garden of the late Malek Fuzzullah and were occupied in demolishing the dwelling-house on it, and throwing up breastworks, a detachment of troops and several volunteers were sent from the town lines to the spot, besides a bombardier, a gunner, and six native musketeers with a six-pounder, etc. This force having reached the garden met at first with some resistance, but the enemy, after losing some men, dead and wounded, who were soon carried away, speedily saved themselves by flight to the jungle behind the garden; the evening beginning to fall, our troops marched back and reached the lines about 6 o'clock, not having lost a single man, as only one native soldier and a volunteer were slightly wounded.\n\nMarch 4.\u2014At daybreak, a force marched out to the Lazarusveld, consisting of a corps of one hundred Malay soldiers under command of their officers, with one extra vuurwerker, one bombardier, two gunners, and twelve native musketeers, with two six-pounders, besides about eighty volunteers under command of their Captain-lieutenant Adrian Koek. They attacked the enemy's fortifications there, and twice drove them out, but as the enemy continually got reinforcements out of the surrounding wood, and the evening was coming on, they were obliged to retire with a loss on this occasion of five wounded, of whom two died.\n\nMarch 6.\u2014The cutter Patriot, on board of which was Heer Roger Abo, Naval Captain, was sent to the north to attack, and if possible destroy, the Selangore vessels which were reported to be lying between Tandjong Kling and Cape Ratjalo.\n\nMarch 7.\u2014The cutter Patriot which left yesterday returned from the north. The particulars of the expedition and its result are given in an extract of Captain Abo's report to the Honourable the Government of India.\n\nMarch 13.\u2014News was received that the enemy were busy constructing a new stockade on the side of the Vriesenberg, so Lieutenant Siegelitz, who was posted at Bandalibera, and the ex-Ensign of the Burghers, Michael Klaar, were sent out with one hundred and fifty native and ten European soldiers, besides the ordinary vuurwerker Du Halden, one extra gunner and six native musketeers, with one six-pounder and a corps of volunteers. They marched\nthere and drove the enemy back into their intrenchments up to the side of the road towards Semahok, which intrenchments they afterwards attacked, but the enemy made so brave a resistance and our troops were so exhausted from the great heat, that the latter, seeing no chance of taking the place, were obliged to retire. Our loss was two men killed and thirteen wounded, but that of the enemy it was impossible to estimate, for they kept always in the wood, and behind their fortifications, but it was observed that at several points breaches were made.\n\nMarch 14. The outer batteries in the Boenga Raju were attacked several times last night by the enemy, and the Lieutenant posted there, Nicholas Christian Vetter, hearing from native scouts that they had thrown up some intrenchments on the road to Pangkalanramia, he marched out with a corps of one hundred men, attacked the enemy in their fortifications, put them to flight, and destroyed their works, without suffering any loss whatever on this occasion, while that of the enemy, as far as could be seen from those who were carried off to the jungle, must have been, more or less, eighteen men, one of these who was taken by us, was immediately decapitated and his head was brought to town and stuck on a pole outside the town lines.\n\nMarch 19. Nothing noteworthy happened, except that, like most nights, first one, then another of the outposts was attacked by the enemy, but they are always repelled without doing any harm.\n\nMarch 20. In the afternoon a vessel was seen towards the south, which seemed to be making for this port, and as it was supposed that it was the steamer of Her Majesty's German, of Batavia, which had left for Padang, the pantjalan Philippine was sent to the ship to bring her up to the roads; but to our great astonishment it was noticed that the little ship, which afterwards was seen to be a packet-boat, made many manoeuvres to escape from the pantjalan which continued to give chase, but the darkness soon prevented our seeing the ships from the land.\n\nMarch 21. At daybreak the pantjalan Philippine and the packet-boat which came in sight yesterday were seen at anchor in the roads. The commander of the first-mentioned craft reported, on landing, that it was the packet-boat of the Englishman James Scott, coming from Brouw and bound for Selangeer; that though he had ordered him to strike sail, he continued to sail away, and as he\n\n*The eastern suburb of Malacca town\nsaw him making all sorts of manoeuvres to escape, and the owner was a suspected smuggler; he forced him to come to the roads, and had taken Scott himself on board of the Hooper Linden.*\n\nMarch 22.\u2014The armed ship Hoop and the cutter Patriot sailed in the morning to Telok Katapan to fight the enemy.\n\nMarch 23.\u2014The ships Hoop and Patriot, which were sent yesterday to Telok Katapan, came back today; the result of the expedition and what they did may be seen from the extract of the journal kept by Naval Lieutenant Hartog.\n\nMarch 28\u2014Up to this date nothing noteworthy happened except that almost every night we were disturbed by the enemy, and that a few volunteers outside now and then had a skirmish with some of them.\n\nMarch 29.\u2014At daybreak there marched out of the fort under command of Lieutenant Anthony Stecher, Ensign Duverge and Lintner and ex-Ensign of the Burghers Kihann, a detachment of fifty-seven European and two hundred and twenty Malay soldiers, besides the ordinary and extra vuurwerkers Dichtland Groenewout, one bombardier, a konstabel, three kanonniers and thirty native and Chinese musketeers with two 6 lb. and two 3 lb. guns, a howitzer and a small gun with their appurtenances. Having arrived in the Bandailhera they were divided into three columns or divisions, of which one under Lieutenant Stecher was posted at Boekit Tamporang, the second under sub-Lieutenant Lintner marched towards Semabok, and the third under command of Ensign Duverge and Kihann to the sandhock, both the first engaged in fight with the enemy, while the third coming from the sandhock right through the jungle fell on the enemy's battery on the rear, when the fight became general and desperate, so that the enemy were forced by Duverge's corps twice to retire from one of their batteries, but a swamp, which lay between, prevented them from advancing to take the battery which was much shattered. The enemy profited by this to make some hasty repairs, took possession again, and defended it as obstinately as before, and this lasted until midday, when, on account of the fierce heat and fatigue, the troops were obliged to retire. The defences of the enemy were greatly damaged, some shells and grenades having exploded inside them, but their loss of men cannot be exactly estimated, but it must have been very great,\n\n* See mention of Scott in Capt. Leemon's diary (1795), Journ. Str. Br. R. A. S., No. 7, p. 53.\nfor at first when the fight became general it was observed from Mount St John that fifteen or sixteen men, who must have been dead or badly wounded, were carried away from their earthworks further towards Semabok; the loss on our side consisted of one killed, Corporal Evans Baving, and eleven wounded, of whom one was a European soldier.\n\nMarch 31.\u2014An alarm was sounded in the town lines on its being signalled from Boekit Tjina that the enemy were on the march to Boenga Raja, but soon afterwards it was reported that having been welcomed by some cannon shots they had turned back again.\n\nApril 1.\u2014The enemy resumed their design of yesterday, and marched from all sides to Boenga Raja, probably to see whether they could break through these, but after some shots had been fired at them from the heavy gun they retired in the same way.\n\nApril 8.\u2014Up to the 8th nothing noteworthy occurred, except a few small encounters between our men and the enemy's partisans.\n\nApril 11.\u2014In the evening at about 10 o'clock the enemy attacked at the same time the outer batteries of Boenga Raja and Bandail-hera and the one under Boekit Tjina, but after firing had gone on for an hour with some intervals they were obliged to draw back without having caused us any damage or loss.\n\nApril 13.\u2014Towards the evening the Selangoerees and their hangers-on attacked the Adnese of the Company's service who were encamped on the road to Gerestein, but after a fight of a good half hour they were obliged to retreat to the jungle, likewise a troop of them who let themselves be seen on the field behind the Tranquera gardens, after a few rounds of grape-shot from the town, were forced to follow their comrades' example.\n\nApril 15.\u2014At break of day there marched out to the enemy's batteries on the side of the road to Semabok, under general command of Herr Johan Andrea Hensel, Captain of Militia, Lieut. and Ensigns Anthony Stecher, Johan Gottfried Maurer and Johan Godfried Luttner, with a corps of thirty European and two hundred and twenty-seven Malay soldiers, a company of negro volunteers under their Captain-Lieutenant Adrian Kock, the ordinary and extra vuurwerkers Dehl and Groenewout, one bombardier, three kanonniers, forty-four native and Chinese musketeers, and the necessary coochees, taking with them a 24-pounder cannon, two six-pounders and two three-pounders together with a 4-inch howitzer and all\nappurtenance. Having got close to the enemy's batteries they began to fire, but the ground being soft and muddy the 24-pounder, after a few shots had been fired, sank so deep that it had to be unmounted and afterwards taken back. A 12 lb gun was seen instead, but for the same reason\u2014the softness of the ground\u2014little use could be made of it; and it was again with the 6 and 3-pounders that they continued to fire on the enemy's batteries. The enemy made a bold resistance, and the fight became general and severe, and several bombs were thrown into their fortifications, but though it was seen that some burst inside, it was impossible to drive the enemy out.\n\nIt was as impracticable to pierce the defences with our guns, from the thickness and strength of the walls, as to make use of the hindering quagmire to storm it, without recklessly sacrificing the greater number of the men, and as all were very exhausted by the cruel heat, it was considered advisable at 2 o'clock to march back. As the enemy did not come out of the defences their losses in this action could not be ascertained, but on our side two men were killed on the spot, and thirteen wounded, three mortally.\n\nIn the meantime the cutters Patriot and Onderneem with the pantjalang Rustenburg sailed to Telok Katapan to harass the enemy from that side.\n\nApril 16-19. Every night we were disturbed by the enemy, once outside Tranquira and the road to Gereitem, once in Boenga Raja and the battery at the foot of Bukit Tjuna, and in the Bandailhera, but they were always driven back without the loss of a single man. Also there were daily skirmishes between our men and the enemy.\n\nApril 21.\u2014This morning a company of our men under command of a captain, an ensign, and three subordinate officers, with fifty Malay soldiers, marched from Boenga Raja to Prunzei where they came into conflict with a company of the enemy, put them to flight, and got possession of one of their killed, whose head they cut off and stuck on a pole at Pangkalanrama.\n\nApril 22.\u2014The bark Girunda Susanna and the hooker Hoendhaai sailed to Tundjong Kling to look for some Selangoer vessels which were reported to be at anchor on the north side of the point.\n\nApril 24.\u2014A patrol of forty Malays left the batteries in the Bandailhera, and went towards Oedjong Pusor, where they fought with a band of the enemy. On our side one man was killed and one wounded.\nApril 25.\u2014Under command of Lieut. Henry van Nijenheim a detachment consisting of 3 officers, 4 sergeants, 6 corporals, 1 drummer, 170 Malay soldiers, 1 ex-Malay soldier, 3 kanonniers, and 18 native and Chinese musketeers, with two 3-pounder guns complete, was sent to Oedjong Pasir in order to attack and if possible take possession of the strong fortifications which the enemy had made there, but they met with so bold and determined a resistance that in the afternoon a Council of War ordered retreat to be sounded. On our side five men were killed and six wounded, and though the loss of the enemy could not be ascertained it was believed from the circumstances to have been considerable.\n\nApril 26, 27, 28.\u2014Every night the enemy attacked our outer batteries in the Bandailhera, but each time were forced by our firing to retreat.\n\nMay 2.\u2014In the evening at past 9 o'clock the enemy attacked simultaneously our batteries in the Buenga Roja and the Bandailhera, besides the one under Bockit Tjina. On account of this an alarm was sounded in the town and every one was under arms. The cannonade and musketry lasted at intervals until half-past eleven when the enemy retired and everything became quiet, except that now and then the whole night through there were occasional shots. These were fired at small parties of the enemy, who were seen now on one side, then on another, creeping along the ground and coming close under our fortification, evidently with the intention of setting it on fire and creating a confusion, when a fresh attack might be made from outside.\n\nMay 5\u2014A sampan arrived from Siak, manned by five persons, and having on board Abdul Baheer, Envoy of the old King of Siak, Radja Mohammad Ali. He brought a letter from this Prince to the Hon'ble Heer Pieter Gerardus de Bruijn, Governor and Director of this town and fortress. Also arrived via Siak from Trengano the Malay, Abdul Mochit, who had been sent there on commission in 1783, bringing a letter from the King of Trengano to the Governor.\n\nMay 6.\u2014The Ambassador from Radja Mohammad Ali, who arrived yesterday, was sent back with a letter from the Governor to the Prince.\n\nThe cutter Ondermeer and the bark Gertruida Susanna sailed to Telok Katapun, and with the Patriot, which was there already, bombarded the enemy's vessels lying in the bay.\nMay 7.\u2014The ships continued a cannonade at intervals at Telok Katapan until sundown.\n\nMay 8.\u2014Under command of Lieuts. Duverge' and Kiliaan there were sent to Oedjong Pasir a sergeant, a corporal, a drummer and twelve European soldiers, together with two officers, ten subordinate officers, and seventy-eight native soldiers, a gunner, bombardier and twelve musketeers, and the necessary coolies with one six-pounder gun and one three-pounder. Their object was to alarm the enemy and keep them occupied, so as to prevent them from attacking our men who were cutting the jungle round and making a new stockade nearer to the enemy than those already existing.\n\nThis was done with so much success that the labourers finished their work without being disturbed, and the following night a party was stationed in the new stockade. Besides this the enemy's works were much damaged and several breaches made in them, but on our side only two musketeers were wounded. In the night between eleven and twelve o'clock the enemy attacked the newly erected and still unfinished stockade at Oedjong Pasir, but met with so determined a resistance from our men posted inside that they had to retire.\n\nMay 9. At 3 A.M they renewed the attack, but could not succeed in taking it, and for the second time were obliged to return to their own fortifications, where a party had been working the whole night to repair yesterday's damage.\n\nMay 11.\u2014The man-of-war Hof ter Linden left for Telok Katapan in order, with the ships already there, to blockade the place and to prevent the escape of Radja Hadiji's ships as well as to keep out hostile reinforcements.\n\nMay 14. The old King of Siak, Radja Mohamad Ali, arrived with a pandjadjar and two kakaps manned with a crew of 78 men from the Straits of Moerong, and in the afternoon the Fiscal, E. Fran\u00e7ois Thiersens, the Lieut Meester, Mr. E. Hoijuck van Papendrecht, and the first sworn clerk of the Police, Baumgarten, went on board his ship to welcome him. They accompanied him to land and as far as the Government House, and after his Highness had remained with the Honourable the Governor for about half-an-hour he was conducted to the house of the widow Verbrugge, which had been prepared for him, outside the Tranquera gate. On landing, a salute of nine guns was fired from the castle walls; and from the great gate up to the steps of Government\nHouse, where the Governor himself received him, the road was lined by a double row of soldiers who presented arms as he passed.\n\nMay 16. In the evening, at about 9 o'clock, the enemy first attacked St John's Hill and the outer batteries in the Bandailhers, and soon after the stockade at the foot of Boekit Tjina and our fortification on this hill, stretching towards Boenga Raja and Pangkaburama; the fierceness of their attack made everyone believe that they meant to venture on a general storm, for in spite of the shot and grape poured on them from our side they still held their ground and kept up a continual fire with their blunder-busses and mantakas till about eleven o'clock, when they again withdrew. In the quarter held by the Selangorese and their party an attack was made on our batteries outside the Tranquera gate but with no better success, for our men there also made a good resistance, and after firing on either side had lasted till about twelve o'clock, the enemy had to retreat to their defences.\n\nMay 18. At ten o'clock at night, the enemy again attacked St John's Hill, and the outer batteries in the Bandailhers, besides those at Boekit Tjina, and as it was noticed from the hill that a strong force was marching towards Boenga Raja, the alarm was sounded in the town, and everyone was under arms till about twelve o'clock, but nothing more was heard of the enemy.\n\nMay 23. At nine o'clock at night the enemy renewed the frequent but unsuccessful attack on our batteries in the Bandailhers and at the foot of Boekit Tjina, and firing on both sides lasted till about ten o'clock, when they suddenly and hastily withdrew, and from the lamentation which was heard from St John's Hill it was supposed that they had suffered some extraordinary loss.\n\nMay 29.\u2014In the morning at sunrise six ships and six smaller vessels were observed from St Paul's Hill, one of which was far ahead. This vessel came to anchor in the roads at eight o'clock, and about nine the Commanding Lieutenant landed and reported to the Hon'ble Heer Pieter Gerardus de Bruijn, Governor and Director of this town and fortress, that the name of his vessel was the cutter Batavier, that it belonged to the fleet now in sight, which was under command of the Hon'ble Heer Jacob Pieter van Braam, Admiral-in-Chief of the East India squadron, which consisted of the warships Utrecht, Gees, Wassenaar, Mouilkenboom, and\nJuno and the Company's ship Heiloopen, the lighters Haas and Vos, and the sloop Volle Maan. The Ondermeer, which had been despatched from here to the south on the 22nd instant, was also with them.\n\nJune 1.\u2014The Utrecht, Goea, Wussenaar, Monnikendam, and Juno, with the cutter Botanier, and the lighters Haas and Vos, sailed to Telok Katapan at daybreak.\n\nJune 5.\u2014Early in the morning the fleet at Telok Katapan began to bombard the enemy's ships lying near the shore, and their fortifications, and continued this until midday. Also a detachment was sent from this to Oedjong Pasir and Semabok under command of four European Officers, consisting of two Non-commissioned Officers, a drummer and twenty-four European soldiers; together with four Officers, sixteen subordinate Officers, and five hundred Malay soldiers, and one extra vuurwerker, three bombardiers, three kanonmers, and forty musketeers, with one 24-pounder cannon, two six pounders, one twelve-pounder, two three-pounders, a howitzer and a katskop each of 4-inch. This detachment having approached sufficiently close to the enemy's batteries began the attack at the same time both on the road to Semabok and at Oedjong Pasir; the enemy, however, offered everywhere a skilful resistance, and the fight became general, and lasted until four o'clock in the afternoon, when our side had to cease and turn back, on account of the fatigue of the men. Besides, the evening was approaching, and the marshy ground prevented our men from getting close enough to the enemy's stockade to be able to storm it.\n\nSeveral shells and grenades were thrown inside and exploded, and twice it was observed that a blaze sprung up which, however, was soon extinguished. The loss on the enemy's side could not be ascertained; ours was four killed and thirteen wounded.\n\nJune 6.\u2014Under command of a European Officer a detachment of three hundred and five Malay soldiers was again sent to Oedjong Pasir, with three bombardiers, two kanonmers, and fourteen musketeers, and two cannon of 6lb and 8lb and a 4-inch katskop but the marshy ground again prevented them from getting near enough the enemy's intrenchments to fire with good effect, so after annoying them a short time they retired.\n\nJune 8.\u2014In the Company's armed ship Diamond were despatched to Telok Katapan to be employed in the expedition there, two\ntown and fortress, the Fiscal, E. Fran\u00e7ois Thierens, Sabandar Hoijuck van Papendrecht, and Secretary Baumgarten went to Telok Katapan in order to congratulate the Hon'ble River Jacob Pieter van Braam, Admiral of the East India Squadron, on his victory of yesterday, and at sunrise a salute of 21 guns was fired from the castle walls in honour of the joyful event.\n\nA detachment of one European officer and two non-commissioned officers, a drummer, and twenty-six soldiers, with two Malay upper and two under officers and forty-nine soldiers, were sent out to protect the coolies who were employed to bring in spoil, and to destroy the enemy's fortifications to the east of this fortress and on the road to Telok Katapan. Another detachment, under command of Lieut Nicholas Christian Vetter, marched from Boenga Raja to Prungga, to turn the enemy out from there, but they found the works already abandoned; so, after knocking them down and setting fire to them, they returned.\n\nSome of the Malacca soldiers who followed the enemy to Telok Katapan yesterday, reported on their return, to-day, that they had found on the battlefield a wounded Bugis, and on asking him where Radja Hadji had gone, he told them that not only had he heard that Radja Hadji was killed, but also, immediately after the attack on the biggest stockade, he had seen a body carried away by two men in a kind of hang mat, and supposed it to be that of Radja Hadji, because it was followed by some well-dressed women.\n\nAt night about 11 o'clock the Selangorese attacked our fortifications on the Tranquera road and those near Gerestein, but they were speedily forced by our guns to retire.\n\nJune 20.\u2014A force was sent to Oedjong Pasir and to Telok Katapan, for the same purpose and in the same way as on the 19th.\n\nJune 21.\u2014This detachment, returning to-day, brought back with them a Bugis of the name of Akker, whom they had found in the jungle. This man, on being questioned, said that he had been in Radja Hadji's stockade when it was stormed by the Europeans, and that Radja Hadji was killed by a shot through the breast; that his body was afterwards carried away in a hang mat on a pole by the Panghalee of Padang and a slave, and followed by some women; that he had joined the party and seen that they laid the body in a small thicket which he could show them, and afterwards had fled, surely for fear of being overtaken by the Europeans, who meanwhile had taken possession of everything.\nThe ship Hoop, the hooker Handelaar, and the galaret Concordia left for Tandjong Kling where the Getrudia Susanna had been lying so long to prevent the escape of the Selangoer vessels from Batang Tiga Bay.\n\nJune 22.\u2014The Bugis Akier, who was found in the jungle and brought up here yesterday, with the Malay Intjeh Mangsoer, and a few men to protect them, were sent to Telok Katapan, the former to point out the body of Radja Hadji, and the latter, who knew the Prince well, to identify it.\n\nIntjeh Mangsoer, returning in the afternoon, declared that when he came to Telok Katapan with the prisoner Akier, the latter had shewn him between that place and Tandjong Pallas an unburied dead body, which he recognised unmistakably as that of Radja Hadji, not only by the figure and the short teeth, in which he differed from other Bugis, but also by the scar of a wound on his thigh, which he had got at Lingga in a previous war against the Company.\n\nJune 23.\u2014Three European officers, and four non-commissioned officers, two drummers and forty-eight soldiers, with four Malay upper and fourteen under officers and one hundred and ninety-six soldiers, were sent from the outskirts of Tranquera to Tandjong Kling, in order to turn out the enemy also from this side of the town, but on coming up to the enemy's stockades they found them deserted, so after destroying them they set them on fire.\n\nThe Malays Madjid and Amien were sent to Telok Katapan this morning for a further examination of the body of Radja Hadji at Tandjong Pallas, and on their return they declared that having inspected it carefully, and noticed the scar mentioned by the Malay Mangsoer, and the bare shaven head, and also a black circular mark, pointed out by Amien, who knew that Radja Hadji bore such a mark, they recognised the body as that of Radja Hadji, and were convinced that it could be none other than that of the Prince. In the evening there returned from Telok Katapan the men-of-war Ulrecht, Goes, Wassenaar, Princess Louisa, Monnikendam and Jeno, and the Company's armed vessels Hof ter Linden and Diamant, together with the smaller boats which had been there.\n\nJune 24.\u2014This morning the Governor sent the chief of the Achinese, Posanjun, with some Malays to Telok Katapan, with an escort of twenty-four native soldiers, in order to put the body of Radja Hadji into a coffin and bring it in. They arrived late in the evening in the Bandalhera, and remained in the outer battery till the next morning, when they brought the body inside the fort,\nwhere it was buried at the foot of St. Paul's Hill, behind the artillery store. The Achinese chief, Pesaijen, assured the Governor that he recognised the body as that of Radja Hadji whom he had known during his long residence in Riouw.\n\n**June 25** In the morning at 2 o'clock we were awakened by a loud report, and afterwards learnt with great sorrow that the Company's armed ship *Dolphijn*, which was lying in the roads, had blown up with all her crew on board, and only one body was found\u2014viz., that of the piper Rijk Adelaar. A Chinaman and four Javanese escaped, but they could give no account of how the disaster happened; for they were asleep, and were awakened by the shock. So of this dreadful occurrence nothing farther is known than what is told in the journal of the nearest ship, the *Hinlopen*, which puts the list of killed at a total of two hundred and three persons.\n\n**July 13**\u2014Then sailed for Selangoer the ships *Utrecht*, *Goes*, the *Princess Louise* and *Wassenaar*, besides the barks *Constantia* and *Gertruda Susanna*, the pantjlanges *Rustenberg* and *Geduld*, the galviet *Concordia*, the sloop *Volle Maan*, *Hans* and *Voe*,\u2020 with some armed native boats belonging to the old King of Sink, Radja Mohamad Ali.\n\nThere also departed for Selangoer, distributed among these ships, one lieutenant, one ensign, one corporal, one drummer and twelve European soldiers, together with two hundred and forty Malay soldiers under command of their officers, thirty-one in all.\n\n**July 22** There were sent besides to Riouw, the men-of-war the *Hof ter Linden* and *Diamant*, with a further reinforcement of two ensigns, four non-commissioned officers, and eighteen Malay soldiers.\n\n**Aug 1,** \u2020 Arrived from Selangoer the Company's pantjlang *Geduld* with a letter from the Hon'ble Admiral van Braam to the Hon'ble Heer Pieter Gerardus de Bruijn, Governor and Director of this town and fortress, communicating the news of the defeat of Radja Brahima, King of Selangoer, and his followers, and of the conquest of that kingdom on the 2nd instant by the victorious arms of the Company's fleet under the skilful and prudent direction of the said Heer van Braam; which joyful event was made known to the community by a salute of 21 guns from the castle walls.\n\n**Aug 21**\u2014A communication was received from Selangoer by the bark *Constantia*, from the newly proclaimed king of that country,\n\n* Full Moon. \u2020 Hans and Fox.\n\u2020 This date is evidently wrong, as the victory of the 2nd is announced.\nRadja Mohammad Ali, besides one from the commandant there, Lieut. Gerardus Smits, dated 9th and 13th instant, and addressed to the Hon'ble Heer Pieter Gerardus de Bruijn, Governor, etc.\n\nAug. 30 \u2014 The men-of-war Utrecht and Wassenaar arrived from Selangor bringing a letter from the old Prince of Sia, Radja Mohammad Ali, now proclaimed King of Selangor.\n\nSept 2 Hadji Mahmut, Envoy of Radja Ali, calling himself Regent of Johor and Pahang, arrived from Riouw in a kakap, armed with two small cannon, with a crew of fifteen men, bringing a letter from that Prince to the Governor and Council, dated August 19th.\n\nSept 4 The Company's pantjalangs Bliton and Banka were despatched to Riouw, with a letter from the Governor and Council to Captains Christian Frederik Winterheim and Jacob Frederiks, commanding the men-of-war Hofter Linden and Diamant, there at anchor, dated this day.\n\nSept 15 \u2014 The Company's bark Constantia and pantjalang Geduld left for Riouw with a communication from the Governor and Council to Captain Jacob Frederiks, commanding the Company's men-of-war and smaller ships in the roads there.\n\nSept 19. The Concordia, Patriot, Batavier and Ondermeer, with the Huas, returned from Selangor, and in the first-named vessel arrived the King of Selangor, formerly Prince of Sia, Radja Mohammad Ali, who was escorted to land by two lieutenants of the Utrecht.\n\nOct 7. The Batavier, Patriot, Concordia, with the lighters Huas and Vos, were sent to Riouw, the first named bearing a letter from the Governor and Council to Captain Jacob Frederiks, commanding the Company's ships in the roads of Riouw.\n\nOct 10 The men-of-war Utrecht, Goes, the Wassenaar, Princess Louisa, Monnikendam and Juna, with the Hullooopen, left for Riouw under command of Admiral van Braam, and were saluted with 15 guns from the castle walls, and a return salute of the same number was fired from the Utrecht.\n\nOct 17 The Company's pantjalang Banka arrived from Riouw bringing a letter from Captain Jacob Frederiks dated 6th inst., with the annexed papers according to the accompanying Register, and one from Lieut Johannes de Frem, commanding the Hofter Linden, dated 6th inst., both addressed to the Governor and\nCouncil. By the same ship arrived Captain Christian Frederik Winterheim.\n\nOct. 20. The Company's ship Mars arrived from Batavia with the Hon'ble Naval Captains Egidius van Braam and J. C. Verheul.\n\nNov. 2. The ship Mars was sent to Riouw to convey provisions and stores to the Batavia fleet and to the Company's ships Patriot and Concordia. By her also left Captains Egidius van Braam and J. C. Verheul, who had arrived on October 20th.\n\nNov. 11.\u2014A fishing boat sent out to the Ondernemer, which since yesterday had been in sight, brought back a letter from Lieutenant Haas with the pleasant news that Riouw had been taken by the Company.\n\nNov. 12. The Ondernemer came in, with a despatch from Admiral van Braam to the Governor Pieter Gerardus de Bruijn, communicating the news of a severe battle on the 29th October, in which the Netherlands arms, under the skilful and prudent direction of the said Hon'ble Heer van Braam, had been a glorious victory; and that in the night of the 30th-31st, the Bugis with Radja Ali at their head had taken flight, and afterwards the legitimate successor of the Djobor house, Radja Mahomed, with the Chinese and Malaya resident in Riouw, had capitulated. This joyful event was made generally known by a salute of 21 guns.\n\nNov. 15.\u2014The Mara, which had left on the 2nd, returned from Riouw.\n\nDec. 10. The Company's bark Constantia, the Ondernemer and the lighters Hose and Van arrived from Riouw, bringing a letter from the Commandant there, Jacob Christian Vetter and one from the King of Djobor and Palang, both directed to the Governor and Council, and dated, respectively, November 30th and 1st instant.\n\nDec. 23.\u2014The Company's pantjaloong Bliton left for Riouw, and by her was sent a letter dated yesterday from the Hon'ble Heer Pieter Gerardus de Bruijn, Governor and Director of this town and fortress, and the Council, to Lieutenant Jacob Christian Vetter, Commandant, and to Secretary Abraham Maurits Falena, second in the Company's garrison at Riouw, and sent over by this vessel.\n\nDec. 28. The armed ships Diamant and the Hof ter Linden were sent to Batavia.\nThe invasion of an European settlement by a Malay force and an attack upon a fortified town, in which there were some, if only a few, disciplined troops, seem to us, fortunately, at this period, to be events which are beyond the bounds of possibility. It is noteworthy, however, that the invaders found supporters among the Malacca Malays. The villagers of Duyong (see verse eighteen of the ballad and the entry under February 15th in the Dutch record) joined Raja Haji, and a first success on the part of a Mohammadan enemy might at any time influence the loyalty of a Malay peasantry.\n\nThe arrest of De Wind mentioned by Begbie is not alluded to in the Dutch official diary, and whereas from Begbie's account one would gather that Captain Abo's ship was blown up before the relief of the town by the arrival of Admiral van Braam's fleet, it is clear from the diary that the loss of the Dolphin did not occur until Raju Hajj had been defeated, killed and buried, and not until nearly a month after the arrival of the fleet from Knoww.\n\nA proof of the arrival of Raja Mohamed Ali, of Sukk, the Malay author says Malay pandey mem-bad lupa, \"The Malay is skilled in fraud,\" and it is clear that the Dutch felt very uncertain of the value of his professions of friendship, and supposed that he would, if admitted within the fort, intrigue with the enemy outside. He was therefore lodged in the Tranquebar suburb, with \"the widow Verbrugge,\" the widow, perhaps, of Mr Ary Verbrugge, whose name appears as an envoy to Perak in the native chronicles of that State (see Journal Str. Br. R.A.S., Notes and Queries, p. 31). Begbie says, \"Tuankoo Mahomed Ali came over from Suk during these commotions ostensibly to assist the Dutch, by whom he was kindly received and allotted a residence in Tranquebar, it not being deemed prudent to admit him within the walls of the fort.\"\n\nRaja Mohamed Ali's retention of the position given to him by the Dutch (see entry in the official record under 21st August), as King of Selangor was a very brief one. Raja Ibrahim re-took his fort and kingdom in 1783 and the Suk adventurer returned to Sumatra and is not recognised by the Malays as ever having really been Raja of Selangor.\n\nThe Malay ballad concludes with a reference to the arrival of the widow of Raja Haji from Knoww to beg for the corpse of her husband. This was apparently refused and a guard placed over\nthe grave to prevent the abstraction of the body. Regarding this\nthe Dutch record is silent. It was not until a few years ago, when\nthe new High School was being built, that the bones of the\ndeceased warrior were disinterred and taken to Riau where they\nnow lie. With their removal the Malaccan Malays lost a place of\npious visitation and payment of vows (bayar niat).\n\nThis paper would not be complete without a translation of the\nMalay prose account of Raja Haji's war with the Dutch, which is\nto be found in a MS chronicle of the Malayo-Bugs Rajas of the\nStraits of Malacca, written by Raja Ali, of Riau, in A.H. 1288,\nand called by the author \"Tuhfat-al-nafis.\" It is always interest-\ning to note the point of view from which the native historian\nregards events. The version which the Malays possess as history\nis as follows:\n\n\"Sultan Mahmud was reigning in Riau* and Raja Haji had not\nlong been Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda when the Yang-di-per-Tuan\nof Selangor, Sultan Saleh-ed-Din fell ill and soon afterwards died.\"\n\n\"Information of this event was duly forwarded by his chiefs to\nRiau and Raja Haji appointed his successor\u2014Raja Ibrahim, son\nof the deceased Sultan, became Yang-di-per-Tuan Besar and Raja\nNala was made Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda.\"\n\n\"Raja Haji had governed Riau and its dependencies as Yang-\ndi-per-Tuan Muda for about eight years when there befell an\nordinance of God, who is all-powerful and who causes His will to\noperate upon all His servants according to His plans and makes\nthem know how despicable is this transitory life with its passing\npleasures, so that they may not love this world but set their\naffections on a hereafter which shall be enduring and the pleasures\nand kingdom of which shall be exceeding great, as God says in\nthe Koran: 'When ye shall see it\u2014that is, the life hereafter\u2014ye\nshall see delights and a kingdom that are exceeding great.' In\nseveral succeeding verses are described the insignificance of this\nworld and the pleasures of the life to come.\"\n\n*Riau is the transliteration of \u0631\u06cc\u0648, the town which the Dutch\ncall \"Riau\" and the English \"Riau.\" This is probably connected in\nderivation with \u0631\u06cc\u0648, riyah or riyah, noise, noisy, loud sounds (of joy or\ndistress), but in Von De Wall's Malay Dictionary the words are given as\nquite distinct \u0631\u06cc\u0648, riyah, naam der bekende; hoofdplaats, and \u0631\u06cc\u0648, riyah,\nlandruiterij; woeling.\n\"The beginning of the events which led to Riau being embroiled in war, and eventually being captured, is ascribed to two different causes. The first account, which I have obtained from the local histories of Siak and Selangor, corroborated by the statements of old men who were alive at the time of the events about to be described and took part in them, is as follows\u2014Raja Haji, the Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda of Riau, made a convention with the Dutch East India Company by which it was agreed that the enemies of the Company should be the enemies of Raja Haji also, and that all prizes and booty should be divided equally between the allies, if Raja Haji took part in the operations. Subsequently there came to Riau a vessel, belonging to enemies of the Dutch, and she anchored at Pulau Bayan. Thereupon Raja Haji caused information to be given to the Governor of Malacca, and there came a Dutch ship from Malacca who attacked the one anchored at Pulau Bayan and the latter was captured and taken away to Malacca with all her cargo. There she was adjudged to be a prize according to the custom of war. Nevertheless, Raja Haji did not get any share. He started for Malacca to enquire as to this and got as far as Muar, where he was met by a Dutch official sent by the Governor of Malacca to discuss the matter with him. The name of this gentleman, as given in the chronicle of Selangor, was Se\u00f1or Bram, but some people say that his real name was Abraham Vergil. The Capitan Malaya of Malacca accompanied him. Raja Haji represented to the two agents of the Governor of Malacca that the prize had been taken in consequence of information given by him, and further that she had been taken in the harbour of Riau, in his territory, and demanded his share. The agents of the Governor of Malacca refused to entertain his complaint and hence arose misunderstandings and dissatisfaction which culminated in war. This is one account of the origin of the war, as set out in the chronicle of Selangor and as given by old men who have related what they knew.\"\n\n\"But there is another account which I have found in the chronicles of Lingga and Riau, compiled by Ungku Basu, the father of Ungku Awak of Dungun. According to this, Raja Kechil, Tim Dalan, the Yang-di-per-Tuan of Trengganu, took counsel with Captain Klaus\u2020\n\n* Vergil is evidently an attempt at Vedge, the name of a well-known Malacca family. But the emissary was not called Abraham Vedge, but Abraham de Windt. See Begbie's narrative above.\n\n\u2020 Captain Klaus, an Englishman, is mentioned in connection with Trengganu by Begbie, *The Malayan Peninsula*, p. 88.\"\nhow to bring about the destruction of Riau. Now the Yang-di-per-Tuan of Trenggau had a Chinese girl whom he had just caused to become a Muhammadan, giving her the name of Si Jamilah. Captain Klasi asked for her and Raja Kechil, Tun Dalam, gave her to him, asking him in return to do something to bring about a fight at Kwala Riau, so as to set the people of Riau against the Dutch Company. Captain Klasi cohabited with Jamilah who became pregnant, and when he left for Riau to provoke the promised disturbance with the French.* At Kwala Riau he left Jamilah under the charge of his brother, Captain Gadis, and directed him to convey her to China. While Captain Klasi was away at Riau Captain Gadis sailed for China, but by the decree of God most high, when he was off Tanjong Lalabi on the coast of Trenggau a tremendous gale came on and his ship was wrecked and all the Hollanders on board were drowned, not one being saved, and Si Jamilah perished with the rest. Besides this ship, about one hundred and ten prahus were lost in this storm, including a number of prahus from Sambas of various sizes and the boat (sulub, Dutch sloep) of the Yang-di-per-Tuan, Raja Kechil, Tun Dalam, himself. This, it is said, is the story of the secret cause of the troubles.\n\n\"To return to our history, when the Governor of Malacca refused to entertain the claims of Raja Haji the latter sent back his convention with the Dutch Company, saying that one side observed it and the other side did not, and having done this he returned to Riau. The Governor of Malacca was angry at the return of the documents and he took counsel with the Admiral (Raja Laut), named Pieter Jacob van Braam. Another version, however, gives the name of the Dutch Naval Commander as Tuan Abo. During the consultations, calumnies and injurious reports of all kinds were carried to the Governor of Malacca and to the Admiral to the effect that the Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda of Riau, Raja Haji, was about to attack Malacca and had fitted out an expedition for this purpose. Then said the Governor of Malacca to Admiral van Braam, 'Raja Haji is going to attack Malacca\u2014let us go and attack him first.' So a Dutch expedition set forth with ever so many ships\n\n* It was a French ship that took the English merchantman, according to Begbie. The story of the connivance of the master of the latter is, of course, absurd. The surname Geddes would correspond with what is written in Malay Gede. The Malay author would not understand that Geddes could not be the brother of Glass. If the ship that went down off Trenggau was an English vessel, as seems probable, the author makes a mistake in describing her crew as \"Hollanders.\"\nof war and armed ketches (kichi prang) to invade Riau and block-\nade the port, hindering the entry of trading-boats. Raja Haji was\nfurious at this, and he issued forth with a number of boats and\nthere was a great fight. Lagum! lagum! terrific was the noise of\nthe cannon, just like a thunderbolt cleaving the mountains, and\nthe smoke from the muskets obscured Kwela Riau like a mist, and\nloud were the shouts of the combatants, and the war-cries of the\nBugis (kilong musong).\"\n\n\"This went on till the evening when both sides ceased fighting,\nand at nightfall the ships stood out to sea and half of the\npenjajaps re-entered the Riau river. Next day the fight was\nresumed with a tremendous cannonade from guns and belas and\nranti-belas on both sides and at night they again stopped. This went\non daily for over so many months without either side giving in and\nrice and all kinds of provisions were dear, for trading-boats could\nonly enter with difficulty, being intercepted by the ships of war,\nsometimes they got through and sometimes they did not.\"\n\n\"Raja Haji caused stockades to be erected at Tanjong Pinang and\nTelok Kreting and Pulau Peningat and manned each with a\nsufficient force of defenders. The stockade at Peningat was manned\nby Santan men and the large penjajaps which carried cannon were\nranged along the coast; of these there were about one hundred and\nfifty large and small down as far as Tanjong Uban, and some were\nstationed behind Riau to help to bring in the trading craft from\nSiam and Cochin China and other places bringing rice and other\nprovisions.\"\n\n\"So the fighting went on day after day in the harbour of Riau.\nRaja Haji himself directed the operations in person and he used\nto paddle about in a long canoe (sampan bidor yang panjang).\"\n\n\"He used to paddle about from one penjajap to another enquiring\nif the equipment was deficient in any way, and he used to do this in\nthe thick of the fighting when bullets were flying from both direc-\ntions. The following story I have from an old man of Bugis\nextraction named Inche Sumpo' who was a youth just old\nenough to wear a kris at the time of these events. He remembered\nbeing with a number of other youths of good family, of about the\nsame age as himself, in a boat in which they were conveying Raja\nHaji during a fight. They were paddling across from one penjajap\nto another when a shot was fired from a war-ship painted black and\nthe ball struck the water, close to the boat and ricocheted to one\nside. The splash wetted the cloth which the Yang-di-per-Tuan\nMuda was wearing, but he did not take any notice and merely told the boys to paddle on, and if any of them ducked their heads when bullets flew by he struck them with a rattan whip which he carried.\n\n\"One day a long ketch belonging to the Dutch approached the shore at Pulau Alus and was becalmed there. Six or seven penja-japs immediately came out and attacked her, and then there was lagom' lagom!' a tremendous cannonade and that ketch very nearly had to yield, and we very nearly got her. The Commander of the party who attacked her was a Panglima, named Inche Kubu, who had a gharab fifteen fathoms long. During the fight the poop (baranda) of the Dutch vessel caught fire and a number of her crew had got into their boats and were ready to pull out to sea, but a strong wind got up and several vessels were able to sail up to her assistance, so the penja-japs had to sheer off and the ketch got away. Then night came on and fighting ceased, only to begin again next day, and so it went on day after day; if there was plenty of wind the ships stood in, and if it was calm the penja-japs went out and gave battle and at night all fighting stopped. The vessels of both sides were so close sometimes that conversation took place between those on board; for among the crews of the Dutch ships there were here and there a few men of Bugis descent, born in Malacca and related (ker-kerabat) to the Bugas of Riau. The former would perhaps call out 'What is one to do?' One takes employment where there is food to be got; but that need not interfere with our relationship.' Or a Dutch sailor would sing out 'Hi! von Malay (or Bugis), to-morrow we'll have a good fight, eh?' And the Malay or Bugis would answer back 'All right!' This is what I myself have heard from the lips of old men.\"\n\n\"One day the Dutch attacked the stockades of the Siantan men on Pulau Penangat, having landed a force of soldiers by means of boats at the back of the island. They fell upon the Siantan men unawares during a heavy shower of rain and took all the stockades, the defenders scattering and taking to the jungle. Then the Dutch landed a quantity of dogs and hunted down all those who had escaped and were hiding in the woods. When the dogs found one they barked, and then the soldiers came up and shot him, and the musketry fire was like the popping of the rice-grains when berah is being roasted. Thus, all the Siantan men on Pulau Penangat were killed, not one was left, for there was no time to run away.\"\n\n\"Attraced by the crackling (meng-kritup) of the musketry fire at Pulau Penangat, the penja-japs at Kwala Riau made for that...\"\nplace and arrived there just as the troops had re-embarked to return to their ships. A fight then took place between the penjajaps and the boats and there was a great deal of firing with muskets and blunderbusses, during which three of the boats were sunk and a number of men were killed, but the rest of them got away. Then the ships and ketches sailed up and opened fire upon the penjajaps, to which the latter responded. The fight ended without a victory for either side, and at nightfall the ships stood out to sea again and the Malays and Bugis landed at Pulau Peninjat to search for the bodies of the Siantan men. Those that were found were buried hurriedly, two or three together in one grave, and when this was done the penjajaps left again and fighting recommenced next day.\"\n\n\"After the war had gone on for nine months (some people say eleven months, God knoweth the truth) there was a parley between the combatants\u2014that is to say, between the Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda, Raja Haji, on one side and Pieter Jacob van Brama (or, as some say, Captain Abo) on the other, and there was a truce in order to allow of negotiations. The Dutch wanted to bring one large ship of war into the Riau river, but Raja Haji objected to this, saying that if the object was a conference with a view to an understanding no ship must be brought in, to which the Dutch replied that they had no sinister intention. Raja Haji still objected, and the Dutch said that they could not be expected to come to Riau without soldiers with them during a time of war. Their war-ship persisted in trying to get in, so fighting recommenced, fire being opened on her from the stockade at Telok Kreting. Then there was a tremendous cannonade, the fire from the ship drowning every other noise. The stockade was very near falling, owing to gunpowder running short, but the Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda sent them a supply in a boat. The man who took it across was Shalibendar Bopeng and the lad who paddled him was Inche Kalik, the head of all the youths of good family at that time. The boat was fired on by the ship with ball and canister and was sunk, but her men got on shore with one barrel of powder and took it up to the stockade at Telok Kreting, which was able thus to fire four or five rounds.\"\n\n\"Then, by the decree of God most high, the ship took fire and, by the explosion of the gunpowder on board, she was blown into the air and fragments were sent flying over land and sea and all her crew perished. According to one account, they numbered eight hundred and, according to another account, five hundred, and there was a Kommissaris among them. I have learned from old Dutch...\"\ninhabitants of Malacca that her name was Malacca's Welvaren.* After this occurrence there was a cessation of hostilities, during which negotiations were continued.\n\n\"Now the Yang-di-per-Tuan of Selangor, Raja Ibrahim, and his brother, Raja Nala, the Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda of the same State, when they heard that their relative, Raja Haji, was at war with the Dutch at Riau, took counsel together, with the Dato' Punggawa and the Chiefs and elders in Selangor, how they might co-operate with the Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda of Riau. When a plan of action had been decided on, the Raja of Selangor set out to invade Malacca. He halted at Rembau to consult with the Penghulu and the four Sukus, and a conference having been held there he went on to Pendat\u2020 and concerted measures with the Penghulu of Pendat and the four Sukus there. When this was over he went to Sungai Bahru and established himself there, and then marched to Batang Tiga. There he constructed a large stockade, which was soon attacked by a force sent out from Malacca, composed partly of soldiers and partly of Malacca people. A fight then took place between the Selangor men and the Malacca force and there was slaughter on both sides. A number of soldiers and Malacca people were killed, and the head of one of their leaders was cut off. The Malacca force was defeated and retreated to the town again. The Governor of Malacca then summoned all his ships of war to return to the port, and sent a letter to Pieter Jacob van Brama at Riau informing him that Malacca was invaded by the Yang-di-per-Tuan of Selangor. The Admiral at once gave orders that all his ships should sail back to Malacca, and the harbour of Riau was soon left quite clear, all the Dutch ships having gone. The Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda of Selangor, Raja Nala, then set out for Riau with a kakap, manned by thirty men, to invite Raja Haji to come to Malacca. There was a great difference of opinion among the young Rajas in Riau, some being in favour of his going and some being altogether against it, which ended in a serious misunderstanding between the descendants of Marhum Jangkat, Raja Ali \u2021\n\n* See the entry under date January 23, on p. 19, where the name is given. Without this clue it would not be easy to give the Dutch equivalent of\n\n\u2020 Pendat, the place where the Langgi river divides, one branch going up to Sungai Ujong and the other to Rembau, now generally called Sempong.\n\n\u2021 Raja Ali afterwards succeeded Raja Haji as Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda of Riau.\nand Raja Abdul Samad.* Raja Haji himself was bent upon going; first, because the Selangor men were actually fighting; secondly, because his royal relative had personally come to ask him; and thirdly because he hoped for merit in the sight of God (\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647) by waging a religious war. For these three reasons he could not restrain himself. When all his preparations were ready he set out for Malacca. His nephew, the Yang-di-per-Tuan Besar, Sultan Mahmud, insisted upon accompanying his uncle as far as Muar, where he was left behind, while Raja Haji pushed on to Malacca. The latter established himself near Telok Katapang and built a stockade at Tanjong Palas, at the same time ordering Punggawa Puna Sati to attack Semibok. There was fighting at Semibok for some days between the Bugis and the Dutch, many being killed and wounded on both sides. The latter at length gave way, a number of soldiers having been killed and the Semibok people having lost several Panglimas. Not long after Semibok had been taken by Raja Haji, Sultan Mahmud came to Telok Katapang to see him, but his uncle induced him to return to Muar. \"Do not,\" said he, \"take part in this campaign, but leave it to me, for it may be that God most high has predestined that my time shall end in this war, and in that case it is first to God, next to the Prophet of God, and thirdly to your Highness that I desire to commit the care and protection of my people and my Bugis dependents. And I should accept this fate with joy, for I should die in the hope that all my past sins would be forgiven by God most high, by reason of my death in battle.\"\n\n\"Sultan Mahmud wept bitterly at hearing these words and his uncle wept also. The Sultan then returned to Muar to await there the issue of the operations.\"\n\nRaja Haji visited Batang Tiga, together with the Yang-di-per-Tuan of Selangor, and made a stockade there and ordered an attack on Malacca on the land side. A detachment of Malacca men and Dutch soldiers came out and when the two forces met there was a fight, with a tremendous discharge of muskets and thunderbusses, and when they got to close quarters swords and spears and klevangs and krises were used. Many were killed and wounded on both\n\n* Raja Abdul Samad (afterwards killed in battle with the Dutch) was in favour of Raja Haji invading Malacca. Raja Ali opposed the proposal.\n\n+ \"War against enemies of Islam, who have been the first aggressors, is enjoined as a sacred duty, and he who loses his life in fulfilling this duty, if unpaid, is promised the rewards of a martyr.\"\u2014Lane's Modern Egyptians, I. 139.\nsides. Before long the Malacca force was defeated and retreated to the town. After this there was no fighting for some days, and then the Yang-di-per-Tuan of Selangor sent fifty Selangor men to Telok Katapang to fetch a large boat, which had been presented to him by the Yang-di-per-Tuan Besar, and to bring her to Batang Tiga. She was, however, attacked by the Dutch and was struck by a cannon-ball and sunk, but she was not burnt. The Selangor men returned to Batang Tiga again.\n\n\"When Raja Haji was established at Tanjong Palas, near Telok Katapang, he ordered an attack to be made on the east side of Malacca by some hundreds of Malays and Bugis. Again the Malacca men sailed forth, with hundreds of Dutch soldiers, and when the two forces met there was a great fight.* The Punggawa led his men to the attack of a gun upon a carriage, and after a hand-to-hand fight it was captured by the Bugis and Riau men, and the Malacca people retreated to the town. Then hostilities ceased for a month or half a month, and then there was another engagement, then another period of quiet and then another fight. As time went on the Malacca people were defeated more and more, until the whole of the territory round the town had been reduced by Raja Haji, and nothing remained to the Dutch but the town of Malacca itself with its fortress.\"\n\n\"It is related that the war had lasted for about a year without any decisive defeat on either side and the Governor of Malacca was becoming very anxious because assistance was so long in coming from Batavia. He brought into the fort, with their wives and families, all the Europeans who lived outside the walls, and a very strict watch was maintained by patrol (sunbang) day and night. The Governor also sent messengers to the neighbouring Malay States to say that if the Company were victorious a reward would be given to those Rajas from whom support was received.\"\n\n\"When the Governor's letter to this effect reached Siah, the Yam Tuan, Mohamed Ali, took to meet with his nephew, Siyud Ali bin Osman, and then started for Malacca, tempted by the riches of this world, to assist the Governor. Nevertheless, it is stated in the chronicle of Selangor that when the Dutch attacked and took Telok Katapang, Yam Tuan Mohamed Ali and Siyud Ali were not present.\"\n\n* Described in language already used; translation omitted to avoid monotony.\n\n\u2020 The Dutch account does not admit the capture of the gun. It was \"unmounted and taken back.\" See p. 27.\n\"The Yang-di-per-Tuan of Selangor made a journey to Rembau for amusement and spent some time there. Thence he returned to Sungai Bahru with a large following of Rembau men. He then made arrangements for a serious attack upon Malacca.\"\n\n\"At last the reinforcements expected by the Governor from Batavia arrived, consisting of about thirty vessels, large and small, ships of war and armed ketches, with thousands of troops both white and black. As soon as they arrived, about nine large ships attacked Telok Katapang, and there was a severe engagement between the stockades and the ships, which ended at nightfall and was renewed next day for several days. Even in a time of danger like this Raja Haji amused himself every night with plays and dances, and feasting and giving feasts to the Princes and Chiefs; but, nevertheless, his piety was no pretence and he never discontinued repeating his prayers; his beads * never left his hands, and on Thursday nights he never failed to celebrate the festival\u2020 of the birth of the Prophet Muhammad, on whom be the blessings of God and His peace, just as if his situation was that of a person free from anxiety.\"\n\n\"At last when his hour had come and the fulfilment of the measure and quantity of time allotted to him by God (who is ever to be praised and most high) in the furtherance of His designs, an attack was made by a body of some thousands of Dutch troops from the land side, who had got behind the small stockade. It should be explained that the large stockade,\u2014namely, the one held by Raja Haji himself\u2014was at Tanjong Palas, and that a smaller one further inland was commanded by Inche Ibrahim, the son of Bandahara Hassan. The Dutch made an assault upon Inche Ibrahim's stockade, and after a hand-to-hand fight the stockade was carried and Inche Ibrahim made his escape to the large stockade in which Raja Haji resided. Then Raja Haji ordered his panglimas to sally out and attack the Dutch. He himself did not cease reading a religious book. The panglimas who went out engaged the Dutch troops, and there was a fight in which there were losses on both sides. The Dutch soldiers, of whom there were thousands, kept up an incessant fire of musketry, which crackled like the popping of rice being parched. Numbers of Bugis were shot down (martyred in God's\n\n* Expressions in praise of God often follow the ordinary prayers and are counted with the beads.\n\n\u2020 Muhih-en-Nabi.\ncause) before they could reach the enemy, but those who could get up to the Dutch attacked them hand to hand, and there was tremendous shouting and noise and many were killed and wounded on both sides. During this engagement the Dutch troops completely surrounded the large stockade, standing in rows, one row behind another. Then Raja Haji ordered a general attack to be made. Among Lenga, who had to ride a pony because he was suffering from a kind of boil on the breast (papula), charged the Dutch line with his men and was killed, he and his pony; of the Dutch, too, many were killed. A number of Dutch officers and soldiers then entered the stockade, and were encountered by Dang Schikang, with his Punggianur, Talisang and Raj Ahmad, who threw themselves upon the advancing lines of the Dutch troops and perished, all three of them, martyrs in God's cause, like brave men. Many others, too, there were, men of high standing, who died similarly and scorned to turn their backs. The Dutch lost about seventy men killed in this action, including three officers.\n\nThen Raja Haji arose and drew his dagger (badak), holding in his other hand the religious book which he had been reading. He was instantly seized by a number of his own followers who were trying to hold him back, and while this was going on he was hit by a musket ball fired from the Dutch ranks, and he fell and almost immediately expired.\n\nWhen the Dutch saw that Raja Haji had been killed they stopped firing and remained drawn up in ranks; all the followers of the Yang-di-pertuan Muda, male and female, quitted the stockade and made their escape unmolested by the troops. Among these were the two sons of Raja Haji, Raja Jafar and Raja Idris, and his nephew, Raja Suleiman; the latter was wounded and was carried off by his people. Raja Jafar was carried by a man named Inche Layar, a descendant of the family of Magat Iru. In this way, all the surviving followers of Raja Haji got clear away from Telok Katapang and made good their escape to Muar, without further molestation from the Dutch. Thus was Telok Katapang taken by the Dutch.\n\nIt is related that after this the Governor of Malacca directed the Capitan Malayu and the elders of the city to go out and bring in the body of the late Raja Haji. A procession of men and women, with lamentations and weeping, conveyed the body within the walls of the fort in the manner customary at royal funerals,\nand as it passed the gate the Dutch fired minute guns. The whole expense of the interment was paid by the Governor of Malacca, and alms were distributed by the Capitan Malayu under his orders.\"\n\n\"Raja Haji was buried within the Fort of Malacca behind the Company's garden. Eventually his remains were removed by his son and were taken to Riau, where they were buried on the hill of Pulau Penangat\u2014that is to say, the hill at the south of the island. I have been told by old people that before Raja Haji was buried, his body was placed in a coffin ready to be transported to Batavia, and a ship had been got ready for the purpose. The very night before she was to start a jet of light like fire was seen to issue from the coffin, and while all the people of Malacca were in confusion at seeing this occurrence, the ship which was to have conveyed the body took fire and blew up with all her crew, not one soul being saved.* On this account, said the relaters of this story, the removal of the body of Raja Haji to a foreign country was not accomplished. He was buried in Malacca, and his remains rested there until they were removed to Riau. But it was because of this story that the Dutch of that generation gave him the name of Raja Api,+ by which they used to speak of him.\"\n\nI have, I think, reached, perhaps exceeded, the reasonable limits of a paper in this Journal, and will not, therefore, follow the Malay chronicler further, though he has much more that is interesting to say about the blockade of Kuala Selangor by Admiral Van Braam; the flight of Sultan Ibrahim to Palang; the occupation of the fort by the Dutch; the brief and nominal tenure of power of the Sak adventurer, Raja Mohamed Ali, and his son, Sayud Ali, in Selangor; the recovery of his fort by Sultan Ibrahim, aided by reinforcements from Pahang; the expulsion of the small Dutch garrison, and the eventual conclusion of a treaty of peace.\n\nThese events, though they had their origin in the quarrel between Raja Haji and the Dutch, belong to the history of Selangor, and the episode which is described in the Malayan ballad preserved by Logan is purely a Malacca one, and appropriately ends with the death of the Bugis Chief.\n\n* Api, fire.\n+ The Malay poem, which is the subject of this paper, is evidently, as already pointed out, the work of a Malacca Malay, hostile to the Riau invaders. Hence the entire omission by the poet of this superstitious explanation of the loss of the Dolphin.\nA word may be added as to the removal of the body of Raja Haji from Malacca to Riau, as to which the statement made (on p. 212 supra) is perhaps not quite correct. If, as the Malay chronicler says (supra p. 223), the remains of Raja Haji were transferred to Riau by his son, the bones which were removed in recent years must have been those of other persons. Interments, according to Malay usage, had perhaps occasionally been practised near the place, which had been rendered specially holy by the burial of one whom the people regarded as a Muhammadan hero. Exact particulars are wanting.\n\nIt would have been interesting, if possible, to supplement the records, both Dutch and Malay, of the war of 1784, by local traditions collected in Malacca. Stories of the Bugis invasion are, no doubt, preserved here and there by the Malay peasantry; and the lines of the stockades at Tanjong Palas and Teluk Katupang can, perhaps, be pointed out. But I have had no leisure for any such investigation; and additional facts, if any be forthcoming, must be left to be supplied by other hands.\n\nI have only to add that if this imperfect attempt to record an important event in the history of Dutch domination in the Peninsula should be read by any of my learned and valued colleagues, the members of the Koninklijk Instituut voor de Taal-Land en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indie, I trust that it may serve to assure them that that history is studied by Englishmen of to-day in a very different spirit from that which is evinced in Begbie's narrative.\n\nThe materials for a good account of Dutch rule in Malacca, the most ancient and famous city in these seas now how sadly eclipsed by younger rivals are gradually being supplied by the publication of selections from the Batavia records,* and it may be hoped that before long a competent historian may be found to undertake it.\n\nW.

H.\n\nIt was in 1627 that the board of administration at Batavia intended to make the next attempt, of which expedition one KAREL LIEVENS SOON was to be the Commander, but for some reason or other this plan had likewise to be given up. So it happened that it was not until 1640, in the reign of the said Prince ABDULJALIL SJAH II. and whilst the Hon'ble ANTONI VAN DIEMEN held the Governor-Generalship of India, that this matter was taken up in good earnest, detailed account of which we will give in the following chapter.\n\nExact Account of the Siege and Conquest of the strong and famous Town of Malacca under the Administration of the Hon'ble Antoni van Diemen,\n\nGovernor-General of India.\n\nFor several years Malacca and the trade of the Portuguese with that place and in the southern part of India had been much hindered and troubled by the navigation of our war-vessels. We\nshall see later that in 1640 and 1641, a squadron under the command of JACOB KOPER, together with some vessels of the Johor Malays, blockaded the place so as to prevent it from being properly supplied with the most urgently needed provisions. That same year then, the Hon'ble ANTONI VAN DIEMEN, jointly with the Hon'ble Council of India, resolved to attack by main force, and, if possible, to take that strong and famous town, which, next to Goa, was the most important town of Portuguese India.\n\nTheir Honours intrusted the execution of this important business to Sergeant-Major ADRIAN ANTONISSOON, an old, experienced and bold soldier. He left Batavia for Malacca in May, 1640, with three well-manned vessels, with orders to take over the command of the fleet from the Commander KOPER, to blockade the town on the seaside as closely as possible, and on the arrival of more troops from Batavia and of the auxiliary troops from the Kings of Acheen and Johor, to land with all his forces, and, according to circumstances, to try and take the town either by arranging terms, by siege, or by storming it, as he thought best.\n\nIn accordance with this plan, in the beginning of June, twelve ships and six boats so rigorously blockaded the town on the seaside, that its supply of victuals was almost entirely cut off, and hardly any one could succeed in leaving or entering the place; hence several vessels with provisions and one barge with fresh supplies from Goa were also taken by our people.\n\nMeanwhile the King of Acheen refused us his assistance; but our fleet was constantly relieved by ships and troops (sailors and soldiers). In short, when at the end of July, the King of Johor's fleet of some 40 sail with a force of 1,400 or 1,500 men had joined our troops, which were partly Dutch, partly German, and of about the same strength, our Commander, on the 2nd of August issued the order that the combined forces should land at about one-third of a mile on the north side of the suburb of Malacca.(1) No sooner were the troops landed than they expelled the enemy, several hundred strong, from the first bastion and were so close at their heels, that they entered\n\n(1) i.e., Tranquerah.\nthe suburb soon after them and drove them back within the fortress.\n\nOur troops then encamped in the conquered suburb, and after having built two batteries there within a pistolshot of the ramparts of the fortress, they battered them so fiercely with sixteen 24-pounders, that finally, notwithstanding the brave resistance of the enemy, several large breaches were made. These breaches exposed the enemy to a great danger, but they were able to meet it for a while by their extraordinary courage. The siege of the river preventing us from storming the town as yet, we could do nothing but blockade the town (within gunshot) from the seaside as closely as possible with our ships drawn up in half-moon form and harass the enemy by an uninterrupted cannonade and a constant throwing of bomb-shells, to which they did not fail to reply bravely and patiently from their heavy guns. This cannonade not only killed many people and wasted much powder and lead, but proved plainly that this siege would last a very long time, unless their Honours resolved to send a larger fleet than they had yet done to besiege the town. Though great scarcity of provisions prevailed in the town, and the Johorians assisted us in many ways, as, for instance, in supplying us with all sorts of materials, in building some of our batteries and other works, in preventing the enemy's small crafts from entering or leaving the town, and in hindering them in a hundred other ways, still it would have been impossible for us to take the town, if no other expedients had been adopted.\n\nThe pride of the Governor of Malacca, Manuel de Souza Coutinho, and the stubbornness of the besieged Portuguese contributed not a little to the long duration of this siege, for several offers of a reasonable capitulation were rejected with contempt. Add to this the self-willed conduct of our Commander Adrian Antonissoon and the slackness of his successor Jacob Koper, and it is no wonder that five months passed without the smallest improvement and with great expenditure and loss on both sides. Many remarkable encounters by sea and land occurred during this space of time,\nin which our people generally carried the day; the enemy, exasperated from want of provisions, used his utmost efforts to bring them by water into the town, which our people tried to prevent, and which caused bloody battles; also similar attempts by land were made at the same time in a determined manner, but were everywhere repelled by our men with the utmost courage.\n\nThe natural strength of the place itself, which was greatly increased artificially, conducted to enable it to withstand so many thousands of cannon-balls fired at it from our artillery, especially from the sixteen 24-pounders. Yet, by this incessant battering not only were large breaches made in the strong bastions \"Curassa\" and \"St. Domingo,\"(1) but even the dome of the \"Hospital des Pauvres\" was levelled to the ground, and the tower of the old fortress, the church, and several large buildings were so badly damaged, that they were hardly recognizable. The hard-pressed Portuguese on the other hand did not fail to do us damage from their battery of extraordinary heavy pieces on St. Paul's Hill, so much so that not one house in our quarters in the suburb remained intact.\n\nThe protracted siege and the great want which followed, not only in the distressed town, but also in our army, caused a bad plague, with great mortality among the troops of both parties; more of the troops were destroyed by this disease than by the hand of the enemy. Hence, notwithstanding the many fresh supplies forwarded from Batavia with the necessary provisions, our troops were quite unable to invest the town on all sides in such a manner as to cut off all supplies of victuals to the enemy. Some deserters also gave us a great deal of trouble, as they informed the enemy of the bad condition of our army and so encouraged him not to yield for some time longer, till, perchance, relief might come from Goa, or we might at last raise the siege, to which suggestions they gave so much credit, that they resolved to persevere to the\n\n(1) This was at the N.W. corner of the fort facing what is now the New Market. (See \"Plan of Portuguese Fortress in Malacca,\" in vol. III of the Commentaries of Albuquerque translated by Mr. De Grey Birch for the Hakluyt Society.)\nlast, notwithstanding the wretched state in which they were.\n\nThis stubborn, nay savage resolution of the enemy, caused the destruction in the month of December, 1640, and January, 1641, of a great number of people, besides which, many of the besieged, emaciated with hunger and unable any longer to resist, fled to our army. They informed us that there were in the town not more than 200 Europeans and only 400 or 500 Eurasians, and that victuals were so scarce that a gallon(1) of rice was sold for 10-15 dollars, and a pound of dried cow's or buffalo's hide for 5 or 6 crusados.(2) and that it was very hard to get them even at that price. This want compelled the enemy to expel most unmercifully from the place many women and children and all useless mouths. Famine was so prevalent that a mother actually exhumed the body of her own child and after having kept it for two days was driven by the pangs of hunger to eat it, to the consternation of all who heard of it.\n\nNotwithstanding the wretched state of things in our camp, our people, greatly encouraged by the consistent reports of the extreme distress of the town, kept up their courage pretty well, though we had not only lost a large number of common soldiers, but also several brave men and chief officers of the army. Among these last ones were the Commissioner (Komissaris) Johan de Meere (who died on the 8th October), the Commander Adrian Antonisson (in November), and his successor Jacob Koper (in the beginning of January, 1641), and Captain Pieter van den Broek, the same who, as Director of Suratte and as the founder of the trade with Persia and the Red Sea, had retired to his native country with the rank of Chief Admiral, but, not having come very well out of these affairs, was sent here by his friend General van Diemen. Most of these men died from lingering diseases, and from the great hardships they had suffered here.\n\nBy this successive decease of our Commanders we soon felt the want of proper men for Commanders of our troops, and in the absence of more distinguished officers (the whole of the Secret Council having died and a new one having been\n\n---\n\n(1) A gallon.\n(2) Marked with a cross on one face.\nappointed from among the officers of the army and the fleet) Captain Mime Willemssoon Kaartekoe was approved as the Hon'ble Company's Commander of the land and naval forces before Malacca (though I cannot understand why others more suitable than Heer Kaartekoe, as, for instance, Heer Lamotius and Captain Forcenburg were overlooked). Kaartekoe then, in conformity with the advice of the Council (which, at that time, was composed of experienced and valiant Captains and seamen) to prevent our army further dwindling away from the ever-increasing pestilence, resolved to storm the moribund town of Malacca (which now scarcely offered any resistance) and to compel its inhabitants in this manner to surrender. After having held a day of public prayers, preparations were made for the storming of the town on the morning of the 14th of January, and, by the grace of God, that rich and important town was taken in the following manner:\n\nAt daybreak of the 14th January, Sergeant-Major Joanes Lamotius formed three columns of all our healthy troops (both soldiers and sailors), numbering about 650 men altogether, of which Captain Laurens Forcenburg commanded the first column, Captain Hurdt the second, and Captain Nicolaas Janssoon Houtkooper the third. These troops, partly armed with muskets (the sailors carrying ladders), marched towards the Bastion \"St. Domingo,\" and shouting the war cry \"Help us God\" they stormed that part of the town with irresistible courage. For a time the enemy offered a brave and unexpected resistance, but after a fierce hand-to-hand fight we became masters of this point, drove the flying enemy from there along the skirts of the town to the point \"Madre de Dios,\" took that also after a weak resistance, and so successively the points \"Our Mille Virgines,\" \"St. Jago,\"(1) \"Curassa,\" and the \"Hospital Bulwark.\" But at the \"Fortressa Vella\" our men met with such a brave resistance, that they had to retreat with a loss of twenty men to the said Hospital, where they were beyond the range of the enemy's guns of heavy calibre and from where we could sweep them with our\n\n(1) This, from the plan, must have been near where the old gateway is.\nArtillery.\n\nAt that moment Commander Kaartekoe having risen from his sick-bed and making his appearance on the town ramparts, most inopportune prevented, by his want of judgment, the successful completion of the attack which our troops had now entirely in their hands, for (most unwarrantably and contrary to the custom of war) he entered into an agreement with the Portuguese Governor and (at his request) some priests, promising them and all the inhabitants of the town (with the exception of the King's soldiers) a free and safe retreat. The enemy then having abandoned that strong bulwark \"Curassa\" and the old fortress, our troops marched into those places and occupied them and all the other points.\n\nThe soldiers of the enemy were then immediately lodged in our camp, and ours in the town, whilst the respectable Portuguese inhabitants and their families were left peaceably in their houses, but ordered to carry all the gold, silver, jewels and money which they possessed to the Church of St. Paul.(1) Such good order was maintained that nothing was heard of murder, brutality or ravishing, though some of our soldiers (after having endured so much want and misery) in their first transport plundered some churches and brothels.\n\nThe Johor Malays, who had been ordered at daybreak to raise a false alarm near the bulwark \"St Jago,\" did not show themselves till after sunrise, when most of the bulwarks had already been taken by our soldiers: they then meant to get into the town by the conquered breach, but Heer Lamotius wisely stopped them to prevent the further shedding of Christian blood, especially by the Moors, who intended to plunder and to destroy the whole town. Thus, not without great loss of men and money to the Hon'ble Company, we at last conquered that famous, strong and powerful mercantile place of the Portuguese, the matchless Malacca, which they had possessed 120 years. This being a strongly fortified and large place, superior to any other place in the East (save Goa), for its importance and many other advantages for which reason it was of old selected as the seat of the Malay\n\n(1) On the top of the hill.\nKings, posterity may safely look upon this conquest as a proof of the valour of the Batavians. The ramparts and bastions were armed with 64 brass and 4 iron guns, 43 brass swivel guns and 31 iron ones, and the place was well provided with the best war materials.\n\nThe great number of inhabitants, the long duration of the siege and other unexpected misfortunes compelled the gallant Portuguese (for nobody will say that they did not behave gallantly during the whole siege), finally, when in want of everything and when no rescue appeared, to surrender the town. It had at that time several pretty broad and properly laid out streets, a small hill in the middle with the Church of St. Paul at its top and the beautiful Convent of the Order of Jesuits on its slope, besides many other churches and convents and very fine lofty buildings and houses; and, having been built in an exceedingly fertile tract of land, it was situated as advantageously as possible for the trade in the southern part of India.\n\nBut we must say that, if the Portuguese during this siege suffered such great calamities, they deserved it as a righteous punishment of God; for having led here for so many years such an incredibly godless life, they really could not be astonished at the terrible destruction of this town by war, famine and pestilence (the three scourges of which God so often makes use to punish similar places).\n\nIt is supposed that during the siege more than 7,000 persons died in the town, but that, in order to escape famine and pestilence, a much greater number fled from the town and were scattered all over the neighbouring country, for its population of more than 20,000 souls before the siege, no more than 3,000 inhabitants were left.\n\nWe lost before that place more than 1,500 Hollanders, mostly, however, of contagious diseases.\n\nThe Portuguese Governor died of disease two days after the surrender of the town, and was buried in the Church of\n\n(1) This will probably account for signs of Portuguese type to be noticed occasionally, both amongst Malays and aborigines and apparently Christian legends found amongst the latter by P\u00e9re Bories and referred to by him in a paper in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute.\nSt. Domingo(1) with much pomp and a guard of honour from our troops after the manner of his country.\n\nThe Ovidor-General (i.e., their Fiscal of India), the Jesuits, the other priests and the principal citizens with their wives and children, left Malacca a few days afterwards in a vessel (which we lent them) for Negapatam; and since we did not visit and search this ship most probably he (the Ovidor-General) carried away a treasure of money of at least several hundred thousands of rix dollars, besides what the others took with them.\n\nLOUIS MATHIAS DE SOUSA CHYSORRO, the Commander of the troops, and the other officers and soldiers of the King of Spain were sent to Batavia, together with some priests and citizens. A few married Portuguese and the Eurasians with their families were left, so that the town might not be depopulated after its surrender, and so that we might be in a position to open it up again in time, as we afterwards did.\n\nOn the 1st of February, 1641 (i.e., 17 days after the conquest of the town), Heer JOHAN VAN TWIST, Extraordinary Member of the Council of India, and the Commissioner Heer JUSTUS SCHOUTEN, arrived in the ruined town.\n\nThe former (first Dutch Governor of Malacca), after having inspected the whole town and its surrounding territory, made the necessary arrangements for the right administration of this conquered country, altering many things that had been badly and rashly managed through the ignorance of Commander KAARTEKOE, who, soon afterwards, returned to Batavia together with the superfluous officers and troops to bring to their Honours in person the news of the conquest of this town.\n\nThis account of the siege and conquest of Malacca in all its details may merit so much more credit, from the fact that it is taken from a report dated 26th October, 1641, drawn up in Malacca by the Commissioner SCHOUTEN in person, and forwarded to their Honours at Batavia, though I doubt very much if that report can be found among the official records, either at Batavia or at Malacca, since many old papers (especially at Batavia) have been lost by the length of time and\n\n(1) Behind the bastion of that name.\nthrough accidents, and that at present but very few records, reaching beyond 1650, are still to be found.\n\nOne of the first matters taken in hand by Heer van Twist was the constitution of a Board of Town Magistrates. The Factor and Fiscal, Gerard Herberts, arrived here with his family per the storeship Gragt on the 15th of May. According to letters from their Honours at Batavia there arrived at that place from Malacca on 11th December, 1640, the ship Rynsburg; on 16th January, 1641, the ship Langerak; on 24th January, the Kleine Zon with the news of the conquest of Malacca; on 10th February, the ships Goes and the Tatjoot de Jager and the Quelpart and the Brak; on 13th February, the Egmond; on 18th February, the ship Klein Zutphen; and on 3rd April the Wassenaar with the late Commander Mime Willemssoon Kaartekoe.\n\nTheir Honours received with these ships all the papers treating at large the matters of Malacca.\n\nSeveral necessaries, to the amount of 3,801 rix dollars, had been forwarded per the said storeship Gragt and per some other ships, whilst different sorts of calicos to an amount of rupees 31,341 had been sent with the Factors Jan Dirkssoon Puyt and Joris Vermeeren for the tin trade at Perak, Kedah, Ujong Salang(1) and Bangert, besides 1,000 rix dollars in specie. 31,341 guilders were also sent for the use of the above-named places, with orders that as much tin as could be got was to be sent to Batavia for the trade with Suratte and Persia.\n\nTheir Honours sanctioned all that had been done by the Governor and the Council and ordered them to continue to govern in the same way and to levy no other taxes, duties or money than those that existed under the Portuguese rule, so as to prevent further trouble, but, at the same time, to take full revenue which the King of Spain had enjoyed and not to surrender anything that they were properly entitled to.\n\nOn the 22nd May Heer Gerard Herberts, the new Fiscal (Attorney-General), examined and sentenced for the first time several criminal prisoners, whilst the first repairs of the\n\n(1) Now known as 'Junk Ceylon.'\nBastion \"Victoria\" or \"St. Domingo\" were started on 23rd May, 1641. On 13th August, the Sjahander Jan Jansz Menie returned from Maccaam Thoheet with letters from the Orang Cala Laksamana to the Governor, containing the news that the Achinese accepted peace and promised to stop all enmity and robbery. From the letter of the Laksamana to the Governor it appears that Acheen was ruled at that time by a Queen.(1) The Governor of Malacca then requested the said Laksamana to send him ten boat-loads of timber for the repairs of the bridge of Malacca, some 200 Malay carpenters and oars and paddles.\n\nIn a letter to their Honours at Batavia forwarded per the Ambonna the Laksamana of Johor complained very much of the want of fulfilment of the promises made to him and to his King by former Commanders before the conquest of Malacca, and according to an agreement, made before the siege of Malacca, he requested the Company to return to the King of Johor all the big and small guns, which the Portuguese had taken from him.\n\nOn the 14th of August the Neptunus arrived from Coromandel with a cargo of purchased goods, amounting to rupees 265,975, viz.:\n\n| Description                                      | Value   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| 250 bales of different calicos from Palliacatte | Rs.86,028 |\n| 482 bales of calicos, sugar, indigo, saltpetre, thread, &c., from Masulipatam | Rs.179,947 |\n| 732 bales of different goods                     | Rs.265,975 |\n\nThe storeship the Duyf with 28 hands, despatched from Acheen by the Commissioner Justus Schouten, arrived at Palliacatte in a very damaged condition, with broken main and fore-mast and lost mizen-mast, for which reason, Heer Arent Gardenys, Governor of Palliacatte, ordered it to Bengal to\n\n(1) Schander Muda, the King in whose time Achin attained its greatest prosperity, and who began to reign in 1606, had just died. He was to have aided the Dutch in their siege of Malacca, but declined, owing to their alliance with his enemy\u2014Johor. Achin was ruled for the next sixty years by Queens.\nhave it repaired there. There being a great demand for cloves at Mazulipatam, the Factor, Arnold Henssen, and Bartholomus de Gruiter were convinced that, if their Honours liked to sell them at 4 or 5 Pagods [A Pagod is an Indian golden coin of $2.20.\u2014Translator.] a basket of 24 lbs., they could easily sell 100,000 lbs. in a short time. All the other goods and produce of the Company were also pretty well sold during the past year, notwithstanding the uninterrupted wars.\n\nThe enemy who had been lying several days with his army before Galle, having decamped on the 23rd May, 1641, marched to Billegam, Mature and Gindere(1) laying hand upon everything that he could catch and laying waste the whole country about Galle in order to intercept the provisions to our people. At that time Raja Singah forwarded from Ceylon to Coromandel five wretched elephants which were not worth sending. Among the home freights were 422,304 lbs. of indigo. The vessel Danish President Barent Passaart took some tobacco to Bengal.\n\nHeer Johan van Twist, Governor of Malacca, wrote on 8th September, 1641, to Palembang to Jambi and sent this letter per the English ship Anne to have it forwarded to the Captain Henrik van Gent. The said English ship Anne arrived at Malacca on the 8th of August, together with the Franiker bringing the Commissioner Justus Schouten. Twenty persons died of a contagious disease on board the Franiker on its voyage to Malacca.\n\nThe old King of Atsjien, hearing of the resistance made by Malacca, was very irresolute and much inclined to make peace with the Portuguese; but he fortunately died in 1641 and was peaceably succeeded by his spouse as Queen, which was for the advantage of the Company. Peace was made with Djohor on reasonable conditions, and the Portuguese Ambassador, Francisco de Zouza, who had been detained in prison for a very long time, was released and forwarded as a present to the said Commissioner Schouten. And everything would have turned out to the best of the Company's wishes but for one thing, viz., that the Company suffered a heavy loss through the sale of the deceased King of Atsjien jewel-\n\n(1) Weligama, Matara and Gintota.\nValentyn's Account of Malacca.\n\n... since but 5,025 talils of the said jewellery were taken over by the Queen, and this amounted only to guilders 60,300, since Her Majesty said, first that it was not right to transfer to the living the debts of the dead and besides that the said jewels could not be worn with a Queen's dress and that the King had squandered much money and drained his country to purchase them, with a hundred other excuses too many to recount. From which it may be seen how dangerous it is to trust to fickle Indian princes in such matters, the more so as there was here nowhere else to send the goods to and they must either be sent back to the Netherlands with great loss or else sold at a loss.\n\nThe Queen reigned very peacefully, but she did nothing without the knowledge of her four chief Counsellors, who made a secret alliance, never to be ruled by a foreign King, and in order to realise that purpose, and to prevent a marriage of the Queen with a foreign Prince, they had inserted in the said treaty of peace, concluded with the King of Djohor, the express condition, that they should never send Ambassadors to each other, but that each of them should remain within the boundaries of his or her territory and refrain from all hostilities. This peace, therefore, was not at all disadvantageous for Djohor, its jurisdiction being properly and legally settled, whilst the averting of Ambassadors became a tacit excuse for being exempted from paying homage to the Atsjien crown generally, the first and chief cause of war between the said two Kings. But fearing that Djohor might get annoyed by the Queen's letter to us, in which the proud AChinese nature made it appear as if we had asked pardon for the crime committed by Djohor, we refuted this misrepresentation immediately in the presence of the AChinese and Djohor Ambassadors, and we sent, moreover, the Shabandar Jan Janszoon Menie with a letter to the Laksamana of Djohor, in which we made a clear report of the matter and of the arrogance of the AChinese to which we added, that it ever had been and would be our principal aim to maintain peace between these two Princes. (Time, however, will show if Djohor will keep peace.)\nThe day after the arrival of Commissioner Schouten, the vessel D'Eendracht arrived at this place from Coromandel, with a freight of calicos worth guilders 165,000, and on the 10th ditto, the (sloop) Ambaina quite unexpectedly entered the river here. Having left at 6 degrees Northern latitude the vessels under the command of Dominicus Bouwens (sailing from Ceylon to Java) she had touched Acheen and brought first the news of the demise at that place of the Underfactor, Henrik van Rendorp, Assistant to the Factor, Jan Compostel, and further that on account of the close occupation till the 2nd May, but one Portuguese vessel had arrived at Goa, which brought the news that the two caracks, with the new Viceroy, Joan de Sylva, on board, which left Lisboa in September last, were still lying under the protection of the Fortress Aguada, and that it was most likely quite impossible to return this year to Europe. Leaving Goa, the said Commander Bouwens sailed to Ceylon with the vessels Ambaina, Arnemuyden and Valkenburg; on his arrival there he heard that Punto Galle was besieged by the Portuguese, about 700 or 800 strong, under the Command of Don Filippo de Mascarenhas, but that the place was not in distress, since the President, Jan Thyssen, held the fortress with a garrison of 500 men well provided with all sorts of necessities. As Mr. Schouten had to remain here still a little longer, he thought it better to despatch D'Eendracht first, so, after having shipped on board the Coromandel freight, worth guilders 165,000, the unsold jewels, cash rix dollars 1,009, four undamaged brass guns from the ramparts of Malacca and a big bell for the church of Batavia, of a total value of guilders 139,431-17-8, it sailed from here on 14th September last.\n\nOn 24th September the Franiker, with Commissioner Schouten on board, left this place with a freight of Achinese pepper, some rice, 27\u00bd bhara of Andragiri pepper (purchased of the British Anne at rix dollars 25 a bhara), besides 7 damaged guns and other rubbish, altogether worth guilders 2,273.14.\n\nHe hoped to arrive soon at Batavia, so as to be able to give their Honours a thorough report on the condition of this place.\nand to forward there the things that most needed, viz., a sufficient number of soldiers to reinforce the garrison, some workmen to repair the fortifications and breaches and, what was most important, some Chinese to cultivate the fields and gardens. He expressed his hope to be back here in September of next year and then to complete the arrangement of matters in the stronghold.\n\nOn the 15th of October Commander Pieter Baak arrived at Malacca with the vessels Welsing and the Franiker and Bergen op de Zoom with 100 soldiers and a freight of guilders 44,144, and, according to letters from their Honours, the following ships had arrived there (Batavia) from this place (Malacca) viz.:\u2014\n\nOn 23rd July, 1641, the vessel Kleen Zutphen; on 17th August the Breedam and the d'Eendracht with the garrisons of Mazulipatam and Palliacate; on 7th September the Franiker with the Commissioner Heer Schouten and the Chinese Ambassadors; and on the 9th September the yacht Limmen with a full freight of rice.\n\nOn the arrival of the said Commissioner, their Honours received an exact report of the whole condition of Malacca, and granted their approbation to all that had been done; they sent first the said two vessels, which 8 or 10 days afterwards were to be followed by the Arucmuyden, Breedam and the yacht de Sterre, first to assist in the action against Ceylon, and then to reinforce the fleet under the command of Mathys Quast, which had sailed to Goa on 18th July last. The vessel Akkersloot was to follow next with a cargo of different cloths, nutmegs, cloves and mace for Persia, and to take thither also the tin bought at Peirah, Keidah, Salang and Bangeri and brought to Malacca per Gragt. We received from Gamron 700 bales of silk, and expected daily some 200 bales more per Sandvoort and de Paum which both had left that place on 2nd June: we will mention afterwards the reason why Factor Adriaan van Ostende had been induced to purchase that silk. The Company's factory at that place being burdened with a sum of guilders 300,000, their Honours gave orders to take the said tin to Persia and to\nsell it there. After an administration of one year and ten months Heer van Twist was succeeded in 1642 by Heer Jeremias van Vliet as 2nd Governor of Malacca, who arrived there from Palembang and Jambi on 7th November per de Luygaard; his installation as such took place on 15th December by the Commissioner Pieter Boreel, whereupon Heer van Twist left this place with the vessel on 21st December.\n\nOn 27th April, 1645, a letter from their Honours arrived here in which they offered Mr. van Vliet 200 guilders a month, and the honorary title of Extraordinary Counsel of India, if he would sign a new agreement for 3 years (to count from 18th August, 1644), but mentioning at the same time, that, if he did not wish to make a new agreement, he had to transfer the administration to Heer Arnold de Vlaming van Oudtshoorn, who was on his way as Commissioner to Atsijen.\n\nThe said Heer de Vlaming arrived here with that letter on 15th May, left as Commissioner for Atsijen via Peirah on 22nd ditto, and returned here from there on 15th October. Heer van Vliet accepted the new agreement, but their Honours granted him, by a letter dated 2nd September, a leave to Patavia, as he had to see their Honours on different matters of importance and to give account of his first administration. The Commissioner Heer Arnold de Vlaming van Oudtshoorn was then appointed acting 3rd Governor of Malacca on 6th November, 1645, with the charge to remain here until later orders of their Honours, whilst Heer van Vliet left for Batavia on 11th ditto, after an administration of about 3 years.\n\nWhereas the said Heer de Vlaming had assumed in the meantime the title of Governor, their Honours not only expressed their dissatisfaction in a letter of 6th December, but told him that Heer van Vliet still being Governor, he (de Vlaming) should assume the title henceforward of President only. He was succeeded in 1646 by Heer Johan Thyssoon Pajant (who arrived here on 22nd November) as the 4th Governor of Malacca and who was introduced as such on 24th ditto by the Commissioner Heer Johan van Teylingen, who\narrived here on 21st November, whilst Heer de Vlaming left for Batavia via Andragiri on 15th December next per the de Ruyt. It was during the administration of the said Heer Pajart in 1651 that the Malays of Kedah and Perak murdered nine Netherlanders. The said gentleman held the administration of this place for 16 years (something very rare) and was succeeded on 1st November, 1662, by Heer Johan van Riebeek (who arrived here on 18th October per the Slot Honingen as 5th Governor), but with the titles of Commander and President only, whilst Heer Pajart, after having introduced the said gentleman as such, sailed for Batavia on 8th ditto per the same vessel.\n\nOn 22nd September, 1665, arrived here Heer Baltiasar Bort per the Meliskerke. Having been here before for several years in the service of the Company, he was introduced on 16th October by Heer van Riebeek as the 6th Commander and President, whereupon van Riebeek sailed for Batavia on that very night after an administration of about 3 years. On the 6th August, 1668, their Honours wrote to Heer Bort, that the \"seventeen gentlemen\" (1) had appointed him to be a Governor and granted him this new title.\n\nIn 1669 the expenditure of this Government amounted to six dollars 201,443 with a clear profit of six dollars 56,926.\n\nOn 4th February, 1670, their Honours wrote again that the \"seventeen gentlemen\" had made his Honour a member of the Extraordinary Council of India with a new agreement of 5 years.\n\nAbduljalil Sjah II, King of Johor, died in 1671 and was succeeded by Sultan Ibrahim Sjah, as the 20th Malay and the 14th Muhammadan King and the 8th King of Johor. He reigned 11 years, viz., from 1671 to 1682.\n\nOn 14th May, 1678, Heer Bort received a letter, mentioning him that the \"seventeen gentlemen\" had made him Ordinary Counsel of India.\n\nOn 30th April, 1679, arrived here Heer Jacob Jorissoon Pitts, Extraordinary Counsel of India, who was introduced by Heer Bort on 10th October as the 7th Governor of this place,\n\n(1) The Directors of the Company.\nwhereas Heer BORT sailed from here with the Nieuwe Noordwyk on 16th ditto, after an administration of 4 years.\n\nOn 22nd November, 1680, arrived here from Batavia per Den Briet Heer COMELIS VAN QUAALEBERG, who succeeded Heer PITs as the 8th Governor of this place on 23rd December, whilst the said Mr. PITs left here on 14th January, 1681, with the vessels de Veluwe and Kroonenburg as Commissioner for the Coast of Coromandel and Bengal to succeed Heer WILLEMS KAREL HARTSING as Governor of those places. By a letter from the \"seventeen gentlemen,\" dated 30th November, 1681, the said Heer Van Quaaalberg was appointed Extraordinary Counsel of India on 2nd November, 1682.\n\nIn the same year IBRAHIM SJAH, King of Johor, died and was succeeded by Sultan MOHAMMED SJAH II, who was the 21st Malay and the 15th Muhammedan King, and the 9th King of Johor, and who reigned there till 1699, i.e., 17 years.\n\nOn 26th September, 1684, arrived here per the Silversteyn Heer NICOLAAS SCHAGHEN, Extraordinary Counsel of India, who was introduced on 1st December by Heer Van Quaaalberg as 9th Governor, whilst the latter one sailed from here per the Japan to Batavia on 6th ditto. Their Honours wrote on 30th October, 1685, to Heer Schaghen, that they had appointed him by decree of 23rd ditto Director of Bengal, and that they had elected as his substitute Heer FRAN\u00c7OIS TAK, then Ambassador and Commissioner to the Emperor of Java; but as the said gentleman would not arrive here before April next, he (Schaghen) had to transmit the administration to the Secunde, Heer DIRK KOMANS, who was then introduced by Heer Schaghen on 5th January, 1686, as Commander of this place, whilst Heer Schaghen left for Bengal on 12th ditto per de Stryen.\n\nOn 19th November arrived here from Batavia per the Hoogergeest Heer THOMAS SLICHER, Extraordinary Counsel of India, who was introduced by Heer Komans on 26th ditto as the 10th Governor of Malacca. That worthy gentleman, who held the Governorship of this place to the general satisfaction from 1686 to 1691, suffered badly from a sad disease, which made him commit suicide on 18th October by jumping\nout of a window. After his death Heer Komans again acted till he was relieved by Heer Gelmer Vosburg, who was introduced by Heer Komans on 1st October, 1692, as the 11th Governor of Malacca.\n\nTheir Honours wrote on 15th April, 1696, that, by their decree of 10th ditto, Heer Vosburg had been elected Commissioner for Coromandel and that Governor Govert van Hoorn had been chosen to relieve him here. He arrived at this place on 2nd November per the Spierdyk and was introduced on 1st January, 1697, by the Secunde, Heer Abraham Douglas (Mr. Vosburg being ill), as the 12th Governor of Malacca.\n\nIn the meantime their Honours had written already on 10th October of the year before to Heer Vosburg, that on account of ill-health he was discharged from his commission to Coromandel. He died here the 10th January, 1697, after an administration of 4 years and 3 months and was buried in the St. Paul's Church.\n\nMohammed Sjah II, King of Johor, died in 1699, and was succeeded by Sultan Abdul Jalil Sjah III as the 22nd Malay and the 16th Muhammadan King and the 10th King of Johor.\n\nI have not been able to trace how long this Prince has reigned, and who succeeded him, but after a reign of 9 years he was still alive in 1708, so, if we begin to count the Rule of the Malay Kings from 1160, the reign of these 22 Kings had lasted in the said year 547 years and 11 months.\n\nOn 11th November, 1700, Heer Bernhard Phoonsen arrived here per the Eltemeet from Batavia, who was introduced on 24th ditto by Heer Van Hoorn as the 13th Governor of Malacca, whilst on the same day the late Governor went on board of the Carthago and left for Batavia after an administration of about 4 years.\n\nOn 17th June, 1703, Heer Phoonsen received the news that, according to a letter dated 18th September, 1702, their Honours the \"seventeen gentlemen,\" had appointed him Extraordinary Counsel of India and a Commissioner for the Coast of Coromandel. But unfortunately, both he and his splendid vessel de Vogel Phenix were taken by the French in 1705.\non his way thither, for which fact he was prosecuted after his release, but, though with much trouble, finally acquitted.\n\nOn 18th December, 1703, the Japanmen arrived here under Heer JOHAN GROOTENBUYS' colours escorted by a squadron of men-of-war.\n\nOn 18th January, 1704, the said Heer GROOTENBUYS was appointed by Heer PHOONSEN to be provisionally Commander of this place, whereupon he (Heer PHOONSEN) embarked that very evening on board of de Ellemeet and left this place with the whole fleet on the following day.\n\nOn 10th May Heer KAREL BOLNER arrived here per de Schoondijk from Punto Galle, who was introduced on 22nd ditto by the said Heer GROOTENBUYS as the 14th Governor of Malacca.\n\nThe 10th January, 1707, Heer PIETER ROOSELAAR, arrived here per the Servantsland, who was introduced on 7th March by Heer BOLNER as the 15th Governor of Malacca, whilst the said late Governor left this place in the afternoon of that day.\n\nOn 6th September of the same year the said Heer ROOSELAAR received the news that, according to a letter dated 30th October, 1706, their Honours the \"seventeen gentlemen\" had appointed him Extraordinary Counsel of India.\n\nShortly afterwards (1708) the solicitor and advocate, Mr. ABRAHAM VAN KERVEL, arrived here, who after having had a dispute with the said Governor and (if I am not mistaken) having been put in jail by him, wrote to Batavia and brought about that their Honours sent to this place in 1709 Heer WILLEM SIX to succeed Heer ROOSELAAR, who was sent up to Batavia together with the whole board of administration with the exception of Captain PALM. Heer SIX arrived here on 7th November, and was introduced on 16th December as the 16th Governor of Malacca by Heer ROOSELAAR who left this place for Batavia a few days afterwards per the Nijtvecht.\n\nHoping that he had been cured Heer Six released the said Heer VAN KERVEL, but he became so troublesome that he was obliged to send him up to Batavia in 1710.\n\nBy order of their Honours he (Heer VAN KERVEL) returned to this place in 1711, but I have heard that the board of ad-\nministration did not allow him to come on shore, but sent him back again to Batavia, at which their Honours were so greatly offended, that they summoned the Governor, Heer Van Suchteelen (the Secunde), Captain Treckmeyer and Ryklof Justus Costerus; when sued at law by Heer Van Kervel in 1712 both Heer Six and Heer Van Suchteelen were not only dismissed from their office, but Heer Six was fined in six-dollars 400 and Heer Van Suchteelen in six dollars 300 whereas the two others were acquitted.\n\nOn 21st May, 1711, per the Venhuizen, Heer Willem Moerman, arrived here, who, in compliance with their Honours' special order, was introduced by Heer Six as the 17th Governor of this place on the day of his arrival, whilst Heer Six sailed from here to Batavia per the same vessel on 16th July next.\n\nIt is a strange fact, that the said Heer Six and Van Suchteelen, although fined and ordered to pay all costs, shortly after having received the above-mentioned punishment, were completely rehabilitated by their Honours and admitted not only anew in the service of the Company, but declared also re-eligible for their former offices, a fact susceptible of several interpretations when it is remembered how long these men had openly made light of their Honours' authority.\n\nHeer Moerman, too, who arrived here with several other members of the board of administration, could not agree with Heer Van Kervel, who arrived in the same vessel with him; he (Van Kervel) remained here till the end of 1711, returned then to Batavia and was by order of the \"seventeen gentlemen\" sent up to Patria in 1712.\n\nHeer Moerman had the administration of this Government till 11th May, 1717, almost 6 years, at which date he died here. That year he was succeeded by Heer Herman van Suchteelen as the 18th Governor of Malacca, who is there still at present, viz., 1725.\n\nThe above then is an account of the most principal worldly matters of Malacca; before passing to the ecclesiastical matters we will attach first a list of the Malay Kings and those of Johor.\n\nBut first I must add to this a few words, viz., that the reader\nwill never find in any work, written about Malacca or about those Kings, anything resembling our account, or any account worth mentioning, and this for the simple reason, that we have had the opportunity of drawing everything from the personal writings and historical notices made by the Kings of Malacca itself, which have never been seen by any previous authors or which could not be read or understood by them, and we hope that we have written something which will meet with the attention of observing and learned men, since we have had a great deal of trouble in digging up this from the dust of antiquity with much scrutiny and caution; but at the same time it has never tired us, as we were convinced, that this account would be agreeable to posterity and would acquaint it with many things of which it had never heard nor read of. To complete my account I have attached the list of the Kings of Malacca.\nTHE LAW RELATING TO SLAVERY AMONG THE MALAYS.\n\nAmong the papers which were printed and laid before Parliament in 1882 on the subject of Slavery in the Protected Native States was a minute by Mr. W. E. Maxwell, then Assistant Resident, Perak, in which the existing system was described, an emancipation scheme was proposed, and a translation of the Malay law relating to Slavery was promised. Mr. Maxwell having now presented to the Straits Branch of the Roy. Asiatic Soc. his extracts from the Perak Pahang and Jhoor Code transliterated and translated these are here printed for the first time and are fully prefaced by the official minute above referred to. (See Parliamentary Papers C\u20141889 p. 16.) That portion of it which deals with the emancipation scheme is omitted; the liberation of slaves and debtors in Perak having long since been effected. The native law though no longer in force in the northern portion of the Peninsula is probably not dissimilar to that which is still carried out in some of the islands of the Eastern Archipelago more or less remote from European influence and authority.\n\nHE institution of slavery as it exists among the Malays, in places where it has not been abolished by European influence, is a national custom which they have in common with other Indo-Chinese races, and it is a mistake to suppose that it is the offspring of Muhammadan law and religion, the introduction of which among the Malays is of comparatively modern date.\n\nMuhammadan law has, however, largely influenced Malay custom respecting slavery, and Arabic terminology is noticeable in many of the details incidental to the system. So far from being identical with the slavery lawful among Muslims in Egypt, Arabia, etc., the Malay institution is, in some respect, completely at variance with it, and in this particular, as in many others, there is a never-ending struggle between the hukum adat, the \"customary law\" of the Malays, and the hukum shar'a or \"religious law\" of the Koran. Muhammadan priests,\nwho would sometimes seek, if they could, to enforce the latter, are met by the plea that the practice denounced is lawful by Malay custom, and it is thus that debt-bondage, like opium smoking, gambling,* etc. is always defended.\n\nSlaves (hamba and kawan) in Perak are of two classes:\u2014\n\n(1) Slaves ('abdi).\n(2) Debtors (orang ber-hutang).\n\nA slave ('abdi) is either\u2014(1) A captive taken in war; (2) an infidel captured by force (e.g., a Batak of Sumatra or Sakei of the Peninsula); (3) A man-slayer ('jang bawa dirah mati'), or other criminal who is unable to pay the price of blood, or other fine (dugat), and who surrenders ('halur') himself and family to the Raju as slaves; (4) the offspring of a female slave (except when the owner acknowledges himself to be the father).\n\nHalur.\u2014The Raju's privilege of retaining as slaves all persons who have taken human life, and who throw themselves upon his protection, seems to be purely Malay. In other points the definition of the status of slave given above is in accordance with Muhammadan law.\n\nDebt-bondage.\u2014A debt-bondsman, although often called hamba (slave), is more correctly termed kawan (companion). He is a free man (mardahiku), as opposed to a slave ('abdi) though from his being obliged to serve his creditor in all kinds of menial employment, the two conditions are not always readily distinguishable.\n\nThe Koran, Sale's translation, C. II.\u2014This institution of debt-bondage is a native Malay custom, and is wholly opposed to Muhammadan law, which is most lenient to debtors. \"If,\" says the Koran, \"there be any (debtor) under a difficulty (of paying his debt) let (his creditor) wait till it be easy (for him to do it); but if ye remit it as alms it will be better for you, if ye knew it. And fear the day wherein ye shall return unto God; then shall every soul be paid what it hath gained, and they shall not be treated unjustly.\"\n\nPecuniary limit of fine.\u2014Malay custom in Perak used to fix\n\n* At Kota Lama in Perak, an Arab Hajj, who ventured once to denounce gambling as irreligious and wicked, was driven from the kampung and narrowly escaped with his life.\nthe value of a free man at $25 (100 bidar). Theoretically, a man could not be fined more than that sum, and was entitled to be released from bondage, on the tender of that sum, whatever might have been the nominal amount of the fine imposed by a Chief. In practice, however, in a state of society recognizing no right but that of the strongest, the acknowledged existence of this custom has not prevented the imposition of fines by Rajas and Chiefs far exceeding in amount the sum above named and the retention in bondage of persons whose relation would willingly pay that sum for their release.\n\nSlaves and debt-bondsmen in Perak before 1874 \u2014 The number of slaves and slave-bondsmen now in Perak is probably 3,000, about one-sixteenth of the whole Malay population. Before the establishment of settled government, under the administration of British officers, this form of property was much more valuable than at present. Every Raja and Chief was accompanied, when he went abroad, and was served when at home, by numerous dependents, debt-bondsmen, and slaves, who lived in or near his house, and belonged to his household. If they misbehaved they might be beaten and tortured, and slaves (\"abdi\") might be killed. If they ran away a regular scale of rewards, calculated according to distance, defined the payment to be made by their owner to any one capturing them. The ownership of a number of slaves and debt-bondsmen was a mark of a man of rank, wealth, and influence, and the aggregate amount of capital represented by his debt-bondsmen often amounted to several thousand dollars. The desire to possess, as a dependent, some particular person, sometimes led to the invention of fictitious debts, and people were liable, with little hope of redress, to be dragged from their homes and taken to the house of some great man, nominally as security for some debt, of which, perhaps, they had never heard. No work that debt-bondsmen performed for their creditors and masters operated to lessen the debt. They served in his household, cultivated his fields, and worked in his mines; but such service was merely a necessary incident of their position and was not accepted in part payment. Sometimes the master fed and clothed them, but more often they had to supply themselves with all necessaries,\nnotwithstanding that their labour was forfeited to the master's service.\n\nThe system of detaining persons in servitude as long as a debt for which they are liable is not discharged is very generally spread among the Malay races of the Archipelago. Through injustice and oppression it has been productive of peculiar hardship in Perak. Crawford, in 1820, noticed the custom in the following passage:\n\n\"If a debtor is unable to pay his creditor he is compelled to serve him until the debt be discharged, and he is then nearly in the condition of a slave. Every man has his fixed price, and if the debt exceed this, he either loses his liberty altogether or his family are compelled to serve the creditor along with him.\"\n\n\"The following two laws of Malacca have reference to this practice.\u2014If a man be in debt to such an amount as to exceed his estimated price in the country, then it shall be lawful for his creditor to punish him by stripes or abusive language; but after the manner of a free man, and not of slave. If a man deflower a virgin that is his debtor, he shall be compelled either to marry her or forfeit the amount of the debt.\"*\n\nThis universal custom is more distinctly expressed in the laws of Sumatra, as collected by the officers of the British Government. \"When a debt,\" say these, \"becomes due and the debtor is unable to pay his creditor, or has no effects to deposit, he shall himself, or his wife, or his children, live with the creditor as his bond-slave or slaves until redeemed by the payment of the debt.\"\n\nAmong Rawa Malays of Sumatra (many of whom are settled in Perak) it is, I am assured, customary to detain a debt bondsman for two years only. At the expiration of that time the debt, if not paid, remitted as alms.\n\nBy Perak Malays, on the contrary, the national customs, when favourable to the debtor, have been openly disregarded, and every kind of oppression has been practised.\n\nNotwithstanding the existence of a well-defined custom that the wife and children of a debtor should not be liable for his\n\n* History of the Indian Archipelago, III, 97.\ndebt unless it were incurred with their knowledge, and that the widow of a debt-bondsman should not be liable for more than a third of her husband's debt, it has gradually become usual for creditors to claim and enforce a right to hold the wife and family of a debtor in bondage for the full amount of any debt, during his lifetime and after his death. This cannot be justified by law or custom.\n\nThe daughters of a debt-bondsman, being in a manner the property of the creditor or master, were given in marriage by him; the dower (isi kawin or mas kawin) being paid to him. It seldom happens among Malays of the lower orders that the dower is paid at the time of marriage; the man, therefore, who married a woman from the house of her creditor usually became liable to the latter for the dower (say about $30), and was thus himself reduced to the condition of a bondsman.\n\nNo part of the dower was, however, credited to the original debtor towards the extinction of his debt. Thus, if a debt-bondsman owing $100 had four daughters, all of whom were given in marriage by the creditor to men of his selection, the master would receive four dowers in cash, or would get four more debt-bondsman in lieu thereof. But the original $100 would still remain. This monstrous injustice must be of modern introduction, or there would be few but debt-bondsman among the population. It has been imitated from the analogous practice in the case of the slaves (\"abdi\"), but it is an unjust and illegal innovation.\n\nAnother rule, which has, I believe, been frequently evaded in Perak, gave to any female debtor with whom her master cohabited, an absolute right to the cancelment of her debt, and made the latter punishable by fine if he did not give her her freedom.*\n\nIn the district of Kinta, the most important mining district in old days before the discovery of the Larut tin fields, debts were swelled in amount by a species of compound interest hardly conceivable among a people who profess to regard usury as sinful. Debts were usually calculated in tin, and\n\n* See s. 59 of the Malacca Code translated in Newbold's Account of the Straits Settlements, II, p. 293\nwere nominally payable in six months. Let it be supposed that a man in Kinta owed a bahara of tin (equivalent in value on the spot to $30, more or less), if he did not pay in six months he was liable by local custom for a bahara of tin at the Penang price, say three times its value at Kinta. The debt was then put down at three bahara, and a further time of six months given. If still unpaid at the expiration of the second period, the debt was again increased by the difference between the local price and that of Penang,* and so on indefinitely. The failure to pay a small debt in six months resulted commonly, therefore, in the reduction of the debtor to hopeless bondage for life.\n\nDebt-bondsmen do not labour under the legal disabilities which in Muhammedan law are incidental to the condition of slave (alodi), but they are to a certain extent the object of contumely.\n\nSlaves of the reigning family especially privileged \u2014The royal slaves (hamba Raja), or the slaves of the household of the reigning Sultan, were a special class, regarding whom certain peculiar rules and customs were in force. To strike one of them wrongfully, involved the penalty of death, and any person who enticed one away had to make good fourteen times his value.\n\nBesides the slaves purchased or inherited by the Raja, those born in his household and those taken under his protection under the law of halur, he became the master of a large number (especially females) by a most iniquitous custom which permitted him to forcibly carry off all the young women of certain districts, where there was no influential Chief or family to resist such tyranny (e.g., Kampar, Sungkei, and Putau Tiga), to become attendants in the royal household. A royal marriage or the birth of a child in the royal family was the signal for the despatch of messengers to drag from their homes all the girls and young married women of suitable age to be found in the selected district. These, under the name of dayang-dayang (maid servants), inang and pengasoh (nurses),\n\n* The Penang price was the local price, plus freight and export duties.\nremained generally for life as the Raja's slaves. Those not already married and accompanied in bondage by their husbands, were seldom allowed to marry, and if permission was accorded their husbands partook their fate as royal slaves, while the dowry (isi kamini) went to the Raja. Usually they led a life of prostitution with the knowledge and consent of the Raja and his household, and by their means a number of male attendants were always about the court, and the importance of the Raja was thereby outwardly increased.\n\nAt the time that British political officers were sent to reside in Perak the whole of the system above described was in full force. During the eight years which have elapsed since then, many causes have combined to render the slave laws practically much less oppressive, and the odious institutions of slavery and debt-bondage are now in fair way to die a natural death in the course of a few years.\n\nA large number of persons remain in a state of partial slavery; it is true, but in many cases they remain in that condition through choice or are only slaves in name. The arrival of a British Resident in Perak was an encouragement to those anxious to do so to free themselves, and some of the earliest difficulties which the first Resident (Mr. Burch) had with the natives of the country had reference to certain runaway slaves whom he refused to return. Since the Perak campaign of 1873-4, the death and banishment of many influential Rajas and Chiefs have given numbers of people their liberty, while such men of influence as have remained have generally been powerless to enforce the ancient laws against their slaves or to obtain their enforcement through the British officers employed in the State. Many of those inclined to do so, both slaves and debt-bondsmen, have left the masters and have assumed the status of free citizens without molestation, though they have been compelled in some instances to pay genuine debts proved in a court of law. In some cases where acts of oppression or ill-treatment have come to the notice of British officers, their influence has procured the release of sufferers.\n\nMost of the owners of slaves and debtors have come to look upon them as a comparatively worthless kind of property.\nSince they can neither compel them by force to work nor punish them for disobedience or misbehaviour, the mere nominal ownership is of limited practical value. It is only in a few cases, where family pride and a clinging to old customs prompt some of the remaining Rajas and heads of families of Chiefs to retain as many personal adherents as they can, that the possession of slaves now bears any resemblance to the old state of things. In some of these instances, notably in the case of Raja Muda Yusuf, the present Regent of Perak, there is no doubt that men and women have been and perhaps still are detained in the condition of slaves without any grounds, which would constitute a right, even under Malay customary law. There is, however, little harsh treatment and complaints are rare.\n\nThe possession of slaves and debtors is more common in the North than in the South of Perak, desertion being difficult in the more secluded districts. Most well-to-do men at Kota Lama and Chigar Galah own several.\n\nSlaves now in Perak may be divided as follows:\n\n1. *Abdi*, i.e., Batak, Sakei, and Habshi (Abyssinian) slaves and their descendants.\n\n2. *Hamba Raja*, or royal slaves, who have been seized by a Raja or have become *hulur* to the State.\n\n3. Debtors who have themselves contracted the debt for which they have forfeited their liberty.\n\n4. Debtors who have become so merely by marrying a female debtor and thus becoming liable to her master for her dower.\n\n5. Such wives, children and descendants of debtors as are lawfully liable for the debt according to Malay custom.\n\n6. Persons who are really neither slaves nor debtors, but who are detained or claimed on fictitious or unlawful grounds.\n\nSlavery in Perak could be stamped out at once by the adoption, by the Council, of resolutions founded on sections 2 and 4 of the Indian Act V of 1843 and providing first that \"no rights arising out of an alleged property in the person and services of another as a slave shall be enforced\" by any authority in Perak, and, second, that \"any act which would be penal of offence if done to a free man shall be equally an offence if...\"\n\"done to any person on the pretext of his being in a condition of slavery.\"\n\nBut the rights of proprietors have to be considered. Slaves have in many cases been acquired under circumstances perfectly in accordance with the law and custom of the country, and many debtors are bond fide indebted for specific sums to the person by whom they are detained in servitude. It would be unjust to deprive proprietors without compensation of this species of property.\n\nAny form of inquiry which would involve the examination of master and slave before a tribunal of some kind regarding the origin or legality of the servitude would be most unpopular to the upper classes, and I have no hesitation in saying that most Malays of good birth would rather release their slaves and lose their money than meet them on quasi equal terms in a court of inquiry.\n\nI believe that if it were resolved by the Council that any slave, whether aduli or debtor, might become free on payment to his owner, of the sum of $25 (which is, as has been pointed out above the price of a free-man according to Malay custom), a large proportion of the persons now in servitude would at once purchase their own liberty. They would be further stimulated to do so, if there were a provision authorising the Government to pay the sum and to require reimbursement by labour on some public work of utility.\n\nThere would still remain two classes of slaves to be dealt with\u2014those unable to pay and those who ought not to be required to pay. The first of these classes would be further subdivided into those able to work and those unable to work. Those unable to pay but able to work should be entitled to claim their freedom on borrowing the redemption sum ($25) from Government, and giving an equivalent value in labour on public works. Those unable to pay or to work (aged persons and women and children) should be entitled to claim their freedom unconditionally after a specified time, say three years. Those who are unlawfully detained and who, therefore, cannot be required to pay anything should be entitled to claim their release at any time from a Committee appointed to re-\nreceive and investigate such applications.\n\nAfter a time to be fixed by the Council, say three years, slavery should altogether cease, and all claims upon debt-bondsmen should lapse.\n\n* * * * *\n\nTwo codes of laws are known to the Perak Malays, though copies of them are extremely scarce among them, the \"Undang-undang ka-Raja-an,\"* or laws of the monarchy (or sovereignty), and the Undang-undang Menangkabau,* laws of Menangkabau sometimes called \"Undang-undang dua-blas,\" the twelve laws.\n\nThe former collection professes to be \"the laws of Perak, Pahang and Johor,\" and contains many provisions identical with those of the Malacca code. In it I have found a number of regulations regarding slaves and debtors, which I have transliterated and translated.\n\nSome are merely curious as showing from an authentic native source what was the condition of a slave in a Malay kingdom. Others may be of practical value to those entrusted with carrying out such measures for the abolition of slavery and debt-bondage as may be decided upon by the Council.\n\nNothing of value on the subject of slaves is to be found in the Menangkabau laws.\n\nI trust to be able shortly to send in the translation above mentioned as an appendix to this Minute.\n\nW.

If the free-man cannot kill him he may appeal to the judge and it is then for the judge to decide what is to be done to the slave.\nIf a free-man insults a slave and is resisted by him, should the slave be killed (in the encounter), the free-man must make good his price according to the full appraisement, but there is a different regulation where the slaves of a Raja are concerned.\n\nIf a slave assaults a free-man, there shall be retaliation in kind, after which his two hands shall be nailed down and the free-man shall be at liberty to enjoy the wife of the slave, but only until retaliation shall have been effected.\n\n---\n\nBab yang ka-sambilan pada me-nyata-kan hukum mengambali-kan hambe orang yang ber-chela barang siapa menebus-kan dia hingga anam bulan juga lama-nya dapat di-kambali-kan kepada tuan-nya ada-pun 'ab yang dapat di-kambali-kan itu seperti gila atau buta larung-an atau isak atau pe-lari atau pen-churi atau men-jual tuan-nya atau busong darah atau bunting me-lain-kan hambe itu tebus-an baharu datang maka hingga-nya yang dapat di-kambali-kan lagi sa-kadar anak bulan pernana bulan juga pkalau lalu dari pada itu tiada dapat di-kambali-kan lagi me-lain-kan 'ab-nya itu pada tuan-nya yang her-jual maka kambali seperti hukum yang dahulu itu\nChapter the ninth.\u2014To state the law regarding the return of slaves who have some defect.\u2014In such a case whoever has bought a slave has six months' time within which he may return him to his former master. The defects for which a slave may be sent back are that he is mad, of weak sight, asthmatic, a runaway, a thief, a seller of his master, or one afflicted with an aneurism, and (in the case of a woman) that she is pregnant. The time within which such a slave may be returned is from the new moon to the full moon (of the 6th month), if that time is exceeded the slave cannot be returned, but as long as the defect is the risk of the vendor, the slave is returnable in accordance with the law previously stated.\n\nBab yang kasapuloh pada me-nyata-kan segala orang mardahika yang mem-bawa hutang-hutang-an orang atau sakei atau biduanida orang atau hamba orang tiada tahu dengan penghulu-nya atau tuan-\nChapter the tenth.\u2014To declare the law regarding free-men who take (for any purpose) the debtors, sakel, biduanda or slaves of others without the knowledge of their penghulus or masters\u2014In such a case should anything happen the responsibility rests with him who takes the slaves, etc. (both upon him personally and upon his companions) until they have been returned to their penghulu or master.\n\nIf a slave is taken in the manner above-mentioned and travels into the interior as far as Pelak, or by sea as far as Penara and Benchah, no responsibility is incurred, but according to one version of the customary law, if there is default on the part of him who takes him, as, for instance, if the slave passes the limits above-mentioned with the knowledge of him who takes him, or dies in the performance of some work which he is ordered by the latter to do, his price is recoverable. Wherefore it is above all things incumbent on those who take with them the slaves of others to do so with the consent of their masters. All slaves who go forth to seek a livelihood must\nbe examined by their masters (as to their intentions), if this is not done, the responsibility rests with the master, but if a slave goes forth without the knowledge of the master, or after the master has made such enquiry, the responsibility is no longer on the master but on him.\n\nBab yang ke-sebelas pada me-niata-kan hukum sagala orang yang meng-hutang kan hamba orang yang diada se-tahu tuan-nya ada-pun yang hamba orang itu atas dua bahagei suatu hamba orang itu ada ber-punya maka dapat meng-hutang-i dia kadua hamba orang itu maffe tiada dapat meng-hutang-i dia me-lain-kan se-paha jikalau lebih deri-pada itu hilang harta-nya ada-pun kata kami ini pada orang yang meng-hutang sahaja bukan pada orang me-ngaga dengan dia jikalau pada hal ber-naga tiada harus di-per-hilang harta-nya dan tiada ter-ranggong atau tuan-nya maka handak-lah kamu sakalau meng-hu-tang-kan sagala hamba orang itu memilik pada ka-laku-an-nya sa-paya jangan ter-anniyaya kemudian.\n\nChapter the eleventh. To declare the law regarding such persons as give credit to slaves without the knowledge of their masters \u2014Now slaves are of two kinds, first, those who have property of their own,\nto them credit may be given; second those who are paupers, to them no credit may be given beyond the sum of one paha (two dollars). If credit be given beyond this sum, the creditor loses his property. What we say here applies to persons who simply lend money to slaves, not to persons who trade with them; if it is a matter of commerce, it is not lawful that the vendor shall lose his property. There is no responsibility on the master.\n\nWherefore all ye who give credit to slaves must carefully note their behaviour so that ye may not suffer loss afterwards.\n\n---\n\nBab yang ka-tiga-blas pada me-nyata-kan sagala hukum orang meng-ambil anak orang yang ter-buang oleh ibu-nya ada-pun barang siapa meng-ambil dia maka handak-lah mem-beri tabu tuan-nya jika lau sudah dengan izin tuan-nya maka handak-lah di-per-saksi-kan-nya ada-pun jualan ada yang izin tuan-nya itu atas dua bagai suatu me-lepas-kan dia sakal-kah ka-dun me-naga-kan pada me-melehra-kan dia ada-pun izin yang me-niaga-kan pada me-melehra itu sa-per-tiga\nharga sa-bahagi akan yang me-melehra dia dengan itu kambali kapada tuan-nya maka di-bahagi anum sa-bahagi akan yang me-melehra dia ada-pun pada kaul yang sab suatu pun tiada di-per-uleh dengan itu dengan kambali kapada tuan-nya karana iya me-lalu-i amar raja itu me-lain-kan sukar iya akan mem-beri tabu tuan-nya seperti tampat-nya jauh dan barang sa-bagei-nya maka kambali kapada hukum yang dahulu itu\n\nChapter the thirteenth.\u2014To declare the law regarding persons who take the children of others abandoned by their parents.\u2014Whoever takes a child (so abandoned) must inform his (the child's) master, and if he obtains the permission of the latter, must call together witnesses to testify to it. The permission of the master may be given in two ways, either he may emancipate the child altogether, or, secondly, he may make a bargain for his bringing up, in which case the charge is one-third of the (child's) value which is awarded to him who brings him up. If, however, the child returns to his master (who is in ignorance of his having been brought up by another), one-sixth of his value is awarded to him who brought him up. But according to a generally received opinion nothing whatever is to be received in such a case by the latter, for he has departed from the command of the Raja (in not notifying to the master the finding of the child). If, however, it is difficult to inform the master (at the time that the child is taken), on account, for instance, of distance, or some other reason, the rule first laid down may be followed.\n\n\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u064a\u0641\u06a9\u0627 \u0645\u0641\u0647 \u0628\u0644\u0633 \u0647\u062f \u0645\u0647\u0646\u0627\u06a9\u06cc \u0645\u0633\u0644 \u062d\u06a9\u0645 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u063a\u06cc\u0645 \u0645\u0641\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u0647\u0633\u0628 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u063a \u062f\u0634\u06cc \u062a\u06cc\u0627\u062f \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u062a\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u062f\u0641\u0648\u0646 \u062c\u06a9\u0644\u0648 \u0647\u0633\u0628 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u063a \u0627\u0628\u06cc \u0645\u0634\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0641\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0648\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0628\u063a \u0633\u0645\u0631\u06cc \u062d\u0627\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u06a9\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0648\u0631 \u062c\u06a9\u0644\u0648\u0645\u0627\u062a\u06cc \u0627\u062a\u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u06af\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0646 \u062d\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u062d\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u06cc \u0644\u06cc\u0627\u062f \u0645\u06cc\u0628\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u063a\u06cc\u0645 \u0645\u0641\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u063a\u06cc\u0645 \u0627\u06cc\u0628 \u062c\u06a9\u0644\u0648 \u062a\u06cc\u0627\u062f \u0645\u06cc\u0628\u0631\u062a \u0647\u0631\u0637 \u0627\u06cc\u0628 \u0645\u06cc\u0628\u0644\u0647 \u062d\u0627\u0644 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u0628\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0647\u0631\u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u062f\u0641\u0648\u0646 \u0644\u0644\u0647\u06cc\u0645\u0646 \u06a9\u0646\u062f \u0644\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0633\u0641\u0631\u0647 \u06a9\u0627\u0644\u0648 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u06af\u0631\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u0628\u0647\nBab yang ka-ampat-belas pada me-nyata-kan sagala hukum orang yang meng-upah hamba orang yang tunda sa-tahu tuan-nya ada-pun jikalau hamba orang itu masih iya meng-ambil upah-an atau yang mem-beri hasil akan tuan-nya atau sewa-nya jikalau mati atau barang suatu hal ahwal-nya iya tunda menyihh orang yang meng-ambil upahan itu jikalau tunda seperti sharat itu menyihh hal dan menyihh sa-harga-nya ada-pun pinjam-an kapada tuan-nya seperti kayu dan barang subagi-nya jikalau barang suatu ahwal-nya lumba orang itu menyihh iya ada-pun pada suatu keul hukum roem menyihh itu dengan harg-nya juga karena pe-karja-an itu dengan sabilah izin tuan-nya ada-pun jikalau ada di-pinjam-nya itu tunda ter-khas dengan suatu pe-karja-an jikalau barang suatu ahwal-nya iya menyihh melam-kan mati-nya itu dengan sa-sutan dengan hukum Allah Taala lain dari\nChapter the fourteenth.\u2014To declare the law regarding those who hire the slaves of others without the knowledge of their master\n\n\u2014If it is a matter of general notoriety that the slave is in receipt of hire or if he pays his earnings to his master or a rate in lieu of his services, then, should the slave die in such service, or should anything befall him, the person who hired him is not responsible for his value. But if the conditions are not as laid down here, there must be restitution of the full value.\n\nThe loan of a slave from his master is like the borrowing of a stick or anything else; should anything happen to him, there must be compensation. According to one rule of the customary law, the compensation shall be the price of the slave, for the work he was put to do was beyond the knowledge of his master.\n\nIf the slave is borrowed without any stipulation as to the particular work he is to do, and anything happens to him, the borrower must make compensation, but it is otherwise if the slave dies by the\nvisitation of God most high (as, for instance, if he is carried off by a tiger or is bitten by a snake or meets his death by any kind of fall etc.), or if there is an acknowledgment by his master (that he will be responsible for all accidents), then, should anything happen to him, there is nothing to be done, and the borrower makes no compensation, but he is bound to take care of the slave (if he is only injured) until his recovery. But if the injury is received during work different from that which was authorised by the master, and anything happens, the borrower must make good the loss. The same rule holds good of living animals, but it differs from the law regarding the loan of (inanimate) property such as weapons, utensils, ornaments, etc. These are to be paid for according to their calculated value, and if burnt or sunk or otherwise destroyed, the borrower must pay half of the value, even although no blame attaches to him for negligence. But if there is an acknowledgment on the part of the owner that he will be responsible for all loss, the borrower need not compensate.\n\n\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u06a9\u0644\u0645 \u0628\u0644\u0633

slaves.\u2014Whosoever lives in the forest or in the country, or, a fortiori, in a town, must, if any runaway slave comes to him take him at once to the judge; any one who fails to do so shall be punished, if a male, by having his ears clipped (with rotan soga), and, if a woman, she shall have her head shaved and then be beaten with rotan manau. If the slave dies or escapes, the owner may sue the harbourer for his value and also for the calculated value of his work during the period that he was so harboured. According to one version of the customary law, he (the person harbouring the slave) may also be punished with stripes, even though he be a freeman.\n\nWe now proceed to state the customary law regarding the redemption of (recaptured) slaves who have run away. If the slave escapes from within the fort and is recaptured within the limits of the town the reward is two kupang and the property which he takes with him may not be seized by the captor. Beyond the limits of the town (Pahang), that is to say, Kanchong down-stream and Sungai Leateng up stream, the reward is 3 kupang and all that he carries with him such as knives, choppers and all small articles of trifling value may be seized and retained by the captor.\n\nEverything else must be restored to the master.\n\nDown the Pahang river.\n\nAs far as Kuala,\n\n| Place       | Reward |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Truson      | 6 kupang |\n| Benchah     | 2 mas, less 1 kupang |\n| Biri       | 3 \"    |\n| Merichang   | 1 paha |\n| Rampasan    | 5 mas  |\n| Panteran    | half a lungkal |\n| Endan      | 2 mas  |\n| Mersang     | half a tahil |\n\n* 1 amas = 1 mayam.

This applies to all the reefs and rocks in the sea if the slave gets beyond Sedili and Trengganu.\n\nWe also lay down that if the slave gets beyond Kanchong, upstream, or beyond Sungei Lentang, downstream, the captor is entitled to one-tenth of whatever property the slave carries with him.\nBab yang ka-anam b\u00e9las pada menyata-kan hukum sagala orang yang ber-jual dengan orang deri-pada sa-orang kepada sa-orang kemudian jikalau ber-temu dengan tuan-nya jika ber-kahandak tuan-nya akan dia di-tebus sa-penebus tuan-nya yang baharu itu tinda da-pat di-per-hilung harta orang yang menebus itu melankan dengan tuan-nya atas yang ber-jual pertama itu juga dapat hasil-nya.\n\nChapter the sixteenth To declare the law regarding any person who sells the slave of another so that he is sold and resold from one to another If he should be discovered by his rightful owner the latter must, if he wants to take him back, pay the full sum for which he was bought by the last vendee. It is not lawful that the purchaser should be a loser, but the person who originally sold the slave is the person to be called to account.\n\n* * * * *\nChapter the nineteenth \u2014 To declare the greater consideration to be given to the households of Rajas than to those of ye all. If any one strikes the slave of a Raja, so that he dies, the offender if a free-man must surrender himself as a hostage to a Raja and if a slave he shall be strangled and beheaded; and if the act of the slave is committed with the knowledge of his master the latter shall be fined a kuta and five tohols of silver. Wherefore none of ye must resist the slave of a Raja on any occasion whatsoever. This rule may be modified if the slave is very insulting, as for instance, towards females, so that the opponent cannot restrain himself any longer or cannot get away from him. In such a case the Raja's slave may be forcibly taken, or his offence may be reported to the judge or to the Raja's penghulu who should punish him.\nBab yang ka-dua-puloh-satu pada me-nyata-kan hukum sagala orang yang ber-jual per-hias-an raja atau sakei raja atau budak-budak raja jikalau orang yang ber-tuntu sa-pulang-tujoh hukum-nya lagi di-kata-i di-hadap-an majlis jikalau hamba rajadi-ganti-nya sa-pulang-tujoh di-suroh nista pada sakei-nya jikalau orang yang ber-tuntu sa-hingga sa-musim lama-nia jikalau hamba raja sa-hingga sa-tahun lama-nya ada-pun jikalau lalu deri-pada itu datang-lah hal akan dia seperti yang telah ter-sebut itu.\n\nChapter the twenty first.\u2014To declare the law relating to persons who sell royal trappings or the Sakeis or slaves of the Raja. If this is done by a person of consideration he shall be ordered to restore seven fold and shall be publicly rebuked; if the offender be a royal slave he shall restore seven fold and shall be disgraced by the reviling of his companions.

When on the delivery of an article the purchaser discovers in it a defect of long standing he can return it. If the defect is not discovered at once the property may be returned to the vendor whenever it is discovered, but this does not apply to a purchaser who knowing of the defect has been trying in his turn to disguise it and to sell the property. If a female slave is pregnant at the time of purchase and gives birth to a child while she is in the possession of her new owner, the child remains the property of the latter and is not sent back with the mother. There are a number of defects for which a slave may be rejected. Habitual runaways, prostitutes, thieves, lunatics and persons afflicted with aneurism, hernia, partial blindness, deafness, the skin disease called sopak, or dumbness, and female slaves who have husbands, may be rejected and so may those who have some hidden defect at whatever time the latter may be discovered.\n\n* Compare section 9 on p. 14 supra. It seems to be the Pahang law, while this section is the Perak law.\nChapter the forty-second \u2014 To state the law about the finding of runaway slaves. Suppose the owner says, \"If any one finds my slave who has runaway I will give so much as his reward\" he must give the sum promised to the person by whom the slave is found. If he says \"If Si Zeid finds him I will give him 3 tampang,\" if Si Omar finds him I will give him 6 tampang and if Si Ahmad finds him I will give him 9 tampang,\" he must give as much as he promises to that one of the three who may find the slave. If they all find him together, the sum of the amounts promised must be divided by three and one third must be paid by the owner. If the slave is found by a person who has no promise of a reward, the owner must be ordered to reward him according to the custom of the country.\n\n\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u064a\u0641\u0643\u0627\u0646\u0645 \u0644\u0648\u0643 \u062f\u0648\u0627 \u062f\u062f \u0645\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0646\u0643\u064a \u0641\u0631\u064a \u0645\u0643\u064a\u0644 \u062d\u0643\u0645 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u063a \u0628\u0631\u0637\u0648\u0639 \u0645\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0646\u0643\u064a \u0647\u0631\u0641\u064a \u0645\u0627\u062a\u064a \u062f\u062f \u062f\u064a\u0643\u0631\u0627\u064a \u0627\u0645\u0641\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0645\u0633 \u0646\u064a\u0627\u0632 \u0647\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0633 \u0646\u0627\u0646\u0633\u064a\u0643 \u0645\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0643\u064a \u062f\u064a\u0647\u0627\u064a \u062a\u064a\u0643 \u0633\u0647\u0627\u064a \u0627\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0631\u064a \u0645\u0645\u0628\u0627\u0632 \u0628\u0631\u0645\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0643\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u063a\u0628\u0631\u0637\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0631\u064a \u062a\u064a\u0627\u062f \u062f\u064a\u0631\u0646\u0643\u064a \u0647\u064a\u0644\u0639 \u0647\u0631\u0648\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u063a \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0647\u064a\u0643 \u0628\u0631\u0645\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u0639 \u0628\u064a\u062f \u064a\u0639 \u0647\u064a\u0644\u0639 \u062f\u0633\u064a\u0644\u0628\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0645\u0648\u0644\nBab yang ka-anam puloh dua pada menyata-kan pri sagala hukum orang ber-hutang menurut-kan hutang-nya mati pada pe-karja-an nya ampuhnya amas tiada harus di-tambah-kan melantikan di-bahagi tiga sa-bahagi istri-nya membayar ber-mula sagala orang ber-hutang anak istri-nya tiada harus di-per-nakal-nakal hilang harta-nya karena orang mardahika, ber-mula barang benda yang hilang di-silh-nya ber-mula sagala hamba orang di-jual orang barangkali ber-temu dengan tuan-nya di-tebus sa-harga-nya ber-mula sagala hamba orang lari dari benua satu ka-benua satu harga-nya dua ratus akan orang mendapat ber-mula sagala orang lari dari benua kepada benua lain seperti orang lari ka-benua ini dam kian-lah anugrah-kan akan orang itu yang mendapat ber-mula sagala orang mardahika meng-ambil hamba raja jadi hamba raja hukum-nya jika hamba orang meng-ambil hamba raja hukum-nya di-palu sarat ber-mula barung siapa memalu hamba-nya lalu mati salah pada raja ber-mula barung siapa memalu hamba raja jika tiada dengan salah-nya salah pada bumi salah sakali-pun tangkap bawa pada orang momeyang dia bagei marika-marika bagei salah-salah hukum ini raja-raja menghukum-kan.\nChapter the sixty second.\u2014To declare the law regarding debtors who give themselves in security for their debts and die in the performance of their service\u2014In such a case it is not lawful for the creditor to claim the debt (from the family of the deceased), but it must be divided into three, and the wife (of the debtor) must pay one third (the other two thirds being lost?). Further, in the case of any debtor, it is not lawful to vex his wife and children to the loss of their property, for they are free citizens (mardahika) and any property of theirs that is lost (through such oppression) must be made good.\n\nIf the slave of one man be (wrongfully) sold by another and afterwards falls in with his real owner, the latter has a right to take him off paying his price.\n\nIf a slave flies from one country to another, the person who finds him shall be entitled to two hundred (hidor?)\n\nSo also, if any one runs from one country to another, as for instance if foreigners run to this country, the same reward shall be bestowed on him who finds him.\n\nAny free-man who takes away one of the Raja's slaves (hamba raja) shall himself be made a slave to the Raja.\n\nIf a slave takes away a hamba raja he shall be punished with one hundred blows.\n\nWhoever beats his slave so that he dies is guilty of an offence against the Raja.\n\nWhoever strikes a hamba raja who is not in fault is guilty towards the earth (i.e., forfeits his life). Even if the hamba raja be in fault let him (not be struck, but) be taken to the person who has charge of him; there are many kinds of men and many kinds of offences.

To declare the law regarding the commission payable for the restoration of runaway slaves. -If the slave\nbe caught within the *kota* (the Raja's premises or grounds) the payment is one *tampang*. Every one who discovers a runaway slave must take him to the landing-place for three days and there exhibit him to Demang Khoja Ahamad, or else to the *balei* and produce him before the *Mantri*. If he omits to do this, he commits an offence and, if the slave makes his escape or dies, he must make good his value. All persons taking refuge with another, such as slaves or deserters must be taken to the *Mantri* and exhibited before him; if this is not done, the case is like one of theft.\n\nSo, any person who finds any gold or silver article or any article of clothing or anything else must take it to the landing-place and exhibit it there for three days and if the owner does not come forward it must be taken to the *Mantri* or the officer appointed by the Raja. If this be done no fault lies with the finder, but if it be not done and this be found out subsequently, the finder may be fined in the same manner as a thief.\n\nAgain, in the case of boats, oars, paddles, mat-awnings, etc. found floating, these must not be flung aside carelessly. If they are treated in this way and are not taken to the landing-place for three days, the finder is guilty of an offence.\n\nIf a slave be struck for using offensive language and dies of the blow, the fine shall be his full value.\n\nIf a free-man kill a slave, the law of retaliation shall not be enforced, but the full price of the slave must be paid.\n\n---\n\n\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u064a\u0641\u06a9\u0627 \u0646\u0645 \u0641\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u062a\u0648\u062c\u0647 \u0641\u062f \u0645\u0647\u062a\u0627\u06a9\u0646 \u062d\u06a9\u0645 \u0633\u06af\u0644 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u063a\u06cc\u063a \u0628\u0631\u06af\u0627\u0631\u0647\u06a9\u0646 \u062f\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u06a9\u0647\u0641 \u06cc\u0641\u0628\u0648\u06a9\u0646 \u06a9\u0639\u0627 \u06cc\u0641\u0646\u0633\u067e \u062f\u063a\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u0636\u0627 \u0646 \u0633\u06af\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0631\u062b\u06cc \u0645\u06a9 \u0627\u06cc \u0647\u0646\u062f\u0642 \u06a9\u0645\u0628\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u06a9\u0647\u0641 \u0627\u06cc\u0628\u0648 \u06cc\u0641\u06af\u0627\u0628 \u0647\u0646\u062f\u0642\u0644\u0647 \u062f\u063a\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u0636\u0627 \u0646 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u063a\u06cc\u063a \u062a\u0645\u062a\u0641\u062a\u0628 \u062f\u0648\u062f\u0642 \u0627\u06cc\u0628 \u062c\u06a9 \u0627\u062f \u06a9\u0633\u0644\u0647\u0646 \u062a\u0645\u063a\u0647 \u062f\u0648\u062f\u0642 \u0627\u06cc\u0628\nBab yang ke-nam puluh tujuh, pada menyatakan hukum sagala orang yang ber-taroh-kan diri kepada yang bukan ka-atib-an-nya dengan ka-rilla-an sagala wana-nya maka iya bandak kambali pada bapa-nya handak-lah dengan rilla-an orang yang tampat-na duduk itu jika ada ka-salah-an tampat duduk itu maka tungal-an-nya kiar hukum dengan betapa salah-nya maka di-tik kapada ka-salah-an-nya jika salah-nya itu atas dua bahagi pertama handak di-per-chabuli kadua di-nista-nya dengan nista yang tiada harus di-khar-kan maka hukum-nya pun dua perkara apa-kala bandak di-per-chabul-i-nya di-denda hukum-nya sapuloh tengah tiga jika di-nista-mata sehaja maka iya kambali sagala harta-nya sumus-nya dibawa-nya kiar sagala hukum tiada harus di-bahagi apa-bila tiada ada sa-sustu ka-salah-an-nya akan marika itu maka tungal-an uloh yang men-troh-kan diri-nya nu barang yang ada harta-nya itu khar sagala hukum di-bahagi tiaga sa-bahagi kapada orang yang ber-taroh-kan diri-nya dua bahagi kapadn orang yang menaroh.\n\nChapter the sixty-seventh \u2014To declare the law regarding voluntary surrender to servitude \u2014If a person who has voluntarily surrendered himself (or herself) to a person beyond the forbidden degrees of relationship with consent of all his (or her) relations, wishes subsequently to return to his (or her) parents, the consent of the\nperson with whom he (or she) lives must first be obtained. If there is any fault on the part of the latter, in consequence of which the servant absconds, the law depends upon the wrong committed. Investigation has to be made as to the nature of the wrong, which may be of two kinds, either an attempt to do an improper act, or the use of such insulting language as it is not lawful to use. The punishment is of two kinds; if there has been an attempt to commit an indecent act, the penalty is a fine of twelve and a half (taluts?); if there has been insulting behaviour only, all the property which the servant brought must be returned to him (or her) and the opinion of all the judges is that there can be no division of it.\n\nWhen, without the slightest fault on the part of the person who accepts the charge of another, the latter, who has voluntarily surrendered himself (or herself), absconds, the opinion of all the judges is that his or her property shall be divided into three portions, one of which shall go to the person who surrendered his (or her) liberty and the remaining two to the person who accepted charge of him (or her).\n\n---\n\nBab yang ka-anam puloh delapan, pada menyatakan pri hukum sagala orang mengambil anak angkat akan anak hamba orang lain maka di-bawa ber-layar mula-mula itu dengan sa-tahu tuan-nya kem-\nChapter the sixty eighth \u2014 If one adopts the child of the slave of another person and takes the child so adopted on a voyage, the first time with the knowledge of the owner of the slave, but afterwards without giving notice to him and (during the subsequent voyage) the child dies, the unanimous opinion of the judges is that the father by adoption shall pay to the owner half of the value of the child.

MARTIN LISTER.\n\nIn 1888, I wrote an appendix to my Administration Report on the Negri Sembilan for 1887 entitled \"Origin and Constitution.\"* It has been suggested that what was only a very brief and superficial sketch might further be enlarged upon. What I wrote was explanatory of my Report, was sketchy and in many points inaccurate, and it was not written for publication in a Journal. This paper, however, was reprinted in the Asiatic Society's Journal, though this had not been my intention when I wrote the Report, and it is excusable, I think, to say that difficulties have arisen in writing what I had intended to write later, viz., a far fuller and more careful paper for publication in connection with this very interesting subject. Without constant repetition of the previous paper this is impossible. Thus I have decided upon taking the question from a different view, and giving some illustrations of cases and decisions in Malay custom connected with their origin, such custom being of a curiously complicated form and derived from a singular origin of Muhammadan Malay occupation and are, if not unknown, ignored in other Malay States.\n\nFirst and foremost it must be understood that instead of Bugis and other Malay pirates occupying a coast line, as in the case of Selangor and Perak, driving back and taking as slaves the non-Muhammadan aborigines of the Peninsula termed \"Sakei,\" \"Jakun,\" \"Semang\" and \"Waris laut,\" the people of Menangkabau who penetrated into the Negri Sembilan nd\n\n* Vide \"The Negri Sembilan, their Origin and Constitution,\" 1889.\nMalacca or the Muar River came as settlers. They came in search of pastures new, possibly on account of troubles and disturbances in the State of Menangkabau in Sumatra, just as we did in leaving English shores for the continent of America. There were no Rajas or Warriors on the look out for conquest and plunder, merely peaceful emigrants from Sumatra who hoped to find fertile and rich countries in which they might quietly settle and make their home. Now it is more than probable that all these settlers came from the interior of Sumatra. They were accustomed to mountainous, hilly districts where existed rich alluvial valleys in which they knew they would find soils fertile and easy of irrigation. Thus, taking a number of the States as instances, we have Rembau and Naning both inland from Malacca and within easy reach of high mountains\u2014Ledang (Ophir) on the one side, and the range of hills from Gunong Tampin running to the North. Those who penetrated here were evidently not piratically inclined, they came to cultivate, to live and let live. Then, we have Sungai Ujong where all the original settlers are to be found at Pantei (at the foot of Gunong Berembun) and in the upper reaches of the Linggi River, though later they occupied the Coast, in contention however constantly with the Rajas of Selangor (very piratically inclined gentlemen), who did all they knew to harass the people of the interior. This is a very possible explanation of the claims of Selangor to Lukut and Sungai Raya, which can only be viewed in connection with some such piratical occupation, and not from any real territorial rights.\n\nMalacca was a very ancient Sultanate dating from even before the Muhammadan religion reached the Straits of Malacca. I add this, as it might be said, in speaking of territorial rights, \"Then why did not the Negri Sembilan possess Malacca?\" Again the Sultans of Malacca and of Menangkabau were apparently closely related, the Negri Sembilan settlers acknowledging the Sultanate of Malacca supreme, as it was, in the Malay Peninsula, and when this Sultanate was driven by the Portuguese to settle in Johor, they acknowledged the ancient Sultans of Johor, of which the present Sultan is only a distant connection.\nThe inhabitants of the State of Johol, which includes Ulu Muar, Terachi and Jempol, are said to have reached this country by ascending the Muar River. The origin of the word Muar is said to be from the Malay word \"Mua,\" for which the best translation may be \"satiated.\" Thus \"Suda mua mudek sungai ini\"\u2014\"I am utterly satiated (by fatigue) in ascending this river.\" Thus Muar became the name given to the district from the Segamat boundary to Kwala Jeleti in the State of Johol. The settlers, however, appear to have recovered their strength and colonised again \"Ulu Muar,\" almost the most populous State, at present, of the Negri Sembilan. From this again we have Kwala Muar, the name given to the small territory on the Muar River from the Segamat boundary to the mouth of the river. Segamat was ruled by the Sultans of Johor, through the Temenggong of Segamat, and Kwala Muar was never a place of any importance except as the mouth of a large river and the residence latterly of Sultan Ali of Johor. Ulu Klang, one of the four original States of the Negri Sembilan, appears to have been principally so in origin as but very few Menangkabau settlers went there, and it was more from the aboriginal point of view that it was considered one of the Negri Sembilan, though in connection with the ancient constitution there is no doubt that it formed a part. This I described more or less in my original paper. I also sketched the arrival of emigrants from Sumatra, and later the demand by these thriving colonists from Menangkabau for a Raja from that Sultanate to be suzerain and constitutional Sultan of the Negri Sembilan, i.e., for a number of States which had become so populous that the necessity for a Raja and high court of appeal had become felt.\n\nFrom what is here written and from my original paper, the way is paved to giving intelligibly a number of political cases and cases of custom which may go further to give a general insight into custom from origin. Much of what occurs here in connection with Malay laws is frequently found in other Malay districts of the interior, such as Kinta, Ulu Selangor and Ulu Pahang, where the Malay custom is closely allied with aboriginal customs and ideas.\nIn order to treat the question in a consecutive form, it will be necessary to take first the aboriginal or as here termed \"Rai'at\" cases in custom first. The \"Baten\" or chiefs are, according to ancient usage, closely connected with the Malay tribe from which the Penghulu of States are in nearly all cases elected. The four principal \"Baten\" are of Ulu Klang, Sungei Ujong, Jelebu and Johol. They had a strong voice in the election of the Muhammadan Penghulu. The cause is apparent. The Menangkabau colonists married the daughters of Batens. Their children were Muhammadians and the female children (in accordance with Menangkabau law) inherited and became the origin of the \"Waris\" or tribe of \"Beduanda\" which was declared to be the inheriting civilized tribe, whilst at the same time they still had to recognise the Baten or Rai'at powers in the mountains and forests and preserve their position and identity in connection with the \"Beduanda\" tribe. This explains the custom of female inheritance and according to Menangkabau custom a man cannot marry in his tribe, that is, in the tribe of his mother. Thus a Beduanda man must marry into another tribe and thus his children belong to the tribe of the mother.\n\nIt is often most interesting to converse with Baten and Rai'at chiefs on their traditions and laws especially in tracing the connection with the Malay Muhammadan customs. A Baten will invariably tell you that all the forest and waste lands, called by them \"Gaung,\" \"Gunong,\" \"Bukit,\" \"Bukan\" as inclusive of everything uncultivated, belong to them. This is by origin correct, but there is at the same time no doubt that they have parted with their rights to the Muhammadan tribe of Beduanda in all cases of Government concession and taxation. Still the Datoh of Johol pays to the Baten of Johol a proportion of the revenues derived from waste lands through his minister the Jenang of Johol, who is, so to speak, minister for the aborigines. The Batens often collect themselves where the Beduanda are remiss in doing so. For instance, in Muar (i.e., on the reaches of the Muar River above the Segamat boundary) Baten Gemala, who is the principal Baten of Johol, told me he collected a fee that he called \"panchong alas\" from the Malays who\ncollected jungle produce. The amount of the fee was insignificant, being $1 per man once in three years. He told me with some pride that this was the \"peti duit orang utan\" or \"the penny box of the man of the woods.\" The simplicity of this form of taxation was most curious and shows the freedom from guile of the aboriginal mind. He was attempting at the time I first met him to collect this fee for the past three years, not in advance. I tried to assist him, but my attempt was vain. He was somewhat indignant at the falseness of the Malay, but for my own part I was not astonished at it. In talking of his position with reference to the Datoh of Johol he said that as between him and the Datoh \"adat tiada berubah, perjanjian tiada berubah, setia tiada bertukar,\" i.e., \"custom cannot be altered, agreements cannot be changed, alliances cannot be revoked.\" This is a very beautiful expression of Malay fealty and loyalty. Sometimes a Baten or Jerukrah who is minister to the Baten is very indignant. He will say \"the Penghulu get thousands of dollars now in selling our forests.\" Then I explain to them that it is necessary that this earth should be developed. I point out to them that they are not able to govern or regulate such things and that they cannot truly claim the forests as being theirs, but that what they can claim is to have all that they require for their maintenance from forests. They will then reply that this is quite right and that they are really perfectly happy as long as they have forests reserved to them and that they do not know what to do with money. They are delighted with presents of tobacco, stuffs and other trifles. If you give them money they generally go home to the forest and bury it, never telling any one where, so that on their death it is lost. I know one man who likes getting money and he always comes alone to see me and asks for it. He comes alone so as to be able to bury the money without difficulty. He has evidently a craving for silver and experiences the satisfaction of a miser in knowing that he has money, though he does not make use of it.\n\nThe Rai'at talk in the most proverbial manner and constantly quote sayings which have certainly become Malay, but\nwhich often and often are unknown to Malays of the present day. It is a usual thing for a Malay to exclaim when a Rai'at is talking \"pandei sekuli chakap\"\u2014\"how clever he is at talking\"\u2014and he looks at him in admiration. The Malay, however, knows the Rai'at's intense simplicity, and if he wants any advantages from him he will get all he requires. He will also laugh at him, though in a friendly chaffing way and it is often amusing to hear the Rai'at get by far the best of the laugh.\n\nThe Rai'ats never object to the collection of revenues by British Officers. They say that the English know how to do it and that they do it rightly and that it should be so, but they say the Malays know nothing about it and that when money comes into a Malay country it makes nothing but difficulties and trouble. They are lookers on, and it is hardly necessary to say how correct their views are.\n\nA Rai'at has the greatest dread of a grant for land; nothing will persuade him to take out a grant and if pressed, which in the Native States is unnecessary, he will leave the country and travel away into the mountains of the interior. Anything binding, any direct taxation or registration drives them away.\n\nTheir real objection to taking out grants for land is because of their custom that if there is a death in the house, they must leave the place and settle elsewhere generally many miles away.\n\nThe origin of land tenure here is very curious and probably unknown in any other State of the Malay Peninsula. When the original settlers arrived, they ingratiated themselves with the aborigines and first of all no doubt got free gifts of forest land from the Baten. Later on there probably was competition for waste lands in fertile valleys and presents were given to the Baten for the land. This resulted later in the sale of land to the Muhammadan settlers. The price was a knife or a weapon, a piece of cloth or some article valued by the Rai'at, but it became an actual sale. According to Muhammadan law, land cannot be sold, it is God's land and man cannot sell it. Thus here we have distinctly the aboriginal origin in the sales of waste lands. Later, as the Muhammadans became powerful\nin the country, the Muhammadan tribe of Beduanda took up the sale of waste lands and made considerable profit by it, and during the last twenty years, the Beduanda chiefs have sold waste lands of, say, three or four acres in extent for eight and ten dollars and sometimes more.\n\nAs this custom was against Muhammadan law it was easy for the Government to put a stop to an usage which caused many disputes, trouble and even bloodshed in the country.\n\nIn my article printed in this Journal, 1889, I have given the dry facts in connection with origin and constitution. The tribes are governed by the \"Adat Perpatih\" and by the customs derived from the aborigines. With the Raja family this is not the case, and the \"Adat Temenggong\" governs property and inheritance.\n\nIn order to explain by practical instances the entire constitution, I will now give a number of political and customary cases which have occurred to my knowledge as these may be useful in understanding a somewhat elaborate constitution and code of laws. I must remark at the same time that in quoting past cases I do not wish in any way to criticize what was done in the past, when it was absolutely impossible to make head or tail of the intricate laws of these States and when we had the very smallest experience in the Malay Peninsula.\n\nFirst of all, I would refer to the case of the Yam Tuan Mudaship of Rembau. An Arab Syed (Saban) from Malacca married a daughter of the Yam Tuan Muda Raja Ali of Rembau. He learnt something of the tribal laws of Rembau and what to him was the great thing the law of female inheritance. He advised his father-in-law to abdicate in his favour. At this the Penghulu and Lembagas of Rembau were furious, refusing to have a Syed as Yam Tuan Muda. They applied for assistance from the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti and together they drove the Syed and the other Raja out of the country. After this the British Government quite rightly arranged with the Rembau Chiefs that Tampin should be settled on the Raja family of Rembau, Rembau refusing to accept a Yam Tuan Muda for the future. Syed Saban took possession of Tampin.\n\nNow in this case the Syed was all wrong. He learnt a little\nof the laws of the country, but not enough. Female inheritance does not follow in the Sultanate or Raja Mudaship, but only amongst commoners in the tribes, and the Yam Tuan and the chiefs of Rembau were justly incensed. The Syed after having been the means of dispossessing his father-in-law, became his lawyer so to speak, being a man who had experience of the outer world. The only wrong result has been that instead of the true Raja family obtaining Tampin, the Syed descendants of the clever Syed Saban have inherited, and the other Rajas of Rembau get comparatively nothing.\n\nThe case of the Sungei Ujong war is interesting. The late Syed Aman, Klana of Sungei Ujong, was the son of another such Arab Syed who married a woman of the Beduanda tribe in which the Dato' Klana is elected. On the death of Dato' Klana Sendeng, Syed Aman got himself elected as Klana of Sungei Ujong and this led to one long dispute with the Dato' Bandar who is the other great Waris Chief of the State. Syed Aman cleverly sought the assistance of the British Government, at the same time saying that he was Klana and Raja (being a Syed) combined and that he would no longer acknowledge the suzerainty of the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti. This brought down upon him the wrath of Sri Menanti. Syed Aman, however, had already obtained British protection, he was protected in his State, and the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti, who was really quite right, was repulsed with great slaughter, and his country occupied by British troops. Sungei Ujong thus became independent. This case brings to notice the law that it is illegal for a Raja to marry in the tribe of Beduanda for fear that the offspring might become Penghulu and as a Raja usurp the Rajaship at the same time. \"Penghulu dia Raja dia\" is the phrase given, or perhaps more properly \"Undang dia ka' adilan dia.\"\n\nThe same thing happened in Jelebu. The present Penghulu is a Syed and on the death of the late Yam Tuan Muda of Jelebu he successfully intrigued in getting rid of the Raja family and governing alone in Jelebu.\n\nIt is impossible that Malay States such as these should be ruled in accordance with constitution and custom, without a\nRaja who is independent of all the commoners of the State and who can control the actions of the \"commoner\" chiefs, and without the Raja, the whole constitution becomes a chaos. By removing this link the chain falls to pieces. I will give an instance of this. Ever since the Yam Tuan Muda of Rembau ceased to exist, the Penghulu alone has had to rule a turbulent people with whom he is connected by marriages and intermarriages, and since that there has been nothing but difficulty in Rembau. He was being dragged in every direction, his decisions were disregarded and not a single decision did he give that was deemed right. He had no longer the support of the Raja, thus the chiefs of tribes, who are numerous, attacked him in every direction and would have been glad to get rid of him in the same way as he had got rid of the Raja.\n\nHe used to say to the Chinese who took up land for planting in Rembau \"Jikalau kris terchahul sahaya yang sarongkan\" \"If the kris is drawn I will replace it in its sheath.\" This was a vain boast, as he could not, being a commoner, and there being no fear of him as in the case of a Raja.\n\nAnother case in point is that of the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti. As soon as the Klana of Sungei Ujong became independent, by our assistance, the other States of Sri Menanti all thought that they would like the same thing, and the disputes, the bloodshed and general chaos in these States became simply indescribable. Seeing the Penghulu anxious to get rid of the Raja, the Lembaga started fighting the Penghulu and the Chiefs of families fought the Chiefs of tribes.\n\nThere are a number of cases which might be quoted, but I think that the above demonstrate the law of \"Lembaga kapada Undang, Undang kapada kaadilan.\"\n\nIn order to put things right here in 1884 it was necessary really to put everything back to what it was 20 years before To put the Raja in his place, the Penghulu in his, the Lembaga and the chief families in a tribe in theirs. In some tribes there were as many as six Lembaga in Sri Menanti in 1887. There were also two Peughulu in two of the States. The only thing to do was to bring the constitution to bear and adhere strictly to it, and very stringent measures were taken in order to\nrestore peace and order and to guarantee the proper power of each Chief of the State. A false Penghulu was deported, and a number of false Chiefs detained until they would acknowledge the Chief of Tribe, recognised by the Raja and the Penghulu.\n\nMembers of the chief families in a tribe were threatened for bringing got up cases against the Lembaga and in a short time everything resumed its proper condition. But this was not all, the Waris tribe was clamouring for revenues, was selling land and claiming lands from the tribes as not having been paid for when occupied ten and fifteen years ago. The Waris were treated as a tribe and the Chiefs of the Tribe only recognised and they were allotted a percentage on the revenues derived from waste lands. The sale of land and the claiming of the value of occupied lands was knocked on the head by Muhammadan law as already described. The Chief in each tribe was kept responsible for his tribe and was called and is now called in every case, in or out of Court, affecting his tribe. Every Chief was told that, in every case the ancient usages and constitution would be adhered to, and he was warned that any departure from the same would be likely to cause his dismissal from office. The Chiefs soon saw how much better this was and how secure each man's position had become. The Raja was treated as supreme and all the rules of homage and the laws of the Istana were strictly enforced, the Raja at the same time recognising the British Officer in the administration of the State and of its Courts.\n\nThe above has, I think, explained a great deal which might not have been understood except by illustration. It shows the position of all the Chiefs, and from this I will pass to a number of cases in customary laws.\n\nThe method of the election of the Raja, the Penghulu and Lembaga have been briefly described in the original paper. I will, however, give an instance of the election of a Lembaga of one of the principal tribes here, viz., that of Sri Lemak Pahang the Chief of which is also Deputy Penghulu of Ulu Muar (Pangku Penghulu serta haluan sembah). There are six families in this tribe from which the Chief of the Tribe can be elected. These families come in turn for the election of the Chief. At the last\nelection in troublous times the order in which the families stood for the election of the Chief had been taken wrongly. It may be understood how this disturbed the equanimity of the various families when the question of succession again had to be decided. First of all it was impossible to get the six families to arrive at an agreement or an election. This being the case the question went on appeal to the Penghulu of Ulu Muar, who is an old man and imagined that with a British Officer in the State he could put in his favourite relation in the tribe regardless of families and be supported in so doing. The tribe however knowing that the constitution was being carefully adhered to would not accept the Penghulu's decision and the case went to the Dato' of Johol who did not wish to interfere openly with the Penghulu of Ulu Muar and recommended that they should go to the Resident. The Raja was then consulted. He was of course indifferent as to who was elected Lembaga and the case was fully inquired into. One of the families had been missed over and the question was whether the chieftainship should return to that family and then go on or whether the order of the families should be proceeded with as if there had been no previous mistake. It was decided that what had been, had been (\"yang sudah, sudah\") and that the next family in order should take the rank. Directly this was decided and upheld there was no further trouble and in a few days all the families acquiesced in this being the best it was then easy to elect the individual in the family to be Lembaga.\n\nNothing can be more dangerous in these States than for anyone to practice what we call patronage. For instance, to say \"I want this man as Chief. He is intelligent and he can read and write and I won't have this ignorant dirty looking individual.\" Such action throws the whole system into chaos, and not only that but the intelligent reading and writing man imagines that he has more power than he really has because he has been selected above all others, regardless of custom, and before long the whole tribe is up in arms, generally justly, at his doings and he has to be dismissed.\n\nIn Terachi, in 1887, there were two Penghulu. One of them,\nand the right one, was recognised by the Raja and by the Dato' of Johol. The other one had half the State on his side, but he was really wrong though he had a grievance. In the origin of things there were two families in Terachi who ruled. A former Penghulu had formally renounced the office for his family. He was a very strict Muhammadan and did not consider that such worldly things as office should be entertained in his family. Thus the office devolved entirely on the other family for election. This was ratified. The descendants, however, of this devout Mussulman did not view the matter in the same light. There was a good deal of trouble on this score in old days and a settlement was arrived at of creating an officer in the exempted family to be called \"Andatar.\" This smoothed matters for a time.\n\nFor some years, however, previous to 1887 the conflict between the two families had broken out with renewed vigour, hence the two Penghulu.\n\nThe question was referred to the Resident, it was referred to the Raja, and a decision was after considerable antagonism from the family of the Penghulu holding office, eventually arrived at.\n\nIt was this, that the old custom should be reverted to; that the two families should take it in turn for the Penghulu-ship and equally so for the office of Andatar. There was a great feast and many rites were gone through, many proverbs, wise saws and Menangkabau legal phrases quoted, and the thing was done. There has been no difficulty since.\n\nHere again is a case that has only been referred to as having created ill-feeling, but which illustrates the Baten influence in State matters\u2014Baten Gemala, the principal Baten of Johol, who lives some miles in the interior on the left bank of the Muar River, was induced, in consequence of a number of his people becoming Muhammadans and of other Muhammadan settlers arriving in the rantaus (reaches) of the Muar River above Segamat called Muar, to consider recently the advisability of bringing forward a Penghulu.\n\nThe Penghulos of States having by origin been brought into office by the Baten, this was no doubt constitutionally correct.\nBaten Gemala brought the individual whom he had selected to the Dato' of Johol in order that the Dato' should recognise this new Penghuluship. The Dato' of Johol did so. He thought it would conduce to a settled population in Muar, where formerly, like on many other rivers, the people of the \"Rantau\" had been nomadic, moving from \"rantau\" to \"rantau\" and never permanently settling. The Penghulu of Ladang, however, whose ancestors before him had always ruled this district under the Penghulu of Johol, was much annoyed at this new departure and the result was quarrels and jealousies. Penghulu Muar died a short time ago and the Dato' of Johol will not make further experiments in accepting a Baten Penghulu.\n\nThe case of the Raja di Muda of Terachi, Lembaga of the tribe of Beduanda, is not without interest. It was decided only recently, but may be quoted as showing how the Chief of a tribe must recognise the Penghulu and cannot depart from the usages and customs required of him in his office. I would remark parenthetically that the titles Raja di Muda, Beginda Maharaja, &c., are only titles of commoners not of Rajas. These titles are derived from the Menangkabau customs of \"gelaran\" which I shall make mention of further on.\n\nAn important case of inheritance of personal not entailed property occurred in Terachi. The case came to the Penghulu in appeal. The Penghulu gave his decision in the case. The decision was given against the Raja di Muda tribe. Raja di Muda considered himself ill-treated and the Penghulu himself brought the case before the Resident, who decided in favour of the Penghulu's decision, but modifying the Penghulu's decision in consultation with the Penghulu himself. From that date Raja di Muda has placed himself in every State matter in opposition to the Penghulu and has become a violent obstructionist. The Penghulu for some time took no notice of this, but at last a serious constitutional error was recorded amongst the many acts of Raja di Muda. The mother of an officer with the title of Mendika and of the tribe of which Raja di Muda was Chief, died. Mendika is what is termed the \"Tiang Balei\" of the Penghulu, that is, the centre post of the\nPenghulu's office. The Penghulu must immediately be officially informed, and various rites have to be gone through. The funeral has to be officially arranged by the Penghulu. All this Raja di Muda ignored, carried it through himself with a high hand and the Penghulu was never consulted. This was too much and the whole matter was reported. Enquiries were made, the Penghulu sent for Raja di Muda, who did not come, and the Penghulu asked to be allowed to dismiss Raja di Muda and that the re-election of another officer be recognised. This was accorded. To the outside world this may appear trivial, but to the Malay mind the Raja di Muda had by his last action placed himself in direct and meaning antagonism to the Penghulu absorbing the Penghulu's rights in his own, and this could not be.\n\nA case in Rembau is one of some interest. The Chief of the Sri Melenggang tribe became intensely unpopular in a certain section of his tribe, in consequence undoubtedly of irregularities he had committed in that section. After a good deal of seething and boiling in the tribe the whole matter bubbled up before the Penghulu and ruling Waris of Rembau (vide Origin and Constitution). The Penghulu referred the matter back to the tribe for further consultation and for proofs to be brought forward of the complaints made. The plaintiffs went away and not long after it was rumoured abroad that a new Chief had been elected, the actual holder of the office not having been formally deposed with the sanction of the Penghulu. Then the Penghulu and Waris enquired the meaning of these signs, such as the firing of guns, the hanging of curtains in the house of one MARASHAD and let the tribe explain the adoption of such forms which were only allowed to a Chief. The disaffected ones in the tribe asked for a meeting of all the Chiefs at which they would present themselves. The Penghulu accorded this and ordered the Chiefs to be present at his Balei. The day arrived. All were congregated. A message came from those disaffected who were outside the fence of the house in the padang or field for the Waris to come out and meet the new Chief and escort him to the Penghulu's presence. This created general consternation and after deliberation it was\ndecided that this was unconstitutional, that the Chiefs had not met for the purpose of receiving a newly elected Lembaga, but to deliberate on the shortcomings of the existing one. The answer was couched in these terms. Again the demand was made, and again it was refused. Nothing more occurred at the time, but the Penghulu and Waris applied for the arrest of the ringleaders in this unconstitutional proceeding. This was granted and the arrests were made. The defence was that the tribe was dissatisfied with its Chief, that the tribe had the right of electing its Chief. Against this it was urged that there could be at no time two Chiefs in the same tribe. That the Penghulu had not acknowledged the dismissal of the existing Chief, that the action of the disaffected members outside the Penghulu's Balei was not customary, and that the prisoners had been guilty of attempting to make disturbances in the tribe in no way warranted by the constitution. The ringleaders were comparatively heavily fined and the original complaints against the Chief were again referred for enquiry to the Council of Chiefs (Waris serta orang yang dua blas).\n\nIn 1887, the Rembau Chiefs were all divided against the Penghulu. The point at issue was that of revenues from waste lands. The question commenced to assume a very serious aspect when a force of thirty or forty armed Malays stopped a Chinaman, to whom the Penghulu had granted forest land for planting, from felling the forest. This action on the part of the insubordinate Chiefs resulted in a very elaborate enquiry. The disaffected Waris urged that they had never received any part of revenues and the Chiefs of tribes urged with the disaffected Waris that they were entitled to revenues from waste lands in the vicinity of their holdings. The Penghulu and his friends, however, denied the statements of the disaffected Waris. They also brought up a point of importance, viz., that if the Waris had a grievance they should do everything they could to settle it in the tribe. If they could not that they should together bring the matter to the Penghulu's Balei. This had not been done and the Penghulu had been ignored throughout. The disaffected Datohs at the enquiry all asked to leave the Balei of the Penghulu and urged\nthe other Chiefs to do the same. Nearly all the Chiefs left. This was a sign that they were going out to try and arrive at an agreement to depose the Penghulu, but in this they failed, and returned without having been able to be of one mind in the matter (babutan). Then came the question of the Lembaga claiming a share of the revenue from waste lands. Now, according to the custom a Lembaga has no rights in the State except in his tribe and over the land which he bought from the Waris (tanah bertebus). It was evident that the mere fact of purchase gave him no rights to other waste lands, the matter was discussed at great length, the Lembagas bringing up numbers of sayings and laws that were useless by themselves being all governed by the main laws, viz., \"Gaung, Guntong, Bukit, Bukau Herta Waris, Penghulu prentah loa, Lembaga prentah suku\", i.e., that all waste lands were the property of the Waris, that the Penghulu ruled the State and the Lembaga ruled his tribe. The case was given entirely against the Lembagas. This being done and the disaffected Waris and Lembagas having been proved to be wrong, it was necessary to consider the crime they had committed against the State. They were found guilty of departing from the constitution and of ignoring the rules of appeal and the ancient customs and usages of the State of Rembau. They were all dismissed from their posts and the families in each tribe were sent for in order that re-elections should be made. This was done and this one decision has restored the Penghulu as head of the State, the Waris as inheritors of waste lands, and the Lembaga as rulers in their tribes.\n\nThis was a very leading case in reference to all the States of the Negri Sembilan, and by it every State has been maintained on the same lines.\n\nIn Sri Menanti there were terrible disputes regarding ownership to mines and Waris claims. Because a Waris claimed as a Waris he also claimed ownership. This was evidently wrong. The Waris' claim was a State claim, ownership was a private claim. Thus by giving a small percentage of tin revenues to the heads of the Waris tribe and by registering the various mines to the owners and legalizing a royalty to\nbe paid to them by the Chinese miner, the difficulty was overcome and every one became contented. The late Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti, in order to make a last attempt at quieting a very turbulent and powerful Waris faction in Ulu Muar, had married a lady of this family. This unfortunately did not improve matters, as although this faction became friendly with the Raja it started terrible struggles with all the other Waris and even with the tribes and being allied to the Raja became more formidable to the peace of the country than hitherto.\n\nLand cases are not very frequent here as land is so well defined by custom. At the same time there have been a number of cases which dated from previous years and had never been settled. Directly a case was brought up again faction fights occurred and then the case was again left unsettled. A very old case at Ampang Serong, about five miles from Kwala Pilah, required immediate settlement. It was as between the tribe of Beduanda Waris and the tribe of \"Tiga Batu.\" The Waris first claimed that they had never sold the land and that it had been appropriated by the Tiga Batu tribe. This, however, they failed to prove, as it was ruled that they could not claim purchase money after upwards of one hundred years of occupation. Then they claimed proprietorship of a great portion saying that the Tiga Batu tribe had encroached. The Tiga Batu tribe on the other hand said that the land had been mortgaged to the Waris for fifty dollars ($50). The whole case was investigated on the spot. It was perfectly evident that the Waris' claim was incorrect. They claimed the paddy land and had forgotten to consider the hill land on the side of the valley where the houses and gardens are. Taking the hill land in the occupation of the tribe, it was evident that in accordance with the ancient usage of selling land in straight strips across a valley or across it up to the main stream the land claimed actually did belong to the tribe of Tiga Batu though in consequence of the mortgage of the paddy field to the tribe of Waris it had been for years cultivated by the Waris holder of the mortgage. It was ordered that the amount of the mortgage should be paid to the Waris tribe and that the land should remain in the possession of the tribe of Tiga Batu.\nLand once held by a tribe is very seldom sold to other tribes. If debts have been incurred and a person's holding has to be sold it is nearly always bought in by the tribe and this avoids many complications in proprietorship that might otherwise arise. There are of course disputes in a tribe, but these are disputes of inheritance more than of boundaries and are far more easily settled. The technical terms for land purchased from the Waris and the dry outline of land tenure has already been described in my former paper. I have referred also to \"herta membawa,\" that is, property brought by the husband to his wife's house, as in these States, the women being inheritors of all lands, the man always goes to his wife's house (\"tempat semenda\"). If he divorces or his wife dies he returns to his mother's house (\"herta pesaka\"). Cases of \"herta membawa\" are most difficult to decide upon. I will give an instance. A foreign Malay from Sungai Ujong married a woman in Ilu Muar; he was accidentally wounded by a spring gun that had been set for pig, and died. His mother who lived in Sungai Ujong was informed by letter by the Chief of her daughter-in-law's tribe. The mother arrived and claimed $150 worth of property that she had given to her son when he was coming to live with his wife here and which she stated he had brought to his wife's house. The orang semenda or male relations of the lady denied this saying that the property had never been declared to them as \"herta membawa\" which was necessary and that they altogether discredited the statement. After hearing a mass of contradictory evidence with good points on both sides, it was ruled that the mother would not have claimed without cause and awarded to her half the amount claimed.\n\nA question of some importance and which has not yet been decisively settled is that of \"pencharian berdua,\" i.e., the fortune acquired by husband and wife apart from \"herta membawa\" or \"herta pesaka.\"\n\nThe law runs \"chari b'hagi dapatan tinggal bawa kembalik.\" This cannot be translated literally, but it means that the money acquired by husband and wife must be divided, each person's share remain to each, and the husband's share\nmust go back to his mother's house or to his \"anak buah,\" that is, his blood relations. That property of this kind should not go entirely to the children made a great deal of difficulty, as it is not in accordance with Muhammedan law and in Rembau the Chiefs decided that all property other than \"herta pesaka\" or \"herta membawa\" became unconditionally the property of the children and could not in any case return to the man's relations. It was ruled, however, that land should not be affected, coming as it does under \"herta pesaka\" and that weapons, ornaments and silver utensils which were \"herta pesaka\" must be returned. Also that \"herta membawa\" could still be claimed by the man's relations. In Jempol where the people are very Muhammedan also this has been adopted, I will relate a case, however, which created great discussion.\n\nA man died the possessor of ten buffaloes. His child was a boy seven years old. The man's brother took the buffaloes back to his mother's house in order, it was supposed, to take care of them until his nephew came of age. The boy grew up and when he was about fifteen he claimed these buffaloes from his uncle, who would not satisfy his demand. The case came forward as the Chiefs could not settle it to the satisfaction of all parties.\n\nThe boy claimed the buffaloes. The uncle first said the buffaloes had died of disease. Enquiries were made and it was found that he possessed buffaloes. The boy said that even if the buffaloes had died of disease his uncle should have informed his mother's family. Then came the question of inheritance, trusteeship, and the guardianship of the buffaloes, finally the question of \"herta membawa.\" The uncle first urged that the boy's father had brought a number of buffaloes to his wife's house from his mother's house and that they should be returned. After a considerable enquiry it was found that there was no reliable evidence of this. Then the uncle claimed that according to the Malay rule, he being the caretaker of the buffaloes, was entitled to one-half of the buffaloes now that his nephew wished to divide. The boy said that his uncle had had no right to take the buffaloes. Then came the question of inheritance. The uncle said he only knew the old rule of\n\"chari bhai, dapatan tinggal bawuk kembatek\" and claimed half the buffaloes. The boy said he knew that in Jempol the Muhammadan custom had been adopted that property acquired during marriage became the property of children and not of the \"anak buah,\" finally it was decided that half the buffaloes should be handed to the boy in satisfaction of all claims. It will be seen from this example how many rules there are in these States that may be brought forward in a case, in connection with which careful investigation is required. If, however, a dispute is carefully summed up and the points fully explained which lead to the decision, the public here is nearly always satisfied and the individual who loses his case has to be satisfied also.\n\nIn connection with inheritance by the children, of property acquired during married life, it is necessary for the children to pay their father's debts if there are any. If there is no property even the children are responsible for the debts of their father. Where the old rule is in force the \"tempat semenda\" and the \"tempat pesaka\" would have to arrange together to pay, and not only that but the \"anak buah\" were supposed to pay the funeral expenses of their male relation and not the \"orang semenda.\" It is still a question that has to be very carefully investigated in every case of debt, viz., as to whether one of the two should pay all.\n\nThe rules of \"pantang larang\" are important, minor laws on dress, on the architecture of houses, of covered gates to enclosures, of the firing of guns, the slaughtering of buffaloes and many other causes. For instance, no one but a Chief may have a covered gateway. No one but a Raja may put his kitchen behind the house, and no one but a Raja may run his front verandah round to the back. No man may wear all yellow nor all black. A quaint custom is that of \"gelaran.\" When a man marries, the \"orang semenda\" of his wife assemble together. Here all property questions are brought forward and decided such as \"heria mumbuca,\" &c. The \"orang semenda\" then confer a title on the man, such as \"Mentri,\" \"Si Maraja,\" \"Peduka Raja,\" \"Laksamana\" and many others.\nIt must be borne in mind though, in connection with all these customs and laws, that Muhammadan law is always present and is enforced in many cases, but it requires careful handling. Nothing is more distasteful to the people than that Muhammadan law should be applied where custom provides the remedy, and as the Kathi is generally anxious to exercise Muhammadan law only, great care has to be taken to prevent him from interfering in cases of custom.\n\nWhat I have written may throw some light on the working of a curious constitution.\n\nMARTIN LISTER.\nTHE RULING FAMILY OF SELANGOR.\n\nBY\n\nW. E. MAXWELL, C.M.G.\n\n(Extracted from the Selangor Administration Report for 1889.)\n\n3. There exists, in Malay, an interesting historical work entitled \"Tuhfat-el-nafis,\" written in A. H. 1288, by Raja Ali, of Riouw, which treats of the later history of those Malay States, the royal houses of which have been founded or influenced by Bugis chiefs from the island of Celebes. These include Riouw, Linggi, Johor, Selangor, Siak, &c.\n\n4. A long table of descent is given, which is mostly fabulous until it approaches modern times. In compiling the latter portion, the author has perhaps consulted Dutch publications.\n\n5. The admixture of Bugis blood in the reigning families of the Malay kingdoms of the Straits of Malacca, seems to have commenced in the early part of the 18th century. It is related in the native chronicle above alluded to that Upu Tanderi Burong, a Bugis Raja in the island of Celebes (the third son of the first Bugis Raja who embraced Muhammadanism), had five sons:\n\n(1) Daing Peani, from whom (by his marriage in Siantak) the reigning family of Siak in Sumatra are descended. He also married princesses of the reigning Malay families in Johor, Selangor and Kedah.\n\n(2) Daing Menimbun, from whom the Rajas of Pontianak, Matan and Brunei are descended.\n(3) Klana Java Putra alias Daing Merewah, first Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda of Riouw. He married a daughter of Tunonggong Abdul Jalil of Johor. His son, Klana Inche Unak, married in Selangor, and his daughter became the wife of her cousin Daing Kamoja, the son of Daing Perani (No. 1), and third Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda of Riouw.\n\n(4) Daing Chela or Daing Palai, second Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda of Riouw. He married a daughter of Sultan Abdul Jalil (sister of Sultan Suleiman Badr-alam Shah) of Johor, and from the female issue of this marriage Sultan Hussein of Singapore (1810) was descended. One of the sons of Daing Chela Raja Lumu', became the first Yang-di-per-Tuan of Selangor. From him the reigning family of Selangor is descended. Another, Raja Haji, was the fourth Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda of Riouw and fell in battle at Malacca, fighting against the Dutch, in 1784.\n\n(5) Daing Kamasi, married the sister of the Sultan of Sambas (Borneo) and his descendants have remained there.\n\n6. Of these five chiefs, Nos. 1, 3 and 4 established themselves in Selangor about 1718, and Raja Lumu', the son of No. 4, was left there as ruler of the country. The principal head-quarters of the Bugis was Riouw, and about this time they made piratical raids upon all the western Malay States, one after another. Raja Lumu' of Selangor, on the occasion of a visit to Perak, about 1743, was formally invested by the Sultan of Perak (Mahmud Shah) with the dignity of Sultan, and took the title of Sultan Saladdin Shah. His successor, Sultan Ibrahim, (in 1783) joined with his brother, Raja Haji, the Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda of Riouw, in an attack upon the Dutch in Malacca. They were repulsed, and Raja Haji was killed. The Dutch under Admiral Van Braam then attacked Selangor, and the Sultan fled inland and escaped to Pahang.\n\n7. Ibrahim, aided by the Dato Bandahara of Pahang, reconquered his fort from the Dutch in 1785, but the latter im-\nmediately blockaded Kwala Selangor with two ships-of-war and after this blockade had lasted for more than a year the Sultan accepted a treaty by which he acknowledged their sovereignty and agreed to hold his kingdom of them.\n\n8. British political relations with Selangor commenced in 1818, when a commercial treaty was concluded with this State by a British Commissioner, Mr. Cracroft, on behalf of the Governor of Penang, and this was followed by \"an agreement of peace and friendship,\" concluded with Sultan Ibrahim Shah, who was still reigning.\n\n9. Sultan Mohammed succeeded Sultan Ibrahim about the year 1826, and reigned until 1856. He was succeeded in the following year by Sultan Abdul Samad, the present ruler.\n\n10. Sultan Abdul Samad is the son of Raja Dolah, a younger brother of Sultan Mohammed, and at the time of the death of the latter, held the rank and office of Tunku Panglima Besar (Commander-in-Chief). His election to the sovereignty was chiefly the work of Raja Juma'at, of Lukut, then a flourishing mining settlement, now decayed and abandoned, who feared the exactions of the late Sultan's family. Sultan Mohammed had no less than 19 children, many of them illegitimate, and one of them, Raja Mahmud (now Penghulu of Ulun Semonieh, a village in Selangor), had been recognised as Raja Muda in his father's life-time. He was only eight years old when Sultan Mohammed died. There were other claimants in the persons of various nephews of the late Sultan, sons of Raja Usup and Raja Abdurrahman, who thought their rights stronger than those of the sons of Raja Dolah. But the influence of Raja Juma'at prevented a war of succession.\n\n11. The strong Bugis element in Selangor earned for the people of the State, in early days, the reputation of being the most daring and formidable of all the Malays on the west coast of the Peninsula. Their fleets were successful in Perak and Kedah (Alor Star in Kedah was taken and burned in 1770), and in a work published fifty years ago, Selangor is quaintly described as follows.\u2014\"of all the Malayan States on the Peninsula, it labours under the heaviest mula fuma on\n\"the score of piracy, man-stealing, manslaughter, and similar peccadilloes of the code of Malayan morals.\"*\n\n12. Of the Malay population of the State at the present day there is little to say, except to emphasize the contrast noted by an eminent authority\u2020 between \"the frank simplicity and humour, harmonising well with a certain grave dignity of self-possession and genuine politeness, which characterise the manner of the Malays of Kedah, and the sinister and impudent bearing of the maritime and semi-piratical Malay of the South.\"\u2021\n\nThere is now a large population, of settlers from Sumatra and Java, who are influencing materially the character of the Muhammadan population.\n\n* Moors's Notices, p. 243.\n\u2020 The late Mr. J.

KELSALL, R.A.\n\nOR any one living in a place like Singapore, and who has any spare time on his hands, it is a great thing to have a hobby. It matters little what this hobby is, but for one whose business keeps him indoors most of the day as happens to many in this Colony, some hobby that will take them out of doors is the best. Such a one is the study of entomology, which has many advantages. It can be carried on at any time; it incurs little expense, it employs both mind and body, and opens up a large field for thought and investigation. This field as well as being large is exceedingly varied and if worked systematically and scientifically will afford unending enjoyment to the student. In this paper I hope to give a brief sketch of what may be done in the near neighbourhood of Singapore in one branch only of this interesting science, namely, in the collection and study of the hawk moths.\n\nAll that is needed in the way of gear is a net, a killing bottle, a small pith-lined box and pins for collecting, and a few setting boards and store boxes for preserving the insects.\n\nOur hunting ground is the nearest flower-bed, amongst the best flowers being honeysuckle, vincea and Barleria, and for humming birds lantana, papaw and the tembusu tree (Fagraea peregrina, Wall). Moth-catching may sound tame, but it is genuine sport, requiring a true and quick eye and ready hand, and often is quite exciting.\n\nThe Sphingidae, or hawk moths, the finest and most interesting group of moths, are fairly well represented in the Island of Singapore. Like most moths they are crepuscular or nocturnal in their habits, few appearing before dusk.\nTheir flight is strong and swift, and the movement of the wings very rapid giving rise to a humming noise, which in the case of the humming bird hawk has given them their popular name.\n\nAs would be expected in swift-flying insects, their wings are long, narrow and pointed, with a strong rigid costa, and their bodies more or less fusiform, which renders their passage through the air more easy.\n\nIn all the hawks the proboscis is of great length, in order to enable them to reach the juice at the bottom of the long tubes of the flowers they frequent. In the green elephant (*Pergesa acteus*), this organ attains to 2\u00bd times the length of the body.\n\nEach species has one or more favourite flowers which it frequents.\n\nFrom sundown till dark\u2014the humming birds appearing half an hour earlier\u2014they may be seen darting from flower to flower and ever and anon pausing motionless but for the swift movement of the wings, which appear but as a shadow on each side before a flower from which, by means of their long slender proboscis they are drinking the nectar. They scarcely ever touch the flowers with their feet and never alight on them, but depend entirely on their wings for support. As soon as they have exhausted the supply of honey in one flower off they dart to another, where they repeat the same process.\n\n*Sphinx convolvuli* has been known to come into a lighted room and go round to the flowers in vases drinking the honey.\n\nSeveral species come to light and one or two are rarely taken any other way, for instance, the death's head and oleander. The latter has been taken in considerable numbers at the beam of a powerful electric light which was being worked in the neighbourhood of some jungle.\n\nThese moths probably play an important part in the fertilization of the plants they frequent.\n\nWhether they remain on the wing all night is difficult to say. They appear to leave the flower-beds soon after dark, as they fill themselves very rapidly with honey. I have, how-\never, taken *Diludia discistriga* at *Crinum asiaticum* as late as 10 p.m.\n\nIn the daytime they remain concealed amongst the foliage of trees and bushes. They are sometimes taken at rest on the trunks of trees or in corners of rooms whither they have probably been attracted by the light in the evenings. They seem to be very sensitive to the state of the weather and the moon and on moonlight nights few are to be seen at the flower-beds. Fine evenings after rain are usually the most favourable for observing them.\n\nLike many other insects these moths are liable to be attacked by a species of internal fungus.\n\nThree at least of this family of moths\u2014*Acherontia medusa*, *A. morta* and *Diludia discistriga*\u2014make a squeaking sound.\n\nIt is noticeable that all the species taken in Singapore are larger than the same as given in Moore's \"Lepidoptera of Ceylon,\" where most of them are described and figured.\n\nThe following is a list of the species recorded from Singapore:\n\n**Sub-Family\u2014Sphingidae.**\n\n*Protoparce orientalis* (*Sphinx convolvuli*).\n\n*Diludia discistriga*.\n\n**Sub-Family\u2014Acherontiinae** (Death's heads).\n\n*Acherontia medusa*.\n\n*A. morta*.\n\n**Sub-Family\u2014Smerinthinae.**\n\nOne or two species.\n\n**Sub-Family\u2014Ch\u00e6rocampinae.**\n\n*Ch\u00e6rocampa celerio*.\n\n*Ch\u00e6rocampa Silhetensis*.\n\n*C. Rafflesi*.\n\n*C. theylia*.\n\n*C. Lucasii*.\n\n*C. tenebrosa* (?).\n\n*Pergesa acteus*.\nC. nessus.\nCalymnia panopus.\nAnd two or three other species probably new.\n\nSub-Family.\u2014Macroglossin\u00e6 (Humming birds).\nHemaris hylas.\nM. luteata.\nM. insipida.\n\nThe convolvulus hawk (Sphinx convolvuli) is the commonest. It may be taken at almost any season, but is more plentiful at some times than at others.\n\nThis moth may almost always be taken at honeysuckles and when Faradaya papuana is in flower one may be sure of obtaining large numbers at it. In fact they are so fond of it that I have taken as many as three at a single stroke of the net, and fifteen or twenty in one night is not an exceptional take. The caterpillar feeds on the Tembusu tree.\n\nDiludia discistriga closely resembles the foregoing species in general appearance and habits, but is larger, darker and has no red on its body and does not fly quite so rapidly. It is not nearly so common as S. convolvuli. In fact, except at certain limited times, it is rare.\n\nNext come the death's heads (Acherontiin\u00e6) represented by two species. These are large handsome moths whose principal colouring consists of black and yellow. They are usually taken at light. I have not yet heard of their being taken at flowers.\n\nBy far the largest proportion of the species recorded from Singapore are comprised in the sub-family Choerocampin\u00e6. The largest and one of the finest of this sub-family is Calymnia panopus, the female of which is over 6\" in span.\n\nAnother beautiful member of this family is Ch\u00e6rocampa nes-sus, one of the handsomest hawks, its beautiful form and splendid green and golden orange tints rendering it conspicuous. The fore wings, dark green at the costal edge, shade off into the softest of browns, fawn and grey; the hind wings being deep glossy black contrasted with pale fawn. The abdomen is green down the centre of the back with a broad golden stripe down each side. The underside of the wings is\na beautiful combination of reds, yellows and greys, which almost rivals the autumn tints of the birch.\n\nThen we have the beautiful *Celerio*, distinguished by its rows of silver spots down each side of the body. It is common on *Barleria flava* and *Vinca rosea* (Madagascar periwinkle).\n\n*Isoples Rafflesii* and *I. Theylia* resemble one another in general appearance, but *Theylia* is smaller and paler. These are common on *Barleria* and *Vinca*.\n\n*Pergesa acteus*, more commonly known as the green elephant, is a beautiful insect. Its fore-wings are of a dark green colour. It is found on the same flowers as *Theylia* and *Celerio*.\n\nOf the *MacroGLOSSINAE* the most remarkable is *Hemaris hylas*, which frequents the coffee plantations, the larv\u00e6 feeding on the coffee tree, where it often does much damage. It has also been taken on lantana. The chief peculiarity of this moth is in its wings, which are quite transparent like those of a bee.\n\nThe other humming birds are most plentiful at lantana and the tembusu (*Fagrea peregrina*) when in flower. The male flowers of the papaw are also a great attraction. The members of this sub-family do not remain out after dark.\n\nThere is much yet to be found out as to the form and habits of the larv\u00e6 and pup\u00e6 of these moths, and there are probably new species to be found and described, so that there is ample scope, for anyone taking up the subject to add to what is already known.\nTHE BURMANNIACE\u00c6 OF THE MALAY PENINSULA.\n\nBY\n\nH. N. RIDLEY, M.A., F.L.S.\n\nHE curious little plants known as Burmanniace\u00e6, though distributed over the whole tropical world, seems to be most abundant in the Malayan region. A large number of very extraordinary forms have been described and figured by Professor Beccari, in \"Malesia,\" vol. i, from the specimens collected by him in Borneo, New Guinea and other Malayan islands. Only three kinds are included in the \"Flora of British India\" from the Malayan Peninsula, but these are not all that occur here. At present seven species are known to be found within this region, representing three genera, and more will surely be found as the botany of the Peninsula is worked up. These plants are constantly neglected by collectors, as they are usually difficult to find and very inconspicuous, and furthermore some of them require to be preserved in spirits of wine, being indeed so succulent that they shrivel up to nothing when an attempt is made to dry them. They should be carefully sought for in deep forests, at the roots of large and old trees. Frequently two or three kinds grow in one spot. Thus if Burmannia tuberosa is found growing in the jungle, it is probable that Gymnophion and Thismia are close at hand, and should be carefully looked for.\n\nThe three genera which are found in the Peninsula are Burmannia, five species, Gymnophion and Thismia one each. The Burmannias may be divided into two sections\u2014saprophytic and non-saprophytic. The latter grow in open places, among grass, etc., the former in the dense jungle as aforesaid,\namong dead leaves. Like all true saprophytes they have no green leaves, but the whole plant is white or yellowish, with the leaves reduced to scales. *Thismia* and *Gymnoviphon* are also saprophytic. The plants of the former genus are peculiarly soft and succulent and very curiously shaped. Two species occur in Singapore.\n\n*Gymnoviphon* is an exceedingly delicate and fragile plant with a slender wiry stem about three inches tall and little violet flowers.\n\nThe relations of these little plants with other orders is still most obscure. Hitherto they have been associated with orchids, owing to a misconception as to the structure of the seed. It is probable that they are most nearly related to the *Liliaceae* and especially the curious *Taccaceae* of which the so-called black Chandrian Lily (*Atacea cristata*) is a common plant in our jungles.\n\n**BURMANNIA** \u2014 Five species are known from the Peninsula, viz., *B. longifolia* (Becc.), *B. disticha* (Linn.) and *B. celestis* (Don.), non-saprophytes; and *B. tuberosa*, (Becc.), and *B. gracilis*, Ridl. saprophytes. The first two of these are alpine plants growing on the high mountains of Perak and Mount Uphir, and both are apparently perennials. *B. celestis* (Don.), is a small annual, very common in grassy spots.\n\n*B. Longifolia* (Becc.), Malesia, i, 244, t. 13, fig. 1-5; Flora of British India, vol. vi, p. 664.\n\nA perennial plant with a tall, leafy stem creeping at the base, the leaves are narrow and grass-like, acute, recurved. The flower-spike erect, with two short branches at the top covered with nodding whitish yellow flowers half-an-inch long. The wings of the flower, so large in *B. celestis*, are very small and obscure.\n\nPerak and also Borneo and Java.\n\n*B. Disticha* (Linn., Sp., Pl. 287) has a distinct creeping stem like that of the preceding, but shorter and the leaves are tilted at the base. They are about three inches long, grassy and pointed, about \u00bd inch across. The whole plant is a foot and-a-half tall, and the stem terminates in an erect forked cyme with branches about 1\u00bd inch long and almost sessile flowers. The flowers are large and blue, erect, twenty on a branch.\nabout half an inch long, with very distinct wings. The sepals are fleshy, linear lanceolate. The petals nearly as large, blunt. The stamens are sessile at the base of the petals with a very distinct bilobed dentate crest. The anther cells far apart, reniform. The style rather stout, the three stigmas fairly large. The ovary is very large in proportion to the size of the flower, a good deal longer than the style.\n\nThis is a widely distributed plant in the Tropics of Asia, occurring in mountainous districts from Nepaul throughout India to Ceylon, Sumatra and China and Australia. At present it has only been gathered on Mount Ophir in the Malay Peninsula, but it will certainly be found in other of our mountain regions.\n\nB. CELESTIS (Don.) is a very widely distributed little annual. It is very common in grassy spots along roadsides. I have seen great plenty of it along the road towards Pasir Panjang, and it is also very common in the turf in the Botanic Gardens. It is not, however, always to be met with, being an annual in the strict sense, that is, it only lives till it has flowered and fruited, and then immediately dies. In Europe, where the growing season is so short, it would probably be literally an annual, and live throughout the summer, dying down in autumn or winter as so many English plants do, but as there is really no time when plants cannot grow here, this little Dragon's-scales appears whenever the weather suits it, lives a short life, of perhaps a month or two, and disappears again. It generally appears after heavy rains when the weather begins to get finer, and then the ground is often dotted all over with it.\n\nThe whole plant is about three to four inches tall, sometimes as much as six inches, often, in poor soil, much smaller. It has a simple slender stem with a tuft of narrow pointed leaves at the base, and one, more rarely two, and still more rarely three or more flowers, about half an inch long at the top. These flowers have the typical Burmannia shape, that is to say, they are urn-shaped with three thin wings running for the whole of the length. At the top are three little sepals, and alternating with these three minute petals. The stamens and pistil are quite hidden in the urn. The flower is of an exquisite lilac-blue, with yellow sepals. The stamens are\nfixed to the side of the urn and each consists of an anther, the two cells of which are oval in shape, and split transversely. They are separated by a broad connective which is crested above, and beneath prolonged into a kind of tooth. The style is slender, and ends in three short arms terminated by heart-shaped stigmas. The fruit is a capsule.\n\nB. celestis (Don Prod. 44), B. azurea (Griff.), B. javanica Bl., B. triflora Roxb., Cryptonema malaccense (Lour.), Nephrocotum malaccensis (Lour.), Malay \"sisik naga\" (Dragon's scales). Widely distributed over India, Mauritius, China, Malaysia and North Australia.\n\nCommon in the Malay Peninsula. Singapore\u2014near Pasir Panjang, Tanglin, Changi and other places; Malacca\u2014Merlimau, Pulau Besar Pahang\u2014Pekan, Kuala Pahang, Penang.\u2014Telok Bahang (C. Curtis, Labuan Bishop Hose) Borneo, (Beccari).\n\nB. tuberosa Becc. was described from specimens found by Professor Beccari in Borneo and New Guinea, nor had any other person, as far as I am aware, ever collected it till I found it growing plentifully in a damp jungle at Chan Chu Kang not very far away from the Selitar bungalow, and I afterwards met with it at Pataling on the Kuala Lumpur Railway in a similar locality. With it, in both places, I found the very curious Thismia junida and also a much commoner plant, Scaphola tenella. It is a very different looking plant to Burmannia celestis, owing to its saprophytic habits. It is fleshy and, except for the sepals, entirely pure white, about three inches long, but for fully three quarters of its length it is buried in the rotten leaves among which it, like other saprophytes, dwells. It has a small, oblong tuber at the base from which arise a few root hairs. The stem has a few little lanceolate leaves like scales upon it, and the flowers are crowded in a tuft upon the top. They are quite small, and the wings, which are large in Burmannia celestis, are very obscure here and have almost entirely disappeared. The sepals are bright cowslip yellow, and though the flowers are small and only one or two open at a time, it is really a very pretty little plant and, as Beccari observes, is sweetly scented.\n\nSingapore\u2014Chan Chu Kang, Bukit Timah near the well of the bungalow. Selangor\u2014Pataling.\nB. gracilis, n. sp., was discovered by Mr. Curtis at Tintow in Kedah in 1889, and is apparently an undescribed species. Like B. tuberosa it is saprophytic and inhabits dense jungle. The whole plant is from six inches to a foot tall, with a slender branched stem, on which are a few narrow lanceolate scale-like leaves \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long. The inflorescence is a branched cyme, the branches of which are about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of an inch long; the flowers few, seven or eight in number, white, pedicelled. The pedicels a quarter of an inch long with lanceolate acute bracts nearly as long (about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the length). The perianth is a quarter of an inch long, elliptic in outline with distinct but not very large wings. The sepals are small ovate, lanceolate; the petals very much smaller, short and blunt. The upper part of the connective of the anther is bilobed, the lobes denticulate rounded not very dissimilar to those of B. edelius but rounder, the anther cells are prolonged into somewhat long points, and the central tooth does not descend below them. The style is long; the stigmas reniform, the ovary small, the seeds fusiform acute at both ends.\n\nGymnosiphon is also a saprophytic genus, of which a considerable number of species are widely scattered over the tropical zones. In texture they are more like some of the Burmannia, being very fragile and delicate and not fleshy like Thysan. The common species here, I thought at first, might be Blume's G. aphylleum of which the description is too meagre really to distinguish it. But on examining the herbarium and library of Buitenzorg, where many of Blume's types are kept, I found a little rough sketch of Blume's plant signed by himself, which is quite unlike our species. There was no specimen in the herbarium. Brueckner in \"Malesia,\" i., p. 241, described and figured G. borneense from Borneo and G. papuanum from New Guinea. Blume's G. aphylleum comes from Java. According to Blume's sketch it has two large bracts at the base of the flower, which does not occur in our species. I have little doubt that the latter is Brueckner's G. borneense although that is represented as rather fleshier and thicker in the stem than the Straits plant.\n\nG. borneense (Becc.) Malesia, i., 241, Pl. xiv, fig. 5-9. A slender, wiry plant, exceedingly fragile and delicate, about 2 or\n3 inches tall, branched and quite leafless except for a few scales. The inflorescence is branched, and the flowers, which are shortly stalked, are arranged on one side of the branches. The whole plant is whitish, except the flower, which is of a pale violet colour. The little flowers are tubular with no wings, and have six small spreading oval perianth-lobes. The fruit is a capsule, covered with the tubular part of the corolla, which becomes skeletonised as the fruit ripens and looks like a network covering it. The seeds are very numerous, dark brown, very small, subglobose with the ends drawn out into short points and covered with low warts or bosses.\n\nIt grows in Singapore at Chan Chu Kang and Bukit Timah, in Selangor at Pataling, and in Malacca on Bukit Sadanen. It is found in the densest parts of the forest, and is very fond of appearing on newly cut paths through the forest.\n\n**Thismia.**\u2014This genus contains perhaps the most remarkable plants in the order, and indeed some of the most curious of the Malayan region. They are succulent, fugacious herbs, yellow, grey, or red, but never green, and would be taken for fungi by an ordinary observer. About six kinds have been described, of which the most striking forms have been met within Borneo and New Guinea, but other species occur in Ceylon, Burma and Tasmania. They are usually to be met with in damp forests among the dead leaves on the ground, and especially at the foot of old trees. As they are so fleshy and delicate they require to be preserved in spirits of wine, in which, however, though keeping their form unaltered, they become pure white.\n\nTwo species are to be found in Singapore, one of which *Th. Aseroe* was collected by Professor Beccari at Woodlands near Kranji, and has since been found by myself on Bukit Timah. The other is an undescribed species, which I have met with both in Singapore and Selangor, but very rarely, and for which I propose the name of *Th. fumida* on account of its smoky colour.\n\n**Thismia Aseroe**, (Becc., Malesia, vol. i, p. 252, Plate 10). A small herbaceous succulent plant about 2 or 3 inches tall with a creeping white rhizome emitting at intervals small tufts of rather thick short roots and flower-stems. Flower-stems\nsolitary sometimes branched with a few scattered bract-like lanceolate leaves. Flower terminal and single on each branch, about half an inch long, orange yellow with two lanceolate acute bracts at the base, lower portion of flower tubular obconic, yellow becoming olivaceous brown with a raised reticulate pattern in the interior, which is visible externally when the flower is withering or preserved in alcohol; limb of flower consists of six segments arranged in a circle and spreading bases triangular from a narrow ring, flat, then suddenly becoming serrate, tubulate, between each a minute extra process. In the centre of the flower is a raised flat topped ring, surrounding the mouth. The stamens are arranged round the walls of the tube pendulous from a short filament at the top, so that the anthers are on the inner surface next to the walls of the tube. They are of the form of oblong scales, ending below in three acute subulate processes, the largest in the middle; on the inner face are the two narrow linear anthers opening longitudinally from between them arises a quadrate organ with crose sides. The edges of the stamens meet so as to form a continuous ring. The style is short reddish and scabrid with three very small stigmas. In fruiting the stem thickens and lengthens. The fruit is a cup-shaped capsule light brown, fleshy ribbed, the edges of which project some way above the top of the ovary which when ripe falls off in the form of a small round plate terminated by the style. The seeds are very numerous elliptic oblong in outline and blunt, brown is ribbed.\n\nSingapore, Bukit Timah, near the well, September, 1890; Woodlands, Kranji (Beccari).\n\nLike other saprophytes, this beautiful little plant has a habit of appearing spasmodically and equally suddenly disappearing. In September last I was surprised to find the ground by the stream at Bukit Timah dotted all over with the little yellow stars of this plant appearing from among the dead leaves. I brought a number of plants home and kept them alive under a glass shade for some months, although in the jungle all had disappeared in a week. The rhizomes under cultivation were long persistent and continued to throw up flower stems. The flowers, however, did not produce fruit,\nbut withered away, and from this and from the peculiar arrangement of the stamens it appears they require the aid of some insect-fertilizer. After fertilization the tube of the flower falls off leaving the base portion in the form of a cup which increases in size. When the seed is ripe the whole of the top of the ovary becomes detached and with the seeds falls out upon the soil as the fruit becomes too heavy and weighs down its stalk.\n\n**Thismia fumida**, n. sp.\n\nA small succulent herbaceous plant more slender and much less conspicuous than the preceding about four inches in height. Rhizome brownish with slender solitary stems bearing one or two flowers. Stems at first whitish, becoming brown when in fruit, with a very small scattered lanceolate acuminate leaves. Flowers much smaller than in *Th. Ascora*; of an inch long and nearly half an inch across. The tube almost globose, subbract narrowed above the ovary and becoming broader above white with pink stripes. The limb consists of six narrow lanceolate acuminate lobes becoming subulate gradually. They rise directly from beneath the central raised ring and there is no outer ring nor small processes as in *Th. Ascora*. They are greenish grey in colour. The central ring slopes inwards and is not raised above the limb except by its own thickness.\n\nThe style is very short with three small recurved stigmas. The capsule is shorter and broader than in the preceding a quarter of an inch each way, the edge crenulate, the outside scabrid, and ribbed. The opening of the ovary halfway down the cup is half inch across.\n\nSingapore, Chan Chu Kang: Selangor, near Pataling.\n\nRare and spasmodic at the roots of trees. It is very difficult to find on account of its inconspicuous colours. It is quite easily distinguished by its more slender habit, colour smaller size of the flowers.

RIDLEY, M.A., F.L.S.\n\nWhile staying recently at Pekan I procured, through the kindness of Mr. Rodger, a fine specimen of the remarkable vegetable production, known to the Malays here as \"Susu Rimau.\" The tradition is that it is the congealed milk of the tiger, and it is stated to produce eventually a climbing plant. It is considered a valuable medicine for asthma and other chest complaints, and is sold in the bazaars at a high price. The specimen given me by Mr. Rodger was considered a very large one, being about four inches cube, but a later one was brought in from the forests at Bukit Mandai in Singapore which is even larger, being six inches in length and three inches through in the thickest part. Professor Vaughan Stephens gave me also a smaller specimen from the interior of Pahang.\n\nThe structure and appearance of all seem very much the same. Each consists of an irregular white mass lobed and cracked all over, covered with a thin rind, terra-cotta red in the fresh specimen, browner when older. When fresh the interior is of the consistency of cheese, white, scentless, and with a faint funguslike taste. When dryer, and in old specimens it becomes chalky and vinier.\n\nUnder the microscope a section shows it to be a very compact mass of fungus threads (mycelium) with which are mixed innumerable globose cells. In the fresh specimen from Bukit Mandai the mycelium is very scanty, and in all it is very much less in quantity than the white globose cells.\nThrough the mass runs a fine whiter network visible with the naked eye, which consists of chains of cells with more granular opaque contents. The red rind consists of a very fine granular layer, in which I cannot perceive any cellstructure.\n\nIt is very certain from this that it is no animal structure, and that it is very improbable that the climbing plant supposed to be produced by it has anything to do with it, but that it is of the nature of a fungus. The Malays say that it is found underground, but the specimen obtained at Bukit Mandai, was growing upon a rotten tree, and to it was attached a fungus of the genus Polyporus, species of which are so abundant on rotten timber in the jungles.\n\nSome similar bodies are known from several parts of the world, and have been described, but at present their origin is very obscure, and I think it will be well to compare the known kinds with our Tiger's Milk, and see wherein it differs.\n\nRumphius described and figured a fungus which he called Tuber Regium, in the Herbarium Amboinense (Vol. VI Plate LVII 4, p. 120). The picture represents a body like a smooth block of earth on which a number of fungi evidently belonging to the genus Lentinus are growing. Rumphius gives a long account of the \"Royal Tuber.\" He says it is very common in April and October when the rainy season is on, and that then it is quite soft and not durable, and although his picture represents it as quite smooth, he says that when suddenly dried, it becomes cracked and fissured: when he planted it in his garden and watered it with warm water it produced the fungi, but perished next year. The Lentinus is eatable, but hardly worth eating. The tuber he recommends for diarrhea grated and mixed with rice and also mixed with oil as an ointment for sore mouths. Eaten raw he says it is insipid and earthy. He gives the following names for it, none of which occur in Filli:t's Javanese Dictionary:\u2014Malay, Ubi Raja, and Culat Batu, Amboinese Mathata Utta batu and Uttah putih. In Hitoe it is called Tabalale (without heart), and in Ulias-sens, Urupickal. In Java Djanjor bongkang (dung of the Python); in Ternate Cabamaisse (earth-tuber). It was common in Oma, Leytimor, Gorama and Ternate under grass on\nthe mountains and at the roots of tall trees. He compares it with the Chinese plant now called Fuhlong (Pachyma Cocos). This is a well-known Chinese drug of a very similar nature to our Tiger's Milk, and which is probably also the same as the Tuckahoe or Indian Bread of North America. I obtained a specimen of the Chinese Fuhlong in the Singapore market. It is sold in the drug shops and appears to have some reputation as a medicine. The plant differs somewhat from the Susu Rimau, and I should imagine is a different species. It is more regular in shape, resembling a large truffle externally with a cracked brown skin darker coloured than that of the Tiger's Milk. The interior is a little more mealy in texture, but perhaps this is due to the age of the specimen, and the rind is thicker. In section the microscope shows that there are the fungus threads as in the Susu Rimau, but that the globose cells are represented in great measure by amorphous granular masses. The white substance of Pachyma is stated by Professor Burkill to consist of masses of pine traversed by mycelium threads, and the whole thing to be of the nature of a sclerotium, that is to say, a fungus in a resting state. Mr. G. Murray, in a paper read before the Linnean Society in 1886, described a sclerotium upon which a Lentinus was growing somewhat as in Rumphius' picture which was brought from Samoa in the Fiji Islands by Mr. Whiteman. This he thought at first might be identical with the Pachyma. Microscopic examination, however, showed no pectine in the Samoan plant which consisted merely of a mass of fungus threads, and in fact was a typical Sclerotium.\n\nOur plant is, however, somewhat more than this, as the proportion of fungus threads to the white globose cells is so very small. It is evidently more closely allied to Pachyma, but I think is quite distinct from that specifically and may indeed be Rumphius' long-lost Tuber Regum.\n\nThe Bukit Mandai mass was partially encrusting a piece of rotten timber, and from it apparently grew a stalked Polyporus of large size. I thought at first that I had got hold of the fungus that produces the Susu Rimau, and was much surprised to find it was a Polyporus, and not a Lentinus, but a section\nshowed that the mycelium of the Polyporus was growing partly on the wood and partly over the Tiger's Milk and there was not only no mingling of the two bodies, but their microscopic structure was totally different. In that of the Polyporus there were no round globose cells, but a mere mass of mycelium threads as in an ordinary Sclerotium, so that the growth of the Polyporus upon the Susu Rimau is a mere accident, and we have again to seek for the fungus which produces this Tiger's Milk.\n\nThe plant is evidently not a very rare one and is well known to the Malays, so that if some of those whose business leads them into the jungles of the Peninsula will make enquiries about it, we may hope ere long to obtain the fungus it produces and settle definitely its name and life history.\nON THE HABITS OF THE CARINGA.\n\n(FORMICA GRACILIPES, GRAY.)\n\nBY\n\nH. N. RIDLEY, M.A., F.L.S.\n\nEvery person in the Straits must be acquainted with the ferocious red ant commonly known as the Caringa, but although it is so abundant, and obnoxious, it seems that its ferocity and the sharpness of its bite are almost all the facts generally known about it. It is, however, a very interesting animal, not only on account of its peculiar intelligence and courage, but also on account of its remarkable nest-building. I cannot find that the methods of making leaf nests as practiced by the Caringa has ever been described, and as it is very curious I will here submit some account of it. The nests are built in the leaves of any tree suitable to the ants, provided that the leaves are not too stiff to bend, or too small to fasten together conveniently. Usually a tree is selected which is attacked by one of the scale insects upon the honey-like exudations of which these ants live to a large extent. If possible the nest is built over leaves or stems infested by the scale insects, so as to include them in the nest, and in any case other scale insects are carried into the nest for the food supply when requisite. When the food supply is finished, the ants leave the nest and go to another tree.\n\nWhen a nest is to be built a number of ants seize one edge of a leaf in their jaws and by sticking the claws of the hind legs into an adjoining leaf steadily draw the two edges together. Usually one ant commences the work, then others come up and assist, till finally a large number can be seen holding on tightly. The structure of the legs is evidently adapted for this work, as they are remarkably long and furnished with very sharp hooked claws. If the edges of the two leaves are still too far apart, and one ant cannot reach both edges a chain is made. One ant grasps one edge with its jaws, another\nseizes him gently but firmly by the notch above the abdomen in its jaws. A third repeats the operation on the second and holds the second leaf by its hind claws. In this manner the leaves are gradually pulled together till the edges almost or entirely meet. The ants can remain in this strained position for a very long time, but usually in a few minutes others come up and commence to sew the leaves together with silk. This is done in the following way. One or two ants come from the interior of the nest, each bearing a larva in its mouth, the tail of the larva pointing outwards. They then commence by applying the tail end of the grub to the edge of one leaf irritating it by quivering the antennae over and upon it. The grub emits a thread of silk which is fixed apparently by the antennae of ant to the leaf-edge. The sewer then runs across to the other leaf drawing the thread from the grub and fixing it there, and thus it goes backwards and forwards from leaf-edge to leaf-edge till a strong web of silk binds the two leaves together. No silk is used in lining the nest, but any holes or spaces between the leaves, are closed with a curtain of silk. When a grub's silk-producing power is exhausted, it is taken back to the interior of the nest and another one fetched. The rapidity with which the work is done is wonderful. I partially opened a nest on a Velvet apple tree (Diospyros discolor) tearing open a space at one end about four inches each way, by raising one of the leaves which had previously been sewn to two others. The ants seemed much excited, but soon recommenced to repair the damage. First one, then another, and eventually ten or a dozen seized the edge of the leaf in the way above described and began to pull it back into the old position. The operation took about ten minutes. The leaf seemed to move by short slight jerks, but slowly and steadily. Just as they had got it close to the other leaf, a gust of wind blew it open again and the ants had to recommence. In less than a quarter of an hour the leaves were again held in apposition and the sewing had begun.\n\nIn the interior of the nest, the larvae seem to be put down anyhow, in a pile in the centre. The rest of the ants remain in the middle of the nest crowded together, and all manner of things, such as insects, bits of meat, etc., are brought in and de-\nON THE HABITS OF THE CARINGA.\n\nScale insects too are carried up into the nest, and thrown down anyhow generally wrong way up. In two or three nests I have seen mud and gravel brought up and deposited; in one made of the leaves of a caraya palm at the lowest end and at a point where the leaves did not actually touch, the aperture was filled up with a quantity of small stones and red mud agglutinated together with some wet slimy substance. It is possible that this was destined to weight down that end of the nest.\n\nThe courage of the Caringa is marvellous. It does not scruple to attack any insect however large. I once witnessed a fight between an army of Carinas who tenanted the upper part of a fig tree, and advancing crowd of a much larger kind of black ants. The field of battle was a large horizontal bough about 5 feet from the ground. The Carinas standing alert on their tall legs were arranged in masses awaiting the onset of the enemy. The black ants charged singly at any isolated Carina and tried to bite it in two with their powerful jaws. If successful the Carina was borne off to the nest at the foot of the tree. The red ant on the other hand attempted always to seize the black ant and hold on to it, so that its formic acid might take effect in the body of its enemy. If it got a hold on the black ant, the latter soon succumbed and was borne off to the nest in the top of the tree. Eventually the Carinas retreated to their nest, and the last who left the field was one who had lost one leg and three abdomen in the fight, but notwithstanding this I saw it at once charge and repulse three black ants one after the other, before it left the field.\n\nI believe these ants are cannibals, at least they carry away dead ones into their nests, and commence sucking their bodies. When an ant is slightly wounded they don't kill it, but pull it about and nibble it, but a fatally wounded they bear off to their nests and probably eat it. Besides other insects, meat and general animal food, they live as I have said, upon the honey of the scale insects.

DAVIES SHERBORN, F.Z.S., F.G.S.\n\nIn compiling this Bibliography, all sources of information have been utilized. In inserting, therefore, every publication that has come under his notice, the compiler hopes that the entries will prove of considerable assistance; but, as a large proportion of the literature of this district, either never reaches England at all, or else arrives so long after as to be too late for examination for this purpose, he begs the reader's indulgence for any error that may be present. His thanks are due to M. Martinus Nijhoff of The Hague for information as to some of the more recent books.\n\nABDOELLAH BIN ABDELKADIR MOENSJI.\u2014Verhaal van de reis van Abdoellah naar Kalantan en van zijne reis naar Djeddah, in het Maleisch, voor de lithogr. pers geschreven en van aanteek. voorzien door H.

The latter means that which tickles the eye (sight being understood), and the former is probably derived from it.\" Kelematah, originally Gele mata, may, he thinks, be derived in the following way:\u2014\n\n\"Malay women are generally slightly hysterical, and seeing a lump of these larvae wriggling about in a vessel would make a Malay woman squirm (I can find no better word) and would give her a feeling of being tickled which she would so express. The large millipede I have known to cause the same sensation to Malay men who are particularly nervous.\"\n\nThis suggestion seems quite a possible one for the derivation. One may compare Forbes's account of his throwing a woman into a state of latah, by flicking a caterpillar upon her, and I have known a syce unable to look at a death's head caterpillar which I was carrying without violent shuddering and horror.\n\nMr. Hale adds:\u2014\"The larvae are very much relished by Malays, and I myself ate several of them and found them particularly sweet and nice, having a flavour like a fried filbert. The way to cook them is to put them alive into a pan over a slow fire and fry them until they are crisp. In the process of cooking they exude a quantity of a clear sweet nutty-flavoured oil (100 larvae will yield about half a pint). This is believed by Malay women to be a most excellent hair-oil, and is much used by them for that purpose to encourage the growth of girls' hair. The perfect insect is called Kumbang Jenti, Kumbang Katapa and Buang, but all of these names are applied indifferently to other large beetles.\"\nMOSQUITO LARV\u00c6 IN THE PITCHERS OF NEPENTHES.\n\nTowards the end of last year, on examining the contents of a pitcher of the common pitcher plant (*Nepenthes ampullacea* Jack) which was growing in the jungle in the Botanic Garden, I was surprised to find three larv\u00e6 of one of the mosquito species living and apparently thriving in the water of the pitcher. Carefully cutting off the pitcher and keeping it in a bottle, I succeeded, in two or three days, in rearing two of the larv\u00e6 to maturity. That mosquito larv\u00e6 are not very particular as to the water they live in is known to every one who has ever watched them, but it is certainly very remarkable to find them living and thriving in the liquid in the Nepenthes, which is speedily fatal to any other insect which chances to fall in.\n\nMATONIA PECTINATA IN THE KARIMON ISLANDS.\n\nDuring a short trip recently made to the Karimon islands I came across a great quantity of *Matonia pectinata*, growing with *Dipteris Lobbiana* and *D. Horsfieldii*, near the waterfall, which is certainly not more than 500 feet above sea level. This rare fern is not known to grow elsewhere at a lower altitude than 2,000 feet. *Dipteris Horsfieldii*, itself so abundant on the shores here near Kranji, in Johor, Toas, Pasir Panjang etc., is an alpine or subalpine plant only in Java growing at about 4,000 feet altitude.\n\nH.
