Elliot, K.C.B. It is probable that, in preparing his extracts from the Mohamadan Histories of India, Elliot availed himself of the aid of Mr. Beale, of whose scholarship Prof. Dowson makes justly deserved mention in the eighth volume of his valuable edition of the work.* Mr. Beale died at a very advanced age in the summer of 1875, having before his death expressed a wish that I would see his MS. through the press, and reduce the transliteration into conformity with the system then recently adopted by the Government of India, and founded (as I need hardly observe) upon the system of Sir W. Jones.\n\nAccordingly, on the 5th October of that year I laid the MS. before Sir John Strachey, the then Lieut.-Governor, in the name of the Archaeological Society of Agra, of which he was a Vice-Patron, in a letter from which the following is an extract:\u2014\n\n\"This is no ordinary book. I have used it as a work of reference, for years: and have lately had an opportunity of showing it to the eminent scholar Mr. E.B. Eastwick, C.B. who, I am authorised to say, concurs with me in thinking that the Dictionary will be of unique value to oriental students.\"\n\nSir J. Strachey took up the subject with that enlightened energy which always actuated him in dealing with the past history of the country over whose administration he then presided. The MS. and copyright were acquired at the expense of Government; and it was ultimately resolved\u2014in view of the importance of the work and my own official occupations\u2014that the editing should be entrusted to the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n\nThe Society confided the labour of seeing the Dictionary though the press to their Philological Secretary, Principal Blochmann, of whose qualifications it would be presumptuous to say more than that they have an eccumenical reputation. That distinguished man (of whom it has been observed by Count v. Noer that he united the enthusiasm of an artist to the most patient accuracy of research) undertook the task with his characteristic earnestness and ability. But unhappily for oriental scholarship Mr. Blochmann's lamented death occurred before he had completed the preparation of more than a few sheets; and the duty ultimately reverted to the local Archaeological Society of Agra.\n\nBeing soon after transferred from Agra, and being besides prevented by my public duties from giving to the Dictionary the full attention which its importance required, I have availed to a great degree of the aid of my colleagues, Mr. S\u00e1yad Mahmood, Prof. A. Thomson, and L\u00e1la Bahal Rai. I have also (in the latter sheets particularly) had valuable help from Dr. Hoernle, Philological Secretary of the Society. To these gentlemen, and to the Superintendent of the Baptist Mission Press the work is indebted for its handsome and practical appearance and character.\n\nThe substance is almost entirely Mr. Beale's; and I cannot close this notice more fitly than by giving the following extracts from the preface originally drafted by himself:\u2014\n\n\"In preparing a work of this nature, intended to be used as a work of reference on matters connected with Oriental History, it is proper to state that the greatest care has been taken to ensure accuracy in the narrative, as also in the dates of births, deaths, and other events recorded... Various MSS. have been collated whenever discrepancy was observed... To remove all doubt, chronograms indicating the dates with a certainty not to be found by any other method and written when the events were fresh in the minds of men, have been inserted, when available.\"\n\n* The History of India, by its own Historians. Tr\u00fcbner & Co., 1877.\n\u2020 Kaiser Akbar. Leyden, 1880.\nI may here add that it has been judged expedient to omit these chronograms, for the most part, in printing the book. In the chapter of Mr. Dowson's book already cited, will be found an account of this species of memoria technica. But it is chiefly interesting as machinery for producing a certain result; and when the result has been produced is not of much more use than the scaffolding of a building when the building is complete.\n\n\"The materials collected in this Biography are only from those works which were within the reach of the author, and therefore it is to be considered as a nucleus to which those who have access to other sources may add new materials.\n\n\"It may also be proper to add, that the difficulties and embarrassment which a writer of such a work is liable to meet with is so great, (I quote here the words of a learned gentleman) 'that though of a minor order, comprehends in itself such a number of annoyances that the writer of it, even if he had none other to make head against, might feel tempted to abandon his pen in despair when considering it.'\n\n\"'In the East' says he, 'there are but a few proper names of individuals. Abdullah, Ali, Hasan, Husain, Muhammad, for example, are common to thousands. To remedy the inconvenience that might be supposed to result from this tendency to homogenousness, the Orientals annex to the family-name of the chronicled person, 1, a Kunia, or surname taken from the name of his eldest son, as Abu Muhammad (father of Muhammad); Ab\u00fa'l Hasan (father of Hasan); 2, the name of his father and often the name of his grandfather; 3, a name taken from his place of residence; 4, a name taken from his birthplace; 5, an honorary title, chiefly appended to the name of K\u00e1z\u00eds, Sheiks and Im\u00e1ms, Monks and Doctors, as Bah\u00e1udd\u00edn (Splendour of Religion), Jal\u00e1luddin (Glory of Religion), T\u00e1judd\u00edn (Crown of Religion); and in the order of this nomenclature, the last name is put first. Thus to designate aright the famous physician Abdul Lat\u00edf, we must call him Muwaffikudd\u00edn Ab\u00fa Muhammad Abdul Lat\u00edf bin Yusaf Mous\u00e1li Baghd\u00e1d\u00ed, viz., The Protector of Religion, father of Muhammad, Abdul Lat\u00edf, son of Joseph, living at Mous\u00e1l, born at Baghd\u00e1d. Yet this is by no means an exaggerated specimen; several other surnames of the same kind are frequently added. The perpetual recurrence of such a multiplicity of names and titles must tend in many ways to confuse a literary historian; and the more naturally when he finds the same individual chronicled in one page under his honorary title only, as Jal\u00e1ludd\u00edn, in another under his family-name, as Abdur Rahm\u00e1n, in the third under his father's name as Ibn Arabsh\u00e1h, somewhere else under the name of his sons, as Ab\u00fa'l Abb\u00e1s, and perhaps again, and where one would least look for it, under the name of his native province, Sh\u00e1hr\u00edst\u00e1n. D'Herbelot has recorded no fewer than fourteen Persian writers, all of whom pass under the common cognomen of Karam\u00e1n\u00ed, from their province Karam\u00e1n. Here is perspicuity! But this is not all. The transcribers of the MSS. have frequently confounded the title Ab\u00fa and Ibn, or else for abbreviation sake, have omitted them altogether and written down Abdullah, or Abdur Rahm\u00e1n, him who was in fact the father or the son of Abdullah or Abdur Rahm\u00e1n. Then there are a great many authors whom public celebrity has been accustomed to distinguish so exclusively by one only of their adjective titles, that even the native biographers find it impossible to trace either their family-names or their surnames. Lastly, many hundreds of books bear the same name, and the names of most books are conceived after such a many-worded and no-meaninged fashion, that de Sacy, Schlegel, Casiri and von Hammer, to mention but a few investigators out of many, have been foiled in the attempt to establish their signification.'\n\n\"To prevent such confusion and difficulties, the author has taken care to insert each individual under his different appellations, viz., under his family-name, his surname, poetical name, under his title or under the name of the place of his birth, referring at the same time, if he is not to be found under one name, to look under the one referred to.\n\n\"In conclusion the author begs to add that most part of the materials collected in this volume were procured by the assistance of his son the late lamented Mr. J. W. Beale, 2nd Master of the Bareily College who was murdered by the insurgents on the 3rd June 1857 at that station, and since he is now no more, the author is obliged to drop his pen; but earnestly hopes that this work which is nearly the first of its kind in India, and the want of which has already been much felt, may prove useful to the Student, the Scholar, the Historian, and the general reader.\"\n\nThis notice may well terminate with a repetition of this hope: and with an appeal to scholars of larger leisure and opportunities for an indulgent treatment of a work produced by\na man who had never been in Europe nor enjoyed the use of a complete Library. Mr. Beale had drawn up a list of more than thirty books in various languages which had furnished him with materials. In addition the editors have from time to time referred to the translation of the Ain Akbori and its invaluable notes by Mr. Blochmann, of which the 1st Volume (never, alas, continued) was published in Calcutta some years ago.\n\nOne word more as to the inexhaustible subject of transliteration. The English as is well known have three methods; the Haphazard (which indeed is no method at all), the Gilchristian, and the popularised Jonesian introduced by the Government of India under the inspiration of Mr. W. W. Hunter. None of these is quite satisfactory. The French adopt a system of their own, and so do the Germans. Mr. Beale had followed an orthography, compounded of the two first-named elements, which has been to some extent modified in printing these pages. For the convenience of Continental European scholars the names have also been printed in the Persian character; and it is hoped that no practical difficulty will be experienced by those who may have occasion to use the Dictionary.\n\nH.

(Rabi'-us-Sani 683 A.H.), and was crowned on Friday the 19th June following (3rd Ramazan.) He was a prince who added to the qualifications of courage and wisdom those of moderation, clemency, and justice. His ambassadors were introduced in 1274 to the ecclesiastical Synod at Lyons. He proved to be a formidable neighbour to the Christians who resided at Jerusalem. The magnificence of his court embittered the latter years of his reign; and his days were believed by many to have been shortened by poison given to him by his minister Khwaja Shamsuddin Muhammad, which occasioned his death on Wednesday the 1st of April 1282 A.D., (20th Zil-hijja 680 A.H.) after a reign of 17 years and some months. He had married the daughter of Michael Paleologus, emperor of Constantinople, who had been betrothed to his father, but arrived at Maragha in Tabriz, the seat of his government, after the death of that prince. Abu-khan was succeeded by his brother Nekodar, who embraced Muhammedanism, and took the title of Ahmad Khan.\n\nAbbas, (\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0633) the son of Abdul-Mutallib, and uncle of the prophet Muhammad. He at first opposed the ambitions views of his nephew, but when defeated in the battle of Badr, he was reconciled to him, warmly embraced his religion, and thanked heaven for the prosperity and the grace which he enjoyed as a Musalman. He served the cause of Muhammad at the battle of Hunain by recalling his dismayed troops to the charge, and inciting them boldly to rally round their prophet, who was near expiring under the scimitars of the Sakaites. He died on the 21st February, 663 A.D. (17th Rajab, 32 A.H.); and 100 lunar years after, Abdul-Abbas, surnamed As-Saffah, one of his descendants, laid the foundation of the Abbas or Abbaside family of the Caliphs in Baghdad, which continued for 524 lunar years.

The promise was forgotten, and the husband's life was sacrificed by the tyrant, and Abbas was reduced to poverty. This circumstance took place in 803 A.D. (187 A.H.). There are still extant some Arabic verses which beautifully celebrate her love and her misfortunes.

This work was dedicated to the emperor Akbar, and is called Tufa-i-Akbarshahi. The first part of this work was translated into Urdu by Maghar Ali Khan in the time of Lord Cornwallis and is entitled 'Tafkhi-i-Sher Shahi.'\n\nVide Dowson, Elliot's History of India, IV, 301.\n\n'Abbas Mirza, (\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u064a\u0631\u0632\u0627) a Persian prince, son of Fatih Ali Shah, was born in 1783. He died in 1833. His death was a great loss to his country, although he could not prevent the encroachments of Russia. His eldest son, Muhammad Mirza, mounted the throne in 1834, on the death of Fatih Ali, under the united protection of England and Russia.\n\n'Abbas Mirza, (\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u064a\u0631\u0632\u0627) whose title was Nawab Iktidaruddaula, was the author of a Masnavi in Urdu verse, containing a history of Christ. He was living in Lakhnau in 1849 A.D., and was then about eighty years of age.\n\n'Abbas (Shah) I, (\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0634\u0627\u0647) surnamed the Great, and seventh king of Persia of the Safawi family, was born on Monday the 29th of January 1571 A.D. (1st Ramazan, 978 A.H.). He was proclaimed king of Persia, in his sixteenth year, by the chiefs of Khurasan, and took possession of the throne during the lifetime of his father, Sultan Sikandar Shah, surnamed Muhammad Khudabanda, A.D. 1588, (996 A.H.). He was the first who made Isfahan the capital of Persia. He was brave and active, and enlarged the boundaries of his dominions. He too came into conflict with the English forces, in 1629 A.D., and took Jalalabad of Oroum, which had been in the possession of the Portuguese for 129 years. He reigned 44 lunar years, was contemporary with Akbar and Jahangir, and died on Thursday, the 8th of January, 1629 A.D. (24th Jamada I, 1038 A.H.).

Ab\u00fa-Ja'far ut-T\u00fasi describes him in the Fihrist as the greatest orator and lawyer of his time, the most ancient Mujahid, the most subtle reasoner, and the chief of all those who delivered Fatwas. Ibn-K\u00e1s\u00edr-uh-Sh\u00e1mi relates that, when he died, Ibn-Nakib, who was one of the most learned of the Sunni doctors, adorned his house, told his followers to congratulate him, and declared that, since he had lived to see the death of Shaikh Muf\u00edd, he should himself leave the world without regret. Shaikh Muf\u00edd stated that he had written 2000 fatwas amongst whom, one called the \"Ir\u00e1hid\", is well-known. He also wrote works on the law of inheritance.

He is said by some to have died in the year 824 A.D., 219 A.H., but as he makes mention of Al-Mu'tesim Billah, whose reign began in 833, he must have died about the year 834 and not 824 A.D., 209 A.H.

His works are composed of a large number of small Tafs\u012brs. There is considerable uncertainty as to the exact time when he lived. Shaikh Najashi says in the Fihrist that Abu-Ja'far died at Rai in 331 A.H., A.D. 942, but this appears to be erroneous. Shaikh Najashi, who died in A.D. 1014, states that Abu-Ja'far visited Baghdad, whilst yet in the prime of life, in A.H. 365, A.D. 965, which might well have been the case, since Abu-Hasan 'Ali bin-Babwaihi, the father of Abu-Ja'far, did not die until A.H. 329, A.D. 940. In addition to this, Nur-ullah relates, on the authority of the Shaikh ad-Diryast\u012b that Abu-Ja'far lived in the time of Rukn-ad-Daula Dailami, and had repeated interviews with that prince, who, as is well-known, reigned from A.H. 388 to A.H. 386, A.D. 949\u2014976. He is also the author of the Man la yahzurhu al-Fakih, which is the fourth of the four authentic books on Shi\u02bfa tradition, called Kutub Arba\u02bfa. He is said to have written in all 172 works, and to have been especially skilled in \u1e24i\u1e6dbah.\n\nAbu-Ja'far Muhammad bin-Hasan al-Tusi, (Shaikh) who was one of the chief Mujtahids of the Imamiya or Shi\u02bfa sect, is the author of the work entitled \"Fi\u1e25sul-Kutub\" and \"As\u0101s al-Maq\u0101sif.\" It is a bibliographical dictionary of Shi\u02bfa works, together with the names of the authors. The greater part of this author's works were publicly burnt in Baghdad in the tumult that arose between the Sunnis and Shi\u02bfas in 1066 A.D., 460 A.H. Abu-Ja'far died in 1067 A.D. He is also the author of a very extensive commentary on the Qur\u02be\u0101n, in twenty volumes, which is generally called the \"Tafs\u012br ut-Tusi,\" though it was entitled by its author the \"Majma\u02bful-Bay\u0101n li-\u02bful\u016bm-il-Kur\u0101n.\" Among the Four Books on Shi\u02bfa Had\u012bs, called Kutub Arba\u02bfa, the two first in order were composed by him entitled \"Ta\u1e25zib-ul-Ahk\u0101m,\" and Istib\u1e63\u0101r. His chief works are the Mabs\u016bt and the Khil\u0101f, which are held in great estimation, as are also the Ni\u1e25\u0101ya and the Mu\u1e25\u012bt by the same author. The Ris\u0101la-i-Jafariya is likewise a legal treatise by at-Tusi, which is frequently quoted.\n\nAbu-Jahl, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u062c\u0647\u0644, the uncle of 'Umar ibn-al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b. He was one of the most inveterate enemies of Muhammad and his religion. Though his son 'Ikrima became a convert to the tenets of Muhammad, yet his father was for ever shut out from paradise; and so violent is the resentment of the Muslims against this first enemy of their prophet, that they call the colocony in contempt, the melon of Abu-Jahl. Abu-Jahl was slain in the battle of Badr, which he fought against Muhammad, together with Al-Ks his brother, in the 70th year of his age, in the month of March 624 A.D., Ramaz\u0101n 2, A.H.\n\nAbu-Lahab, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0644\u0647\u0628, the uncle of Muhammad, also called 'Abdul-'Uzz\u0101, was the son of 'Abdul-Muttalib and one of the bitterest enemies of Muhammad and his doctrines. He died of grief within a week after the defeat of Ab\u016b-Sufy\u0101n in the battle of Badr, which took place about the beginning of the year 624 A.D., 2 A.H. He was a man of wealth, of proud spirit and irritable temper. His son 'Utba was engaged, or according to some married, to Muhammad's third daughter Rukayya, but when Muhammad appeared as a prophet, the contract was dissolved, and Rukayya married her lover 'Uqman. Abu-Lahab was also allied to the rival line of Kurash\u012b, having married Umm-Jam\u012bl, sister of Ab\u016b-Sufy\u0101n.\n\nAbul-'Abbas, surnamed Al-Saffah, which see.\n\nAbul-'Abbas bin-Muhammad, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f, author of the Arabic work \"Ma\u02berifat-us-Sahaba,\" and other books.

Al-Darkutini, the Sunn\u012b traditionist, is reported to have said that Ibn-'Ukda knew 300,000 traditions of the Ahl-bait and the Ban\u016b-Hashim. He died in A.D. 944, 333 A.H.\n\nAbul-'Abbas Fagl, bin-Ahmad, of Isfara\u00edn, was minister to Mahmud of Ghazni.\n\nAbul-'Ain\u0101, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0621, a Musulm\u0101n lawyer celebrated for his wit. When Musa, son of the kalifa 'Abdul-Malik, put to death one of Abul-'Ain\u0101's friends, and afterwards spread a report that he had escaped, Abul-'Ain\u0101 said in the words of the Lawgiver of the Hebrews, \"Moses smote him and he died.\" The sentence was reported to the prince, and Abul-'Ain\u0101 was summoned to appear. Instead of dreading the threats of the tyrant, he boldly replied in the words of the following verse in Exodus, \"Will thou kill me to-day as thou killedst the other man yesterday?\" The ingenuity of the expression disarmed the anger of Musa, who loaded him with presents.\n\nAbu-Lais Nasir Samarkandi, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0644\u0627\u0633 \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0633\u0645\u0631\u0642\u0646\u062f\u0649, author of the work on jurisprudence in Arabic called \"Fiqh Abu-Lais,\" and the \"Ghunyat-ul-Mubtadi.\"\n\nAbul-'Ala, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0647, entitled Malik-ush-Shu\u02bfar\u0101\u02be, or royal poet, of Ganja, flourished in the time of Man\u1e63\u016br, ruler of Shirw\u0101n.

Though he lost his sight in the early years of age by an accidental hit, his poetry is animated and his descriptions are beautiful and striking. He died on Friday the 9th of May 1057 A.D., 1st Rab\u012b\u02bf I, 449 A.H. He was the panegyrist of Al-k\u0101yim Billah, the kalifa of Baghdad, and has left a Diw\u0101n in Arabic.

He is celebrated as the author of the \"Akbarnama\" and the \"Ain-Akbari,\" and for his letters, called \"Maktubat-i-Allami,\" which are considered in India models of public correspondence. The history of the Mughal empire is narrated on the 47th year of Akbar's reign, in which year he died. He was deputed with Prince Sultan Murad in 1597 A.D., 1006 A.H., as Commander-in-Chief of the army of the Dakhin, and on his being recalled five years after, he was advancing towards Narwar with a small escort, when he fell into an ambuscade, laid for him by Birsingh Deo Bundela, raja of Uchcha in Bundelkhand, at the instigation of Prince Salim (afterwards Jahangir) on suspicion of being the occasion of a misunderstanding between him and the emperor his father; and although Abul-Fazl defended himself with great gallantry, he was cut off with most of his attendants, and his head was sent to the prince, who was then at Allahabad.

Hereupon the prince with horror demanded a learned man as his recreant, and commanded him to be instantly thrown out of the window. The barbarous sentence was presently executed; but care had been taken to prepare beneath a soft cushion, into which the body of the sage sank without sustaining any injury. Abu-Rahman was then called before the monarch, and was required to say whether by his boasted art he had been able to foresee these events, and the treatment through which he had that day passed. The learned man immediately desired his table to be sent for, in which were found regularly predicted the whole of these singular transactions. He travelled into different countries, and to and from India for the space of 40 years. He wrote many works, and is said to have executed several translations from the Greek and epitomized the Almagest of Ptolemy. His works are said to have exceeded a camel load. The most valuable of all his works is the \"Kitab-ul-Hind.\" Another of his works is the K\u0101fiya Mas'udi, dedicated to Sultan Mas'ud of Gharni, for which he received an elephant-load of silver coins. He lived in the time of Sultans Mahmud and Mas'ud of Gharnawi, and died in the year 1039 A.D., 480 A.H.\n\nFor further notes see Dowson, Elliot's History of India, II, I.\n\nAbu-Sa'id, the son of 'Abdullah, an Arabian poet who flourished in the court of Salih-ud-din, and was his prime minister.

In his time Rashid-ud-din, the author of the Jami-ut-Tawarikh, was put to death. This monarch may be termed the last of the dynasty of Hulakai Khan who enjoyed any power. The few princes of that sovereign's family who were raised to the throne after Abu-\n\nSalid were mere pageants, whom the nobles of the court elected or cast down as it suited the purposes of their ambition. Abu-Sa'id resigned 19 lunar years, and died of fever on the 20th November 1395 A.D., 13th Rab'II, 736 A.H. The following is a list of the princes of the family of Chingiz Khan, who were raised to nominal power after the death of Abu-Sa'id Khan.\n\nArpa Khan (Mu'izz-ud-din) was crowned in 1335, reigned five months, and was killed in battle in 1336 A.D.\n\nMusa Khan was elevated in 1336, reigned two years, and was murdered in 1338 A.D.\n\nSaki, sister of Abu-Sa'id Khan, was elevated to the throne in 1338.

He was born in 1427 A.D. After the death of his father in 1441, he continued to live with Mirza Ulugh Beg, son of Mirza Shahrukh at Samar-kand, and served in his army when he was at war with his son Mirza 'Abdul-Latif; but when that prince was murdered by his unnatural son in October 1449 A.D., Ramazan, 853 A.H., and he in his turn was slain after nine or ten months by his own soldiers, and Samar-kand was taken possession of by Mirza 'Abdullah, son of Mirza Ibrahim and grandson of Amir Timur. Abu-Sa'id with the assistance of Abu-Khair Usbek had been defeated and taken 'Abdullah prisoner in a battle, put him to death and ascended the throne of Samar-kand in 1451 A.D., 856 A.H. He also took possession of Khurasan after the death of Babor Sultan, son of Bayasanghar Mirza in 1457, 861 A.H., and greatly extended his dominions, but was at last taken prisoner in an ambush, and put to death on the 8th February, 1469 A.D., 25th Rajab, 873 A.H., after he had reigned 18 years. After his death, Sultan Husain Bakhsh, surnamed Abul-Ghazi, a descendant of Amir Timur, made himself master of the empire. Abu-Sa'id at his death left eleven sons, viz., Mirza Sultan Ahmad, Mirza Sultan Mahmud, Mirza Sultan Muhammad, Mirza Shahrukh, Mirza Ulugh Beg, Mirza Sultan Shahid, Mirza Ali Khan, Mirza Sultan Murad, Mirza Sultan Khalil, Mirza Sultan Walid, and Mirza Sultan Umar; of whom four arrived to the dignity of kings, viz., Mirza Ulugh Beg to the throne of Kabul; Mirza Sultan Ahmad to the kingdom of Samar-kand; Mirza Umar Shahid to the united thrones of Andijan and Farghana; and Mirza Sultan Mahmud to those of Kundus and Badakhshan. Abu-Sa'id Mirza says Babar Shah, though brought up in the city, was illiterate and unrefined.\n\nSee Genealogical Table attached to Kin Translation.\n\nAbu-Sina Muhammad, author of the Arabic work called \"Dahakul-Hakai,\" containing a collection of traditions.\n\nAbu-Sina, or Abu-'Ali Sina, whom we call Avicenna, was a famous Muhammadan physician and philosopher, who early applied himself to literature, botany, and mathematics. At the age of eighteen, he began to practise, and with such success that he became physician to the court of Baghdad. He was born in the city of Bukhara in 983 A.D., 373 A.H., and died at Hamadan in July, 1037, 427 A.H., aged 54 lunar years, with the character of a learned man but too much addicted to wine and effeminating pleasures. His books on Medicine, &c., were in number 100, now nearly all lost. He is also called Ibn-Sina. The following are the titles of his works: Of the Utility and Advantages of Sciences, 20 books.

He was an able and ambitious man, of great wealth and influence, and one of the most persevering and powerful opponents of Muhammad. He was the father of Mu'awiya, the first khalifa of the house of Umayya, and one of the heads of the tribe of Kuraish, to which Muhammad also belonged. When Muhammad took up arms for the propagation of his faith, Abu-Sufy\u00e1n was made generalissimo of his enemies against him: and after the battle of Badr, he stood very fair for the headship of that tribe. But he was at last convinced (as it seems, by a signal victory gained by Muhammad over his enemies), of the truth of the prophet's pretensions, and was converted in the 8th year of the Hijra, A.D. 629.\n\nAbu-Sulaiman Daud, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u062faud, bin-Abul-Fazl bin-Muhammad Fakhr Binakkit, so called from having been born at Binakkit, or Finakit, town in Transoxiana, afterwards called Shahrakhiya.

It is chiefly an abridgment of the Jami'-ur-Rashidi, and was compiled by the author only seven years after that work in A.D. 1317, 707 A.H., and is dedicated to Sultan Abu-Sa'id, the ninth Mughul king of Persia. The author was a poet as well as an historian, and was appointed by Sultan Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, poet laureate of his court.

After some years he again visited India in the time of Shah Jah\u00e1n, who employed him and conferred on him the title of \"Malik-ush-Shu'ar\u00e1,\" or Poet Laureate. He was twice weighed against gold and silver, and the amount was given to him as a reward for his poetical talents. He died at L\u00e1h\u00f3r on the 19th November, 1651, 10th Zil-hijja 1061 A.H.

In this situation he continued for two years; and after the death of his patron, and the appointment of Haidar Beg Kh\u00e1n to his office, he was superseded, and repaired to Lakhnau, and was allowed by the Naw\u00e1b 60,000 Rs. per annum for his support. After the expiration of one year, Colonel Alexander Hanny, having been appointed Collector of Gorakhpur, requested the Naw\u00e1b to take him with him as an assistant, in which situation he continued for three years. He was afterwards employed by Mr. Middleton, the Resident of Lakhnau, in reducing the rebel raja Balbhadar Singh, whom, during two years, he frequently defeated and pursued. At length, being surprised in his camp, the raja in endeavouring to make his escape, was killed. Abu-T\u00e1lib, after this falling in distant parts of India, embarked for Europe with Captain David Richardson, a Scotchman, and left Calcutta in February, 1799, Ramzan 1213 A.H. He visited England and other parts of Europe, and was well known in London under the title of the Persian Prince. During his travels he wrote a Journal in which he daily inserted every event, and committed to writing such reflections as occurred to him at the moment. On his return to Calcutta in 1803, 1218 A.H., having revised and abridged his notes, he published them under the title of \"Maq\u00e1sir-ut-T\u00e1lib\u00ed fi Bil\u00e1d-i-Ir\u00e1nji.\" This work was translated by Charles Stewart, and published in London in the year 1814. Abu-T\u00e1lib died about the year 1806 A.D., 1221 A.H.

Having arrived in the city of Hamad\u00e1n, he was received with great distinction by Abu-Waf\u00e1 bin-Salama. When about to depart, a heavy fall of snow made the roads for a long time impassable. Abu-Waf\u00e1 conducted the poet to his library, and placed it entirely at his disposal. Surrounded with these literary treasures, Abu-Tamnam forgot his journey, read the precious volumes with avidity, and devoted his time to the composition of several works. The poetical collection, entitled \"Khamsa,\" was the principal fruit of these researches, and attests the indefatigable attention with which the learned writer had ransacked this rich library. Amongst the other works that he wrote, one is called \"Fuh\u00edd-ush-Shu'ar\u00e1.\" He was born in A.D. 804, 188 A.H., at J\u00e1s\u00edm near Damascus, and died in A.D. 846, 231 A.H.\n\nAbu-Tayyib al-Mutanabbi, \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0646\u0628\u064a, vide Mutanabbi.\nAbu-Turab, Mir, a Salafi Sayyid of Shiraz, who served with his son Mir Gaddi in Gujrat, and then under Akbar.

Umar, on his accession to the khalifa, replaced Abu-'Ubaida in the command of the army in Syria, being greatly displeased with the cruel and blood-thirsty disposition of Khalid. Abu-'Ubaida extended his conquests over Palestine and Syria, and drove the Greeks out of the whole country extending from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates. His conquest was completed in 639 A.D., 18 A.H., in which year Syria was visited by a dreadful plague, in which the Muslims lost 25,000 men, among whom were Abu-'Ubaida himself, Yasir ibn Abu-Sufyan, and many other men of distinction.\n\nAbu-'Ubaida ibn-Mas'ud, a general in the time of the khalifa 'Umar.

He supported the tenets of Ab\u00fb Han\u00eefa, and maintained the dignity of his office by impartiality. When one day reproached for his ignorance of one of the causes brought before him, for the decision of which he received an ample allowance, he jocosely replied, that he received in proportion as he knew; but, said he, if I were paid for all I do not know, the riches of the khalifa itself would not be sufficient to answer my demands.

The great Tartar conqueror Amir Timur (Tamerlane), being on his march through Anatoli, halted for a while at Amethi, where Ahmadi lived; and the poet took the opportunity of presenting him with an ode. This led to further intimacies. Timur being a patron of literary men; and one day when both were in the bath, the monarch amused himself by putting facetious questions to Ahmadi, and laughing at his answers. \"See now,\" said he, pointing to the surrounding attendants, \"you were required to value these beautiful boys, how much would you say each was worth?\" Ahmadi answered with becoming gravity, estimating one at a camel-load of silver, another at six buahels of pearls, a third at forty gold wedges, and so made the circuit of the ring. \"Very fair,\" said Timur, \"and now tell me, What do you value Me at?\" \"Four and twenty aspers,\" replied the poet, \"no more and no less.\" \"What!\" cried Timur, laughing, \"why the shirt I have on is worth that.\" \"Do you really think so?\" asked Ahmadi with the greatest apparent simplicity\u2014\"at that rate you must be worth nothing, for I included the shirt in the valuation.\" So much to his credit, Timur, instead of being angry, applauded and rewarded the wit and boldness of the poet. Ahmadi was a contemporary of Shaikh, and is the author of the \"Kulliyati-Khwaja Ahmad Ja'fari.\" He also composed a heroic poem on the actions of Tamerlane, and a Sikandar-nama in the Turkish language.

He died in A.D. 884, 270 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Khumawwa. Egypt continued to be governed by his successors for several years when it was again reduced in A.D. 905 by Muhammad, general of the Khalifa of Baghdad al-Muktafi;\nthe last khalifa of Egypt having assassinated his predecessor, and thereby rendered himself very odious. In the year 938, Muhammad the son of T\u0101j\u012b, or T\u0101j\u012bl, surnamed al-Ashhad, seized upon Syria and Egypt in the khilafat of ar-R\u0101z\u012b Billah, and his family retained the whole of it, except a small part which 'Ubd-ulla al-Mahdi, the first of the F\u0101timite dynasty (the seat of whose empire was at Kairuw\u0101n near Tunis) had conquered in A.D. 910.

After the death of Mull\u00e1 Ahmad, the remainder of the work was written by Asaf Kh\u00e1n Ja'far Beg, up to the year 997 A.H., or 1589 A.D. Mull\u00e1 Ahmad was buried at L\u00e1h\u00e1r, but being a Sh\u00ed'a, who openly used to revile the first khalifas, the people of L\u00e1h\u00e1r exhumed his remains and burnt them.\n\n[Vide \u00c1\u00edn Translation, I, 206.]\n\nAhmad Niz\u00e1m Shah Bahri, the founder of the Niz\u00e1m-Sh\u00e1hi dynasty of the Dakhin, was the son of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk Bahri, prime minister to Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad Shah Bahmani. He had conquered many places in the vicinity of his father's jagir, and was besieging the fort of Dundr\u00e1jpur about the year A.D. 1486, 891 A.H., when he received intelligence of the assassination of his father, and immediately returned and assumed the titles of the deceased. He was generally known by those of Ahmad Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk Bahri, to which the people of the Dakhin added the title of Shah. As he had distinguished himself repeatedly as a general in the field, though the Sult\u00e1n wished to remove him from power, none of his nobility would accept the task of reducing him. He, however, on the 3rd May 1490, 3rd Rajab 895 A.H., gained a victory over the army of the Sult\u00e1n, and from that time he sat without opponent on the masnad of royalty, and by the advice of Y\u00fasuf 'Adil Sh\u00e1h, who had already become independent, having discontinued to read the khutba in the name of the king, put in his own and spread a white umbrella over his head. He laid the foundation of the city of Ahmadnagar in A.D. 1496, 900 A.H., which was completed in two years, and became the first of the Niz\u00e1m-Sh\u00e1hi kings of Ahmadnagar. He died in A.D. 1505, 914 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h I.

He was soon after defeated by Torahim, the favorite of Sulaim\u00e1n, and his head was sent to Constantinople.\n\nAhmad Rumi, author of the F\u00e9k-ul-Ha-k\u00edk, a work written in imitation of the Masnav\u00ed of Jal\u00e1ludd\u00edn R\u00fam\u00ed.\n\nAhmad Sam\u00e1n\u00ed, (Am\u00edr) second king of the race of Sam\u00e1n\u00ed (Sam\u00e1n\u00eddes), succeeded his father Am\u00edr Ism\u00e1'il in the provinces of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, &c., in 907 A.D., 296 A.H. He was a cruel prince, and contended with his uncle, his brothers, and other relations for the extensive possessions of his father, more by intrigues at the court of Baghdad, than by arms. After a reign of seven years, he was murdered by some of his domestics on Thursday, 30th January, 914 A.D., 23rd Jum\u00e1da I, 301 A.H., and his son Amir Nasr, then only eight years of age, was placed upon the throne of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n and Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1. Ahmad was buried in Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1, and they gave him the title of Sult\u00e1n Shah\u00edd, i.e. the martyred king.\n\nAhmad Sarhind\u00ed, (Shaikh) entitled Mujaddid-i-Alf-i-S\u00e1n\u00ed, a dervish celebrated for his piety and learning, was the son of Shaikh 'Abdul-W\u00e1hid F\u00e1r\u00faki, and was born at Sarhind in A.D. 1563, 971 A.H. He was a disciple of Khw\u00e1ja B\u00e1ki, a celebrated saint of Dihl\u00ed, and is the author of several works. He died on Tuesday, 29th November 1624, the last Tuesday in the month of Safar 1034 A.H., and is buried at Sarhind. He was called \"Mujaddid-i-Alf-i-S\u00e1n\u00ed\", or the \"Renewer of the second Millennium\", because he adopted the general belief that every thousand years a man was born, who has a thorough knowledge of the Isl\u00e1m, and whose vocation it is to revive and strengthen it. He believed that he was the man of the second (\u00e9di) Millennium (aff).\n\nAhmad, Sayyid, of B\u00e1h\u00e1, brother of Sayyid Mahm\u00fad B\u00e1h\u00e1, served under Akbar in Gujrat. He was in charge of Akbar's hunting leopards. His son, Sayyid Jam\u00e1luddin, was killed by the explosion of a mine before Chitor.\n\nAhmad, Sayyid, of Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1, father of the renowned Sheikh Far\u00edd-i-Bukh\u00e1r\u00ed; vide below.\n\nAhmad Shah, entitled Mujahid-ud-d\u00edn Muhammad Abun-Nasr Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Bah\u00e1dur, was the son of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, emperor of Dihl\u00ed, whom he succeeded on the 16th April 1748, 27th Rabi' II, 1161 A.H. His mother's name was Udham B\u00e1fi. He was born in the fort of Dihl\u00ed on Tuesday, 14th December 1725, 17th Rabi' II, 1138 A.H. and crowned in P\u00e1nip\u00e1t on Monday 19th April 1748, 2nd Jum\u00e1da I, 1161 A.H. After a reign of 6 years 3 months and 8 days, he was deposed and imprisoned, and afterwards blinded, together with his mother, by his prime minister 'Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk Gh\u00e1z\u00edudd\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, on Sunday, 2nd June 1754, N.S. Afterwards, he died after three years, and died on the 1st of January 1756, from bodily disease. He was buried in the front of the mosque of K\u00e1dam-Sh\u00e1rf in Dihl\u00ed, in the mausoleum of Maryam-Mak\u00e1n\u00ed. After his imprisonment, 'Alamgr\u00ed II, son of Jah\u00e1nd\u00e1r Sh\u00e1h, was raised to the throne.\n\n[Vide Proceedings, As. Soc'y. Bengal, for 1874, p. 208.]\n\nAhmad Shah I, second king of Gujrat, was the son of T\u00e1ti\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, and grandson of Muq\u00e1s\u00edr Sh\u00e1h, whom he succeeded as king of Gujrat. The author of the Muntakhab-ut-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh states, that his grandfather placed him on the throne during his lifetime, in the year 813 H. or 1410 A.D., and that he survived that measure five months and sixteen days. In the same year, he laid the foundation of a new city on the banks of the S\u00e1barmati, which he called after his own name Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and which afterwards became the capital of the kings of Gujrat. The story of the laying out of the foundation of this city is contained in the words \"B\u00e1-kh\u00e1-kh\u00e1\", i.e. all well. He died after a reign of nearly 33 years, on the 4th July 1443 A.D., 4th Rabi' I, 847 H., and was succeeded by his son Muhammad Sh\u00e1h.\nAhmad Shah II, king of Gujrat. After the death of Mahmud Shah III, there being no relation on whom the succession might devolve, Timad Khan, the prime minister, resolved rather than see the kingdom in absolute anarchy, to elevate a youth, whom he asserted to be the son of prince Ahmad Khan, formerly governor of Ahmadabad, and declared him the legal successor to the crown of Gujrat. He was forthwith placed on the throne on the 18th February 1564 A.D., 15th Rab' 961 A.H. He reigned 7 years and some months, and was found murdered one morning at the foot of the palace wall. This event took place on Monday the 21st April 1561 A.D., 5th Sha'ban, 968 A.H. He was succeeded by Musaffar Shah III.\n\n[See Kin Translation, I, 335.]\n\nAhmad Shah Abdali, commonly called Shah Durran, was the son of a chief of the Afghan tribe of Abdal, in the vicinity of the city of Hird. He was taken prisoner in his infancy by Nadir Shah, who gave him the post of a mace-bearer, and by degrees promoted him to a considerable command in the army. The morning after the assassination of Nadir Shah, which took place in the night of the 12th May, 1747, O.S., he made an attack, supported by a corps of Usbaki, upon the Persian troops, but was repulsed. He then left the army, and proceeding by rapid marches to Kandahar, not only obtained possession of that city, but took a large convoy of treasure which was coming from Kabul and Shiah to the Persian camp. By the aid of these means, he laid the foundation of a kingdom, which soon attained a strength that rendered it formidable to the surrounding nations. He not only subdued Kandahar and Kabul, but took Peshawar and Lohor; and emboldened by this success, and the weakness of the empire, he resolved the conquest of the capital of Hindustan. In the beginning of the year 1748, 1161 A.H., he began his march from Lahore. Muhammad Shah, the emperor of Delhi, being at this time too indisposed to take the field, despatched his only son, prince Ahmad, against the enemy, under the command of the wazir Kamar-uddin Khan, Safdar-Jang, governor of Auda, and several other chiefs, with a great army. For some days several skirmishes took place between the two armies near Sarhind. At length, on Friday 11th March, 1748, 22nd Rab' I, 1161 A.H., Kamar-uddin Khan, the wazir, being killed as he was at his devotion in his tent by a cannon ball, a panic prevailed in the Mughul army; the battle, however, continued till a magazine of rockets was taken by fire in the enemy's camp, numerous of the troops were wounded by the explosion; and Shah Abdali, either disheartened by the loss, or satisfied by the plunder gained at Sarhind, thought it proper to retreat towards Kabul, which he did unmolested. In the year 1767 A.D., 1170 A.H., he again advanced as far as Delhi and Agra, and after having plundered and massacred the inhabitants of Mathura, he returned to Kandahar. About the year 1758 A.D., 1172 A.H., the Maratha power had spread itself in almost every province of Hindustan, when Najib-ud-daula, the Rohila, Shuja'-ud-daula Nawab of Audh, and not only the Musalmans but Hindus also, joined in petition to Ahmad Shah Abdali, that he would march and assume the throne of Delhi in which they promised to support him. The Abdali enraged at the seizure of Lahore by the Marathas rejoiced at the invitation, and advanced into India; delay across the Indus, and driving back the Marathas before him, he did not stop till they reached the vicinity of Delhi. He engaged the Marathas in several battles, and attained the highest renown among Muhammedans by the memorable defeat that he gave the hostile army on the plains of Panipat. This famous action was fought in January, 1761. After this victory, Durrani Shah returned to his own country, but before his departure, he acknowledged Shah Alam, then in Bengal, as emperor of Hindustan, and commanded Shuja'-ud-daula and other chiefs to submit to his authority. He died after a reign of 26 years in 1772 A.D., 1182 A.H., aged 66 years, and was succeeded by his son Timur Shah. His tomb, covered with a gilt cupola, stands near the king's palace, and is held sacred as an asylum.\n\nAhmad Shah Wali Bahmani I, (Sultan), was the second son of Sultan Daud Shah of the Bahmani race. He ascended the throne of the Dakhin on the 16th September, 1422 A.D., 6th Shawwal 826 A.H., ten days before the demise of his brother Sultan Firuz Shah, who had resigned the crown in his favor. He is the founder of the city and fort of Ahmadabad Bidar, the foundation of which he laid in the year 1432 A.D., 836 A.H. It is said that the Sultan, on his return from a war at Bidar, took to the amusement of hunting; and coming to a most beautiful spot, finely watered, resolved to build upon it a city, to be called after his name, Ahmadabad. A citadel of great extent and strength was erected on the very site of Bidar, the ancient capital of princes, who, according to tradition, lived there many years back, possessed the whole extent of Mirhat, Kanntik, and Talinjina. Raj\u00e9 Bhim Sen was one of the most celebrated of this house, and the history of the loves of his daughter and Raj\u00e9 Nal, king of Malwa, are famous through all Hindustan. Their story was translated from the Sanskrit by Shaikh Faizi, under the title of \"Nal Damana,\" into Persian verse, at the command of the emperor Akbar Shah. Ahmad Shah reigned 12 lunar years and 10 months, and died on the 19th of February 1435 A.D., 18th Rajab, 838 A.H. He was buried at Ahmadabad Bidar, and was succeeded by his son Sultan Ali-ud-din II.\n\nAhmad Shah Bahmani II, (Sultan). On the death of his father Sultan Mahmud Shah II, in October 1518 A.D., Shawwal 924 A.H., Amir Barid, his prime minister, dreading that the surrounding powers would attack him should he assume open independence, placed prince Ahmad, son of the late king, upon the throne at Ahmadabad Bidar, leaving him the palace, with the use of the royal jewels and a daily allowance of money for his support. The sum not being equal to his expenses, the king broke up the crown, which was valued at 400,000 huns, or \u00a3160,000, and privately sold the jewels. He died two years after his accession to the throne, in the year 1521 A.D., 927 A.H. After his death Amir Barid raised Sultan Ali-ud-din III, one of the princes, on the throne. Two years after, he was imprisoned, and another son of Mahmud Shah, named Wall-ullah Shah, was placed in his room. Three years after his accession, the minister conceiving a passion for his wife, he caused him to be poisoned, and espoused the queen. He then placed Kalimullah, the son of Ahmad Shah II, on the throne. This prince enjoyed the throne but for a short reign, and was never allowed to leave the palace. He was afterwards treated with great rigour by Amir Barid, whereupon he made his escape, first to his uncle Isma'il 'Adil Shah to Bijapur, and thence to Burhan Nizam Shah of Ahmadnagar, where he resided till his death. With him ended the dynasty of the Bahmani kings of the Dakhin. In fact before this event, the Dakhin was divided into five kingdoms\u2014'Adil-Shahi or kings of Bijapur; Kutb-Shahi, or kings of Golconda; 'Imad-Shahi, or kings of Barar; Nizam-Shahi or kings of Ahmadnagar; and Barid-Shahi, kings of Ahmadabad Bidar.\n\nAhmad Shah of Bengal, succeeded his father Jalal-ud-din to the throne of Bengal in 834 H. or 1430 A.D., reigned about 16 years, and died about the year 1448 A.D., 866 A.H. He was succeeded by Nasir-ud-din Mahmud Shah I, a descendant of Sham-ud-din Ilyas Shah.\n\nAhmad Shah, or Ahmad-ullah Shah, commonly called \"The Maulawi,\" a prominent character\nin the neighbourhood of Shahjah\u00e1npur and Muhammadi during the mutiny of 1857. He is said to have been the inspired Fakir who travelled through the upper provinces, a few years ago, on a miraculous mission. He made a pretty long stay at Agra, astonishing the natives and puzzling the authorities. It seems probable that he was even then busy in sowing the seeds of rebellion. He held great power within the city of Lakhnau, in March, 1858, when the Commander-in-chief entered that city and commanded a stronghold in the very heart of the city. He was slain at P\u00e1s\u00e1n, on the 16th June 1868, sixteen miles north-east of Shahjah\u00e1npur, and the raja of that place sent the head and trunk to Mr. Gilbert Money, the Commissioner.\n\nAhmad Shihab-uddin Talish, \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0634\u06cc\u062e\u0627\u0628\u200c\u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u062a\u0627\u0644\u0634, vide Shihab-uddin Ahmad Talish.\n\nAhmad Suhaili, \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0633\u0647\u06cc\u0644\u06cc, (Amir), seal-bearer to Sultan Husain Mirza of Hira, to whom several of the poets of his time dedicated their works.

He was made an eunuch in his childhood by 'Adil Shah, the nephew and immediate successor of N\u00e1dir Shah. After the death of 'Adil Shah, he obtained his release, and joined his father, who was afterwards slain by Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n Zand, king of Persia. Agh\u00e1 or Ak\u00e1 Muhammad was obliged to surrender himself to him, and was a prisoner in the city of Shir\u00e1z. He had, for some time, been very strictly guarded, and was never allowed to go beyond the walls of the town, but afterwards he was permitted to go a-hunting. When the last illness of Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n assumed a dangerous appearance, he contrived to leave that city on the usual pretext of hunting. When intelligence was brought to him that the founder of the Zand dynasty was no more, accompanied by a few attendants, he commenced his flight, and favored by the confusion of the moment, he reached his province of Mazandaran in safety, and proclaimed himself one of the competitors for the crown of Persia. Soon after the\ndeath of 'Al\u00ed Mur\u00e9d Kh\u00e1n, ruler of Persia, in 1785 A.D., he made himself master of Isfah\u00e1n without a battle, but had for several years to contend with Lutf 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, the last prince of the Zand family, before he became sole master of Persia. Lutf 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n was put to death by him in A.D. 1796, 14th Muharram, 1212 A.H. Ak\u00e1 Muhammad Kh\u00e1n was murdered on the 10th July, 1797, by two of his attendants, whom he had succeeded to death, in the 63rd year of his age.

When his father Dost Muhammad Kh\u00e1n came into possession of Kabul after the retreat of the English in 1842, he was appointed heir-apparent in preference to Muhammad Afgh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, his eldest son by his second wife. He died in 1848, when his full brother Sh\u00fal\u00edm Haid\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n was nominated heir-apparent, after whose death, in 1858, Sher 'Al\u00ed his brother, the present Amir, was nominated.\n\nAkbar, (Prince) the youngest son of the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr, was born on the 10th September, 1657, O.S., 11th Zil-hijjah, 1067 A.H., raised the standard of rebellion against his father, and joined the Maratha chief Sambhuj\u00ed in June 1681. He afterwards quitted his court, and repaired to Persia, where he died in 1706, 1118 A.H., a few months before his father, and was buried near Mashhad in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n. 'Alamg\u00edr, at one time intended to make Akbar his successor; but a difference arose between Akbar being the son of a Muhammadan mother, the daughter of Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n; whereas his brothers Sult\u00e1na Mu'azzam and Az\u00e1m were born of R\u00e1jput princesses.\n\nAkbar Shah, \u0627\u06a9\u0628\u0631 \u0634\u0627\u06c1, the Great, emperor of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, surnamed Abul-Fath Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn Muhammad, was the eldest son of the emperor Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, and was born in Amarkot in the province of Sindh on Sunday the 16th October, 1542 A.D., 6th Raj\u00e1b, 949 A.H., at a time when his father, after being defeated by Sher Sh\u00e1h, had taken refuge with R\u00e1m\u00e9 Pr\u00e1sh\u00e1d. At the time of his father's death, Akbar was at K\u00e1l\u00e1n\u00far, where he had been deputed by his father with a considerable force to expel the ex-king S\u00edkandar Sh\u00e1h S\u00far from the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk mountains. When information reached the prince of this mournful event, Bair\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, and other officers who were present, raised him to the throne on Friday, 14th February, 1556, A.D., 2nd Rab\u00ed' II, 963 A.H., Akbar being then only 13 years and 9 months old. He enlarged his dominions by the conquest of Gujrat, Bengal, Kashmir, and Sindh. Besides the forts of A't\u00e1l, Agra, and Ashhab\u00e1d, many military works were erected by him. He also built the fortified town of Fateh\u00e1ri Sikr\u00ed, which was his principal residence, and which, though now deserted, is one of the most splendid remains of former grandeur of India. He died after a prosperous reign of 61 lunar years and 9 months on Wednesday, the 16th October, 1605, Old Style, 13th Jum\u00e1da II, 1014 A.H., aged 64 lunar years and 11 months. The words \"Faut-i-Akbar Sh\u00e1h,\" (the death of Akbar Sh\u00e1h) are the chronogram of his death. He was buried in the village of Sikandra in the environs of Agra, where a splendid mausoleum was built over his remains by his son Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, which is still in a high state of preservation. He received after his death the title of \"Arsh-'Ashy\u00e1n\u00ed,\" and was succeeded by his son Sult\u00e1n Sal\u00edm, who assumed the title of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. His mother's name was Ham\u00edd\u00e1 B\u00e1n\u00fa, commonly called Maryam-Mak\u00e1n\u00ed. The history of this potentate has been written, with great elegance and precision by His Highness Ab\u00fa'l-Fath Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn, entitled the Akbar-n\u00e1m\u00e1. In order to keep his turbulent Umar\u00e1s, Turks, and Afgh\u00e1ns, in check, Hind\u00fa chiefs were encouraged by Akbar, and entrusted with the highest powers, both military and civil, as was the case with R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1ld\u00e9 of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, Bhagw\u00e1n D\u00e1gs of Amber, M\u00e1n Singh, his son, and R\u00e1j\u00e1 Todar Mal. He also connected himself and his sons with them by marriage. Both Akbar and his successor, Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, had amongst their wives several of Hind\u00fa origin. Towards the middle of his reign, Akbar became dissatisfied with the Muhammadan religion, and invited to his court teachers of the Christian, Hind\u00fa, and Parsi religions, and took an interest in their discussions. He adopted, however, neither, but attempted to found a new system or belief, called \"Din-i-Illahi,\" which acknowledged one God, and the king as his vicegerent.\n\nAkbar Shah II, \u0627\u06a9\u0628\u0631 \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u062f\u0648\u0645, king of Dihl\u00ed, whose title in full is Abul-Nasr Mu'in-udd\u00edn Muhammad Akbar Sh\u00e1h, was the son of the nominal emperor Sh\u00e1h 'Al\u00e1m; was born on Wednesday, 23rd April, 1760, New Style, 7th Ram\u00e1zan, 1173 H., and succeeded his father at the age of 48, on the 10th of November, 1806 A.D., 7th Ram\u00e1zan, 1221 H., as the real king of Dihl\u00ed. On his accession he made some weak attempts to increase his influence and power. These were properly resisted, but at the same time the pledge given by Lord Wellesley, to increase the allowance of the imperial family when the revenue of the country improved, was redeemed by an act of politic liberality. An augmentation of ten thousand rupees per mensem was appropriated for the support of his eldest son, whom he had declared heir-apparent. He sat on the throne of his ancestors nearly 32 lunar years; died on Friday, 28th September, 1837, 28th Jum\u00e1da II, 1253 A.H., aged about 80 lunar years, and was buried at Dihl\u00ed, close to the tomb of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h.

He was no sooner seated on the throne than he formed a design of excluding his brother al-M\u0101'm\u016bn from the succession. Accordingly, he deprived him of the furniture of the imperial palace of Khur\u0101s\u0101n; and in open violation of his father's will, he bestowed on al-M\u0101'm\u016bn the perpetual government of Khur\u0101s\u0101n and of all the troops in that province, he ordered these forces to march directly to Baghdad. Upon the arrival of this order, al-M\u0101'm\u016bn expostulated with the general al-Fag\u012bl Ibn R\u0101bi'a, who com-\nmanded his troops, and endeavoured to prevent his marching to Baghdad; but without effect, for he punctually obeyed the orders sent by the caliph. Al-Fazl having ingratiated himself with the caliph by his ready compliance with his orders, was chosen prime-minister, and governed with absolute sway, al-Amin abandoning himself entirely to drunkenness. Al-Fazl was a very able minister; but fearing al-Mamun's resentment, if ever he should ascend the throne, he gave al-Amin such advice as proved in the end the ruin of them both. He advised him to deprive al-Mamun of the right of succession that had been given him by his father, and transfer it to his own son Musa, though there was an infant, agreeable to this plan, surviving the khalifa; for his mother al-Kaisim from Mesopotamia, and recalled al-Mamun from Khurasan, pretending he had occasion for him as an assistant in his councils. By this ill-treatment al-Mamun was so much provoked, that he resolved to come to an open rupture with his brother. A war soon after broke out between them. Thahir ibn-Husain, the general of al-Mamun, laid siege to Baghdad, took it, and having seized al-Amin, cut off his head, and exposed it to public view in the streets of Baghdad.

Murad was soon after imprisoned by 'Alamgir, who marched to Delhi, where he caused himself to be proclaimed emperor on the 21st July of the same year, 1st Zil-kad'a, 1068 H., but was not crowned till the first anniversary of his accession, a circumstance which has introduced some confusion in the chronology of his reign. Soon after, he put Murad Bakht and his eldest brother the heir-apparent, Shah Jahan, to death. He rapidly enlarged his dominions, and became so formidable, that all Eastern princes sent ambassadors to him. He was an able prince, but a bigoted Sunn\u00ee, and attempted to force the Hind\u00fas to adopt that faith, destroying their temples, and levying the capitulation tax (jizya) from every Hind\u00fa.

Vide Muhammad Ism\u00e2'il Bukh\u00e2ri.\nAl-Dawani, *vide* Daw\u00e1n\u00ed.\n\n'Ali, \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u06cc \u0637\u0627\u0644\u0628, son of Ab\u00fa-Talib, was the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad. He was born 23 years before the Hijr\u012b, i.e., in the year 599 A.D., at the very temple itself. His mother's name was F\u00e1tima, daughter of Asad the son of Hish\u00e1m. After the death of Muhammad, he was opposed in his attempts to succeed the prophet by 'Umar and 'Umar, and retired into Arabia where his mind and energy interpretation of the Kor\u00e1n increased the number of his followers. After the death of 'Umar, the 3rd khalifa, he was acknowledged khalifa by the Egyptians and Arabians in July, 655 A.D., but in less than 5 years after, he was compelled to resign that title, and Mu'awiya was proclaimed khalifa at Damascus. 'Ali was subsequently wounded by 'Abdur-Rahm\u00e1n ibn-Muljim in a mosque at Kufa, whilst engaged in his evening prayers, on Friday, the 22nd January, 661, A.D., 17th Ram\u00e1d\u00e1n, 40 A.H., and died four days after. 'Ali after the decease of his beloved F\u00e1tima, the daughter of the prophet, claimed the privilege of polygamy, and had 18 sons and 18 daughters. The most renowned of them are the two sons of F\u00e1tima, viz., Hasan and Husain, as also Muhammad Hanif, by another wife. Among the many surnames or honorable titles bestowed upon 'Ali, are the following\u2014Wali which signifies \"legatee and heir;\" Murtagh, \"beloved by God;\" Asad-Allah, \"Gh\u00e1lib,\" \"the victorious;\" Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm of God;\" M\u00e1z\u00edr, \"lion;\" Shih M\u00e1rk\u00e1n, \"king of men;\" Sher Khud\u00e1, \"the lion of God.\" His memory is still held in the highest veneration by the Muhammedans, who say that he was the first that embraced their religion. They say, moreover, that Muhammad, talking of him, said, \"'Ali is for me and I am for him; he stands to me in the same rank as Aaron did to Moses; I am the town in which all knowledge is shut up, and he is the gate of it.\" However, these great eulogies did not hinder his name, and that of all his family, from being cursed, and their persons from being excommunicated through all the mosques of the empire of the Khalifa of the house of Umayya, from Mu'awiya down to the time of 'Umar ibn-'Abdul-'Aziz, who suppressed the solemn maledictions. There were besides several Khalifa of the house of 'Abb\u00e1s, who expressed a great aversion to 'Ali and all his posterity, such as Mu'tasim and Mutawakkil. On the other hand, the Fatimids' Khalifa of Egypt caused his name to be added to that of Muhammad in the call to prayer, (az\u00e1d) which is chanted from the turrets of the mosques. He is the first of the twelve Im\u00e1ma, eleven of whom were his descendants. Their names are as follows:\n\n1. 'Ali, the son of Ab\u00fa-Talib.\n2.

Under pretence of making his submissions to the S\u00fal\u00e1n, he engaged an interview with the Bij\u00e1pur general, Afzal Kh\u00e1n, who treacherously stabbed him in an embrace.

In his 13th year he was carried away by some robbers as he was hunting, and sold to Ibrahim, a lieutenant of the Janissaries, at Grand Cairo, who treated him with kindness. 'Ali distinguished himself against the Arabs, but when his patron was badly assassinated in 1768, by Ibrahim the Circassian, he avenged his death, and returned to Egypt with his own band. This violent measure raised him enemies, and his flight to Jerusalem and to Ptolemais or Acre with difficulty saved him from the resentment of the Ottoman Porte, that had demanded his head. Time, however, paved the way to his elevation. Those who had espoused the cause of the Circassian were sacrificed to the public safety; and 'Ali recalled by the public voice, governed the country with benevolence and equity. In a battle fought against a rebellious Mamlik to whom he had entrusted part of his army, 'Ali saw some of his troops desert, and unwilling to survive a defeat, he defended himself with the fury of a lion, till he was cut down by a sabre and carried to the conqueror's tent, where eight days after he expired of his wounds, April 21st, 1773, in his 45th year, and left behind him a character unrivalled for excellence, for courage, and magnanimity.\n\n'Ali Bae, \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u06cc, the titles by which he was known in the Muhammadan countries, were, al Amir, al-Hafim, al-Fakih, al-Sharif, al-Hajj 'Ali Bae ibn Usman Bae al-Abbas, Khadim Batulallah al-Haram, i.e. the prince, the learned, doctor of the law, of the blood of Muhammad, pilgrim, 'Ali Bae, son of Usman Bae, of the race of the Abbasides, servant of the house of God. He was master of the Arabic language, and had carefully studied the mathematical and natural branches of science and knowledge. It was in 1802 that he visited England. In June 1803 he sailed from Spain to Morocco, and travelled through Tripoli, Cyprus, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, and Turkey, and wrote a history of his travels, which was translated into English and published in London in the year 1816, entitled \"The Travels of 'Ali Bae.\" In his visit to the Isle of Cyprus he surveyed some curious remains of antiquity that have been usually overlooked. Having been admitted in his character of a Muhammadan prince to keep the interior of the Ka'ba at Mecca, the most sacred office that a Musulman can perform, and to visit it repeatedly, he has given, from personal inspection a more minute and exact account of the temple of Mecca than other travellers could lay before the public. His notice of the venerated mountain beyond Mecca, the last and principal object of the pilgrimage to that city, and his description of the interior of the Temple of Jerusalem, which no Christian is permitted to enter, is said to contain much new information.\n\n'Ali Bahadur, \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0628\u0631, Nawab of Banda, eldest son of Shamsher Bahadur I, and grandson of the Maratha chief Raj Rao Peshwa I.

He reigned about 11 or 12 years, and as at the time of his death, which happened in 1801 or 1802 A.D., his eldest son Shamsher Bahadur II was absent at Puna, his youngest son Zulfiqar Ali was proclaimed (in violation of the title of his eldest brother) as his successor by his uncle Ghani Bahadur and his Diwan Himmat Bahadur Goshain. Ghani Bahadur, however, was soon after expelled by Shamsher Bahadur who took possession of the raja.\n\n'Ali Bahadur Khan, \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0646, the last Nawab of Banda and son of Zulfiqar Ali Khan Bahadur.

He rose in the Turkish court, and was appointed interpreter to the Grand Signior, and translated the Bible and the English Calendar into the Turkish language. His great work is on the history of the Turks, their pilgrimages to Mecca, and other religious ceremonies, translated into Latin by Dr. Smith. He died 1676 A.D.\n\n'Ali bin al-Husain al-Masa'udi al-Hudaili, \u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u06cc \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646, the far-famed author of the Marjiz-uz-Zahab, and who has been, with some justice, termed the Herodotus of the East, was also a writer on the Shia traditions. He died in 957 A.D., 346 A.H.\n'Ali Boya or Ali ibn Boya, entitled Imad-ud-daula, the first of a race of kings of Fars and 'Irak. The flatterers of this family, which is called Dilami or Dila'ma (from the name of their native village, Dila'm) and Boya or Burjani (from the name of one of their ancestors, Burjani Boya), trace their descent to the ancient kings of Persia; but the first of this race that history notices was a fisherman of Dila'm whose name was Boya. His eldest son, 'Ali Boya, was employed by a governor of his native country named Murawij, and was in the command of the chief part of his army, with which he encountered and defeated Yakut, the governor of Isfahan, and by the immense plunder that he obtained from that victory, he became at once a leader of reputation and of power. He pursued Yakut into Fars, defeated him again, and took possession of the whole of that province as well as those of Kirman, Khuzistan and 'Irak in 933 A.D., 321 A.H. This chief was afterwards tempted, by the weak and distracted state of the Khilafat or Caliphate, to a still higher enterprise: accompanied by his two brothers, Hasan and Ahmad, he marched to Baghdad. The Khalif al-Razi Bilah fled, but 'Ali Boya refused to retreat until his first act was to heap honours on those who had taken possession of his capital. 'Ali Boya, on agreeing to pay annually 600,000 dinars of gold, was appointed viceroy of Fars and 'Irak, with the rank of Amir-ul-Umra, and the title of Imad-ud-daula. His younger brother Ahmad, received the title of Maiz-ud-daula, and was nominated wazir to the khalif. Hasan, who was his second brother, received the title of Rukn-ud-daula, and acted, during the life of Ali Boya, under that chief. Ali Boya fixed his residence at Shiraz, and died on Sunday the 11th November, 949 A.D., 16th Jamad I, 338 H., much regretted by his soldiers and subjects.

He was received with great honour, was created Amir-ul-Umra, and was at different times, made governor of Kashmir and Kabul, and employed in various wars and other duties. He excited universal admiration at the court by the skill and judgment of his public works, of which the canal which bears his name at Delhi still affords a proof, and the taste and elegance he displayed on all occasions of show and festivity. He died on his way to Kashmir, where he was going for change of air, on the 16th of April, 1657 A.D., O.S., 12th Rajab, 1067 A.H., and was buried at Lahore in the mausoleum of his mother.

To the enclosure wherein his tomb is raised, the Persians give the name of \"Rauzat Risavi,\" or the garden of Raza, and esteem it the most sacred spot in all Persia. The chief ornament and support of Mashhad is this festival to which thousands of pious pilgrims annually resort, and which had been once greatly enriched by the bounty of sovereigns. Nasir-ud-din Mirza, the son of Nadir Shah carried away the golden railing that surrounded the tomb, and Nadir Mirza son of Shah-rokh Mirza and grandson of Nadir Shah, took down the great golden ball which ornamented the top of the\ndome over the grave, and which was said to weigh 60 maunds or 420 pounds. The carpets fringed with gold, the golden lamps, and everything valuable were plundered by these necessitous and rapacious princes. Ali Mas\u00fa Ras\u00e1 was poisoned by the khalif\u00e1 al-M\u00e1mm\u00fan, consequently is called a martyr.\n\n'Ali Muhammad Khan, \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646, founder of the Rohila government. It is mentioned in Forster's Travels, that in the year 1720 A.D., Basharat Kh\u00e1n and D\u00e1d\u00fa Kh\u00e1n, of the tribe of Rohilas, accompanied by a small number of their adventurous countrymen came into Hindust\u00e1n in quest of liberty. They were at first entertained by Madan Sh\u00e1h, a Hind\u00fa chief of Serw\u00e1n\u00ed (a small town in the north-west quarter of Rohilkhand) who by robbery and predatory excursions maintained a large party of banditti. In the plunder of an adjacent village, D\u00e1d\u00fa Kh\u00e1n captured a youth of the J\u00e9b sect, whom he adopted and brought up in the Muhammedan faith, by the name of 'Ali Muhammad, and distinguished this boy by pre-eminent marks of paternal affection. Some years after, the Rohilas quarrelling with Madan Sh\u00e1h, retired from his country, and associating themselves with Ch\u00e1nd Kh\u00e1n the chief of Barelli, they jointly entered into the service of Asmat Kh\u00e1n, the governor of Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d. After the death of D\u00e1d\u00fa Kh\u00e1n, who was slain by the mountaineers in one of his excursions, the Rohila party in a short space of time seized on the districts of Madan Sh\u00e1h and 'Ali Muhammad Kh\u00e1n was declared chief of them. From the beginning of the reign of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, he possessed himself of the district of Katir (now called from the residence of the Rohilas, Rohilkhand) and assumed independence of the royal authority. He was besieged in March, 1745 A.D., Safar 1158 A.H., in a fortress called Bankar and 'Aoul\u00e1 and taken prisoner, but was released after some time, and a j\u00e1gir conferred on him. The emperor Muhammad Sh\u00e1h died in April 1748, A.D. 1161 A.H. and 'Ali Muhammad Kh\u00e1n some time after him in the same year at 'Aoul\u00e1, which he had ornamented with numerous public and private edifices. He left four sons, viz., Sa'd-ull\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n, Abdullah Kh\u00e1n, Faiz-ull\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n and Dunde Kh\u00e1n.

He succeeded to the throne after the death of S\u00e1d\u00ed Kh\u00e1n in March, 1781 A.D., and assumed the title of wak\u00edl. He reigned over Persia five years and was independent of the government two years prior to this period. Persia during this time, enjoyed a certain degree of peace. He continued to confine his rival 'Ak\u00e1 Muhammad Kh\u00e1n to the province of M\u00e1sin dar\u00e1n.

For some time he was in disgrace with his patron and changed his Takhallus or poetical name from Nawedi to N\u00e1-um\u00e1idi (or hopeless).

He flourished in the reign of Sh\u00e1h-r\u00fakh Mirz\u00e1, and found a patron in his son Muham mad Jog\u00ed, in whose praise he wrote several panegyrics. He was co-temporary with the poet Az\u00far, who died A.D. 1462, 866 A.H.\n\n'Alisher, \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0634\u06cc\u0631, (Am\u00edr) surnamed Niz\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn, was the prime minister of the Sult\u00e1n Husain Mirz\u00e1 ruler of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n. He sprang from an illustrious family of the Jaght\u00e1f or Chaght\u00e1f tribe. His father Gajk\u00edna Bah\u00e9dur, held one of the principal offices of government during the reign of Sult\u00e1n \u00c1bd\u00fal K\u00e1s\u00edm B\u00e1b\u00e1r Bah\u00e9dur, a descendant of Am\u00edr Taim\u00edr. His grandfather, by his mother's side, was one of the principal Am\u00edrs of Sult\u00e1n B\u00e1ikara Mirz\u00e1, the grandfather of Sult\u00e1n Husain Mirz\u00e1. Alisher attached himself originally to Sult\u00e1n \u00c1bd\u00fal K\u00e1s\u00edm B\u00e1b\u00e1r Mirz\u00e1, who was greatly attached to him, and called him his son. After his death he retired to Mash-had and continued his studies there; which place he subsequently quitted for Samarqand, on account of the disturbances which broke out in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and applied himself diligently to the acquirement of knowledge in the college of Kl\u00edw\u00e1ja Fazl-ud-d\u00edn. When Sult\u00e1n Husain Mirz\u00e1 became monarch, the whole of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n was given to Sult\u00e1n Ahmad Mirz\u00e1, at that time ruler of the countries beyond the Oruz, to send 'Alisher to him. On his arrival, he was received with the greatest distinction, and raised to the highest posts of honor. 'Alisher's palace was open to all men of learning: and notwithstanding that the reins of government were placed in his hands, in the midst of the weightiest affairs, he neglected no opportunity of improving both himself and others in the pursuit of knowledge. He was not only honored by his own Sult\u00e1n and his officers, but foreign princes also esteemed and respected him. After being employed in the capacity of d\u00edv\u00e1n and prime minister for some time, love of study induced him to resign, and bidding a final adieu to public life, he passed the remainder of his days in composing Turkish and Persian works, of which S\u00e1m Mirz\u00e1 recounts the names of no less than twenty-one. Daulat Both the biographer, Mirkhund and his son Kh\u00e1nmirz\u00e1, the poets who dedicated their works to him, and amongst other men of genius who were cherished by his liberality, may be mentioned the celebrated poet J\u00e1m\u00ed. His collection of Odes in the Chaght\u00e1f or pure Turkish dialect, which he wrote under the poetical name of Naw\u00e1i, amounts to 10,000 compleats, and his parody of Niz\u00e1m's five poems, containing nearly 30,000 compleats, is universally admired by the cultivators of Turkish poetry, in which he is considered to be without a rival. In the Persian language also he wrote a collection of Odes, under the poetical name of F\u00e1n\u00ed or Fan\u00e1i, consisting of 6,000 distiches. 'Alisher was born in the year 1440 A.D., 844 A.H., and died on Sunday the 6th of December, 1500 A.D., 15th Jam\u00e1d I, 908 A.H., five years before his royal friend and master Sult\u00e1n Husain Mirz\u00e1. Kh\u00fandam\u00edr has recorded the year of his death in an affectionate chronogram: \"His highness the Amir, the asylum or divine garden, in which all the marks of mercy were conspicuous, has quitted the thorny brake of the world, and fled to the rose-garden of pity.\" Since the\n'Ali Tabar, (Prince) was the son of prince 'Azim Shah, and grandson of the emperor 'Alamgir.

There is a heroic ballad sung or recited by the Hind\u00fa sepoys in a kind of monotonous, but not unmusical sort of chant, accompanied by a sotto voce beat of the dh\u00f3li, which rise to a constrepito in the pause between the verses. Whoever has resided in a military cantonment must have frequently observed the sepoys, when disengaged from military duty, collected in small knots, listening to one of the party reciting some poem or tale to a deeply interested audience. The subject of this lay is the prowess of 'Alha', the raja of Mahoba, a town in Bundelkhand, of which extensive ruins remain. The hero is described as the terror of the Muhammadans; his triumphs over whom are attributed not only to his own valour, but the favor of the goddess Kali, whom he had propitiated by the offering of his life. There are many songs, it is said, of this prince, and his brother Udal, a warrior of equal estimation; but they are preserved only traditionally by the Pow\u00e1rs, and their amateur students. The verses are in Bhakha.\n\nAl-Hadi, the fourth khalif of the house of 'Abb\u00e1s succeeded his father al-Mahdi on the 4th of August, 785 A.D., 23rd Muharram, 169 H., to the throne of Baghdad. He reigned one year and one month, and having formed a design to deprive his younger brother Harun-al-Rashid of his right of succession and even to assassinate him, was poisoned by his prime minister about the month of September, 786 A.D., Rab\u00ed I, 170 A.H. On his death his brother the celebrated Harun-al-Rashid ascended the throne.\n\nAl-Hakm, also called ibn Abd\u00fcll Hakim, an Arabian author who (according to the chronological arrangement of the Arab authorities by Howard Vyse and Dr. Sprenger, in the former's second volume of 'The Pyramids of Gizeh') lived about 1450 A.D., or six hundred years after the death of the khalif al-Mam\u00fcn of Baghdad, but by a manuscript note recorded by a gentleman of the British Museum, (1868) it appears that al-Hakm was nearly contemporary with that prince who flourished between 813 and 842 A.D. Al-Hakm writes that the Great Pyramid in Egypt was built by a certain antediluvian patriarch, and filled by him chiefly with celestial spheres and figures of the stars; together with the perfumes used in their worship; and that khalif al-Mam\u00fcn found the body of a man deposited, with jewels, arms, and golden writing, in the coffin when he broke into the king's chamber of the Great Pyramid. But neither Ab\u00fa M\u00fas\u00e1har J\u00e1far bin Muhammad Balkhi, who wrote in about 890 A.D. nor ibn Khurdalbeh, in 920 A.D. have one word about al-Mam\u00fcn, or any opening of the pyramid. But when we descend to Mas\u00e1udi, in 967 A.D. he, after an astonishing amount of romancing on what took place at the building of the pyramids 300 years before the Flood\u2014mentions that, not al-Mam\u00fcn, but his father, Khalifa Harun-al-Rashid, attempted to break into the Great Pyramid; and after penetrating 20 cubits, found a vessel containing 100 coins of the finest gold, each of which came out in weight and making a sum, which exactly repaid the cost of his operations; at which, it is added, he greatly wondered. About the year 1170 A.D. or 340 years after al-Mam\u00fcn's age, that prince is mentioned by Ab\u00fa Abdur Rah\u00edm Muhammed bin Abdur Rah\u00edm Alkaisi, who states that he was informed that those who went into the upper parts of the Great Pyramid in the time of al-Mam\u00fcn, came to a small passage, containing the image of a man in green stone, and within that a human body with golden armour &c. &c.\n\nAl-Hasan, an Arabian who wrote on optics, about the year 1100 A.D.\n\nAlif bin Nur Kashani, author of another \"Matla-ul-Anw\u00e1r\", besides the one of the same name written by Mull\u00e1 Hussain Waez.

From the accession of al-Mahdi to the year 781 A.D., 164 A.H., the most remarkable event was the rebellion of al-Makna (or al-Makanna) which see. All this time was had been carried on by the Greeks, but without any remarkable success on either side. But after the suppression of the rebellion of al-Makna, the khalifa ordered his son Har\u016bn-al-Rashid to penetrate into the Greek territories with an army of 95,000 men. Har\u016bn, then, having entered the dominions of the empress Irane, defeated one of her commanders that advanced against him; after which he laid waste several of the imperial provinces with fire and sword, and even threatened the city of Constantinople itself. By this the empress was so terrified, that she purchased a peace with the khalifa by paying him an annual tribute of 70,000 pieces of gold, which for the present at least, delivered her from the depredations of these barbarians. After the signing of this treaty Har\u016bn returned home laden with spoils and glory. This year (i.e. the 164th year of the Hijr\u012b or 81 A.D.), according to some of the oriental historians, the sun one day a little after rising, totally lost his light in a moment without being eclipsed, when neither any fog nor any cloud of dust appeared to obscure him. This frightful darkness continued till noon, to the great astonishment of the people settled in the countries where it happened. Al-Mahdi was poisoned, though undesignedly, by one of his concubines, named Hasana. She had designed to destroy one of her rivals whom she imagined to have too great an ascendancy over the khalifa, by giving her a poisoned pear. This the latter, not suspecting anything, gave to the khalifa; who had no sooner eaten it than he felt himself in exquisite torture, and soon after expired. This event took place on the eve of Thursday the 4th of August, 786 A.D., 23rd Mu\u1e25arram, 169 H. In a village called Ar R\u0101d in the dependencies of M\u0101s\u0101bd\u0101n. He was succeeded by his eldest son al-H\u0101d\u012b.\n\nAl-Mahdi, \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0647\u0652\u062f\u0650\u064a, a khalifa of Barbary, vide Obeid-ullah al-Mahdi and Muhammad al-Mahdi.\n\nAl-Makna, or al-Makanna, \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u0629, a famous impostor of Khur\u0101s\u0101n who lived in the reign of al-Mahdi the khalifa of Baghdad. His true name was H\u0101kam ibn H\u0101sham, and had been an under secretary to Abu Muslim governor of that province. He afterwards turned soldier, and passed thence into M\u0101warun-nahr, where he gave himself out as a prophet. The name of al-Makna, as well as that of al-Burq\u0101l, that is the veiled, was received from his custom of covering his face with a veil or little mask, to conceal his deformity; he having lost an eye in the wars, and being otherwise of a despicable appearance, and a stutterer; though his followers pretended he did this for the same reason that Moses did, viz., lest the splendor of his countenance should dazzle the eyes of his beholders. In some places he made a great many proselytes, deluding the people with a number of juggling tricks which they swallowed as miracles, and particularly by causing the appearance of a moon to rise out of a well for many nights together; whence he was also called in the Persian tongue, S\u0101zinda Mah, or the Moon-maker. This wretch, not content with being reckoned a prophet, arrogated to himself divine honors; pretending that the Deity resided in his person. He had first, he said, assumed the body of Adam, then that of Noah and subsequently that of many others, and so on. The last human form he pretended to have adopted was that of Abu Muslim, the prince of Khur\u0101s\u0101n, from whom it proceeded to him. At last this impostor raised an open rebellion against the khalifa, and made himself master of several fortified places in Khur\u0101s\u0101n, so that al-Mahdi was obliged to send one of his generals with an army against him about the year 780 A.D., 163 H. Upon the approach of the khalifa's troops, al-Makna retired into one of his strong fortresses which he had well provided for a siege. But being closely besieged by the khalifa's forces, and seeing no possibility of escaping, he gave poison in wine to his whole family and all that were with him in the castle; when they were dead, he burnt their bodies, together with all their furniture, provisions, and cattle; and lastly he threw himself into the flames. He had promised his followers, that his soul should transmigrate into the form of an old man riding on a greyish coloured horse, and that after so many years he would return and give them the earth for their possession; which ridiculous expectation kept the sect in being for several years. English readers will remember the use made of this story by the author of Lalla Rookh.\n\nAl-Mamun, \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0646, surnamed 'Abdull\u0101h, was the seventh khalifa of the race of the Abbasides, and the second son of H\u0101r\u016bn-al-Rashid. He was proclaimed khalifa at Baghdad on the 8th October, 813 A.D., 6th Safar, 198 A.H., the day on which his brother al-Mans\u016br was assassinated. He conferred the government of Khur\u0101s\u0101n upon T\u0101hir ibn Husein his general, and his descendants with almost absolute and unlimited power. This happened in the year 820 A.D., 206 A.H., from which time we may date the dismemberment of that province from the empire of the khalifa. During the reign of this khalifa nothing remarkable happened; only the African Molesms invaded the island of Sicily, where they made themselves master of several places. Al-Mam\u016bn conquered part of Crete, had the best Greek writers translated into Arabic, and compiled a collection of the best authors. He also calculated a set of astronomical tables and founded an academy at Baghdad. In Khur\u0101s\u0101n he visited T\u0101s, at that time the capital of the kingdom, his place of residence. Under his patronage Khur\u0101s\u0101n became the resort of learned men; and the city of T\u0101s, the great rival of Baghdad. He died of a surfeit on the 18th of August, 833 A.D., 17th Rajab 218 A.H., after a reign of 20 years and some months in Asia Minor, aged 48 years, and was buried at Tarsus a city on the frontiers.\nof Asia Minor. His wife named B\u00far\u00e1n, daughter of Hasan ibn Sahl his prime minister, outlived him 50 years, and died on Tuesday the 22nd September, 884 A.D., 27th Rab\u00ed I., 271 A.H., aged 80 years. Al-M\u00e1mm\u00edn was succeeded by his brother al-Mo'tasim Billah.\n\nAl-Mansur, the second khalifa of Barbary of the Fatimites race, surnamed Isma'il, surnamed Al-Mansur.\n\nAl-Mansur, whose former name was Ab\u00fa Ja'far, was called al-Mans\u00far, the victorious, by his overcomers his enemies. He was the second khalifa of the noble house of Banu Abb\u00e1s or Abbasites, and succeeded to the throne of Baghdad after the death of his brother Ab\u00fa Abb\u00e1s surnamed al-Saffah, in 764 A.D., 136 A.H. He was opposed by his uncle, 'Abdull\u00e1h son of Ali, who caused himself to be proclaimed khalifa at Damascus, but was defeated by al-Mans\u00far's general, Ab\u00fa Muslim. He laid the foundation of the city of Baghdad on the banks of the Tigris in 762 A.D. and finished it four years after. He was a prince of extraordinary talent and taste, and an ardent lover of science and literature. He got the Pahlawi copy of Pilpay's Fables translated into Arabic. In the year 776 A.D., 168 A.H., the khalifa set out from Baghdad in order to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca; but being taken ill on the road he expired at his Maim\u00f3n, whence his body was carried to Mecca, where, after 100 years had been sung that his sepulchre might be concealed, he was interred, having lived, according to some 63, according to others 68 years, and reigned 22 lunar years. He is said to have been extremely covetous, and to have left in his treasury 600,000,000 dirhams, and 24,000,000 dinars. He is reported to have paid his cook by assigning him the heads and legs of the animals dressed in his kitchen, and to have obliged him to procure at his own expense all the fuel and vessels he had occasion for. He was succeeded by his son al-Mahd\u00ed. A Christian physician, named Bacth\u00e1us, was very eminent at the court of al-Mans\u00far, who understanding that he had an old infirm woman for his wife, sent him three beautiful Greek girls and 3,000 dinars as a present. Bacth\u00e1us sent back the girls and told the khalifa that his religion prohibited his having more than one wife at a time; which pleased the khalifa so much, that he loaded him with presents, and permitted him, at his earnest request, to return to his own country of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n.\n\nAl-Mo'tamid Billah, the fifteenth khalifa of the house of Abb\u00e1s, was the son of al-Mutawakkil Billah. He was raised to the throne of Baghdad by the Turks after the murder of al-Mu'tadid in 870 A.D., 266 A.H. This year the prince of the Zanj\u00e1ns, Al\u00ed or al-H\u00e1dh\u00ed, made incursions to the very gates of Baghdad, doing prodigious mischief wherever he passed. In the year 874 A.D., Ya'k\u00fab-bin-Lys having taken Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n from the descendants of T\u00e1hir, attacked and defeated Muhammad ibn W\u00e1d\u00ed (who had killed the khalifa's governor of Fara, and afterwards made himself master of that province) seizing on his palace, where he found a sum of money amounting to 40,000,000 dirhams. In the year 879 A.D., 265 A.H., Ahmad ibn T\u00fal\u00e1n rebelled against the khalifa and set up for himself in Egypt. There were now four independent powers in the Moslem dominions, besides the house of Umyya in Spain; viz. The African Moslems, or Aghlabites, who had had for a long time access to the standard; Ahmad ibn T\u00fal\u00e1n in Egypt; Ya'k\u00fab bin Lys in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and al-H\u00e1dh\u00ed in Arabia and Ir\u00e1k. In the year 883 A.D., 270 A.H., al-H\u00e1dh\u00ed was defeated and slain by al-Mu'tawakkil, the khalifa's brother and coadjutor, who ordered his head to be cut off, and carried through a great part of that region which he had so long disturbed. In the year 891 A.D., 278 A.H., the Karmatians first made their appearance in the Moslem empire, and gave almost continual disturbance to the khalifas and their subjects. Al-Mo'tamid reigned 22 lunar years 11 months and some days, and died in the year 892 A.D., 279 A.H. He was succeeded by his nephew al-Mo'tasim Billah the son of al-Mu'tawakkil.\n\nAl-Mo'tasim Billah, the fourth son of H\u00e1rf\u00fan-al-Rash\u00edd, and the eighth khalifa of the house of Abb\u00e1s. He succeeded to the throne by virtue of his brother al-M\u00e1mm\u00edn's express nomination of him to the exclusion of his own son al-Abb\u00e1s, and his other brother al-M\u00e1mm\u00edn, who had been assassinated by al-Mu'tawakkil. In the beginning of his reign 893 A.D., 218 A.H., he was obliged to employ the whole forces of his empire against one B\u00e1bak, who had been for a considerable time in rebellion in Persia and Persian Ir\u00e1k, and had taken upon himself the title of a prophet. He was however, defeated and slain. In the year 898 A.D., 223 A.H., the Greek emperor Theophilus invaded the khalifa's territories, where he behaved with the greatest cruelty, and by destroying Sozopeta the place of al-Mo'tasim's nativity, notwithstanding his earnest entreaties to the contrary, occasioned the terrible distinction of Amorium. He is said to have been so robust, that he once carried a burden of 1,000 pounds weight several paces. As the people of Baghdad disturbed him with frequent revolts and commotions, he took the resolution to abandon that city, and build another for his own residence. The new city he built was first called S\u00e1m\u00e1, and afterwards Sam\u00e1ra, (for that which gives pleasure at first sight) and stood on the Arabian Ir\u00e1k. He was attached to the opinion of the Materialists who maintain the creation of the Kor\u00e1n; and both he and his predecessor cruelly persecuted those who believed it to be eternal. Al-Mo'tasim died on Thursday the 5th January, 842 A.D., 18th Rabi I., 227 H. He reigned 8 years 8 months and 8 days, was born in the 8th month (Shaban) of the year, was the 8th khalifa of the house of Abb\u00e1s, ascended the throne in the 218th year of the Hijri, died on the 18th of Rabi I., lived 48 years, fought 8 battles, built 8 palaces, begat 8 sons and 8 daughters, had 8,000 slaves, and had 8,000,000 dinars, and 80,000 dirhams in his treasury at his death, whence the oriental historians gave him the name of al-Musamman, or the Octonary. He was the first khalifa that added to his name the title of Billah, equivalent to the Dei Gratia of Christian sovereigns. He was succeeded by his son al-W\u00e1thik or W\u00e1lik Billah.\n\nAl-Mo'tasim Billah, the son of al-Mu'tawakkil Billah, was the sixteenth khalifa of the race of Abb\u00e1s. He came to the throne of Baghdad after the death of his uncle al-Mo'tamid Billah in 892 A.D., 279 A.H. In the first year of his reign he demanded in marriage the daughter of Khamarw\u00e1la Sulh\u00e1 or khalifa of Egypt, the son of Ahmad ibn T\u00fal\u00e1n; which was agreed to by him with the utmost joy, and their nuptials were solemnized with great pomp in the year 895 A.D., 282 A.H. He carried on a war with the Karmatians, but very unsuccessfully, his forces being defeated with great slaughter, and his general Ab\u00fa Abb\u00e1s taken prisoner. The khalifa some time after his marriage granted to H\u00e1rf\u00fan, son of Khamaraw\u00e1la, the perpetual prefecture of Aw\u00e1sam and Kinissirin, which he annexed to that of Egypt and Syria, upon condition that he paid him an annual tribute of 45,000 dinars. He reigned 9 years 8 months and 26 days, and died in 903 A.D., 289 A.H. His son al-Mukaff\u00ed Billah succeeded him.\n\nAl-Mughira, the son of Sayyid and governor of K\u00fafa in the time of Mu'\u00e1wa the first khalifa of the house of Umyya. He was an active man, and of very good parts; he had lost one of his eyes at the battle of Yemnouk, though some say that it was with looking at an eclipse. By the followers of Ali he was accounted to be of the wrong party, and one of the chief of them. For thus they reckon there are five elders on Ali's side: Muhammad, Ali, F\u00e1tima, Hasan and Husain; and to these are opposed, Ab\u00fa Bakr, 'Umar, Mu\u00e1wa, Amr\u00fa and al-\nAl-Muhtadi, the fourteenth khalif of the Abbasids, was the son of one of al-Wathiq's concubines named Kurb, who is supposed by some to have been a Christian. Al-Muhtadi was raised to the throne of Baghdad after the dethronement of al-Mutawil's Billah in 869 A.D., 255 A.H. The beginning of his reign is remarkable for the irruption of the Zanjians, people of Nubia, Ethiopia and the country of Caffra, into Arabia, where they penetrated into the neighbourhood of Basra and Kufa. The chief of this gang of robbers was Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman. He came to al-Hidjaz and gave himself out to be the son of the first Abbasi. This made such an impression upon the Shias in those parts that they flocked to him in great numbers; which enabled him to seize upon the cities of Basra and Ramla, and even to pass the Tigris at the head of a formidable army. In the year 870 A.D., 256 A.H., al-Muhtadi was barbarously murdered by the Turks who had raised him to the throne. He reigned only eleven months and was succeeded by al-Mustamid.\n\nAl-Mukhtar, a celebrated Muhammedan chief who had beaten all the generals of the khalifa Yazid, Marwan, and Abdul Malik, and had made himself sole master of Babylonian Iraq, whereas Kufa was the capital. He persecuted all those he could lay his hands on, who were not of Husain's party; he never pardoned any one of those who had declared themselves enemies to the family of the Prophet; nor those who, by his belief, had dipped their hands in Husain's blood or that of his relations. He sent an army against Ubeide-ullah the son of Yazid, who was sent by the khalifa Abdul Malik towards Kufa with leave to plunder it for three days, and slew him in battle in August, 686 A.D., Muharram, 67 A.H. Al-Mukhtar was killed at Kufa in a battle fought with Misasib the brother of Abdullah the son of Zuber, governor of Basra, in the month of April, 687 A.D., Ramzan, 67 A.H., in the 67th year of his age. It is said that he killed nearly 50,000 men.\n\nAl-Muktafi Billah, surnamed Abul Kasim Abd-ullah, the son of Muhammad, and grandson of al-Kamil Billah, was raised to the throne of Baghdad after the death of his grandfather in 1076 A.D., 460 A.H., by order of Sultan Malikshah Seljuk who was then caliph-master of the empire. He was the 27th khalif of the race of Abbasids, reigning 19 lunar years and 5 months and died in 1094 A.D., 487 A.H. His death induced Barakayrak the Seljuk, the reigning Sultan of Persia, whose brother Mahmud had died about the same period, to go to Baghdad, where he confirmed al-Mustasim the son of the late khalifa as his successor, and was himself hailed by the new lord of the faithful, as Sultan of the empire.\n\nAl-Muktafi Billah, the eighteenth khalif of the house of Abbas, was the son of al-Mustamid Billah. He succeeded his brother al-Muktafi to the throne of Baghdad in 908 A.D., 296 A.H. He reigned 24 lunar years 2 months and 7 days, and was murdered by a eunuch on the 26th October, 932 A.D., 2nd Shawwal, 320 H. He was succeeded by his brother al-Kahir Billah.\n\nAl-Mustasim Billah, the seventeenth khalif of the house of Abbas who reigned in Baghdad. He succeeded his father al-Mustamid Billah in 902 A.D., 289 A.H., and proved a warlike and successful prince. He gained several advantages over the Carmatians, but was not able to reduce them. The Turks, however, having invaded the province of Mawarunnahr, were defeated with great slaughter; after which al-Muktafi carried on a successful war against the Greeks, from whom he took Seleucia. After this he invaded Syria and Egypt, which provinces he recovered from the house of Ahmad ibn Tulun in 906 A.D., 292 A.H.; he then renewed the war with success against the Greeks and Carmatians. Al-Muktafi died in 908 A.D., 295 A.H., after a reign of about six years and a half. He was the last of the khalifs who made any figure by their warlike exploits. His successors al-Muktafi, al-Kahir and al-Razi, were so distressed by the Carmatians and numberless usurpers who were every day starting up, that by the 326th year of the Hijri 937 A.D., they had nothing left but the city of Baghdad.\n\nAl-Muktafi Bi-amir-illah, the son of al-Mustasim was the 31st khalif of the house of Abbas. He succeeded his nephew al-Rashid in A.D. 1136, 580 A.H., reigned about 24 lunar years and died in 1160 A.D., 565 A.H., leaving his kingdom to his son al-Mustanjad.\n\nAl-Mustasim Billah, the sixth Fatimite khalif succeeded his father al-Mustanjar Billah in the government of Egypt and Syria. During his reign, the power of that dynasty was impaired, and its authority weakened, their political influence having ceased in most of the Syrian cities, and the provinces of that country having fallen into the possessions of the Turkmans on one hand, and the Franks on the other. This people (the Crusaders) entered Syria and encamped before Antioch in the month of October, 1097 A.D., 21st Jada 490 A.H.; they obtained possession of it on the 20th June, 1098, 16th Rajab, 491 A.H.; the following year they took Maristan Nomad, and in the month of July, 1099, Sha'ban, 492 A.H., they became masters of Jerusalem, after a siege of more than 40 days. This city was taken on a Friday morning; during the ensuing week, a great multitude of Moelams perished, and upwards of 70,000 were slain in the Masjid al-Aksa (or mosque of Umar) \u2014\u2014 al-Mustanjar was born at Cairo on the 24th August, 1076, 20th Muharram, 469 A.H., proclaimed khalif on Thursday the 28th of December, 1094, 18th Zil-hijja 487 A.H., and died in Egypt on the 10th December, 1101 A.D., 16th Safar, 496 A.H. His son Amar bi Akhdam-ullah Abul Ali Mansur succeeded him.\n\nAl-Mustasim Billah, surnamed Abul Ahmad Abdul-karim, was the thirty-seventh and last khalif of the race of Abbas. He succeeded his father al-Mustanjar to the throne of Baghdad in 1142 A.D., 640 A.H. In his time Halak Kh\u00e1n, Tartar, enemy of the Mughals and grandson of the great conqueror Changiz Khan, besieged Baghdad for two months, and having taken that place, seized al-Mustasim and his four sons whom he put to a most cruel death with 800,000 of its inhabitants. Halak Khan was very desirous of seizing upon Baghdad, and of adding the whole kingdom of Mesopotamia to his already vast and numerous conquests; but, partly on account of his own scruples, and partly from fear of offending the prejudices of his Sunni followers, who were all of the same faith with the khalifa, he refrained for a time from entering the sacred dominion of one who was considered as the head of their holy religion, and the true representative of their beloved prophet. But the glorious days of the house of Bani Abbas had already been numbered, the effeminate Mustasim had personal vices enough to lead and excuse the final extinction of his race! Ibn al-Kama, his prime minister (who hated him more than any other of his oppressed subjects) from within, and Nasiruddin Tusi, the preceptor of the Mughal prince (who owed him an old grudge) from without, urged the conqueror to the gates of Baghdad. Nasiruddin had a few years before been at Baghdad, seeking shelter from persecution, when he was introduced to Mustasim. The latter asked him to what country he belonged? \"Tus,\"\nplease your holiness\", answered Nasir-uddin. \"Art thou of the asses, or of the oxen of Tus?\" said the khalif (meaning the two principal branches of the Shia faith\u2014Akhbaris and Usulis). Mortified as the illustrious refugee was at this inadmissible insult, he still submissively answered: \"Of the oxen of Tus, oh illustrious khalif!\" \"Where, then, are thy horns?\", said the insolent buffoon. \"I have them not with me\", replied Nasir-uddin; \"but, if your holiness permit, I will go and fetch them.\" \"Make haste, hence, then, thou deformed animal\", said the khalif, \"and never again appear in my presence in so imperfect a state!\" Nasir-uddin kept his promise well, for, at the moment when Baghdad was on the point of being surrendered, and the khalif driven to the last extremity, he sent him a message to the effect that the ox of Tus was at the gate with his horns, and inquiring, when it would please his holiness to receive him? Nasir-uddin had in the city another old offender, whom he was anxious also to chastise. This was Ibn Hajib, also one of the khalif's ministers, and a person of great reputation for his learning; but being an Arabian Sunni, and a very bigoted one too, he had behaved still more cruelly than his master to the Persians. Recognising him, he stood up at Baghdad. Ibn Hajib having been seized with depression of spirits, the physicians had recommended him (and the priests had granted him dispensation) to take occasionally, a little wine. This happened when Nasir-uddin was at Baghdad. One day, Ibn Hajib feeling himself particularly melancholy, and having, in consequence, taken a larger dose than usual, he became unusually merry, and requested Nasir-uddin to accompany him on the Tigris. Having reached the middle of the stream, he stopped the boat, and produced the several volumes of Nasir-uddin's works, which the learned refugee had presented to the khalif\u2014some of them in the original manuscript, and not yet transcribed, and in the presence of their anxious author, he threw them all, one after another, into the river, with such spiteful force, that the water was splashed about in every direction; when turning himself on each occasion, he satirically exclaimed, \"Delighted with the sarcastic smile of triumph, \"How wonderfully it bubbles!\" When the turn of Nasir-uddin came, he, too, gave full vent to his revenge. He ordered Ibn Hajib to be caressed up to his neck, in an ox's hide, just taken off the animal, and, having filled the skin with air, he laid it for a few hours in the sun, till it became quite dry, and sounded like a drum. Then the victor advanced close to his half exhausted enemy, gave him a kick of triumph, and, as he rolled on the ground, exclaimed, \"How wonderfully it rattles!\" This melancholy event took place on Sunday the 10th of February, 1268 A.D., 4th Safar, 556 A.H., from which time Baghdad was added to the other conquered provinces of this proud emperor. Al-Mustas'aim reigned 15 lunar years and 7 months.\n\nAl-Mustas'in Billah, the son of Muhammad, the son of al-Mustas'in Billah, was the twelfth khalif of the race of Abbas. He ascended the throne of Baghdad in 862 A.D., 248 A.H., after the death of his cousin or brother al-Mustansar Billah, but was forced to abdicate the throne in 866 A.D., 252 A.H., by his brother al-Mustakfi Billah, who afterwards caused him to be privately murdered.\n\nAl-Mustakfi Billah, was the 22nd khalif of the Abbasid family, and the son of al-Mustakfi the son of al-Mustakfi Billah. He succeeded his uncle al-Mutakfi in 946 A.D., 333 A.H., reigned in Baghdad one year and four months, and was deposed by his wazir in 946 A.D., 334 A.H. After him al-Mut'a' Billah was raised to the throne.\n\nAl-Mustansir Billah, the son of Tahir, was the fifth khalif of Egypt of the Fatimite race. He succeeded his father A.D. 1036, and with the assistance of a Turk named Basairi, conquered Baghdad and imprisoned al-Kasim Billah about the year 1054 A.D., and for a year and half was acknowledged the only legitimate chief of all the Musalmans. Basairi was defeated and killed by Tughrul Beg A.D. 1059, 487 A.H. Vide Basairi. Al-Mustansar died in 1094, having reigned 60 years, and was succeeded by his son al-Mustas'aim Billah Abdul Kasim.\n\nAl-Mustansir Billah I, the eleventh khalif of the race of Abbas, ascended the throne of Baghdad after the murder of his father al-Mutawakkil in December 861 A.D., Shawwal, 247 A.H., and had reigned only six months, when he was cut off by the hand of death in 862 A.D., 248 A.H. He was succeeded by his cousin al-Mustas'in Billah.\n\nAl-Mustansir Billah II, surnamed Abu Ja'far al-Mansur, ascended the throne of Baghdad after the death of his father al-Tahir, in 1264 A.D., 623 A.H. He was the 36th khalif of the house of Abbas, reigned about 17 years, and died in 1242 A.D., 640 A.H., leaving his kingdom to his son al-Mustas'aim Billah the last of the khalifs.\n\nAl-Mustanji'd Billah, the thirty-second khalif of the race of Abbas, succeeded to the throne of Baghdad after the death of his father al-Muktafi, in 1160 A.D., 555 A.H., reigned 11 lunar years and died in 1171 A.D., 566 A.H., when his son al-Mustas'aim succeeded him.\n\nAl-Mustashrid Billah, the twenty-ninth khalif of the Abbaside family, succeeded his father al-Muktafi to the throne of Baghdad in 1118 A.D., 512 A.H. It is related that Ibn Khakim that when Sultan Masud the son of Muhamed the son of Malikshah Saljuki was encamped outside of the town of Maragha in Azurbajian, al-Mustashrid was then with him, and on Thursday the 23rd or according to Ibn Mustafii, the 14th or 28th Zil'kada 529 A.H. (corresponding with the 24th August or 7th September, 1135 A.D.) a band of assassins broke into the khalif's tent and murdered him. Al-Mustashrid reigned 17 lunar years and some months, and was succeeded by his son al-Rashid Billah.\n\nAl-Mustazhir Billah, the son of al-Muktafi, was the twenty-eighth khalif of the dynasty of Abbas. He was placed on the throne of Baghdad after the death of his father in 1094 A.D., 487 A.H., by Barqaray Saljuki, the Sultan of Persia. He reigned 25 lunar years and some months, and at his death which happened in the year 1118 A.D., 512 A.H., he was succeeded by his son al-Mustashrid.\n\nAl-Mustasi Bi-amr-illah, the thirty-third khalif of the Abbaside family, succeeded his father al-Mustanji'd to the throne of Baghdad in 1171 A.D., 566 A.H. He reigned about seven years and died in 1179 A.D., 576 A.H., when his son al-Nasir Billah succeeded him.\n\nAl-Mutas'aim Billah, the son of al-Mutawakkil, was the thirteenth khalif of the race of Abbas. He deposed his brother al-Mustafin in 866 A.D., 252 A.H., and having caused him to be murdered privately, ascended the throne of Baghdad. He did not, however, long enjoy the dignity of which he had so iniquitously possessed himself, being deposed by the Turkish Militia (who now began to set up and depose khalifs as they pleased) in the year 869 A.D., 265 A.H. After his deposition, he was sent under an escort from Sarr Manras to Baghdad, where he died of thirst and hunger, after a reign of three years and about seven months. The fate of this khalif was particularly hard, as the Turkish towns had mutinied for their pay, and al-Mutas'aim not having money to satisfy their demands, applied to his mother named Kafiha for 60,000 dinars. This she refused, telling him that she had\nno money at all, although it afterwards appeared that she was possessed of immense treasure. After his deposition, however, she was obliged to discover them, and even deposit them in the hands of the new khalif al-Mu'tadid. They consisted of 1,000,000 dinars, a bushel of emeralds, and another of pearls, and three pounds and three quarters of rubies of the colour of fire.\n\nAl-Mutia' Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, the twenty-third khalif of the race of Abb\u00e1s was the son of al-Mukta'dir Billah. He ascended the throne of Baghd\u00e1d after al-Mustakfi in 946 A.D., 334 A.H., reigned 29 lunar years and 4 months and died in 974 A.D., 363 A.H. His son al-Tayy succeeded him.\n\nAl-Mutta'k Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062a\u0643 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, the son of al-Mukta'dir was the twenty-first khalif of the dynasty of Abb\u00e1s. He succeeded his brother al-R\u00e1zi Billah to the throne of Baghd\u00e1d in 941 A.D., 329 A.H., reigned 3 years 11 months and 15 days and died in 945 A.D., 333 A.H. He was succeeded by his nephew, al-Mustakfi the son of al-Mukta'dir.\n\nAl-Mutwakil, 'Al-allah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0648\u0643\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647. This was the name and title assumed by Ab\u00fa Fazl Ja'far on his accession to the throne of Baghd\u00e1d. He was the tenth khalif of the house of Abb\u00e1s, and the son of al-M\u00f3'tasim Billah. He succeeded his brother al-W\u00e1thik or W\u00e1sik in the year 847 A.D., 232 A.H., and began his reign with an act of the greatest cruelty. The late khalif's w\u00e1rir having treated al-Mutwakil ill in his brother's lifetime, and opposed his election to the khalifat, was on that account now sent to prison, and afterwards thrown into an iron furnace lined with spikes or nails heated red hot, where he was murdered and left to die. During this reign nothing remarkable happened, except wars with the Greeks, which were carried on with various success. He was very intolerant, especially of the Jews and Christians, on whom he heaped many indignities. He did not stop there. In his imbecility and ferocity he forbade the pilgrimage to Karbala, and caused the sacred repository of the ashes of Husain and the other martyrs interred there to be razed. He reigned 14 years 9 months and 9 days, and was assassinated and cut into seven pieces on the 24th December, 861 A.D., 17th Shawwal, 247 A.H., at the instance of his son al-Mustan\u00e1sar who succeeded him.\n\nAl-Muwaffik Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0641\u0642 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, the son of al-Mutwakil Billah, the khalif of Baghd\u00e1d and brother and coadjutor of the khalif al-M\u00e1'tamid, to whom he was of much service in his battles against his enemies. He died of the elephantiasis or leprosy in the year 891 A.D., 278 A.H., and while in his last illness, could not help observing, that of 100,000 men whom he commanded, there was not one so miserable as himself. His son M\u00f3'tasim, after the death of his brother al-M\u00e1'tamid in 892 A.D., succeeded to the throne of Baghd\u00e1d.\n\nAl-Muwyiyid, (Isma'il), \u0627\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644, whose name is spelt in Lempiere's Universal Biographical Dictionary, \"Alombundad\", and in Watkin's Biographical Dictionary \"Almuvedad\", was an Arabian historian, who gave a chronological account of the Saracen affairs in Sicily from 842 to 904 A.D. This MS. is in the library of the Escorial, in Spain, and a Latin version of it is inserted in Muratori's Rerum Italicarum Scriptores.\n\nAl-Muzani, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0632\u0627\u0646\u064a, vide Ab\u00fa Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Isma'il.\n\nAl-Nasir Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, or al-Nasir-uddin allah, the son of al-Mustaf\u00ed succeeded his father to the throne of Baghd\u00e1d in 1179 A.D. He professed the Sh\u00ed'a faith, and after a long reign of 46 lunar years and 11 months, died in the year 1226 A.D. He was the 34th khalif of the house of Abb\u00e1s, and was succeeded by his son al-T\u00e1hir Billah.\n\nAl-Rashid, \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f, the celebrated hero of the Arabian Nights, was the fifth khalif of the race of Abb\u00e1s and son of al-Mahdi, he succeeded his eldest brother al-H\u00e1di to the throne of Baghd\u00e1d in 786 A.D., 170 A.H. This was one of the best and wisest princes that ever sat on the throne of Baghd\u00e1d. He was also extremely fortunate in all his undertakings, though he did not much extend his khalifate's conquests. In his time the Moeslim empire may be said to have been in its most flourishing state, though, by the independency of the Moeslims in Spain, who had formerly set up a khalif of the house of Umm\u00e1ya, his territories were not quite so extensive as those of some of his predecessors. He, possessed the provinces of Syria, Palestine, Arabia, Persia, Armenia, Natalia, Media or Asurbej\u00e1n, Babylonia, Assyria, Sindh, Sijistan, Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, Tabrist\u00e1n, Jurj\u00e1n, Z\u00e1b\u00edst\u00e1n, Mawarunnahr, or great Bukh\u00e1ri\u00e1, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania &c., so that his empire was by far the most powerful of any in the world, and extended farther than the Roman empire ever had done.\n\nIn the beginning of the year 802 A.D., 186 A.H., he divided the government of his extensive dominions among his three sons in the following manner: To al-Amin the eldest, he assigned the province of Syria, Ir\u00e1k, the three Arab\u00edas, Mesopotamia, Assyria, Media, Palistine, Egypt, and all the part of Africa extending from the confines of Egypt and Ethiopia to the Straits of Gibraltar, with the dignity of khalif; to al-M\u00e1'm\u00fan the second, he assigned Persia, Kirm\u00e1n, the Indics, Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, Tabrist\u00e1n, K\u00e1h\u00falist\u00e1n and Z\u00e1b\u00edst\u00e1n, together with the vast province of Mawarunnahr, and to his third son al-K\u00e1sim, he gave Armenia, Natalia, Jurj\u00e1n, Georgia, Circassia, and all the Moeslim territories bordering upon the Euxine sea. As to the order of succession, al-Amin was to ascend the throne immediately after his father's decease; after him, al-M\u00e1'm\u00fan; and then al-K\u00e1sim, whom he had surnamed al-M\u00f3'tasim.\n\nThe most considerable exploits performed by this khalif were against the Greeks, who by their perfidy pro-\n\nAlp Arsalan, \u0623\u0631\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646, (which means in the Turkish language \"the valiant lion\") was a king of Persia of the Salj\u00fakian dynasty, and the son of D\u00e1d\u00ed Beg Salj\u00fak\u00ed. He succeeded his uncle Tughral Beg in 1063 A.D., 455 A.H., married the sister of the khalif K\u00e1sem Bill\u00e1h, and his name, after that of the khalif, was pronounced in the public prayers of the Muhammadans. He was a warlike prince; and, having spoiled the Church of St. Basil in C\u00e9sarea, defeated Romanus Diogenes, emperor of the Greeks in 1068 A.D., 460 A.H., who was sent out to be carried to the concours. Alp Arsalan demanded of his captive, at the first conference, what he would have done if fortune had reversed their lot. \"I would have given thee many a stripe\", was the imprudent and virulent answer. The Sultan only smiled and asked Romanus what he expected would be done to him. \"If thou art cruel\", said the emperor, \"put me to death. If vain-glorious load me with chains, and drag me in triumph to thy capital. If generous, grant me my liberty.\" Alp Arsalan was neither cruel nor vain-glorious, he nobly released his prisoner, and gave all his officers who were captives dresses of honor, and sent them away. Alp Arsalan after a reign of more than nine years was stabbed about the 15th of December, 1072 A.D., 30th Rabi I, 465 A.H., by a desperate Khw\u00e1rizmian, whom he had taken prisoner and sentenced to death. He was buried at Mary in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and the following is the translation of the inscription engraved on his tomb: \"All who have seen the glory of Alp Arsalan exalted to the heavens come to Mary, and you will behold it buried in the dust.\" He was succeeded by his son Maliksh\u00e1h.\n\nAlp Arsalan, who is by some called Apal Arsalan, was the son of Ataiz, a Sultan of Khw\u00e1rizm, whom he succeeded in A.D. 1168, 551\u2014567 A.H. and died in 1192 A.D.\n\nAlptakin or Alptagin, \u0623\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0643\u064a\u062a, vide Alaptakin.\n\nAl-Rashid or Harun al-Rashid, \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f, the celebrated hero of the Arabian Nights, was the fifth khalif of the race of Abb\u00e1s and son of al-Mahdi, he succeeded his eldest brother al-H\u00e1di to the throne of Baghd\u00e1d in 786 A.D., 170 A.H.

As to the order of succession, al-Amin was to ascend the throne immediately after his father's decease; after him, al-M\u00e1'm\u00fan; and then al-K\u00e1sim, whom he had surnamed al-M\u00f3'tasim.\n\nThe most considerable exploits performed by this khalif were against the Greeks, who by their perfidy pro-\nvoked him to make war upon them, and whom he always overcame. In the year 803 A.D., 187 A.H., the khalif received a letter from the Greek emperor Nicephorus, commanding him to return all the money he had extorted from the Empress Irene, or expect soon to see an imperial army in the heart of his territories. This insolent letter so exasperated Harun, that he immediately assembled his forces and advanced to Heraclea, laying the country, through which he passed, waste with fire and sword. For some time also he kept that city straitly besieged; which so terrified the Greek emperor that he submitted to pay an annual tribute.\n\nIn the year 804 A.D., 188 A.H., war was renewed with the Greeks, and Nicephorus sent a great army attacked the khalif's forces with the utmost fury. He was, however, defeated with the loss of 40,000 men, and received three wounds in the action; after which the Moalma committed terrible ravages in his territories, and returned home laden with spoils. The next year Harun invaded Phrygia; defeated an imperial army sent to oppose him, and having ravaged the country, returned without any considerable loss. In the year 806, 190 A.H., the khalif marched into the imperial territories with an army of 135,000 men, besides a great number of volunteers and others who were not enrolled among his troops. He first took the city of Heraclea, from which he is said to have carried 16,000 prisoners; after which he made himself master of several other places, and, in the conclusion of the expedition, he made a descent on the island of Cyprus, which he plundered in a terrible manner. This success so intimidated Nicephorus, that he immediately paid tribute due to Harun, the withholding of which had been the cause of the war; and concluded a peace upon the khalif's own terms. Charlemagne respected his character, and Harun in token of their friendship presented to the European prince a clock; the mechanism and construction of which were regarded among the prodigies of the age. Harun reigned 28 years and died in Khurasan on the eve of Saturday the 24th March, 809 A.D., 3rd Jamad II, 193 A.H., and was buried at Tus which is now called Mashhad. He was succeeded by his eldest son al-Amin.\n\nAl-Rashid Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0634\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0644, the thirtieth khalif of the Abbasides succeeded his father al-Mustarshad in August or September, 1135 A.D., Zil'kad, 529 A.H., and died in the year 1136 A.D., 530 A.H. He was succeeded by al-Muktafi the son of al-Mustarshad.\n\nAl-Razi, see Razi.\n\nAl-Razi Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0632\u064a \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0644, the son of al-Muktafi and the twentieth khalif of the house of Abbas, was the last who deserved the title of the Commander of the Faithful. He was raised to the throne of Baghdad, after the deposition of his uncle al-Kahir Billah by the wazir Ibn Majid, in April, 796 A.D., 13th Safar, 796 A.H. In the year 936, the khalif feeling himself distressed on all sides by usurpers, and having a wasif of no capacity, instituted a new office superior to that of wasif, which he entitled Amir-ul-Umra. This great officer, Imad-ud-daula Ali Boya, was trusted with the management of the finances in a much more absolute and unlimited manner than any of the khalif's wasifs ever had been. Nay he officiated for the khalif in the great mosque at Baghdad, and had his name mentioned in the public prayers throughout the kingdom. In short the khalif was so much under the power of this officer, that he could not apply a single dinar to his own use without the leave of the Amir-ul-Umra. In the year 937 A.D. the Moslem empire so great and powerful, was shared among the following usurpers:\n\nThe cities of Wasat, Basra, Kufa with the rest of the Arabian Irak, were considered as the property of the Amir-ul-Umra, though they had been in the beginning of the year seized upon by a rebel called al-Baridi, who could not be driven out of them.\n\nThe country of Fars, Faristan, or Persia properly so called, was possessed by Imad-ud-daula Ali ibn Boya, who resided in the city of Shiraz.\n\nPart of the tract denominated al-Jabal, together with Persian Irak, which is the mountainous part of Persia, and the country of the ancient Parthians, obeyed Ruknud-daula, the brother of Imad-ud-daula, who resided at Isfahan. The other part of the country was possessed by Washmakin the Dilmite.\n\nDayar Rabia, Dayar Birk, Dayar Moder, and the city of Moual, acknowledged for their sovereign a race of princes called Hamadanites.\n\nEgypt and Syria no longer obeyed the khalifa, but Muhammed ibn Nasr, who had formerly been appointed governor of those provinces.\n\nAfrica and Spain had long been independent.\n\nCicily and Crete were governed by princes of their own.\n\nThe provinces of Khurasan and Malvanunnahr were under the dominions of al-Nasr ibn Ahmad, of the dynasty of the Samanians.\n\nThe provinces of Tabristan, Jurjan or Georgia, and Mazinderan, had kings of the first dynasty of the Dilamites.\n\nThe province of Kirm\u00e1n was occupied by Ab\u00fa Ali Muhammad ibn Elyia al-Sam\u00e1n\u00ed, who had made himself master of it a short time before.\n\nLastly, the provinces of Yemama and Bahryn, including the district of Hajr, were in the possession of Ab\u00fa T\u00e1hir the Karmatian.\n\nThus the khalifa were deprived of all their dominions, and reduced to the rank of sovereign pontiffs; in which light, though they continued for some time to be regarded by the neighboring princes, yet their power never arrived to any height. In this low state the khalifa continued till the extinction of the Khilaf\u00e1t by Hal\u00e1k\u00f3 Khan the Tartar in the year 1258 A.D., 666 A.H.\n\nAl-Raf\u00ed Billah reigned 7 years 2 months and 11 days and died in 941 A.D., 329 A.H. He was succeeded by his brother al-Mutakfi.\n\nAl-Saharawi, \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a, surname of Ab\u00fa Abb\u00e1s, the son of Muhammed, the son of Ali, the son of 'Abdull\u00e1h, the son of Abb\u00e1s the uncle of the prophet. He was proclaimed khalifa by the inhabitants of Kufa on Friday the 29th of November, 749 A.D., 13th Rabi II, 132 A.H., upon which a battle took place between him and Marwan II the last khalifa of the house of Umayya or Ommaides, in which the latter was slain, 6th of August, 750 A.D., 26th Zil-hijja, 132 A.H.\n\nAl-Saffah after this victory investing himself with sovereign power, laid the foundation of the dynasty of the Abbasides, which continued to be transmitted to his family from father to son for 524 lunar years, during a succession of 37 khalifa, till they were dispossessed by Halk\u00fa Khan the Tartar king of Persia in 1258 A.D., 666 A.H. By the elevation of the house of Abbas to the dignity of khalifa, began that glorious period during which Arabic and Persian literature reached its highest perfection. With very few exceptions these khalifa were the noblest race of kings that ever ascended the throne of sovereignty. Ab\u00fa Abb\u00e1s died after a reign of more than four years of the small-pox on Sunday the 9th of June, 764 A.D., 13th Zil-hijja 136 A.H., and was succeeded by his brother Ab\u00fa Ja'far Alman\u00fasir.\n\nList of the khalifa of the race of Abbas who reigned at Baghdad.\n\n1.

He was consequently, with the consent of the emperor, stabbed with a dagger by a person who had been discharged from his service, and fell down dead on the spot.

He had on various pretexts avoided the ratification of the engagements which his agent had concluded with the resident of Delhi, but the movement of troops to his vicinity, and their occupation of positions which left him only the option between engaging in an unequal conflict and signing this treaty, induced him to adopt the safer course. He was confirmed in the possession of all the territories he held from the Holkar family, but compelled to surrender his large trains of artillery to the English Government, and to disband that great body of plunderers which had been for more than two years the scourge of Malwa and Rajputana.

Some say he was the son of a shepherd, and others, that he was descended in a right line from Kajuli Bahadur, son of Tuman Khan, of the same lineage with Changez Khan the celebrated conqueror of Persia. His father's name was Amir Turaghai and mother's Takima Khatoon; however, his obscurity was soon forgotten in the glory of his exploits. Distinguished by his courage and unbounded ambition, he gathered numbers of faithful adherents, and seized the city of Balkh, the capital of Khurasan, and having put to death Amir Hussain the ruler of that place, whose sister he had married, he ascended the throne on Wednesday the 10th of April, 1370 A.D., 12th Ramzan, 771 A.H. He then subdued Kandahar, Persia, and Baghdad, and seconded by an enthusiastic army, he penetrated to India, took Delhi on Tuesday the 17th December, 1398 A.D., 7th Rabii II, 801 A.H., with its immense treasures, and returned to punish Baghdad that shook off his yoke. The offending city was given up to pillage, and 80,000 of her inhabitants put to the sword. Now master of the fairer part of Asia, he interfered, at the request of the Greek emperor, in the affairs of Bajazid (Bajazet) emperor of the Turks, and commanded him to abandon the siege of Constantinople.

Bajazid fell into the hands of the emperor, and was carried about in mockery in an iron cage. To these conquests Taimur added Egypt and the treasures of Cairo, and then fixed the seat of his empire at Samarkand, where he received the homage of Manuel Paleologus, emperor of Constantinople, and of Henry III, King of Castile, by their ambassadors.

After his death he received the title of \"Pirzada Mahal.\" It is said that Taimur died saying \"Allah is my rest.\" He had four sons viz., Jahangir Mirza, Umar Shaikh Mirza, Mirza Shah, and Shahrukh Mirza. Tamerlane on his deathbed named his grandson Pir Muhammad son of Jahangir Mirza, the universal heir of all his dominions; but the contempt with which his will was treated after his death, was equal to the veneration which had been paid to his authority during his life. The Sultan Khalil, another of his grandsons, immediately took possession of the capital of Samarkand, and proclaimed himself emperor.

Usman continued him in that post four years, and then removed him; whereupon he retired to Palestine, where he lived privately till Usman's death. Upon this event, he went over to Mu'awiya upon his invitation; and took a great part in the dispute between 'Ali and Mu'awiya. The latter restored him to the lieutenancy of Egypt, and continued him in it till his death, which happened in 663 A.D., 48 A.H.

After three or four days the khalifa sent for him and killed him with his own hand.\n\nAmru bin Laish, \u0639\u0645\u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u062b, brother of Ya'kub bin Laish, whom he succeeded in the government of Khurasan, &c., in 878 A.D., 265 A.H., and ruled over those countries for 23 years. He was at last seized by Amir Isma'il Sani in 900 A.D., 288 A.H., and sent to Baghdad where he was confined for some time; his execution was the last act of the Khalifa Al-Mo'tazid, who gave orders for it a few months before his own death in 901 A.D., 289 A.H. He was blind of one eye. With Amru fell the fortunes of his family. His grandson Taher, struggled for power in his native province: but after a reign of six years, during which he conquered Fars, his authority was subverted by one of his own officers, by whom he was seized and sent prisoner to Baghdad. The only other prince of the family of Banu Laish who attained any eminence, was a chief of the house of Khalifa, who established himself in Kerman and maintained his power over that province till the time of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, by whom he was defeated and made prisoner.\n\nAmurath, names of several emperors of Turkey written so by English writers, being a corruption of Murad, which see.\n\nAnandpal, \u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f\u067e\u0627\u0644, son of Jaipal I, raj\u00e1 of Lahor whom he succeeded about the year 1001 A.D., and became tributary to Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni.

Her mausoleum is at a place called Anarkali in Lahor, which is now used as a church. Different stories are told concerning the name Anarkali by which the mausoleum as well as the bazar in its vicinity is known. According to some, it was the name of a\nprincess in Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr's time, while others say, that An\u00e1skali was a beautiful handmaid with whom Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr fell in love, and who, on Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n becoming aware of it, was buried alive. These stories may or may not be true, but there is no doubt certainly that a woman, whose name the building is called, lived in the time of the emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr or Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, that Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr or some other prince was madly in love with her, and that her death took place under such mournful circumstances, as broke the heart of the fond lover, and led him in the height of his passion and love for the princess who was no more, to compose the following couplet, and have it engraved on her tombstone: \"Oh could I see again the face of my angel, for ever would I repeat thanks to the Almighty.\"\n\nAnand Rao, Gaikwar, a Marhatta chief of Bar\u00f3da, with whom the English Government had in 1812 concluded a subsidiary alliance.

When 'Abdul-l\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n Uzbak took H\u00edr\u00e1t he made a proclamation in his army, that the life of An\u00eds be spared, and treated him with great respect. He came to India and received a salary of 50,000 rupees, and a jagir. He died at Bash\u00e1n-pur in 1605 A.D., 1014 A.H., and has left a D\u00edv\u00e1n and a Masnavi called Mahm\u00fad \u00c1i\u00e1s.\n\nAng or Ungh Khan, a king of the Trit Tartars who resided at Karakoram, and to whom the celebrated Jangz\u00e9 Kh\u00e1n was at one time a tributary.

He formerly took for his poetical name, \"Kh\u00e1f-war\u00ed,\" but he changed it afterwards to \"Anwari.\" From the superiority of his poetical talents, he was called the king of the poets of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n. He was a native of Abiward in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, was the favorite of Sult\u00e1n Sanjar Salj\u00fak\u00ed, and the rival of the poet Rashd\u00edl surnamed Watw\u00e1t, who espoused the cause of Atsiz the Sult\u00e1n of Khw\u00e1rizm. Whilst the two princes were engaged in war, the two poets assailed one another by rhymes sent on the point of arrows. He is also said to have been the greatest astronomer of his age. It so happened in the year 581 or 582 A.H., September, 1186 A.D., that there was a conjunction of all the planets in the sign of Libra, which produced strange winds and eradicate trees and destroy every building. When the fatal day arrived, it was perfectly calm, and there was the whole year so little wind, that the people were unable to winnow their corn. He was therefore accused for his predictions as an astrologer, and was obliged to fly to Balkh where he died in the reign of Sult\u00e1n Al\u00e1udd\u00edn Takash in 1200 A.D., 596 A.H. His death is mentioned in the Khul\u00e1sat-ul-Asha'ar to have taken place in 587 A.H. and others have written 592 A.H. Anwari, when very young, was sitting at the gate of his college called Mans\u00far\u00eda in T\u00faz, when a man richly dressed rode by him on a fine horse, with a numerous train of attendants; upon his asking who it was, he was told, that it was a poet belonging to the court. When Anwari reflected on the honor conferred on poetry, for which art he had a very early bent, he applied himself to it more ardently than ever, and having finished a poem, he showed it to Sult\u00e1n, who approved the work and invited him to his palace, and raised him even to the first honors of the State. He found many other poets at court, among whom were Salm\u00e1n, Zaf\u00edr and Rash\u00edd\u00ed, all men of wit and genius. Anwari has left us a collection of highly esteemed poems, on various subjects called Diw\u00e1n Anwari.

He at first served under one of the emperors of D\u00e9hli, and was appointed governor of K\u00f3pa Jahanabad. Ill success, or perhaps ill conduct, prevented him from being able to pay the stipend of his government to the men who quitted it promptly, and went to Abmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, where Gh\u00e1z\u00ed-udd\u00edn Kh\u00e1n the father of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, gave him a post of considerable trust and profit in the city of S\u00farat. After the death of Gh\u00e1z\u00ed-udd\u00edn, his son who had succeeded in the S\u00fabdar\u00ed of the southern provinces, appointed him Naw\u00e1b of Yalore or Vellore and R\u00e9jandrum, countries which he governed from 1725 to 1741 A.D., and in 1744 he was appointed governor of the Karnatic. He was killed in battle fought against Muzaffar Jang the grandson of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, on the 23rd of July 1749 O.S., 1162 A.H., who took possession of the Karnatic. Anwar-udd\u00edn was then 107 years old. His eldest son was made prisoner and his second son Muham-mad Ali fled to Trichinopoly. A heroic poem called \"Anwar Nama,\" in praise of the Naw\u00e1b was written by Abd\u00ed, in which the exploits of Major Lawrence, and the first contests between the English and French in India, are recorded with tolerable accuracy. (Vide Sa'd\u00e1t-udd\u00edn Kh\u00e1n.)

The latter succeeded his father in 1816, but was an idiot and unfit to rule. Ap\u00e1 Sahib assumed the civil authority under the title of Regent, and had the sole conduct of the public affairs. Although he was in a great degree indebted for his elevation to the English Government, he early evinced a disposition as inconsistent with the gratitude which he owed to that State, as with the obligations of good faith. It was also discovered that he had secretly murdered his predecessor B\u00e1li Sahib (Pars\u00e1r\u00e1m) in order to obtain that elevation which he had so disgraced. He was consequently seized in the beginning of the year 1818, and brought to the Residency, where he continued in confinement till directed to be sent under a strong escort to the Company's territories. When arrived at Raichora, a village within one march from Jabalpur, he contrived by bribing some of his guards, to make his escape. It is believed that, after having for a short period found a refuge in Asirgarh, he fled to Rajputana, where he remained a miserable dependent on the charity of R\u00e1ja Ranjit Singh.

He was the first king of the S\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00edan dynasty. His father B\u00e1bak, who was an inferior officer in the public service, after putting to death the governor appointed by Ard\u00e1w\u00e1n (Artabanes) made himself master of the province Fars. The old man survived but a short time. His son Ard\u00edsh\u00e9r, after settling the affairs of Fars, not only made himself master of Isf\u00e1h\u00e1n, but of almost all Ir\u00e1k before Ard\u00e1w\u00e1n, who was the reigning prince, took the field against him, about the year 228 A.D. Their armies met in the plains of Hurmuz, where a desperate battle ensued, in which Ard\u00e1w\u00e1n lost his crown and his life; and the son of B\u00e1bak was raised in the field with the royal title of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h, or King of kings. He was contemporary with Alexander Severus, the Roman emperor.

He succeeded his grandfather, Gahtasp, as king of Persia in 464 B.C. He is celebrated for the wisdom he displayed in the internal regulation of his empire. In the commencement of the reign of this monarch, the celebrated Rustam was slain by the treachery of his brother. This prince is named Ahasuerus in Scripture, and is the same who married Esther, and during the whole of his reign showed the greatest kindness to the Jewish nation. The long reign of this monarch includes that of two or more of his immediate successors, who are not noticed by Persian writers.

From the time of the decline of the dynasty of Saljuk to the conquest of Persia by Hal\u00e2k Kh\u00e2n (which occupies a period of more than a century,) that country was distracted by the contests of a number of petty princes or governors, called At\u00e2b\u00e2ks; who taking advantage of the weakness of the last monarchs of the house, established their authority over some of the finest provinces of the empire. One of the most distinguished of these At\u00e2b\u00e2ks was Eldiguz, a Turkish slave, whose descendants reigned over 'Azurb\u00e2j\u00e2n. The At\u00e2b\u00e2ks of Fars were descended from Salghur, a Turkish general. Vide Eldiguz and Salghur, also 'Imad-ud-din Zangi.

When Tughrul III a prince of the Salj\u00fbkian dynasty (who was a child of seven years of age) was placed on the throne in 1176 A.D., Muhammad, who was his uncle, became the actual ruler of Persia. This state of affairs continued for 13 years until March, 1186 A.D., Zil-hij\u00e2, 561 A.H., in which year the conjunction of all the planets took place.

As a specimen of the Urdu language the Nautars Murass\u00e2 was rendered objectionable for students, by his retaining too much of the phraseology and idiom of the Persian and Arabic.

Now that, by the grace of God and your majesty\u2019s favor, I am elevated above all the nobles of the land, and am intrusted with the treasures of the world, I am fearful that my heart should be puffed up with vanity; I therefore daily practice this humiliation to remind me of my former insignificance.\u201d The Sult\u00e1n being much pleased, added to his rank, and severely reprimanded his slanderers.\n\n'Ayas (Kazi), \u0627\u0648\u06cc\u0627\u0633 \u06a9\u0627\u0632\u06cc, son of M\u00fassa, and author of the \u201cSharah Sah\u00edn Muslim,\u201d Mash\u00e1rik-ul-Anw\u00e1r, and several other works. He died in 1149 A.D., 544 A.H.\n\n'Ayesha, \u0627\u0648\u06cc\u0634\u06c1, daughter of Ab\u00fa Bakr, and one of the most beloved wives of Muhammad, though she bore him no child. She was his third wife, and the only one that was a maid, being then only of seven years of age. On which account (some say) her father, whose original name was Abd-ull\u00e1h, was named Ab\u00fa Bakr, that is to say, the father of the virgin. An Arabian author, cited by Maracca, says that Ab\u00fa Bakr was very averse to the giving his daughters so young, but that Muhammad pretended a divine command for it; whereupon he sent her to him with a basket of dates, and when the girl was alone with him, he stretched out his hand, and rudely took hold of her clothes; upon which she looked fiercely at him, and said, \u201cPeople call you the faithful man, but your behaviour to me shews you are a perfidious one.\u201d But this story is most probably one of those calumnies against Muhammad, which were invented and found favour during the Middle Ages. After the death of her husband, she opposed the succession of Ali, and had several bloody battles with him; although violent, her character was respected, and when taken prisoner by Ali, she was dismissed without injury. She was called prophetess and mother of the faithful. She died aged 67 in the year 678 A.D., 56 A.H. Her brother Abd-ll\u00e1h Rahman, one of the four who stood out against Yazid\u2019s insurrection, died the same year. There is a tradition that \u2018Ayesha was murdered by the direction of Mu\u2019aw\u00eda I, and the following particulars are recorded. \u2018Ayesha having resolutely and insultingly refused to engage her allegiance to Yazid, Mu\u2019aw\u00eda invited her to an entertainment, where he had prepared a very deep well or pit in that part of the chamber reserved for her reception, and had the mouth of it deceptively covered over with leaves and straw. A chair was then placed upon the fatal spot, and \u2018Ayesha, on being conducted to her seat, instantly sank into eternal night, and the mouth of the pit was immediately covered with stones and mortar. There is, however, no trustworthy authority in support of this story.\n\n'Ayn-uddin (Shaikh), \u0627\u0648\u06cc\u0646 \u0639\u062f\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u06c1\u06a9, of Bij\u00e1pur, author of the \u201cMulkijat,\u201d and Kit\u00e1b-ul-Anw\u00e1r containing a history of all the Muhammadan saints of India.

But the state of affairs in Egypt was now tottering to its fall. The descendants of 'Ali from the death of Al-Must\u00e1'ali Bill\u00e1h A.D. 1101, had become supreme in the hands of their waz\u00edr or Amir-ul-Jayy\u00e1n\u00ed (generalissimo), who wielded all the regal authority of the state: two Amir-ul-Darg\u00e1n\u00ed and \u00c1mir-ul-Hass\u00e1n contested in arms this high dignity, and the latter, defeated and expelled from Egypt, sought refuge and aid from N\u00far-udd\u00edn styled Malik-ul-'Adil N\u00far-udd\u00edn Mahm\u00edd, the celebrated ruler of Syria. The sovereign of Damascus eagerly embraced the opportunity of obtaining a footing in Egypt, and in 1163 A.D., 558 A.H., despatched a force under Asad-ud-d\u00edn Shirakoh (the brother of Aiy\u00fab) and his nephew S\u00e1h\u00e1b-udd\u00edn to reinstate Sh\u00e1war; whose rival called in the Christians of Palestine to his support; but ere Amauri (the brother and successor of Baldwin III) could\nenter Egypt, Dargam had been overpowered and slain by Shirakoh, who replaced Sh\u00e1var in his former power. But Sh\u00e1var, faithless alike to friend and foe, now entered into arrangements with the Franks in order to elude the fulfilment of his engagements with N\u00far-udd\u00edn; and Shirakoh, after maintaining himself for some time in Belbes against the joint forces of Jerusalem and Egypt, was compelled to enter into a convention with Amauri and evacuate the country. But he was soon recalled by Sh\u00e1var to deliver him from the vengeance of his new allies to whom he had proved as perfidious as to those of his own faith; Cairo was closely besieged by the Franks, and the Fatimite khalif 'Azid le-din-allah sent the hair of his women, the extreme symbol of Oriental distress, to implore the succour of N\u00far-udd\u00edn (1168 A.D.). Shirakoh again joined Egypt with an army, forced Amauri to retreat, and after subduing the double treachery of Sh\u00e1var, installed himself in the capital. Afterward came the Fatimite khalif, and lieutenant of Egypt in the name of N\u00far-udd\u00edn; but dying the same year, was succeeded in his dignities by his famous nephew S\u00e1l\u00e1h-udd\u00edn, who after the death of N\u00far-udd\u00edn in May, 1173 A.D., Shawwal, 569 A.H., became the sole master of Egypt and Syria.

He was a man of Ghazni, and formerly served under Prince K\u00e1n\u00e1n\u00e1n Mirz\u00e9. It is said that he saved the life of Hum\u00e2y\u00fan, or had been of some service to him after his defeat by Sher Shah at Kanauj; for which service he was handsomely rewarded by that emperor after his having recovered the kingdom. He accompanied the emperor to Persia, and as his wife Jij\u00ed Begam became the wet-nurse of Akbar, the emperor's son, he was consequently called Anka Kh\u00e1n. He was the first person that was honored with the rank of \"Haft Haz\u00e1r\u00ed,\" or Seven Thousand, by Akbar. The office of Wakil Mutlak, which was taken away from M\u00e1ham Anka, was also conferred on him; on which account, Adham Kh\u00e1n Kokaltash, the son of M\u00e1ham Anka, took offence, and assassinated Kh\u00e1n 'Asim on Monday the 18th of May, 1562 A.D., 12th Ram\u00e1n, 968 A.H., by a rod, according to the custom by the emperor.

He was called K\u00f3ka or Kokaltash on account of his being foster-brother and playmate of Akbar; for his mother whose name was Jij\u00ed Begam, was Akbar's wet-nurse, and was one of the best governesses of the emperor, who, in the 16th year of his reign conferred on him the title of 'Asim Kh\u00e1n. He held the government of Gujrat for several years together, and being absent from the presence from a long period, was summoned to court by Akbar in 1592 A.D., 1001 A.H., but as that chief had always entertained the wish to proceed on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and his friends representing to him that the king was displeased with him, and merely sought an opportunity to imprison him, he placed his family and treasure on board a vessel, and on the 13th of March, 1594 O.S., 1st Rajah, 1002 A.H., set sail for Hoj\u00e1j without leave or notice. In a short time, however, he found his situation irksome in that country, and returned to India, where he made his submission, and was restored at once to his former place in the emperor's favor and confidence. He died at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d Gujrat, in the 19th year of the reign of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, 1606 A.D., 1015 A.H.

What his particular doctrine was, is now unknown; but his religion is said to have differed from all others then known in Asia. He gained a great number of proselytes in Azarbaijan and Persian Ir\u00e2k, where he soon grew powerful enough to wage war with the khalif At-T\u00e2m\u00een, whose troops he often beat, so that he became extremely formidable in the beginning of the khalifa Al-Mu'tasim's reign. The general sent by the khalif to reduce him was Haidar-ibn-K\u00e2fs, surnamed Ashin, a Turk by birth. By him Babak was defeated with prodigious slaughter; no fewer than 60,000 men being killed in this first engagement. The next year 836 A.D., 220 A.H., he received a still greater overthrow; 100,000 men either killed or taken prisoners. By this defeat he was obliged to retire into the Gordian mountains, where he fortified himself in such a manner, that Ashin found it impossible to reduce him till the year 837 A.D., 222 A.H., when he was forced to surrender to Ashin, upon that general's promising him pardon. But Ashin no sooner had him in his power, than he first caused his hands and feet, and afterwards his head to be cut off. Babak had supported himself against the power of the khalifa for upwards of 20 years, during which time he had cruelly massacred 250,000 people, it being his custom to spare neither man, woman, nor child of the Muhammadans or their allies.\n\nBaba Ratan, surnamed Abu Ras\u00ee, a pious Musulm\u00e2n, who is said, by Delet Shah, to be one of the disciples of Jesus Christ, and that he lived to an advanced age of 1400 years, and died about the beginning of the 13th century of the Christian era.\n\nBabar Shah, surnamed Zafir-ud-d\u00een Muhammad, the ancestor of the Mughal emperors of Delhi, was the sixth in descent from Amir Taimur (Tamerlane).

When the emperor Akbar a few years afterwards arrived at Mandu, with the avowed intention of invading the Dakhin, Bahadur Khan instead of adopting the policy of his father in relying on the honor of Akbar, and going with an army to co-operate with him, shut himself up in the fort of Asir, and commenced preparations to withstand a siege. When Akbar heard of these proceedings, he sent orders to the Khanda-khan Abdur Rahim Khan, and the prince Dahnal Mirza to come to the siege of Ahmadnagar, where he himself marched to the sound, and invested Burhanpur, killing one of his generals to besiege Asir. The blockade of this fortress continued for a length of time, till it surrendered, and Bahadur Khan, the last of the Faruki dynasty humbled himself before the throne of Akbar in the year 1599 A.D., 1008 A.H., while the impregnable fortress of Asir with ten years' provisions and countless treasures fell into the hands of the conqueror.\n\nBahadur Khan Rohila, son of Dari Khan, was an amir of high rank in the reign of the emperor Shah Jahan.

On the death of his father Ibrahim Nizam Shah, which took place in August 1596 A.D., Zil-hijja 1003 A.H., several factions arose in Ahmadnagar, each setting up a nominal sovereign. Miyan Manju, who possessed the city, and acknowledged the title of Bahadur Nizam Shah, then an infant, being besieged by his competitors, invited Sultan Murad, son of the emperor Akbar, then governor of Gujrat, to his assistance, for which he offered to become tributary to the Mughal power. Sultan Murad embraced the proposal, and arrived before Ahmadnagar with a considerable army. Miyan Manju by this time, having overcome his rivals, repented of his offers, and prepared to oppose the prince. Having committed the city to the charge of Nasir Khan his deputy, and the care of Chand Bibi, great aunt to Sultan Bahadur, he departed to raise levies, and implore the assistance of Kutub Shah of Golconda, and Adil Shah of Bijapur. Sultan Murad besieged Ahmadnagar on the 16th of December 1596 O.S., 23rd Rabii II, 1004 A.H., which was gallantly defended. Breaches were made, but were immediately repaired by the heroic conduct of Chand Bibi, who covering herself with a veil, headed the troops. At length in the month of March 1598, Rajab, 1004 A.H., supplies growing scarce in the camp, and the allies of Bijapur and Golkonda approaching, Sultan Murad thought proper to accept of some offers of tribute from Chand Bibi, and raise the siege. Some money was paid, and the districts in Berar belonging to the Nizam Shahi government were ceded to the Mughals. In the year 1600 A.D., beginning of 1009 A.H., Ahmadnagar was taken by the Mughals, and Bahadur Shah with all the children of both sexes of the royal family were taken prisoners and sent to perpetual confinement in the fortress of Gwalior.\n\nBahadur Singh Kuchwhaha, brother to Sakat Singh, died of hard-drinking in the year 1621 A.D., 1030 A.H.\n\nBahadur Shah, an Afghan, succeeded his father Mahmud Khan as governor of Bengal in the\nBahadur Shah, the second son of Muzaffar Shah II, of Gujrat. At the time of his father's death, he was absent at Jaunpur, but when Mahmud Shah, his younger brother, ascended the throne of Gujrat, after the murder of his elder brother, Sikandar Shah, Bahadur returned from thence, and having deprived Mahmud of his kingdom, ascended the throne on the 20th of August 1526, A.D., 15th Zil-Ka'da 932 A.H. He conquered Malwa on the 26th February 1531, 9th Shaban, 937 A.H., and the king of that place, Sultan Mahmud II, who was taken prisoner and sent to Champanir, was put to death on the road. In the year 1536 A.D., 942 A.H., Malwa was taken by the emperor Humayun, and Bahadur being defeated was obliged to fly towards Cambay, where, on his arrival, he heard that a fleet, in which there were between 4 or 5,000 Europeans, had arrived off the island of Diu. He immediately repaired thither with a reinforcement of troops, and on his arrival there, he ordered his barge and went to visit the admiral, with the intention of killing him; but perceiving that he was betrayed, he arose, and was attacked on all sides by the Portuguese, and a soldier struck him over the head with a sword, and threw him into the water, where he was drowned. This event took place on the 14th of February 1537, 3rd Ramazan, 943 A.H., and has been commemorated in two Persian chronograms, comprising the numerals which form the date of the year when it occurred. Their meaning is this: \"The Europeans were the slayers of Bahadur,\" and \"The king of the land became a martyr at Sea.\" Bahadur Shah was 20 years of age when he ascended the throne, reigned 11 lunar years, and was slain at the age of 31. After his death his nephew Mirza Muhammad Shah was raised to the throne of Gujrat.\n\nBahadur Shah I, surnamed Kutbuddin Shah 'Alam, formerly called prince Muzaffar, was the second son of the emperor Akbar, born at Burhanpur in the Dakhani on the 4th October 1643 O.S., 30th Rajab, 1053 A.H. At the time of his father's death, which took place at Ahmadabad, on the 21st February 1707 O.S., 28th Zil-Ka'da 1118 A.H., he being then at Kabul, his younger brother, prince Azim, was proclaimed sovereign of all India in perfect disregard of the late emperor's will. Prince Muzaffar, with better reason, assumed the crown at Kabul with the title of Bahadur Shah; and both brothers prepared to assert their pretensions by force of arms. They assembled very large armies, and met at length at Daulipur not far to the south of Agra. A bloody battle ensued on Sunday the 8th June 1707, O.S., 18th Rab'i I, 1119 A.H., in which prince Azim and his two grown-up sons Bedar Bakht and Walijah, were killed. Bahadur Shah reigned nearly five lunar years, and died at Lahore on Monday the 18th of February 1712 O.S., 21st Safar, 1122 A.H., in the 71st lunar year of his age. He was buried in the environs of Delhi, near the tomb of Khwaja Kutbuddin, where he had built during his life a mosque entirely of white marble named Moti Masjid. His tomb is also built of the same stone. He received the title of \"Khuld Manzil,\" i.e., \"May his mansion be in paradise,\" after his death. He left four sons, viz., Ma'izuddin Jahandar Shah, Azim-ush-Shan, Raff-ush-Shan, and Jahangir Shah, among whom a battle ensued, wherein the three latter brothers were killed, and Jahandar Shah ascended the throne.\n\nBahadur Shah II, the present and last king of Delhi whose title in full is Abu'l Muzaffar Sirajuddin Muhammad Bahadur Shah, a lineal descendant from Amir Taimur; is the son of Akbar Shah II, on whose death he succeeded him on the 28th September 1837, 28th Jumada II, 1253 A.H. He was born on Tuesday the 24th of October 1775, 28th Shaban, 1189 A.H.; and Abu'l Muzaffar is the chronogram of his birth. His mother's name was Lai Bai. A sum of the period of one lakh of rupees monthly was allowed him by the British Government. He is an excellent Persian scholar, and an elegant Urdu poet, and Zafar is his poetical name. His Divan or Book of Odes was printed some years ago at Delhi. He is supposed to be the principal instigator of the mutiny of the native troops throughout India in 1857, and is now deposed and tried, but his life has been guaranteed. In October 1858 he was sent down to Calcutta, from which place he embarked on board H.M. Ship \"Megara\" on Saturday the 4th December 1858, for Rangoon, accompanied by two of his wives, a son and a grandson, and thus ended the royal race of Taimur in India. His sons Mirza Mughal and Mirza Khwaja Sultan, and a grandson named Mirza Abu Bakr, who were known to have taken a prominent part in the atrocities attending the insurrection, were captured on the 22nd September 1857 at the tomb of Humayun, and shot on the spot.

He committed the greatest cruelties on the Muslims, to every advantage, killing no quarter to age or sex, and even ripping up women with child. The emperor found it necessary to march in person against him, and he was besieged in the fortress of Lohgruh, which was taken, but Banda found means to escape, and raise new insurrections. In the reign of the emperor Farrukhsh\u00e1h, 'Abdus Samad Kh\u00e1n governor of Kashmir was sent against the rebels with a great army. After many severe engagements, he forced Banda to take refuge in a fortress, which was blockaded so effectually, as to cut off every supply. The garrison was reduced to the necessity of eating cows, horses, asses, and other animals forbidden by their laws; when at length, having no provision of any sort left, and being reduced to the extremity of famine and disease, they begged for quarter. 'Abdus Samad Kh\u00e1n, having planted a standard on the plain, commanded them to come down and lay their arms under it, which they did. He then divided the meanest sort among his chiefs, who cut off their heads; and threw their bodies into a river near the fortress.

A dagger was put into his hands, and he was commanded to kill his infant son; but refusing, the child was slain by the executioner, his heart torn out, and forced into the father's mouth.

He caused his elder brother Ya'kub, his rival for the throne, to be strangled, an act of barbarity which since his time has become a custom at the Turkish court. He conquered Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Thessaly; and after he had made the emperor of Constantinople tributary to his power, he marched to attack Tamerlane in the east. He was, however, totally defeated near Angora on Friday the 21st July, 1402 A.D., 19th Zil-hijjah, 804 A.H., and taken prisoner; and when the prisoners were asked him what he would have done with him if he had obtained the victory, Baiazeid answered that he would have confined him in an iron cage. \"Such then shall be thy fate,\" rejoined Tamerlane, and ordered him to be carried about with his camp in an iron cage. Baiazeid died on the 8th of March, 1403 A.D., 18th Sha'b\u00e1n, 805 A.H., at Antioch in Pisidia during his confinement in Taimir's camp. His son Musa, who was with his father at the time of his death, brought his remains to Brusa and buried there. During his (Musa's) absence in the camp, his brother Sulaim\u00e1n had ascended the throne.\n\nBaiazid II, \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f, (Sultan) emperor of Turkey succeeded his father Muhammed II. to the throne of Constantinople in May, 1481 A.D., Rab\u00ed'\u0131, 886 A.H. He extended the boundaries of his kingdom; and obliged the Venetians to sue for peace. His reign was distracted by internal dissensions, and he fell by the sword of his son Selim I, who caused him to be poisoned in 1512 A.D., 918 A.H., in the 60th year of his age and 31st of his reign. He was a man of uncommon talents, and did much for the improvement of his empire, and the promotion of the sciences.\n\nBaiazid Ansari, \u0628\u0627\u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631\u064a, the Afghan Apostle, called Pir Roshan, founder of the Sufi sect called \"Rohanism,\" or \"the enlightened.\" He had established amid the mountains of Afghanistan a temporal power upon the authority of his spiritual character, which enabled him and his successors to disturb the tranquillity of the Empire of Dohli, when, under the celebrated Akbar, it had reached the very zenith of its power.\n\nBaiazid Bustami (Khwaja), \u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0633\u0637\u0627\u0645\u064a, the famous ascetic of Bust\u00e1m, whose original name was Taifuri; he is therefore sometimes called Baiazid Taifuri-al-Bustami. His father's name was 'Isa-ibn-Adam-ibn-'Isa-ibn-'Ali. His grandfather was a Gabr or magian, but became a convert to Islamism. These two brothers Adam and 'Ali, were like himself, devout ascetics, but in an inferior degree. He was born in the year 777 A.D., 160 A.H., came to a great age, and died between the years 846 or 848 A.D., 731 or 733 A.H.; but according to Ibn-Khalkh\u00e1n\u00ed his death took place in 876 or 878 A.D., 261 or 264 A.H. He is said to have been a contemporary of Ahmad Khizroya who died 240 A.H.\n\nBaiazid Khan, \u0628\u0627\u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646, faujdar of Sarhind, who was commanded by the emperor Farrukh-siyar to punish the Sikhs, who had risen in rebellion; he took the field, but was assassinated in his tent when alone at evening prayers, by a Sikh commissioned for that purpose by Banda their chief, and the murderer escaped unhurt. This circumstance took place about the year 1714 A.D., 1126 A.H.\n\nBaiazid (Sultan), \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f. There is a cenotaph at Chatig\u00e1on, called the Rauza of Sultan Baiazid. It is related that he was born at Bust\u00e1m in Khurasan, of which country he was king; but abandoning royal pomp and cares for the tranquillity of the ascetic life, he came with twelve attending disciples to Chatig\u00e1on. Their arrival was promptly opposed by the king of the fairies and the\nattendant genii, who desired them forthwith to depart. Sult\u00e1n B\u00e1iz\u00e1id, with feigned humility, entreated to be allowed to remain that night and to occupy only as much ground as could be illumined by a single lamp, called in Bengali, chat\u00ed or chat\u00ed; on obtaining their consent, he kindled from his urine a lamp of such radiance, that its light extended to T\u00edk Naof, a distance of 120 miles, and scorched the terrified genii, who fled from its flame in dismay. In commemoration of this event, the place was named Chatig\u00e1on; in common parlance, Chatig\u00e1on, signifying the village of the lamp. This insult and breach of confidence led to intractable war on the part of the genii, whom Sult\u00e1n B\u00e1iz\u00e1id, in various conflicts, drove from the field; and in his strenuous exertions dropped a ring, where the cenotaph now stands\u2014his Karanph\u00fal, or sar-ring, fell in the river, which thence was named the \"Karanph\u00fal;\" and a sankh, or shell, dropped from his hand, into the other stream, from which it derived the name of San-khaut\u00ed. Sult\u00e1n B\u00e1iz\u00e1id then became a Gorchela (i.e., did penance in the tomb) for 12 years: after endowing it with lands to keep it in repair and defray the expenses of pilgrims and the twelve disciples\u2014he proceeded to Mak\u00e1n-p\u00far, and was succeeded by his disciple Sh\u00e1h\u2014who in the hope of an eternal reward, performed the penance of standing for 12 years on one leg, after which he also proceeded to Mak\u00e1n-p\u00far; leaving the cenotaph under the charge of Sh\u00e1h Pir, an attending disciple of B\u00e1iz\u00e1id. This place was therefore in after ages held in great repute, and visited by numerous pilgrims from distant parts. It is situated on a hill, approached by a flight of steps, enclosed by a wall about 30 feet square and 15 high, with mitred battlements, and a pillar rising two feet above them at each angle, similar to the buildings of the time of Akbar. The tomb, about 12 feet by 9, is in the centre of the area, with some shells and corals deposited at its head.\n\nB\u00e1iz\u00e1id Taifuri-al-Bust\u00e1mi, \u0628\u0627\u06cc\u0632\u06cc\u062f \u0637\u0641\u06cc\u0641\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0645\u06cc, vide B\u00e1iz\u00e1id Bust\u00e1mi.\n\nBaz Bah\u00e1d\u00far, \u0628\u0632 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0631, whose original name was M\u00e1l\u00edk B\u00e1iz\u00e1id, succeeded his father Shuj\u00e1' Kh\u00e1n to the government of M\u00e1lwa in 1564 A.D., 962 A.H., and having taken possession of many towns in M\u00e1lwa which were previously almost independent, he ascended the throne under the title of Sult\u00e1n B\u00e1z Bah\u00e1d\u00far. His attachment to R\u00fapm\u00e1n\u00ed, a celebrated courtezan of that age, became so notorious, that the loves of B\u00e1z Bah\u00e1d\u00far and R\u00fapm\u00e1n\u00ed have been handed down to posterity in song. He reigned about 17 years, after which the kingdom of M\u00e1lwa was taken, and included among the provinces of the empire of Delhi, by the emperor Akbar in the year 1570 A.D., 978 A.H. B\u00e1z Bah\u00e1d\u00far afterwards joined Akbar at Delhi and received a commission as an officer of 2000 cavalry.

Being informed that his prince Jaish\u00e1h of Jaipur was so infatuated with the beauty of a very young girl he had married, as to neglect entirely the affairs of his country; for he never came abroad, having shut himself up to contemplate the fascinating charms of his beauteous, though immature bride; Bihari boldly ventured to admonish him by bribing a slave girl to convey a couplet, which he had composed, under his pillow; the translation of which is thus given by Gilchrist: \"When the flower blooms, what will be the situation of the tree that is now captivated with a bud in which there is neither fragrance, sweets, or colour?\" This had not only the desired effect of rousing the prince from his lethargy, but excited in his breast a generous regard for the man, whose advice came so seasonably and elegantly disguised. Bihari received, ever after, a pension from court, with a present of more than one thousand pounds, for a work he published under the name of \"Sat-sai,\" from its consisting of seven hundred couplets.\n\nBihari Mal, also called Bharimal and P\u00faranmal, a raja of Ambhar or Ameer, now Jaipur, was a rajput\nof the tribe of Kachhwaha.

Both he and his son R\u00e1j\u00e9 Bhagw\u00e1n D\u00e1s were admitted at the same time to a high rank in the imperial army by the emperor. Bhagw\u00e1n D\u00e1s gave his daughter in marriage to Jah\u00e1ngir in 1686 A.D., who was married next year (1686) to the daughter of R\u00e1j\u00e9 Udai Singh, son of Rao Maldeo Rathor.\n\nBija Bai, \u0628\u06cc\u062c\u0627 \u0628\u06cc, or B\u00e9j\u00ed B\u00e1\u00ed, the wife of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Daulat Rao Scindia of Gwalior.

In the \"Bijaip\u00e1l Rass,\" a metrical romance or ballad (written in the Birj Bh\u00e1kha), the Hind\u00fa scholar will find a full and particular account of this great Hind\u00fa monarch, who is fabled to have conquered r\u00e9j\u00e9 Jumeshwar, the father of Pirth\u00ed R\u00e9j\u00e9, the celebrated chah\u00fa\u00e1n king of Delhi, and to have ruled despotically over the whole of India. The Karan\u00fa r\u00e9j\u00e9 too boasts his descent from Bijaip\u00e1l, and if any faith can be placed in a \"Bans\u00f3li or genealogical tree,\" he has a fair claim to the benefits, real or imaginary, resulting therefrom.\n\nBijai Singh, \u0628\u06cc\u062c\u0627\u06cc \u0633\u0646\u06af, son of r\u00e9j\u00e9 Abhai Singh, the son of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Ajit Singh, R\u00e1thor of J\u00f3dhpur, succeeded to the r\u00e9j\u00e9 in 1762 A.D., 1167 A.H. He became infatuated with fondness for a young concubine; his chiefs rebelled, his family were in hostility with each other, and he left at his death the throne itself in dispute.

His era called the Sambat is still used in the north of India. Bikramaj\u00edt died or ascended the throne in the K\u00e1f\u00ed Jug, year 3044, according to Wilford, whose essays in the 9th and 10th volumes of the Asiatic Researches, contain the fullest information on the history of the three supposed princes of this name, and of their common rival Salivahana. The first Sambat year, therefore, concurs with the year 3044 of the K\u00e1f\u00ed Jug year, or 57 years before the birth of Christ. This prince was a great patron of learned men; nine of whom at his court are called the nine gems, and are said to have been Dhantwanti, K\u00e1hap\u00e1naka, Amcra Sinha, Sanka, V\u00e9d\u00e1dhatta, Ghatak\u00e1rpara, Kalid\u00e1s, Vir\u00e1hamihira, and Var\u00e1kr\u00fahi.\n\nBikramaj\u00edt (Rajah), \u0631\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u0628\u06a9\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062c\u06cc\u062a, Vide R\u00e1e P\u00e1tr D\u00e1s.

His conceit had roused the jealousy of Am\u00edr Al\u00edsh\u00e9r, Bin\u00e1i tried to conciliate his favour by writing a Kas\u00edda in his praise, but received no reward, he therefore substituted the name of Sult\u00e1n Ahmad M\u00edrz\u00e1 for that of Al\u00edsh\u00e9r, saying that he would not give away his daughters without dowry. Al\u00edsh\u00e9r was so enraged at this, that he obtained a death-warrant against him. Bin\u00e1i fled to M\u00e1warunnahr. He was killed in the massacre of Sh\u00e1h Isma'il in 1612 A.D., 918 A.H.

He was also an excellent Hind\u00fa poet, and was honoured with the title of Kabr\u00e9 or the royal poet.

Akbar was for a long time inconsolable for the death of B\u00edrb\u00e1l, and as the r\u00e9j\u00e9's body was never found, a report gained currency that he was still alive among the prisoners, and it was so much encouraged by Akbar, that a long time afterwards an impostor appeared in his name; and as this second B\u00edrb\u00e1l died before he reached the court, Akbar again wore mourning as for his friend.

He succeeded his father in 1770 A.D. In August, 1771, demands were made upon him by the Governor-General for additional tribute to be paid to the Company, as the sovereign power now requiring assistance in its exigency. The r\u00e9j\u00e1 declined, pleading unwillingness, but inability. He was seized by Mr. Hastings' order at Ban\u00e1ras; a revolt took place in his behalf on the 20th August; nearly two companies of sepoys and their officers were destroyed,\u2014and the r\u00e9j\u00e1 escaped in the confusion. The Governor-General immediately assumed control of the province; and troops were called in to oppose the r\u00e9j\u00e1, who now headed the numbers flocking to his support. He was defeated at Lat\u00edfpur\u2014and lastly, his stronghold of Bij\u00e1igurh was seized, and his family plundered by a force under Major Popham. The r\u00e9j\u00e1 had fled, on his reverses at Lat\u00edfpur, to Bundelkhand. His government was declared vacant, and the zamind\u00e1r restored to the Naw\u00e1b, as a mark of favour to the r\u00e9j\u00e1, a minor. After these transactions at Ban\u00e1ras, the Governor-General proceeded to Audh, to obtain an adjustment of the heavy debts due to the Company by the W\u00e1z\u00edr 'Asaf-ud-daula.' The territories of the Begams, (one, the mother of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula, the late Naw\u00e1b\u2014the other, the mother of the W\u00e1z\u00edr) were seized, on a charge of aiding the insurrection of Chait Singh. The r\u00e9j\u00e1 found an asylum in Gw\u00e1l\u00edar for 29 years, and died there on the 29th March, 1810 A.D. The lands were transferred to a collateral branch of the family, the present representative of which is named R\u00e9j\u00e1 Ud\u00e1t N\u00e1ra\u00edn. See Balwant Singh. His estates, with title of R\u00e9j\u00e1, were presented to his nephew Bab\u00fa Muh\u00edp Narain, grandson of R\u00e9j\u00e1 Balwant Singh.\n\nChand, \u0634\u0646\u062f, or Ch\u00e1nd, called also Trikala, from his supposed prophetic spirit, was a celebrated Hind\u00fa poet or bard. He flourished towards the close of the twelfth century of the Christian era. He may be called the poet laureate of Prithiv\u00edr\u00e1j, the Chah\u00e1n emperor of Dehl\u00ed who, in his last battle with Shah\u00e1b-udd\u00edn Gh\u00f3r\u00ed, was taken prisoner and conveyed to Ghazn\u00ed, where his bard, Ch\u00e1nd, followed him. Both perished by their own hands, after causing the death of their implacable foe, Shah\u00e1b-udd\u00edn. Like the Greek bard, Homer, countries and cities have contended for the honor of having been the place of birth of this the most popular poet of the Hind\u00fas. Dehl\u00ed, Kanauj, Mah\u00f3ba, and the Panj\u00e1b, assert their respective claims, but his own testimony is decisive, whence it appears he was a native of L\u00e1hor. In his \"Prithiv\u00edr\u00e1j Chah\u00e1n R\u00e1s\u00e1,\" when enumerating some of the heroes, friends and partizans of his hero, he says, \"Nidr\u00e1n was born in Kanauj, Siluk and J\u00e1t\u00ed, the father and son, at Abu, Mundeva, the Par\u00edh\u00e1r, and in Kurrik Kangr\u00eda the Ha\u00f3l\u00ed R\u00e1o, in N\u00e1g\u00f3r, Balbhadd\u00e1r, and Ch\u00e1nd, the bard, at L\u00e1hor.\"\n\nChand Sandagar, \u0634\u0646\u062f \u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0631, a Bangali merchant.\n\nChand, \u0634\u0646\u062f, vide Teik Chand.\n\nChanda Kunwar, \u0634\u0646\u062f \u06a9\u0648\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631, the wife of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Kharg Singh of L\u00e1hor.\n\nChanda, \u0634\u0646\u062f, also called M\u00e1h-l\u00edk\u00e1, a dancing girl, or queen of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, was a poetess of much taste and merit. She is the author of a Diw\u00e1n which was revised by Sher Muhammed Kh\u00e1n Im\u00e1n. In the year 1799 A.D., in the midst of a dance, in which she bore the chief part, she presented a British officer with a copy of her poems, accompanied with the following complimentary observations, in the form of the usual g\u00e1zi:\n\nSince my heart drank from the cup of a fascinating eye,\nI wonder beside myself, like one whom wine bewilders.\nThy searching glances leave nothing unseated;\nThy face, bright as flame, consumes my heart.\nThou soughtest a Naz\u00e1r: I offer thee my head;\nAlbeit thy heart is not unveiled to me.\nMy eyes fixed on thy lineaments\u2014emotion agitates my soul,\nFresh excitement beats impatient in my heart.\nAll that Chand\u00e1 asks is, that, in either world,\nThou wouldest preserve the ashes of her heart by thy side.\n\nGarcin de Tassy informs us that there is a copy of her Diw\u00e1n in the East India House Library, which she herself presented to Captain Malcolm on the 1st of October, 1799 A.D.\n\nChanda Sahib, \u0634\u0646\u062f \u0633\u0627\u062d\u0628, surname of Husain Dost Kh\u00e1\u00e1, a relation of D\u00e9st 'Ali Kh\u00e1n, Naw\u00e1b of Arcot, whose daughter he had married. He had made his way to the highest offices of the government by the services of his prowess, and was esteemed the ablest soldier that had of late years appeared in the Carnatic. He invested the queen of Trichinopoly, and got possession of the city in 1736 A.D. He was taken prisoner by the Marhattas on the 26th March, 1741 A.D., and imprisoned in the fort of Sit\u00e1ra, but was released by the aid of Mons. Duplex in 1746, and appointed Naw\u00e1b of the Carnatic by Mus\u00e1far Jang. He was put to death in 1752 A.D., 1st Sha'b\u00e1n, 1165 A.H. by the Marhattas, and his head sent to Muhammad 'Ali Kh\u00e1n who was made Naw\u00e1b of Arcot by the English, who treated it with ignominy.\n\nChandar Bhan, \u0634\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0646, a Br\u00e1hman of Pati\u00e1la, well-versed in the Persian language, was employed as a Munshi in the service of the prince D\u00e1r\u00e1 Shikh\u00f3, the eldest son of the emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. He is the author of several Persian works, viz.: \"Guldst\u00e1,\" \"Tuhf\u00e1t-ul-Anw\u00e1r,\" \"Tuhf\u00e1t-ul-Fus-h\u00e1,\" \"Majma'-ul-Fuhr\u00e1,\" one entitled \"Ch\u00e1r Chaman,\" another called \"Mansh\u00e1 Br\u00e1hman\" being a collection of his own letters written to different persons, and also of a Diw\u00e1n in which he uses the title of Br\u00e1hman for his poetical name. After the tragic death of his employer, he retired to Ban\u00e1ras where he died in the year 1662 A.D., 1073 A.H. He had also built a house at Agra, of which no traces now remain.\n\nChand Bibi (Sultana), \u0634\u0646\u062f \u0628\u06cc\u0628\u06cc, was the daughter of Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h I of Ahmadnagar in the Dakh\u00e1n, sister to Mur\u00e1za Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, and wife of 'Al\u00ed 'Adil Sh\u00e1h I, of Bij\u00e1ip\u00far. After the death of her husband in 1680 A.D., 988 A.H., she had been queen and dowager-regent of the neighbouring kingdom of Bij\u00e1ip\u00far during the minority of her nephew Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm 'Adil Sh\u00e1h II, and was one of the most able politicians of her day. The Mughals under prince Mur\u00e1d, the son of Akbar, proceeded in November, 1595 A.D., Rab\u00ed' II, 1004 A.H., and besieged Ahmadnagar for some months, while Chand Sult\u00e1na defended the place with masculine resolution. At the same time there being a scarcity of provisions in the Mughal camp, prince Mur\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n Ahmadnagar thought it advisable to enter into a treaty with the besiegers. It was dictated by Chand Bibi that the prince should keep possession of Ber\u00e1r, and that Ahmadnagar and its dependencies, should remain with her in the name of Bah\u00e1dur, the grandson of Burh\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h. She was put to death by the Dakh\u00e1n\u00eds in the year 1599 A.D., 1008 A.H.\nChandu Lal, a Hind\u00fa, who was appointed Diw\u00e1n to the Niz\u00e1m of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d in 1808 A.D.

He was born in 1154 A.D., 549 A.H., and at the age of 13 he began to reign, but the conspiracies of his subjects obliged him to fly for safety to Avant Khan, a Tartar prince, whom he supported on his throne; but those who had been married. These ties being not binding, Avant Khan joined against Changez, who took signal vengeance on his enemies, and after almost unexampled vicissitudes, he obtained, at the age of 49, a complete victory over all those who had endeavoured to effect his ruin, and received from the Kh\u00e1ns of Tartary the title of Kh\u00e1k\u00e1n in 1206 A.D., 602 A.H., and was declared emperor of Tartary. His capital was Kar\u00e1kum. In the space of 22 years he conquered Corea, Cathay, part of China, and the noblest provinces of Asia, and became as renowned a conqueror as Alexander the Great.

His death and the circumstances connected with it, so much affected the king his father who was in a declining state of health, that he became every day worse, and died six months after.

He was also governor of Bengal for some time, and on his return to the Dakhin, the emperor being displeased with him on some account, ordered Mahabat Khan to strike off his head, which he did, and sent it to the king. This circumstance took place 1625 A.D., 1034 A.H.\n\nDarab Khan, son of Mukhtar Khan Sabzwari, a nobleman in the service of the emperor Alamgir.

His mother, Mumtaz Mahal, was the daughter of Asaf Khan, wazir, the brother of Nur Jahan Begum. In the 20th year of his age, i.e., in the year 1633 A.D., 1043 A.H., he was married to the princess Nadiya, the daughter of his uncle Sultan Parvez, by whom he had two sons, viz., Sulaiman Shikoh and Siyeh Shikoh. In 1658 A.D., during the illness of his father, several battles took place between him and his brother Aurangzeb Alamgir for the throne, in which Dara, being defeated, was at last obliged to fly towards Sindh, where he was captured by the chief of that country and brought to the presence of Aurangzeb, loaded with chains, on a sorry elephant without housings; was thrown into prison in Delhi, where after a few days, in the night of the 29th of August, 1659 O.S., 21st Zil Hijjah, 1069 A.H., he was murdered by the order of Aurangzeb; his body exhibited next morning to the populace on an elephant, and his head cut off and carried to the emperor, who ordered it to be placed on a platter, and to be wiped and washed in his presence. When he had satisfied himself that it was the real head of Dara, he began to weep, and with many expressions of sorrow, directed it with its corpse to be interred in the tomb of the emperor Humayun. Siyeh Shikoh, his son, who was also taken captive and brought with his father, was sent away in confinement to Gwalior. Sulaiman Shikoh, his eldest son, who, after the defeat of his father had taken refuge in Srinagar for some time, was subsequently, in 1670 A.D., 1071 A.H., given up by the rajah of that place to the officers of Aurangzeb, who conveyed him to Delhi. He died at Gwalior, where he and his brother Siyeh Shikoh both died within a short space. Dara Shikoh is the author of the work called \"Safinat-ul-Aulia,\" an abridgment of the Life of Muhammad, with a circumstantial detail of his wives, children, and companions, &c., also of a work entitled \"Majma-ul-Bahrain\" (i.e., the uniting of both seas,) in which he endeavours to reconcile the Brahmin religion with the Muhammedan; citing passages from the Koran to prove the several points. In 1656 he likewise, with the same intent, caused a Persian translation to be made by the Brahmans of Banaras, of the Apokrypha, a work in the Sanskrit language, of which the title signifies \"the word that is not to be said;\" meaning the secret that is not to be revealed. This book he named \"Sarr-i-Azrak;\" or Secret of Secrets; but his enemies took advantage of it, to traduce him in the esteem of his father's ministers and soldiers, and to excite against him with the epithets of Kafir and Rasif (unbeliever and blasphemer), and finally effected his ruin; for Aurangzeb his brother made a pretence of that, and consequently had all his bigotry Muhammedans to join him. Monsieur Anquetil du Perron has given a translation of this work, in two large volumes in quarto, on which a very good critique may be found in the second Number of the \"Edinburgh Review.\" There is also a copy of the Persian version of this work in the British Museum, with a MS. translation, made by N.B.

When during the fall of Delhi every body fled from the city, Dard remained in poverty contented with his lot. He was a Sufi and a good singer. A crowd of musicians used to assemble at his house on the 22nd of every month. Some biographers say that he was a disciple of Shah Gulshan, meaning Shaikh Sa'd-ullah.

In the meantime, to sanction his own measures by the appearance of legal authority, he released prince D\u00e1war Bakhsh from prison, and proclaimed him king. Nur Jah\u00e1n Begam, endeavouring to support the cause of Shahri\u00e1r, her son-in-law, was placed under temporary restraint by her brother, the waz\u00edr, who then continued his march to L\u00e1h\u00f3r.

He was a Gw\u00e1la by caste, and flourished in the reign of the Emperor Farr\u00fakh-si-yar. The wonderful feats of this man are sung or recited accompanied by the beat of a gh\u00e1li throughout Hindust\u00e1n.

A train of Artillery was brought against this place from Cawnpur, and a few hours of its tremendous fire breached the boasted fortification.\n\nDil\u00e1mi, \u062f\u06cc\u0644\u0645\u06cc, and S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00ed were two dynasties which divided between them the kingdom of Persia towards the beginning of the 10th century. They both rose to power through the favor of the Khalifa of Baghd\u00e1d, but they speedily threw off the yoke. The Dil\u00e1mi divided into two branches, exercised sovereign authority in Kirm\u00e1n, Ir\u00e1k, F\u00e1ris, Khur\u00edst\u00e1n, and Lar\u00edst\u00e1n, always acknowledging their nominal dependence on the Khalifa, and during the whole period of their rule, one of the southern branch of this family was vested with the dignity of Am\u00edr-ul-Umra, or vizir, and managed the affairs of the khalifate. Several of the Dil\u00e1mi were able and wise rulers, but Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni put an end to the rule of the northern branch in 1029 A.D., and the Salj\u00faks subjugated the southern one in 1056 A.D., by the capture of Merv, their last stronghold. Their most powerful rivals, the S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00ed, had obtained from the Khalifa the government of Transoxiana in 974 A.D., and to this Ima'il, the most celebrated prince of the family, speedily added Khw\u00e1rizm, Balhk, Khur\u00edst\u00e1n, S\u00edst\u00e1n, and many portions of northern Turki-st\u00e1n. Rebellions of provincial governors distracted the Samanida monarchy towards the end of the 10th century; and in 999 A.D. their dominions north of Persia were taken possession of by the Kh\u00e1n of K\u00e1shghar, the Persian provinces being added by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni to his dominions.

This robber assumed the lofty title of King of the two worlds, and aimed, doubtless, at carving out for himself some independent principality, after the example of Hydar 'Al\u00ed, in whose service he originally commenced his adventurous career. Subsequently he incurred the displeasure of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, who chained him like a wild beast to the walls of his dungeons in Seragapatan, from which \"durance vile\" he had been liberated by the English soldiers after the taking of Seragapatan. He then returned to Mysore with 5,000 cavalry. The Government of Madras instructed Colonel Wellesley to pursue him wherever he could be found and to hang him on the first tree. His subjugation and subsequent death (in 1800) with the extirpation of his formidable band of free-booters, relieved the English Government from an enemy, who, though by no means equal to Hydar and Tip\u00fa, might eventually have afforded considerable annoyance.\n\nDil, \u062f\u06cc\u0644, poetical name of Zorawar Kh\u00e1n of Sirkar Kol.

The Hind\u00fa histories of the kingdom of M\u00e1lwa go back as far as the reign of R\u00e9j\u00e9 Bikarm\u00e1j\u00edt, whose accession to that kingdom has given rise to an era which commences 57 years before Christ. After him reigned R\u00e9j\u00e9 Bh\u00f3j and many others, who are all mentioned among the rajas of Hindust\u00e1n. During the reign of Ghay\u00e1s-udd\u00edn Balbek, king of Delhi in the year 1310 A.D., 710 A.H., the Mu\u1e25ammadans first invaded and conquered the province of M\u00e1lwa, after which it acknowledged allegiance to that crown until the reign of Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h Tughl\u00e1k II, 1387 A.D., 790 A.H. At this period Dilawar Kh\u00e1n, a descendant on his mother's side from Sultan Sh\u00e1h-budd\u00edn Gh\u00f3rt, was appointed governor of M\u00e1lwa, previously to the accession of Mu\u1e25ammad Tughl\u00e1k, and he subsequently established his independence. In the year 1398 A.D., 801 A.H., Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h, king of Delhi, being driven from his throne by Am\u00edr Taim\u00far (Tamerlane,) made his escape to Gujr\u00e1t, and then to M\u00e1lwa, where he remained three years, after which, in 1401 A.D., 804 A.H., he, at the instance of the Delhi nobles, quitted M\u00e1lwa, in order to resume the reins of his own government. Dilawar Kh\u00e1n shortly afterwards assumed royalty and divided his kingdom into estates among his officers whom he ennobled. Dilawar Kh\u00e1n on assuming independence, took up his residence in Dh\u00e1r, which place he considered as the seat of\nhis government, but he frequently visited the city of M\u00e1ndo, remaining there sometimes for months together. He only survived his assumption of the royal titles a few years; for in the year 1405 A.D., 808 A.H., he died suddenly, and his son Alp Kh\u00e1n ascended the throne under the title of Sult\u00e1n H\u00f3shang Sh\u00e1h. Including Dilawar Kh\u00e1n eleven princes reigned in Malwa till the time of the emperor Humay\u00fan, whose son Akbar eventually subdued and attached it to the Delhi government.

Under him the atrocious seizure of Trichinopoly was perpetrated by Chanda Sahib. He was succeeded by his son Safdar 'Ali, who, after overcoming the effects of poison prepared for him by Mur\u00e1za Kh\u00e1n, fell by the poniard of a Path\u00e1n assassin, hired for the work by the same person. A storm was raised which he had not the courage to encounter; and disguising himself in female attire, he escaped from Arkat to his own fort of Vellora.\n\nDost Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, ruler of Kabul and Kundah\u00e1r, was one of the brothers of Fatha Kh\u00e1n, the celebrated waz\u00edr of Mahm\u00fad, ruler of Hind and chief of the Barakz\u00e1i clan. He was the most powerful chief in Afghanistan, and had for some years previous to the restoration of Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1-ul-Mulk by the British in 1838, ruled that country. On the death of this prince, Dost Muhammad again assumed the reins of government.\n\nOn the base and cruel murder of Fatha Kh\u00e1n by Mahm\u00fad at the instigation of Prince K\u00e1mr\u00e1n, his brothers revolted from their allegiance under the guidance of Az\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, the governor of Kashmir, and drove Mahm\u00fad and his son R\u00e1mr\u00e1n from Kabul. Az\u00edm Kh\u00e1n in the first instance offered the vacant throne to Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1, but offended by some personal slight, withdrew his support, and placed in his room, Ay\u00fab, a brother of Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1, who was content to take the trappings with the power of royalty. On Az\u00edm Kh\u00e1n's death, his brothers dissatisfied with their position conspired against his son, Hab\u00edb-All\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n, and seizing upon personal threats of overthrowing him from his guard induced his mother to deliver up the residue of Az\u00edm Kh\u00e1n's immense wealth. Ay\u00fab's son was killed in these disputes, and he himself alarmed by these scenes of violence, fled to L\u00e1h\u00f3r. Dost Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, the most talented of the brothers, then took possession of the throne and became de facto king of Kabul. Sher Dil Kh\u00e1n, accompanied by four brothers, carried off about half a million sterling of Az\u00edm Kh\u00e1n's money, and seated himself in Kandah\u00e1r, as an independent chieftain. He and one of his brothers died some years ago; and Kandah\u00e1r was until lately ruled by Roh\u00e1n Dil Kh\u00e1n, assisted by his two surviving brothers Rah\u00edm Dil and Mir Dil. In the year 1839 the British army entered Kabul and placed Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1-ul-Mulk on the throne on the 8th May, and Dost Muhammad Kh\u00e1n surrendered to the British Envoy and Minister in Kabul on the 1st November, after having defeated in 2nd Bengal Cavalry, a desperate charge. He was subsequently sent down to Calcutta, where he arrived, accompanied by one of his sons, on the 23rd May, 1841. He was set free in November 1842 and returned to Kabul, where he reigned as before till his death, which took place on the 9th June, 1863 A.D., 21st Zil-hijjah 1279 A.H., and his youngest son Amir Sher Ali succeeded him.\n\nDoulat Khan Lodi, who, according to Firishta, was an Afgh\u00e1n by birth, originally a private Secretary, who after passing through various offices was raised by Sultan Mahm\u00fad Tughl\u00e1k, and attained the title of Az\u00edm Mum\u00e1l\u00edk. After the death of Mahm\u00fad, the nobles raised him to the throne of Delhi in April, 1413 A.D., 816 A.H. In March 1414, 15th Rah\u00ed I, 817 A.H., Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, governor of Mult\u00e1n, invaded Dakh\u00e1n, defeated a siege of four days, obliged Doulat Kh\u00e1n on the 4th June 1414, Jam\u00e1da I, 817 A.H., to surrender. He was instantly confined in the fort of Pir\u00f3z-b\u00e1d, where he died after two months.\n\nDoulat Khan Lodi, who invited B\u00e1bar Sh\u00e1h to India, was a descendant of the race of that name who heretofore reigned at Dehl\u00ed.

His violence, rapacity and lawless ambition, were the main causes of the war in 1802 with the confederate Marhatta chieftains. Hostilities having broken out with the British, Sir Arthur Wellesley (afterwards Duke of Wellington) defeated Doulat R\u00e1j at Assaye in 1803, while Lord Lake drove the Marhattas from the whole of the Doab. He married Baji B\u00e1\u00ed, resigned 33 years, and died on the 21st March, 1827, 21st Shaban 1242 A.H.

The work was written in 1466 A.H., 896 A.H. and contains the Lives of Memoirs of ten Arabian and one hundred and thirty-four Persian poets, with various quotations from their works, and anecdotes of the princes at whose court they resided. It also gives an account of six poets then residing in H\u00edr\u00e1t; two of whom were principal ministers of the Sult\u00e1n; viz., 'Al\u00edsh\u00e9r, and Amir Shaikh Ahmad Sub\u00e9li.

He died previous to the Rohila war which took place in 1774 A.D., leaving three sons, the eldest of whom Muhib-ullah Kh\u00e1n, succeeded to the largest portion of his territories.\n\n**Dunyapat Singh (raja).** His father died in 1790 A.D., at which time he was only seven years of age. He inherited from his grandfather R\u00fap R\u00e1o the Chaklas of K\u00f3ya, Fatehpur and Kara, but was dispossessed by the Naw\u00e1b W\u00e1z\u00edr, and a N\u00e1n\u00e1r allowance of 24,000 rupees granted to the raja on his exclusion. This was subsequently reduced to 7,500 rupees. The original grant amounted to 62,000 per annum, payable from 14 mah\u00e1s, but in 1770 A.D., the Naw\u00e1b Najaf Kh\u00e1n acquiring unlimited dominion over these provinces, possessed by his father of eleven of the villages, by which his income was reduced to 20,000 rupees. In 1787 his father was dispossessed of the remaining three villages by Zain-ul-'Abid\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, the 'Amil, but as the raja was about to proceed to hostilities, the 'Amil agreed to allow him 10,000 Rs. for the first year, and 20,000 thereafter, but failed in the fulfilment of his promise. In 1792 A.D., Zain-ul-'Abid\u00edn died, and was succeeded by his son B\u00e1kar 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, and from that period up to 1802, the raja Duni\u00e1pat Singh was allowed 8,000 rupees per annum, which was confirmed by Government in 1806 in perpetuity.\n\n**Duplexix,** a French officer, governor of Pondicherry.

Vide Silh\u00e1ddi.\n\n**Durgawati (Rani),** the daughter of the raja of Mah\u00f3ba, who was much celebrated for her singular beauty. Overtures had been made for an union with Dalpat S\u00e1h, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Singalgarh (which is situated on the brow of a hill that commands a pass on the road about half way between Garha and Sangar;) but the proposal was rejected on the ground of a previous engagement, and some inferiority of caste on the part of the Garha family, who was of the race of the Chandel r\u00e1jputs. Dalpat S\u00e1h was a man of uncommonly fine appearance, and this added to the celebrity of his father's name and extent of his dominions, made Durgawati as desirable as himself for the union, but he was by her given to understand, that she must be relinquished or taken by force, since the difference of caste would of itself be other than an insurmountable obstacle. He marched with all his troops he could assemble, met those of her father and his rival,\u2014gained a victory and brought off Durgawati as the prize to the fort of Singalgarh. Dalpat S\u00e1h died four years after their marriage, leaving a son named Bir N\u00e1r\u00edy\u00e1n about three years of age, and his widow as regent during his minority. Asaf Kh\u00e1n, the imperial viceroy at Kara M\u00e1nikpur on the Ganges in the province of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, invited by the prospect of appropriating so fine a country and so much wealth as she was reputed to possess, invaded her dominions in the year 1564 A.D., at the head of 6,000 cavalry and 12,000 well disciplined infantry, with a train of artillery. He was met by the queen at the head of her troops, and an action took place in which she was defeated. She received a wound from an arrow in the eye; and her only son, then about 18 years of age, was severely wounded and taken to the rear. At this moment she received another arrow in the neck; and seeing her troops give way and the enemy closing around her, she snatched a dagger from the driver of her elephant, and plunged it in her own bosom. Her son was taken off the field, and was, unperceived by the enemy, conveyed back to the palace at Ch\u00far\u00e1garh, to which Asaf Kh\u00e1n returned immediately after his victory and laid siege. The young prince was killed in the siege; and the women set fire to the place under the apprehension of suffering dishonor if they fell alive into the hands of the enemy. Two females are said to have escaped, the sister of the queen, and a young princess who had been betrothed to the young prince Bir N\u00e1r\u00edy\u00e1n; and these two are said to have been sent to the emperor Akbar. In this district of Jahip\u00far, the marble rocks and the palace called Madan Mahal is worth seeing. There is some doggerel rhyme about this palace which is not generally known, though of some interest. This building stands on a single granite boulder, and was constructed by the Gond princess Ran\u00ed Durgawati, at the time of the Muhammadan invasion of Central India. Years after the cession of the country to the British, a wag or a Pandit wrote on the entrance door of the palace the following lines:\n\nMadan Mahal k\u00e1 chhain m\u00e9,\nDo t\u00e1ngon k\u00e1 b\u00edch,\nGarh nan lakh rupi,\nAur sop\u00e1 k\u00e1 do fgt.\n\nTranslation\u2014\n\nIn the shade of Madan Mahal\nBetween two boulders\nThere are buried nine lakhs of rupees\nAnd two bricks of gold.\n\nIt did not take long for the news of the appearance of this writing on the door to spread abroad, and the very person to fall a dupe to the Pandit's trick was Captain Wheatley, at that time a Political Assistant at Jalap\u00far. He mustered some poons and laborers, and having proceeded to the spot, commenced digging for the treasure on the part of Government. The native lady, in whose possession was the village lands on which the palace stood, came rushing down to the Agent to the Governor-General and represented that she was being plundered of her\ntreasure by Captain Wheatley. \"Pagli,\" replied Sir Wm. Sleeman, \"he is as mad as you are; the Pandit would not have divulged the secret were it of much value.\" Many years have since elapsed, and many others not possessed of Sir William's wisdom have fallen dupes to the Pandit's poetical trick; and, but for the very durable nature of the marbles, there have been enough of excavations made in and about the building to raze it to the ground.\n\nE.\n\nEgypt, kings of, vide Moizx-li-din-allah Abi Tamim Ma'd.\n\nEkkoji, the founder of the Tanjore family was the son of Shahji Bhosla, and brother of Seiwaji, but from another consort.

But when the information of his father's death reached him, he threw himself on the compassion and fidelity of Saiyad Husain Ali Khan, the governor of Behar, who warmly espoused his cause, and prevailed on his brother, Saiyad Abdullah Khan, governor of Allahabad, to adopt the same course. By the aid of Abbas noblemen, Farrukh-siyar assembled an army at Allahabad, marched towards Agra, defeated Jahandar Shah, took him prisoner, and having murdered him, he ascended the throne in the fort of Delhi on Friday the 9th of January, 1713, O.S., 23rd Zil-hijjah, 1124 A.H.

It contains the stories of the ancient kings of Persia, from the reign of the first king, Kaisumura, to the death of Yezd\u00edjard III, the last monarch of the S\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00edan race, who was deprived of his kingdom 641 A.D., by the invasion of the Arabs during the Khilaf\u00e1t of 'Umar, the second Khalif after Muhammed. It is the labour of 30 years, and consists of 60,000 verses, each of which is a distich. The following circumstances respecting the origin of the poem and the life of the poet, are chiefly derived from the preface to the copy of the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma, which was collated 1426 A.D., 829 A.H., by order of B\u00e1s\u00ednghur Mirz\u00e1, the grandson of Amir Taimur. It appears from that preface, that Yezd\u00edjard, the last king of the S\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00edan race, took considerable pains in collecting all the chronicles, histories, and traditions connected with Persia and the reigns of its country, from the time of Kaisumura to the accession of the Khilaf\u00e1t, which by his direction were digested and brought into one view, and formed the book known by the name of \"Siar-ul-Mah\u00e1k,\" or the Bast\u00e1n N\u00e1ma. When the followers of Muhammed overturned the Persian monarchy, this work was found in the plundered library of Yazd\u00edjard. In the tenth century one of the kings of the S\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00edan dynasty, directed D\u00e1k\u00edki the poet to verify that extensive work, but the poet only lived to finish a thousand distiches, having been assassinated by his own slaves. Nothing further was done till the reign of Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad, when a romantic accident furnished the Sult\u00e1n with a copy of the Bast\u00e1n N\u00e1ma, the existence of which was till then unknown to him. From this work, he selected seven stories which he delivered to seven poets to be composed in verse, that he might be able to ascertain the merits of each competitor. The poet Unscarf gained the palm, and he was accordingly ordered to arrange the whole poem. Firdaus\u00ed was at this time at his native city, where he cultivated his poetical talents with assiduity and success. He had heard of the attempt of D\u00e1k\u00edki, and of the determination of the reigning king Mahm\u00fad, to patronize an undertaking which\npromised to add lustre to the age in which he lived. Having fortunately succeeded in procuring a copy of the B\u00e1st\u00e1n N\u00e1ma, he pursued his studies with unremitting zeal, and soon produced that part of the poem in which the battles of Zuh\u00e1k and Farid\u00fan are described. The performance was universally read and admired, and it was not long before his fame reached the ears of the Sult\u00e1n, who immediately invited him to his court. It is related that when Firdausi, on the invitation of the Sult\u00e1n, reached the capital of Ghazni, he happened to pass a public garden where the three royal poets, Unsr\u00e1, Asjad\u00ed and Farrukh\u00ed were enjoying themselves. The poets observed him approach and at once agreed that if the stranger chanced to have any taste for poetry, which they intended to put to test, he should be admitted to their friendship, and in order to decide as to his merits they selected among themselves four riddles each in his own hemistich, and leave to Firdausi to complete the fourth, but at the same time satisfied in their own minds, that there was no other word in the Persian language that would rhyme with the three, which they had taken care to pre-occupy. Firdausi joining them and hearing the proposal, promised to exert his powers. They then commenced each with an extemporaneous hemistich:\n\nUnsr\u00e1 ....... The light of the moon to thy splendour is weak,\nAsjad\u00ed ....... The rose is eclipsed by the bloom of thy cheek;\nFarrukh\u00ed .... Thy eye-lashes dart through the folds of the Joshan,\nFirdausi .... Like the javelin of Geo in the battle with Pushan.\n\nThe poets were astonished at the readiness of the stranger, and ashamed at being totally ignorant of the story of Geo and Pushan, which Firdausi related as described in the B\u00e1st\u00e1n N\u00e1ma. They immediately treated him with the greatest kindness and respect, and afterwards introduced him to Mahm\u00fad, as a poet capable of undertaking the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma. Mahm\u00fad considered himself never so much honored as when Firdausi set his foot at Ghazni; he was never more proud, than that Firdausi was by his command, composing, in his faultless verse, a history of the monarchs of Persia, his predecessors. No reward then appeared to him too great to offer, to induce the poet to undertake such a task, no promises too splendid to excite him. \"Write, unequalled one,\" cried he, \"and for every thousand complete, thousand pieces of gold shall be thine.\" Firdausi obeyed, but resolved to accept no reward till he had completed the work he had undertaken, and for thirty years he studied and laboured that the poem might be worthy of eternal fame. In this he succeeded, and presented an elegant copy of his book to Mahm\u00fad, but the patience of the Sult\u00e1n was exhausted, his enthusiasm was gone, his liberality had faded away, and when the 60,000 couplets of the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma was ended, there was a pause, which brought to the poet disappointment and to the monarch such everlasting disgrace as has obliterated all his triumphs. Mahm\u00fad received the book, coldly applauded his diligence and dismissed him. Many months elapsed, and Firdausi heard no more of his work: he then took occasion to remind the king of it by the following epigram:\n\n'Tis said our monarch's liberal mind,\nIs like the ocean unconfined,\nHappy are they who prove it so,\n'Tis not for me that truth to know.\nI've plunged within its waves, 'tis true,\nBut not a single pearl could view.\n\nShamed, piqued, and offended at this freedom, the Sult\u00e1n ordered 60,000 pieces of silver dirhams to be sent to the author, instead of the gold which he had promised. Firdausi was in the bath at the time the money arrived, and his rage and amazement exceeded all bounds when he found himself thus insulted. He immediately distributed the paltry sum amongst the attendants of the bath and the slave who brought it. The excited poet then relieved his mind by a satire full of stinging invective, and caused it to be transmitted to the favorite Wazir who had instigated the Sult\u00e1n against him; it was carefully sealed up, with directions that it should be read to Mahm\u00fad on some occasion when his mind was perturbed with affairs of State, as it was a poem likely to afford him entertainment. Firdausi having thus prepared his vengeance, quitted the court and was safely arrived in M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n where news reached him that his lines had fully answered the purpose he had intended they should do. Mahm\u00fad had heard and trembled, and too late discovered that he had ruined his own reputation for ever. After his satire had been read by Mahm\u00fad, the poet feared to remain too long in one place, he therefore shunned the sight of the Khalifa of Baghd\u00e1d, in whose honor he added a 1,000 couplets to the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma, and who rewarded him with 60,000 gold dinars which had been withheld by Mahm\u00fad. Mahm\u00fad pretended to have discovered that his Wazir had deceived him in attributing impiety to Firdausi, and he at once sacrificed that favorite, dismissing him with disgrace. Thinking, by a tardy act of liberality, to repair his former meanness, Mahm\u00fad dispatched to Firdausi the 60,000 pieces he had promised, a robe of State, and many apologies and expressions of friendship; but the poet was dead, having expired in his native town full of years and honours, surrounded by his friends and kindred. Firdausi died at Tus (now called Mashhad) his native country in 1020 A.D., 411 A.H., aged 89 years; but Haji Khalf\u00e1 says, he died in 1024 A.D., 416 A.H. Besides the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma, he is the author of other poems called \"Abi\u00e1t Firdausi.\"\n\nFirdausi-al-Thaull, \u0641\u0631\u062f\u0648\u0633\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u0640 \u062b\u0639\u0644\u0628, a Turkish historian, and author of the Turkish work called \"Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma\" which comprises the history of all the ancient kings of the East. Bayazid or Bajazet II, to whom the book was dedicated, ordered the author to reduce it from its original bulk of 300 volumes to 80. Firdausi, however, felt so mortified at this proposal, that he preferred leaving the country altogether, and emigrated to Khuras\u00e1n, in Persia. Firdausi flourished in 1500 A.D.\n\nFirishta, \u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0634\u062a\u0627, whose proper name is Muhammad K\u00e1s\u00edm, and who is the author of the history called \"T\u00e1r\u00edkh Firish-ta,\" was born at Astrabad on the borders of the Caspian Sea, about the year 1570 or 1550 A.D., 978 or 968 A.H. His father a learned man, by name Ghul\u00e1m 'Al\u00ed Hind\u00fa Shah, left his native country when the author was very young and travelled into India. He eventually became Ahmad-nagar in the Dakh\u00e1n during the reign of Murtaza Nizam Shah I, and was appointed by the Sult\u00e1n to instruct his son Mir\u00e1n Husain, in the Persian language, but he soon died after his selection, and Firish-ta was left an orphan in early youth. After the death of Murtaza Nizam Shah in 1589 A.D., 996 A.H., he proceeded to Bij\u00e1pur, and was presented by Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, minister to Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm 'Adil Shah II, by whose request he wrote the history which goes by his name, in the year 1023 Hijr\u00ed (1614 A.D.) The year of his death is altogether unknown. Brigg supposes that it occurred in 1612 A.D., 1021 A.H., making him only 41 years of age. M. J. Mohl supposes him to have revised his work up to at least 1623 A.D., 1033 A.H., making his age not less than 73, as he supposes him to have been born in 1550 A.D. Firish-ta styles his work, \"Gul\u00e1b-i-Thuluth,\" and named N\u00e1ma-e-N\u00e1ma. Its former name is derived from the king to whom it was dedicated; and hence it is frequently quoted under the name of \"T\u00e1r\u00edkh Thuluth.\" The latter name was given to it in commemoration of the new capital, Naur\u00e1s, which his patron Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm 'Adil Shah, commenced building in the year 1599 A.D.

After the death of that tyrant, he attended the court of his son Shahrukh Mirza, and received from the young prince Mirza Baisanghar every demonstration of kindness and regard. To him he dedicated his works under the name of \"Zubdat-ut-Tawarikh Baisanghan,\" which contains a complete history of the world, and an account of the institutions and religions of different peoples down to 1425 A.D., 829 A.H.

He was born at Shiraz in the reign of the Safavids, and was living at the time when Amir Timur (Tamerlane) defeated Shah Mansur, the last Sultans of the dynasty. The language of Hafiz has been styled among the Musalmans \"Liyan-ul-Ghaib,\" the language of mystery. From his frequent celebration of love and wine in his odes he has not improperly been denominated, by some Orientalists, the Anarchon of Persia. He died in 1389 A.D., 971 A.H. at Shiraz, where his tomb is yet to be seen at a place called Musalla, and is visited as a sacred spot by pilgrims of all ages. After his death a collection of 569 of his odes was made by Sayyid Kasim Ansari, entitled \"Diwan Hafiz.\" A few of his poems may be understood in a literal sense; but in general they are figurative, and allude to the Sufi doctrines; most of them have been at different times translated into some of the European languages. At the head of the English translators, stand Sir W. Jones, Moore, Richardson and Carlyle. There have been two other Persian poets of the name of Hafiz, one of them named Halwai, the other is named the composer, who lived in the reign of Sultan Shahrukh, the son of Tamerlane, and the other was named Ajin Rumi. Many zealons admirers of Hafiz insist, that by wine he invariably means devotion; and they have gone so far as to compose a dictionary of words in the language, as they call it, of the Sufis: in that vocabulary, sleep is explained by meditation on the divine perfections, and perfume by hope of the divine favor; gates are illespas of grace; kisses and embraces, the raptures of piety; idolaters, infidels, and libertines, are men of the purest religion, and their idol is the Creator himself; the tavern is a retired oratory, and its keeper, a sage instructor; beauty denotes the perfection of the Supreme Being; tresses are the expansion of his glory; lips the hidden mysteries of his essence; down on the cheek, the world of spirits, who encircle his throne; and a black mole the point of indivisible unity; lastly, uncomeliness, worth, and inactivity mean religious ardour and abstraction from all terrestrial thoughts.\n\nHafiz Muhammad, author of the \"Hawf Saghir.\"\n\nHafiz Rahmat Khan, a celebrated Rohila chief.

This battle took place in the month of March, 625 A.D., Shawwal, 3 A.H.\n\nHamza Bano Begum, daughter of Shah Jehan by Kandahari Begum, daughter of Muzaffar Husain Mirza of the royal race of Shah Ismail Safawi. She was born in the year 1019 A.H.\n\nHamza Mirza, the eldest son of Sultan Muhammad Khuda Banda, and the grandson of Shah Tahmasp I of the Safavi family of Persia. His father, on account of a natural weakness in his eyes, which rendered him almost blind, had at first entrusted the charge of the empire to his wazir, Mirza Sulaiman; when that nobleman was slain, he created his own son, Hamza Mirza, regent of the empire. This prince, by his valour, extricated his weak father from all the difficulties with which he was surrounded. But this gleam of good fortune soon vanished. This gallant prince was stabbed by a barber, in his own private apartments on the 24th of November, 1586 A.D., 92nd Zil-hijja 994 A.H.\n\nHanbal, Imam, or Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, the son of Muhammad-Ibn-Hanbal, was the fourth Imam or founder of one of the four orthodox sects of the Sunnis called Hanbalites. This sect made a great noise in Baghdad in the reign of the Khalif Al-Mutakadir in 929 A.D., 317 A.H., Meroufi chief of the sect, had asserted that God had placed Muhammad on his throne, which assertion he founded upon the passage of the Koran: \"Thy Lord shall soon give thee a considerable place or station.\" All the other sects of the Musalmans regard the explanation of the Hanbalites as a shocking impiety. They maintain that this 'considerable place or station' was the post or quality of a mediator, which they affirm to belong to their prophet. This dispute passed from the schools to the public assemblies. At length they came from words to blows which cost the lives of several thousands. In the year 935 A.D., 323 A.H., the Hanbalites became so insolent, that they marched in arms on the city of Baghdad, and plundered the shops on pretence that wine was drunk in them. Ahmad was a traditionist of the first class, and composed a collection of authenticated traditions called \"Musnad\" more copious than those any other person had till then been able to form: it is said that he knew by-heart one million of these traditions. He was born in the year 786 A.D., 164 A.H., and died on the 31st July, 855 A.D., 12th Rabii, 241 A.H., in the reign of the Khalif Al-Mutawakkil, and was buried at Baghdad. It was estimated that the number of men present at his funeral was 800,000, and women 60,000; and it is said that 20,000 Christians, Jews and Magians became Moslems on the day of his death. In the year 835 A.D., Ramazan, 220 A.H., some time in the month of September, he was required by the Khalif Al-Motassim Billah to declare that the Koran was created, but would not, and although beaten and imprisoned, persisted in his refusal. The eternity of the Koran, considered as the word of God, is the orthodox Moslem doctrine.\n\nHandal Mirza, son of Humayun, was born in the year 1618 A.D., 924 A.H. He lost his life in a night attack made by his brother Kamran Mirza on the emperor Humayun near Khubar in the province of Kabul, on the 19th of November, 1561 A.D., 21st Zi-Ka'da, 958 A.H. He is buried at Kabul close to the tomb of the emperor Babur Shah. Humayun, out of affection to the memory of Handal Mirza, in the same year, gave the daughter of that prince, Raza Sultana, to his son Akbar in marriage.\n\nHani, surname of Muhammad-bin-Alf, a poet who died in the year 1389 A.D., 738 A.H.\n\nHanifa Imam, also called Abu Hanifa and Imam Azim, was one of the four Jurisconsults of Mecca; viz., Imam Hanifa, Imam Hanbal, Imam Shafi'i and Imam Malik, from whom are derived the various Codes of Muhammadan Jurisprudence. He was one of the most celebrated doctors of the Musalmans, and chief of the sect of Hanifites; and though his sect is the principal of the four which now independently follow, he was ill-used during his lifetime, and died in the prison at Baghdad 767 A.D., 150 A.H. His principal works are, the \"Musnad,\" i.e., the foundation of his sect, wherein he established all the points of the Musluman faith: a Treatise entitled \"Fikrakam,\" or Scholastic Divinity; and a Catechism called \"Musa'il-ul-Islam,\" i.e., the Instructor.\n\nHis principal work is entitled the \"Fikrakam,\" it treats of the Ilm-ul-Kalam, and has been commented upon by various writers, many of whom are mentioned by Haji Khalfa. Vide Abu Hanifa. Some say that the Musnad was written by Imam Hanbal. By the Shiites he is as much detested and censured, as by their antagonists he is admired and exalted. For allowing his disciples to drink nektar, which is a wine made of dates, he is accused by the Persians of departing from the clear injunction of the Prophet against all intoxicating beverages.\n\nHarindar Narain Bhup, Maharaja, the raja of Kuch Behar, who died at Benares on the 30th May, 1839, aged 70 years. He was of the Rajbansi caste, and a follower of Siva, and his style of living was very unlike that of a Hindu. He used to marry without any regard to caste, and entered into the connubial relation with any woman he took a fancy to. He did not even spare married women. The number of his wives or rani's was no less than 1200!\nHari Bao Holkar, the cousin and successor of Malhar Rao III, the adopted son and successor of Jaswant Rao Holkar.

He was one of the ablest writers of his time, and is the author of the \"Mukammat Hariri,\" a work consisting of 50 Oratorical, Poetical, Moral, Economic, and Satirical discourses, supposed to have been spoken or read in public assemblies; but which were composed by the author at the desire of Anushirwan ibn Khalid, wazir to Sultan Muhammad Saljuki. He died at Basra in the year 1122 A.H., 516 A.D. Poets, historians, grammarians and lexicographers look upon the Mukammat as the highest authority, and next to the Koran, as far at least as language is concerned. His book has been translated either entirely or partially into nearly every Eastern and European tongue.\n\nHarkaran, the son of Mathum Dasi, a Kambhoj of Multan, was a Munshi in the service of Nawab Ya'far Khan, and is the author of a collection of letters called \"Lahkha Harkaran,\" or the Forms of Harkaran, translated into English by Dr. Francis Balfour, M.D. The second edition of this work was printed in England in 1804.\n\nHarun-al-Rashid, Vide Al-Rashid.\n\nHasan, son of Sahil or Sahl, was governor of Chaldees about the year 830 A.D., under the Khalif Al-Mamun who married Turan Dukht his daughter.

He is the author of a book called \"Bhoghal,\" or the \"Kok Shaster.\" It is a curious but obscene satire on women, said to be a translation or paraphrase from the Sanskrit in Hindi verse. There is another translation of the same book in Persian prose called \"Lazzat un-Nisa,\" by Ziyyuddin Nakhahabi.\n\nHasan Askari, Imam, or Abul Hasan 'Ali al-Askari, was the eleventh Imam of the race of 'Ali, and the eldest son of Imam 'Ali Naki who was the tenth. He was born at Medina in the year 846 A.D., 232 A.H., and died on the 6th November 874 A.D., 22nd Muharram, 261 A.H., aged 28 years. He is buried at Sarmanre in Baghdad close to the tomb of his father.\n\nHasan Basri, Khwaja, a native of Basra, and a very pious Musulman, who is said to have possessed all the branches of science, and was noted for self-mortification, fear of God and devotion. He is the author of a Divan or book of Odes in Arabic. He was born in 642 A.D., 21 A.H., and died on the 11th October, 728 A.D., 1st Rajab, 110 A.H., aged 89 lunar years, and was buried at Basra.\n\nHasan Beg, (Khani, Badakhshi), Shaikh Umari was a good soldier. He was made a commander of 2500 for his services in Bangash, and was put towards the end of Akbar's reign, in charge of Kabul, receiving Fort Rohtas in the Panjab as jagir. Hasan Beg, after making a useless attempt to incriminate others, was put into a cow-hide and in this state he was tied to donkeys and carried through the bazar. He died after a few hours from suffocation. Vide Ain, I. 464.\n\nHasan-bin-Muhammad Khaki-al-Shirazi, who came to India in the time of the emperor Akbar and obtained different offices under the government. He is the author of a history also called \"Muntakhib-at-Tawarikh,\" besides the one written by Abdul Kadir Badoni. He commenced the work before the close of Akbar's reign, and completed it in the fifth year of the emperor Jahangir, i.e., 1610 A.D., 1019 A.H., in which year, he tells us, he was appointed Diwan of Patna.\n\nHasan-bin-Muhammad Sharif, author of the \"Anfa-ul-Ushshak,\" the lover's companion, containing an explanation of all the metaphors and phrases used by the poets; with numerous quotations from those held in the greatest estimation. Vide Khadin.\n\nHasan-bin-Sabah, vide Hasan Sabbah.\n\nHasan Buzurg, also called Sheikh Hasan, Amir Hasan Yikani, and Amr Hasan Navian, Kaykaki, the son of Amir Yikani Jalayer. He was an immediate descendant of Sultan Arghun Khan, king of Persia, (whose sister was his mother,) and one of the principal chiefs of the Mughals in the reign of Sultan Abu Sa'id. He married Baghdadi Khatai, daughter of Amir Choban or Jovian, but the prince being deeply enamoured of her charms, Amir Hasan, after the death of her father, was forced to resign his consort to him in 1327 A.D., 728 A.H. A few years after the death of Abu Sa'id, Amir Hasan married his widow Dihahd Khan, went to Baghdad, seized that city, and became the founder of a petty dynasty of princes. His life was passed in contests to establish his authority over the territories of Baghdad, and he died before this object of his ambition was accomplished, in July 1356 A.D., Rajab, 767 A.H. His son Sultan Owes Jalayer more fortunate: he not only succeeded in completing the conquest his father had commenced, but carried his arms into Asurbafian and Khurasan. Sultan Owes died in October 1374 A.D., 776 A.H., and left his government to his second son Sultan Husain Jalayer. This excellent prince, who is also alike celebrated for his benevolence and love of justice, lost his life in an action in 1382 A.D., 784 A.H., with his brother Ahmad, surnamed Yikani, a cruel and unjust ruler, whose enormities compelled his subjects to invite Amir Taimur (Tamerlane) to their relief in 1383 A.D., and almost the whole of the future life of Ahmad passed in an infectious sickness, and then convalescence. He fled to Egypt for safety, and when, after the death of Taimur, he returned to recover his dominions, he was taken and put to death by Kara Yusuf, a Turkman chief in 1410 A.D., 813 A.H.\n\nHasan Imam, the eldest son of 'Ali, the son of Abu Talib, and Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad; was born on the 1st March, 626 A.D., 16th Ramazan, 3 A.H. After the death of his father in January 661 A.D., Ramazan, 40 A.H., he succeeded him as second Imam, and was proclaimed Khalif by the Arabians, but perceiving the people divided and himself ill-used, he after six months resigned the Khilafat to Mu'awiya, who assigned to him about 150,000 pounds a year, besides\nlarge presents. After this Hassan and his brother Husain retired and lived privately at Madina, where after a few years he died of poison, administered to him by one of his wives, whom Yazid, the son of Mu'awiya suborned to commit that wickedness, on the promise of marrying her afterwards. But instead of a new husband, she was forced to be contented with a good sum of money which Mu'awiya gave her for her pains; for Yazid was not so mad as to trust himself to her embraces. This mournful event took place on the night of the 17th March, 669 or 670 A.D., 7th Safar, 49 A.H. He was buried in Madina at a place called Bakis. Hassan is said to have been in person very like his grandfathers Mu'awiya and Mo'awiya, when he was born, spit in his mouth and named him Hassan. He had twenty children, fifteen sons and five daughters. Though his wives were remarkably fond of him, yet he was apt very frequently to divorce them and marry new ones.\n\nHasan Kashi, Moulana, a poet who was a native of Kashan. He is the author of many Kasideh and Ghazals.

He was one of the chiefs who, during the period of trouble and confusion which took place after the death of Sultan Abu Sa'id, king of Persia, in 1335 A.D., rose to eminence. He fought several battles with Amir Hasan Burzurg, and met his death accidentally by the hands of his unclesome wife, in December 1343 A.D., Rajah, 744 A.H.\n\nHasan Maimandi, \u0645\u06cc\u0645\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u062d\u0633\u0646. It is recorded by some that he was one of the ministers of Sultan Mahmud of Gharni. This statement is altogether incorrect and unfounded, says Mr. Elliot, as it is not mentioned by any great historian. But his son who is commonly called Ahmad-bin-Hasan Maimandi was a minister of that monarch. Hassan Maimandi was, during the lifetime of Sultan Nasiruddin Subuktigin, employed as Diwan or Collector of Revenues at Kasba Bust; but Nasiruddin was led by the secret machinations of his enemies to entertain an unfavourable opinion of him, till he was at last, in consequence of his having been convicted of extortion and fraud to a large amount, hanged by order of that Sultan; so that the general notion which prevails that he was the wazir of Sultan Mahmud, is erroneous.\n\nHasan, Mir, \u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u062d\u0633\u0646, a Hindustani poet of Lakhnau, and author of the novel called \"Masnavi Mir Hasan,\" containing the loves of Badri-i-Munir and Benazir in Urdu verse, which he completed and dedicated to Nawab Asaf-uddaula in the year 1785 A.D., 1199 A.H. It is also called \"Sahir-ul-Bayan.\" His successor was Hirsi, but he was born at Delhi, and went early in life to Lakhnau, where he was supported by Nawab Safdar Jang and his son Mirza Nawazish Ali Khan. He is also the author of a Diwan of about 8000 verses, and of a Tazkira of Urdu poets. He died in 1790 A.D., 1204 A.H. His father's name was Mir Ghulam Hussain Zadik.\n\nHasan Mirza, \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u062d\u0633\u0646, son of Mulla Abdur Razak of Lahijan.

He was styled Sheikh-ul-Jabal, an Arabic title, which signifies \"the chief of the mountains.\" The name by which this ruler and his descendants are indiscriminately known in European history, is, \"The Old Man of the Mountain.\" His followers or descendants were also called Hasani, and the English word \"assassin\" is supposed to have been formed from a corruption of this term. Hassan Sabbah was at first a mace-bearer to Sultan Alp Arslan; but in consequence of a quarrel with Nizam-ul-Mulk, the minister of that prince, he retired to Ray, his native country; and from thence, to Syria, where he entered into the service of a chief of the family of Isma'il the son of Ja'far Sadiq, who adopted the tenets of that sect. The first object of Hassan was to possess himself of a stronghold; and he succeeded in gaining by stratagem the mountain fort of Alamut, situated between Kazwin and Gilan. The fort was built by Hasan-bin-Zaid in the year 860 A.D., 246 A.H.; and Hassan Sabbah took it in 1089 A.D., 482 A.H. From this fortress he commenced depredations on the surrounding country, and added several other hill forts to the one he had already seized. That of Riddar, which is also near Kazwin, was next to Alamut in consequence. Malik Shah Saljuqi, the reigning Sultan, had sent a force to reduce him, but without any success. In the month of October, 1092 A.D., Ramazan, 485 A.H., Nizam-ul-Mulk, who was then following the royal camp from Isfahan to Baghdad, was stabbed by one of the followers of Hassan Sabbah, who was his personal enemy. Hassan Sabbah died in 1124 A.D., 518 A.H. Ruknuddin, who was the last of this family, and who is better known under the name of Kahir Shah or Khur Shah, after a weak and ineffectual struggle fell before Halakd. That conqueror not only made him prisoner, but took and dismantled all his strongholds. This event took place in the month of November, 1256 A.D., Zida' 654 A.H. It was his father Al-Afduddin Muhammad who forced Nasiruddin Tusi to remain with him for some years, till he was released by Halakd Kh\u00e1n. Vide Ismaili and Ismailis. The successor of Hassan was Burzurg Umed.\n\nHasan Salimi, \u0633\u0644\u06cc\u0645\u06cc \u062d\u0633\u0646, vide Salimi.\n\nHasan Sanjar, Khwaja, \u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0633\u0646\u062c\u0631, also called Khwaja Hasan Dehlawi, a celebrated Persian poet of Delhi, who was a contemporary of the famous Amir Khwaja, and had become at the age of 50 years a disciple of Sheikh Nizamuddin Aulia.

Nay, so great veneration is the memory of Hashim held in by the Arabs, that from him the family of Muhammad among them are called Hashimites.

Having finished his studies under the patronage and instruction of his uncle, Hatifi, with his permission, secluded himself from the world. When Shah Isma'il Safawi fought the Uzbak Tartars in Khurasan, and slew Shah Bogh Khan their chief in 1608 A.D., 914 A.H., he prevailed on our poet to quit his cell, and come to court. Solely ambitious of rivalling the Khamsa or five poems of Nizami, he wrote in imitation of them his \"Laili and Majnun,\" \"Khuro and Shifir,\" \"Haft Manzar,\" the \"Taimur Nam\u00e1\" which is also called \"Zafarnama,\" and in imitation of the Sikandar Nam\u00e1, he undertook a heroic poem in praise of his patron, called \"Fatih Shah,\" which he did not live to finish. Among the numerous Persian poems on the story of Layli and Majnun, that of Hatifi seems universally esteemed the simplest and most pathetic.\n\nHatim, commonly called H\u00e1tim T\u00e1'i, a famous Arabian Chief of the tribe of T\u00e1'i, celebrated for his liberality, wisdom and valour. He flourished before the birth of Muhammad, and his sepulchre may still be seen at a little village, called Anwar in Arabia.

In 1720 A.D., 1132 A.H., the Diwan of Wali was brought to Delhi and verses of it were on every body's lips; this induced him and three friends of his, Naj\u00ed, Mazm\u00fcn, and 'Abd\u00fa to apply themselves to Rekhta poetry. Up to the time of H\u00e1tim, it would appear, that Indian poets wrote in Persian.

During the absence of Humayun, which extended to a period of fifteen years, five kings ascended the throne of Delhi, viz.

The mother of this monarch was the daughter of Mahr\u00fakh a petty prince, whom Ardish\u00e9r had put to death, and whose family he had persecuted, because an astrologer had pre-dicted that a descendant of Mahr\u00fakh should attain the throne of Persia. This lady had fled to the tents of a shepherd where she was seen by Sh\u00e1hp\u00far when hunting. This prince became enamoured, and married her privately. His father Ardish\u00e9r, going one day unexpectedly to his son's house, saw young Hormidas. He was greatly pleased with the appearance of the child and made enquiries, which compelled Sh\u00e1hp\u00far to confess all that had happened. The joy of the old king was excessive. \"The pre-diction of the astrologers,\" he exclaimed, \"which gave me such alarm, is, thank God, confirmed, and a descen-dant of Mahr\u00fakh shall succeed to my crown.\" Humrus was a virtuous prince, but reigned only one year and ten days.

His sister told him he could not contain it, and that it would cause his death.

He was born at Medina in January, 232 A.D., Shaban, 4 A.H., and was the third Imam of the race of 'Ali. Having refused to acknowledge Yazid the son of Mu'awiya, for the lawful Khalif, he was obliged to leave Medina, and to fly to Mecca; but was overtaken on his way and killed by order of Uthman ibn-Ziyad, the Yazid's captain, on the 16th October, 680 A.D., 10th Rabi'ul-Awal, 61 A.H. When his head was brought to Uthman ibn-Kata', he struck it over the mouth with a stick, and treated it with great contempt. He then sent it along with his family who were made captives, to Damascus where Yazid then reigned. The day on which he was killed, is still a great day amongst the Musalmans. He is buried at a place called Karbala in Babylonian Irak or Chaldea near Kifa. Some pretend to show that Husain's head was buried near the river of Karbala; others say, that there are no traces of it remaining. However, the first Sultan of the race of Boyaides built on that spot a sumptuous monument, which is visited to this very day with great devotion by the Musalmans.

He fought several battles with Bahl\u00f3l Lod\u00ed, the king of D\u00e9lh\u00ed, and was at last defeated, and so closely pursued that he left his horse and escaped on foot. The army of D\u00e9lh\u00ed advanced without any other check to Jaunp\u00far which fell to the arms of Bahl\u00f3l, while Husain Sh\u00e1h, abandoning his capital, was obliged to content himself with a small tract of country yielding only a revenue of five lakhs of rupees. Bahl\u00f3l having delivered over Jaunp\u00far and its kingdom to his own son B\u00e9rek, enjoined him not to deprive Husain Sh\u00e1h of the small tract to which he was confined, terming it his family estate. This event took place about the year 1476 A.D., 881 A.H., and the subversion of the Sh\u00e1riki dynasty may be dated from that year. The reign of Husain Sh\u00e1h lasted for a period of 19 lunar years. Some years after the death of Bahl\u00f3l Lod\u00ed (which happened in 1489 A.D., 884 A.H.), Husain Sh\u00e1h incited the famous B\u00e1bak to rise up against his brother Sh\u00e1h Sh\u00e1h, called King of D\u00e9lh\u00ed, and wrested the government out of his hands; but B\u00e9rek was defeated in the first action, and retired to Jaunp\u00far, to which place he was pursued by the king. Jaunp\u00far fell shortly after, and was added to the kingdom of D\u00e9lh\u00ed.

He was born at Corduba in Spain, where his father held the office of high priest and chief judge, under the emperor of Morocco. His knowledge of law, divinity, mathematics, and astrology was very extensive, and to this was added the theory rather than the practice of medicine. On the death of his father, he was appointed to succeed him. Falling\nunder the suspicion of heresy, he was deprived of his posts and thrown into prison from whence he was at last delivered and reinstated in his office of judge. He wrote a treatise on the art of physic, an Epitome of Ptolemy's Almagest, a treatise on astrology, and many amorous verses; but when he grew old, he threw the three last into the fire. As to religion, his opinions were, that Christianity is absurd; Judaism, the religion of children; and Muhammadanism, the religion of swine.

This country was reduced by the Saracens in the Khilafat of Umar, and continued subject to the Khalif of Arabia and Baghdad till the reign of Harun-al-Rashid, who having appointed Ibrahim-ibn-Aghlab, governor of the western parts of his empire, then preferred the opportunity, first of assuming greater powers for himself than had been granted by the Khalif, and then erecting a principality altogether independent of the Khalifa. The race of Aghlab continued to enjoy their new principality peaceably till the year 910 A.D., 298 A.H., during which time they made several descents on the island of Sicily, and conquered a part of it. About this time, however, one Obeidullah surnamed 'Al-Mahdi, rebelled against\nIbrahim Khan Fatha Jang, was a relation of the celebrated Nur Jah\u00e1n Begam, whose mother's sister he had married. When Kasim Kh\u00e1n the grandson of Shaikh Sal\u00edm Chisht\u00ed was recalled to court from the government of Bihar in the twelfth year of the emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr 1616 A.D., 1026 A.H., Ibrahim Kh\u00e1n was appointed governor of that province with the rank of 4000.

He raised a considerable army and took possession of Dohl\u00ed and Agrah on the 28th February, 1565 A.D., 966 Jum\u00e1da I, 962 A.H. He had no sooner ascended the throne, than another competitor arose in the province of the Panj\u00e1b, in the person of Ahmad Kh\u00e1n, a nephew of the late Sheir Sh\u00e1h. He defeated Ibrahim Kh\u00e1n in a battle, and the latter retreated to Sambhal, where Ahmad Kh\u00e1n took possession of Agrah and Dohl\u00ed, and assumed the title of Sikandar Sh\u00e1h in May the same year. Ibrahim Kh\u00e1n was killed by Sulaim\u00e1n, King of Bengal, in Orissa in a battle fought in 1667 A.D., 976 A.H., and is buried there. Amongst the incidents of the year 1565 A.D., 962 A.H., was the explosion in the fort of Agrah, when enormous stones and columns were sent flying several k\u00eds to the other side of the Jamna, and many people were destroyed.

On the death of his brother Jamsh\u00edd Kutb Sh\u00e1h, the nobles of the court elevated his son Subh\u00e1n Kutb, a child of seven years of age, to the throne; but as he was unable to wield the sceptre, Ibrahim was sent for from Bij\u00e1na, where he then resided, and was crowned on Monday, the 28th of July, 1550 A.D., 12th Raj\u00e1b, 957 A.H. In the year 1565 A.D., 972 A.H., he, in conjunction with the other Muhammedan monarchs of the Dakh\u00e1n, marched against Ramr\u00e1j, the r\u00e1s\u00ed of Bij\u00e1na garh, who was defeated and slain, and his territories occupied by the conquerors.

He died at Hamd\u00e1n in 1179 A.D., 568 A.H., in the reign of Arsal\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h, and left his power and station to his eldest son At\u00e1bak Muhammad.\n\nList of the At\u00e1baks of the race of Ildiguz.\n\n| At\u00e1bak Ildiguz | \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 | died 1179 |\n|----------------|----------------|-----------|\n| Muhammad, son of Ildiguz | \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 | 1168 |\n| K\u00edz\u00e1l Arsal\u00e1n, son of Ildiguz | \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 | 1191 |\n| Ab\u00fa Bakr, son of Muhammad | \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 | died 1210 |\n| Muzaffar, son of Muhammad | \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 | defeated 1225 |\n\nby Sultan Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn of Khw\u00e1num, and died some time after.

In the reign of Sultan Mahmud Shah Bahmani, through the influence of Khwaja Mahmud Gawan, he received the title of 'Imad-ul-Mulk, and was subsequently raised to the office of commander of the forces in Berar.

The last of these Imam Mahdi, is supposed by them to be concealed (not dead), and the title which belongs to him, cannot, they conceive, be given to another: but among the Sunnis it is a dogma, that there must be always a visible Imam or \"father of the church.\" The title is given by them to the four learned doctors who are the founders of their faith, viz.: Imams Hanifa, Malik, Shafii, and Hanbal. Of these four sects, the Hanbalite and Malikite may be considered as the most rigid, the Shafii'ite as the most conformable to the spirit of Islamism, and the Haniffite as the wildest and most philosophical of them all. Two other Imams, Abu Daud uz-Zahiri, and Sufiyan-us-Sauri were also chiefs of the orthodox sects, but their opinions had not many followers, and after some time were totally abandoned. Ibn Jarir-at-Tabari, whose reputation as a historian is so familiar to Europeans, founded also a particular sect, which disappeared soon after his death.

They maintain, that Ism\u00e1'il, who was the eldest son, but died during his father's life, should have succeeded to the dignity of Im\u00e1m, and not M\u00fas\u00ed K\u00e1zim, who was his younger brother, and became the seventh Im\u00e1m. Hasan Sabb\u00e1h was of this sect. Vide Isma'ilis.\n\nIsm\u00e1'il, Safwi, Shah, the son of Sult\u00e1n Haidar, was the first monarch of the Saf\u00edw\u00e1n dynasty of kings who reigned in Persia. He traced his descent from M\u00fas\u00ed K\u00e1zim the seventh Im\u00e1m, who was descended in a direct line from 'Ali, the son-in-law of Mohammad. Almost all his ancestors were regarded as holy men, and some of them as saints. The first of this family who acquired any considerable reputation was Sh\u00e1ikh S\u00e1d\u00edk, who had settled at Ardib\u00e9l, and from whom this dynasty takes its name of Saf\u00edw\u00e1n or Saf\u00ed. His son Sadr-udd\u00edn M\u00fan\u00ed as well as his immediate descendants, Khw\u00e1ja 'Al\u00ed, Sh\u00e1ikh Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, Sult\u00e1n Jun\u00e1id, and Haidar, acquired the greatest reputation for sanctity. Contemporary monarchs, we are informed, visited the cell of Sadr-udd\u00edn. The great Taim\u00e9r (Tamerlane), when he went to see this holy man, demanded to know what favour he should confer upon him. \"Release those prisoners you have brought from Turkey,\" was the noble and pious request of the saint. The conqueror complied; and the grateful tribes, when they gained their liberty, declared themselves the devoted disciples of him to whom they owed it. Their children preserved sacred the obligation of their fathers; and the descendants of the captives of Taim\u00e9r became the supporters of the family of Saf\u00ed and the heads of one of the most splendid thrones in the world. Khw\u00e1ja 'Al\u00ed, after visiting Mecca, went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and died at that city. His grandson Jun\u00e1id, sat on the masnad as a spiritual guide after the death of his father Sh\u00e1ikh Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm; and so great a crowd of disciples attended this holy man, that Jah\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h, the chief of the tribe of the Black Sheep, who at that time ruled Asurb\u00e9jan, became alarmed at their numbers, and banished him from Ardib\u00e9l. Jun\u00e1id went to Day\u00e1rb\u00edkar, whose ruler, the celebrated Uzz\u00e1n Hasan, received him kindly, and gave his sister in marriage to Jun\u00e1id. He afterwards went with his disciples to Shirw\u00e1n, where he was slain in a conflict with the troops of the king of that province in 1466 A.D., 860 A.H. His son Sult\u00e1n Haidar succeeded him, and his uncle, Uzz\u00e1n Hasan who had now by his overthrow of Jah\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h and Sult\u00e1n Abu S\u00e1d, become sovereign of all Persia, gave him his daughter in marriage. The name of this princess according to Muhammadan authors, was 'Alam Shoa', but we are informed by\na contemporary European writer, that she was called Martha, and was the daughter of Uzzan Haasan by the Christian lady Despina, who was a daughter of Calo Joannes, king of Trebizond. Sultan Haidar also lost his life from the wound of an arrow which he received in battle with the troops of Shirwan Shah and Ya'kub Beg in July, 1498 A.D., Shahin, 993 A.H. Sultan Haidar had three sons by this princess; Sultan 'Ali, Ibrahim Mirza and Shah Isma'il. When Isma'il attained the age of fourteen (his elder brothers having died some years before), he put himself at the head of his adherents, and marched against the great enemy of his family the ruler of Shirwan, called Shirwan Shah, whom he defeated 1500 A.D., 906 A.H., and soon after; by another victory gained over Alwand Beg, the son of Ya'kub Beg, a prince of the dynasty of the White Sheep, he became the master of the province of Azarbejan, and established his residence at the city of Tabriz; and in less than four years became the acknowledged sovereign of the kingdom of Persia. He was born on the 17th July, 1487 A.D., 26th Rajab, 892 A.H., died after a reign of 14 lunar years on Monday the 23rd of May, 1524 A.D., 930 A.H., aged 32 years, and was buried at Ardabil. Muhammed bin Mirza fix the commencement of his reign from the year 1500 A.D. He left four sons; Tahmasp, who succeeded his father, Sam Mirza, Bahr\u00e1m, and Ikhlas Mirza, and five daughters. He composed a Turkish Divan in which he uses the Takhallus of Khitab.\n\nThe following is a list of the Safavi kings of Persia.\n\n1. Shah Isma'il Safvi, 1st son of Sultan Haidar.\n2.

The short reign of this unworthy prince was marked by debauchery and crime. Immediately on his accession, he directed the massacre of all the princes of the blood-royal that were at Karwin, except 'Ali Mirza whose life was spared; but even he was deprived of sight. His eldest brother Muhammad Mirza, who had a natural weakness in his eyes, which rendered him almost blind, and was during his father's life, employed as governor of Khurasan, was then at Shiraz. Orders were sent to murder him and his son 'Abbas, but before they could be executed, Isma'il was found dead in his bed. It was suspected that he was supposed to have been poisoned by his sister. His death happened at Karwin on Sunday the 34th November, 1577 A.D., 13th Ramaz\u00e1n, 985 A.H., after a short reign of one year and six months.

Their ruler, who may be justly termed the chief of the assassins resided in a safer retreat, distant, calm, and isolated, far from his hands; for there was no chance which his followers could not assume, no danger that they could not brave, to fulfil his mandates. These were the Isma'il\u00eds or assassins, well-known by the Crusaders, as subjects of the Old Man of the mountain. They were completely extirpated by Hal\u00e1ku, the Tartar king of Persia, in the year 1266 A.D.

His father Burh\u00e1n Shah having received assistance from the emperor Akbar, marched against his son, but was defeated. However in a short time after this, he renewed his attempts, and being joined by a great majority of the chiefs and people, attacked Jam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n the king's minister, who was killed in the action on the 27th April, 1591 O.S., 13th Rajab, 999 A.H.

The following is a list of his successors:\n\n| Name                  | Year          |\n|-----------------------|---------------|\n| Murshid Kuli Ja'far Kh\u0101n | 1704          |\n| Shuj\u0101'-udd\u012bn, son of Ja'far Kh\u0101n | 1726          |\n| Al\u0101'uddaula Sarfraz Kh\u0101n | 1739          |\n| Al\u0101hw\u0101rdi Kh\u0101n Mah\u0101bat Jang | 1740          |\n| Siraj-uddaula, grandson of ditto | 1756          |\n| Ja'far 'Al\u012b Kh\u0101n (deposed in 1760), | 1757          |\n| K\u0101sim 'Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, son-in-law of ditto | 1760          |\n| Ja'far 'Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, restored in | 1763          |\n| Najm-uddaula, son of ditto | 1764          |\n| Safi-uddaula, brother of Najm-uddaula | 1766          |\n| Mubarak-uddaula | 1769          |\n| Nazir-ul-Mulk Wasif-uddaula, (died April 28th, 1810) | 1796          |\n| Sayyad Zain-udd\u012bn 'Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, son of ditto | 1810          |\n| Sayyad Ahmad 'Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, Humayun J\u0101h. | Mansur 'Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, Nasrat Jang. |\n\nJa'far Khan, son of S\u0101dik Kh\u0101n, king of Persia. He was recognised by the principal noblemen in Fars, after the death of 'Al\u012b Mur\u0101d Kh\u0101n in 1785, and the people were forward in acknowledging his authority, but unable to resist his enemy Ak\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, who now ventured to embrace a more extensive field for the exertion of his talents, and commenced his march against Isfah\u0101n. Ja'far Kh\u0101n was treacherously murdered in 1788; his head was severed from his body, and cast before the citadel, the sport of children, and the outcasts of the city.\n\nJa'far Khan, a nobleman who in the first year of the emperor Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h was appointed governor of Kashmir in the room of Naw\u0101zish Kh\u0101n 1707 A.D., 1119 A.H. He proved to be a bad governor and a mob set fire to his residence. He died in Kashmir of drink and excess 1709 A.D., 1121 A.H., and according to the record of his death, must be faring badly at present.\nJa'far Nasiri, an author who completed the work called \"Lat\u00e1ef Khay\u00e1l,\" in 1742 A.D., 1155 A.H., which was commenced by Mirz\u00e1 Muhammad S\u00e1lih.\n\nJa'far Sad\u00edk, or Ja'far the Just. He was the eldest son of Muhamad B\u00e1kir, the grandson of Im\u00e1m Husain. He is reckoned the sixth Im\u00e1m; was born at Medina about the year 702 A.D., 83 A.H., and died in the same city under the khilafat of Ab\u00fa Ja'far Al-Mans\u00far, in 765 A.D., 148 A.H. He was very famous for his doctrine amongst the Musalm\u00e1ns, was invited to court by Al-Mans\u00far, that he might profit by his counsel: Ja'far returned for answer, \"Whoever has a view duly to this world, will not give you sincere advice, and he who regards the next, will not keep your company.\" He was buried in the cemetery of Al-Bak\u00eda at Medina. The same tomb contains the bodies of his father, Im\u00e1m B\u00e1kir, his grandfather 'Ali Zain-\u00fal-'Abid\u00edn, and his grandfather's uncle, Hasan, son of 'Ali. His mother's name was Fatima, the daughter of Kh\u00e1zim, the son of Muhamad, the son of Ab\u00fa Bakr Sad\u00edk, the first Khalif after Muhamad. He is said to be the author of a book of fate called \"F\u00e1'il N\u00e1ma.\"\n\nJa'far Zat\u00e1ll\u00ed, Mir, a Sayyad of N\u00e1r-noul, cotemporary with Mirz\u00e1 Bed\u00edl. He served under prince 'Az\u00edm Sh\u00e1h, the son of the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr, who was slain in battle in 1707 A.D., 1019 A.H. Ja'far was the most celebrated humoristic poet of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n; his compositions are a mixture of Persian and Urdu. He is the author of a Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma in Rekh\u00e1. He was put to death in 1713 A.D., 1225 A.H., by order of the emperor Farr\u00fakh-siy\u00e1r, on account of a satirical verse he had written on the accession of that emperor to the throne of Delhi.\n\nJagat Gosh\u00e1in\u00ed, Jodh B\u00e1\u00ed.\n\nJagat Narayan, a Hind\u00fa poet who wrote some k\u00e1s\u00edd\u00e1s in praise of Naw\u00e1b 'Asaf-uddaula of Lakhnau, who died in 1797 A.D., 1212 A.H.\n\nJagannath, Raja, the son of Bhara Mal. He held the rank of 5000 in the time of the emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, about the year 1605 A.D., 1014 A.H.\n\nJagat Singh, the son of Makund Singh Hara, lived in the time of the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr 1659 A.D.\n\nJagat Singh, r\u00e9j\u00e9 of Jaipur or Jainagar, was the son of r\u00e9j\u00e9 Part\u00e1sp Singh, the son of Madho Singh, the son of Jah\u00fari Singh, the son of the celebrated r\u00e9j\u00e9 Jai Singh Saw\u00e1i, who lived in the time of the emperor Muhamad Sh\u00e1h. Jagat Singh succeeded his father in 1803 A.D., and is said to have been an effeminate prince. Though he died without issue, he was succeeded by r\u00e9j\u00e9 Jai Singh, a posthumous son, believed supposititious.\n\nJagnath Kalanwat, a musician who was employed by Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, who conferred on him the title of Mah\u00e1 Kabr\u00e1j.\n\nJaghtai, Chaght\u00e1\u00ed Kh\u00e1n.\n\nJagnath, brother of R\u00e9j\u00e9 Bhagw\u00e1n D\u00e1s. He distinguished himself in the war with R\u00e9j\u00e9 Part\u00e1sp Singh. He slew the renowned champion R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, son of Jaggah.\n\nJahan Ara Begam, daughter of the emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, by Mumt\u00e1s Mahal, daughter of 'Asaf Kh\u00e1n, wax\u00edr; was born on Wednesday the 23rd of March, 1614 A.D., 21st Safar, 1023 A.H. One of the most beautiful examples of female modesty to be found in the annals of woman is recorded of this princess, celebrated in song and history as the heroic, the witty, the generous, the elegant, the accomplished, and the beautiful Jahan Ara Begam. One night, (26th March, 1644 A.D., 27th Muhr\u00e1ram, 1054 A.H.) as she was returning from her father's apartments to the harem, in one of the passages which connect the latter building with the city of the palace, she sawing a fire which unexpectedly ignited by the flame of a lamp. Her whole dress, which was of the finest muslin, was instantly in flames, and of course her life was in imminent peril; but, knowing that she was then within hearing of many young nobles of the court, she would not raise an alarm, lest they should run to her assistance, and behold her unveiled, or lay their hands upon her in order to extinguish the flames. Heroically enduring all the agonies which fire could inflict, she withheld her cries, and rushed forward until she reached the women's apartments, and there sunk upon the floor, almost lifeless. For a long period, no hopes were entertained of her recovery, but she was ultimately restored to health by an English physician named Dr. Boughton who was then at Sur\u00e1t, and had been sent for by the emperor her father then in the Dakh\u00edn, although her beauty was cruelly impaired. The emperor, in reward for Dr. Boughton's services, besides other favours, granted him, at his distinguished request, a patent for his countrymen to trade free of custom throughout his dominions. The large Masjid of red stone adjoining the fort of Agra near the Tripol\u00eda (now demolished) was built by her in the year 1648 A.D., 1058 A.H., at a cost of five lacs of rupees. She died in the reign of her brother the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr on the 5th September, 1680 A.D., 3rd Ram\u00e1zan, 1092 A.H., and lies buried in the yard of the mausoleum of Niz\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn Auli\u00e1 at Dehl\u00ed. The name of Jah\u00e1n Ar\u00e1 will ever adorn the pages of history as a bright example of filial attachment and heroic self-devotion to the dictates of duty, more especially when we view it in contrast with the behaviour of her sister Roshan Ar\u00e1, who, by aiding the ambitious designs of Aurangz\u00e9b, enabled him to dethrone Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. The amiable and accomplished Jah\u00e1n Ar\u00e1 not only supported her aged father in his adversity, but voluntarily resigned her liberty, joined with him during his imprisonment in the fort of Agra. Her tomb is of white marble, open at the top, and at the head is a tablet with a Persian inscription inlaid in black marble letters, to the following effect: \"Let no one scatter over my grave anything but verdure, for such best becomes the sepulchre of one who had a humble mind.\" On the margin is written, \"The perishable fak\u00edr Jah\u00e1n Ar\u00e1 Begam, daughter of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, and the disciple of the saints of Chiaht\u00ed, died in the year of the Hijra, 1092 A.H.\"\n\nJahan Bano Begam, the daughter of Prince Mur\u00e1d, the son of the emperor Akbar. She was married to Prince Parwez, the son of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, by whom she had Nadira Begam, who was married to Dara Sheko, the eldest son of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n.\n\nJahand\u00e1r Shah, surnamed Muhamad Muizz-ud-d\u00edn, was the eldest son of the emperor Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, and grandson of 'Alamg\u00edr. He was born in the Dakh\u00edn on Wednesday the 8th April, 1663 A.D., 10th Ram\u00e1zan, 1073 A.H. The death of his father, which took place in February, 1712 A.D., Muhr\u00e1ram, 1124 A.H., was followed by the usual struggle among his sons for the crown. The incapacity of Jah\u00e1nd\u00e1r Sh\u00e1h the eldest, had given a great ascendancy to the second whose name was Azim-ush-Sh\u00e1n. He was supported by most of the nobility and of the army, but his other brothers joined their interests, and were kept together by the persuasions and false promises of Zulfiq\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n the Amir.\nJahandar Shah, Prince, the eldest son of the emperor Sh\u00e2h 'Alam. In April, 1784 A.D., on account of the unsettled affairs of his father, he made his escape from Delhi and repaired to Lakhnau, where Mr. Hastings had arrived to regulate the concerns between the wazir, Asaf-uddaula, and the Company. He accompanied Mr. Hastings to Benares, which place he chose for his residence. He had an allowance of five lacs of rupees per annum from the Naw\u00e2b wazir at the request of Mr. Hastings. He died in Benares on the 1st of April, 1786 A.D., 26th Sha'ban, 1202 A.H., after an illness of little more than two-fourth moons, aged about 35 years, and was buried with every honour due to his rank near the tomb of a revered Muhammadan in Benares. The English Resident and principal people of the city attended his funeral. He left behind him three sons, whom, with the rest of his family, he recommended to the care of the English, under whom they still enjoy a comfortable asylum and allowance at Benares. Garqin-de-Tassy informs us, that there is a work of his in the India House, which has the title of \"Bayz\u00e2 In\u00e2y\u00e2t Murshidada.\" He is also called Mirz\u00e2 Jaw\u00e2n Bakht, and his poetical title is Jah\u00e2nd\u00e2r. The narrative written by this prince, was translated by Mr. Scott, and published in the appendix to Mr. Hastings' Review of the state of Bengal.\n\nJahangir, (emperor) surnamed N\u00fbr-ud-d\u00een Muhammad, was the eldest son of the emperor Akbar the Great; was born in the village of Sikri on Wednesday the 31st of August, 1569 A.D., 17th Rabi' I, 977 A.H., and was named Mirz\u00e2 Salim on account of his coming out the world, as supposed, by the prayers of Shaikh Salim Chishti, a venerable Shaikh and dervish who resided in the village of Sikri, now called Fatehpur Sikri, in the province of Agra. His mother, who received the title of Mariam Zamman, was the daughter of R\u00e2j\u00e2 Bih\u00e2r\u00ee Mal Kachhw\u00e2h\u00e2. After the death of his father, which took place on the 16th of October, 1605 A.D., he succeeded him by the title of N\u00fbr-ud-d\u00een Muhammad Jah\u00e2ng\u00eer. He reigned 22 lunar years, 8 months and 15 days from the day of his father's demise; and died in camp on Sunday the 28th of October, 1627 A.D., 28th Safar, 1037 A.H., on his way to L\u00e2h\u00f4r from Kashmir, aged 59 lunar years, 11 months and 12 days; and was interred in the suburbs of L\u00e2h\u00f4r in the garden of his favourite wife N\u00fbr Jah\u00e2n Begam. He was succeeded by his son Mirz\u00e2 Khurrum, who took the title of Sh\u00e2h Jah\u00e2n. His favourite Sult\u00e2na N\u00fbr Jah\u00e2n, who survived him 18 years, is also buried in the same mausoleum. Jah\u00e2ng\u00eer, after his death, received the title of \"Jannat Mak\u00e2ni.\" It was to this prince that Sir Thomas Roe was sent as ambassador by King James I. Sir Thomas has given a good description of the grandeur of the court of Hindustan; but very little is known of the barbarism in the chronicles of the East. In 1612, Jah\u00e2ng\u00eer permitted the Company to establish factories at Surat, Ahmad\u00e2bd, and Cambay. Jah\u00e2ng\u00eer wrote his own Memoir in Persian, called \"T\u00fbzak Jah\u00e2ng\u00eer,\" which has been translated by Major David Price, London, 1829, 184 pages 4to. It is also called Jah\u00e2ng\u00eer N\u00e2ma.\n\nJahangir Kuli Khan, Kabuli, an amir of the rank of 5000, who was appointed governor of Bengal by the emperor Jah\u00e2ng\u00eer in 1607 A.D., 1016 A.H., and died there in 1608 A.D., 1017 A.H.\n\nJahangir, a cousin and husband of Sikandar Begam of Bhopal. His uncle was one of the Path\u00e2n or Afghan soldiers of fortune, who under Aurangzeb carved out principalities, and on that emperor's death, declared himself independent at Bhopal; and on his death his wife was declared Regent by the army, and his daughter Sikandar Begum, heir. She married Jah\u00e2ng\u00eer who died in the year 1646 A.D.\n\nJahangir Kuli Khan, son of Kh\u00e2n 'As\u00een M\u00eerz\u00e2 'Az\u00eez K\u00f4t\u00e2, served under the emperors Akbar and Jah\u00e2ng\u00eer, and died in the fifth year of Sh\u00e2h Jah\u00e2n 1631 A.D., 1041 A.H.\n\nJahangir Mirza, the eldest son of Amir Taim\u00fbr.

He was at first interred in the same garden, and subsequently his remains were transferred to Dehl\u00ee, and buried in the court-yard of the mausoleum of Niz\u00e2m-ud-d\u00een Aulia.\n\nJahanian Jahan Gasht, Mahkhum, vide Shaikh Jal\u00e2l.\n\nJahan Khatoon, a famous lady, who after the death of her first husband, got married to Khw\u00e2ja Am\u00een-ud-d\u00een, minister of Sh\u00e2h Ab\u00fb Is-h\u00e2k, ruler of Shir\u00e2z. She is said to have been a very beautiful woman, and a good poet.\n\nJahan Shah Turkman, son of Kar\u00e2 Y\u00e2s\u00eef Turkm\u00e2n, was the brother of Sikandar Turkm\u00e2n, after whose death in 1437 A.D., 841 A.H., the government of Azarbej\u00e2n was conferred on him by Sh\u00e2hr\u00fbkh Mirz\u00e2, the son of Amir Taim\u00fbr. He held it till the death of that prince in 1447 A.D., 850 A.H., after which he conquered most part of Persia, and carried his arms as far as Day\u00e2rbikar, and fell in a battle which he fought against Hasan Beg, commonly called Us\u00fbn Has\u00e2n, the ruler of that province, on the 10th of November, 1467 A.D., 12th Rabi' I, 872 A.H., aged 70 years.

He was slain in the battle which took place at L\u00e1hor after the death of his father between his brothers in March, 1712 A.D. His mangled body with that of his brother Raffi-ud-Sh\u00e1n and his son, was conveyed to D\u00e1lf\u00edh and interred without ceremony and pomp in the mausoleum of the emperor Humay\u00fan, the general receptacle of the murdered princes of the imperial family.\n\nJahan Soz, a title of Sult\u00e1n 'Al\u00ed-udd\u00edn Hasan Ghori.\n\nJahi, the poetical name of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Mir\u00e1 (Sult\u00e1n) which see.\n\nJahiz or Aljahiz, the surname of Ab\u00fa 'Usm\u00e1n 'Umar bin-Mahbub Kana'\u00edna, a man of great learning, but of a very eccentric tendency of mind. He wrote a book on the Commerce of the Arabians early in the third century of the Hijra, entitled \"Kit\u00e1b-al-Nazrat fil Taj\u00e1r\u00e1t,\" which is frequently quoted by Nawer\u00ed. Jahiz died 868 A.D., 255 A.H., at the age of 96 years.\n\nJaiapa, Sindhis, succeeded his father R\u00e1noji Sindhis, the founder of the Sindhis family, in 1760 A.D., 1163 A.H. and was murdered in his tent in 1769 A.D., 1172 A.H.

The present city of Jounpur was built by F\u00edr\u00f3s Sh\u00e1h in the year 1370 A.D., 772 A.H., in the name of his uncle Fakhr-udd\u00edn Muhammad J\u00e1n\u00e1n, the date of which is found in the words \"Shah Jounpur.\" According to Colonel Tod, Jaichand reigned about the 12th century of the Christian era, and one of his grandsons named Seoji, with a few retainers, planted the R\u00e1th\u00f3r standard in M\u00e1rwar in the year 1212 A.D.\n\nJai Chand, a r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Nagarkot or Kangra, who lived in the time of the emperor Akbar.\n\nJaikishun, a Kashmiri Brahman whose poetical name was 'Izzat, was the agent of Naw\u00e1b Is-h\u00e1k Kh\u00e1n.\n\nJa\u00edmal, a r\u00e1j\u00e1, famous in history as \"the bravest of the brave.\" In 1568 A.D. Udai Singh, the son of Rana Sanka or Sanga, and the founder of the capital Udaipur in Chittor, came under the displeasure of the emperor Akbar. The recreant chief fled and left the defence of his capital (Chittor) to r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ja\u00edmal, who was killed by Akbar himself in 1568 A.D.\n\nJaipal I, son of Hitpal, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of L\u00e1hor of the Br\u00e1hman tribe, who reigned over the country extending in length from Sarhind to Lamghan, and in breadth from the kingdom of Kashmir to Mult\u00e1n. He was once defeated by Subaktagin, the Sultan of Ghazni, with great slaughter, and again on Monday the 27th November, 1001 A.D. by his son Sultan Mahm\u00fad, when Jaipal with fifteen of his principal chiefs, being his sons and brethren, were taken prisoners, and 5000 of his troops were slain on the field of battle. He was afterwards released by Mahm\u00fad, but in compliance with a custom which prevailed among the Hind\u00fas, that whatever r\u00e1j\u00e1 was twice overpowered by strangers, became disqualified to reign, he ordered a funeral pile to be prepared, and having set fire to it with his own hands, perished therein. He was succeeded by his son Anandpal.\n\nJaipal II, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of L\u00e1hor, son of Anandpal whom he succeeded in 1013 A.D. He was routed in a great battle by Sultan Mahm\u00fad in 1032 A.D. on the banks of the river Ravi, the result was the permanent occupation of L\u00e1hor by a Muhammedan governor, and the appointment of a Viceroy of L\u00e1hor by Mahm\u00fad. This was the foundation of the Muhammedan empire in India.\n\nJai Singh I, (r\u00e1j\u00e1) of the tribe of Kachhw\u00e1ha, commonly called Mir\u00e1z R\u00e1j\u00e1, was the son of r\u00e1j\u00e1 Mah\u00e1 Singh, the son of Part\u00e1p Singh, the son of r\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1ns Singh. He served under the emperor Shah Jahan, and was made governor over the conquered provinces of the Dakhin since the year 1684 A.D. by the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr. He was recalled to court in 1686 A.D. but died on the road, soon after his arrival at Burhanpur, 28th Muharram 1078 A.H. According to Orme's Historical Fragments of the Mughul Empire, Jai Singh died at Burhanpur soon after the pretended revolt of Sultan Muazzim the son of the emperor, and seems to have been poisoned by the procurement of 'Alamg\u00edr. There never was a prince among the r\u00e1jputs equal to him in accomplishments. He was completely learned in Hindi, and understood the Turkish, Persian, and Arabic languages. He left two sons, R\u00e1m Singh his eldest, and Kir\u00e1t Singh. The former was honoured after his father's death with the title of r\u00e1j\u00e1, and put in possession of his father's territories. Jai Singh had built several fine edifices at Agra of which no sign remains now, but the name and place on which the buildings stood is still called Jaishgupura.\n\nJai Singh II, Saw\u00e1i, a r\u00e1j\u00e1 of the tribe of Kachhw\u00e1ha r\u00e1jputs, was the son of Bihun Singh, the son of Kishun Singh, the son of R\u00e1ma Singh, the son of Mir\u00e1z R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Singh. He is commonly called Mir\u00e1z R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Singh Saw\u00e1i. He was the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r or r\u00e1j\u00e1 of a considerable territory in the province of Ajmir named Amer, but since the prince's founding a new city called Jaipur, the r\u00e1j\u00e1ship has also taken that name. Bihun Singh, the father of Jai Singh and Bijai Singh, died about the year 1693 A.D., Sambat 1750, and after his death the title of r\u00e1j\u00e1 was bestowed on Jai Singh by the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr with the rank of 1500, and subsequently with that of 2000. After the death of that emperor, he espoused the cause of 'Azim Sh\u00e1h, the son of 'Alamg\u00edr, whilst his brother Bijai Singh aided Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, whilst on his accession to the throne conferred the rank of 3000 on the latter. Bijai Singh quarrelled with his brother for the r\u00e1j\u00e1, but the emperor, not wishing to dispense either, confiscated the estate, and appointed Sayyid Has\u00e1n Ali Kh\u00e1n of B\u00e1kh\u00e1 a Faujdar of that place. When the emperor marched to the Dakhin to punish his brother K\u00e1malkh\u00e1h, 1708 A.D., 1120 A.H., Jai Singh, with the aid of r\u00e1j\u00e1 Aj\u00edt Singh R\u00e1th\u00f3r, engaged the Faujdar in battle and having killed him took possession of the province. In the reign of Farrukh-siyar he was honoured with the title of Dh\u00edr\u00e1j R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Singh, and in the time of Muhammed Sh\u00e1h, with that of Saw\u00e1i. In the year 1732 A.D., 1145 A.H., he was appointed governor of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. His love of science makes him one of the most remarkable persons of his nation. He built five observatories for astronomical studies, namely, at Dehl\u00ed, Banaras, Math\u00e1, Ujjain and Jaipur, and published a work on astronomy called \"Zij\u00ed Muhammed Sh\u00e1h\u00ed.\" He also created a Karavansarai and market in every province of Hindust\u00e1n for the convenience of travellers at his own expense. After his death, which took place in September, 1743 A.D., 9th Sha'b\u00e1n, 1156 A.H., three of his wives with many concubines burned themselves on his funeral pile. He was succeeded by his son Jah\u00far\u00ed.\nSingh, after whose death in 1760 A.D., Madho Singh his son succeeded him.\n\nList of Kachhwah\u00e9 R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Amer or Jaipur.\n\n| Bhara Mal. | Jai Singh Saw\u00e1i. |\n|------------|------------------|\n| Bhagw\u00e1n D\u00e1s. | Ishuri Singh. |\n| M\u00e1n Singh. | Madho Singh. |\n| Bh\u00e1o Singh. | Pirthi Singh. |\n| Mah\u00e1 Singh. | Part\u00e1b Singh. |\n| Jai Singh Mirz\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1. | Jagat Singh. |\n| R\u00e1m Singh. | Jai Singh. |\n| Bihnu Singh. | |\n\nJai Singh III, (r\u00e1s) of the tribe of Kachhwah\u00e9 r\u00e1sj\u00fas of Jaipur, was a posthumous son of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jagat Singh who died in 1818 A.D.

Another work of Sayy\u016bt\u012b is called \"Lubb-ul-Lub\u0101b.\" It is a dictionary of Persian words, instead of others by which the Arabic authors are much more frequently quoted than under their proper names. The confusion under which the Arabs labour to identify men known under different names, has induced them to prepare dictionaries for obviating this difficulty. S\u0101m\u0101n\u012b (or S\u0101m\u0101n\u012b) in the sixth century of the Hijra published one, entitled, \"Fil Ans\u0101b,\" in which he does not only explain the sense and origin of these names, but also mentions with regard to every word the true names of the authors who have had them. This work was abbreviated in the succeeding century by Ibn-ul-A\u1e63f\u012br, and this extract shortened by Sayy\u016bt\u012b. There is another work of Sayy\u016bt\u012b called \"Kashfus-Salsala-un-Wasfus Zalsala,\" containing an account of all the earthquakes which took place from the year 713 A.D., 94 A.H., to his time.

It is related that the emperor had ordered that all the ladies at court should provide precious stones, and bring them to a market-place that he had erected, and there show their wares publicly to all the noblemen at court, who were ordered to buy them at whatever prices the ladies put upon them; and that the king himself was to be a buyer, to put the greater honour on the new erected market. The ladies obeyed, and took their jewels to the newly-erected fair. On the next day, the king and the noblemen came to market, and bought the jewels and other trifles the ladies had to dispose of. The king coming to the booth of a very pretty lady, asked her what she had to sell. She told him she had one large fine rough diamond still to dispose of. He desired to see it, and he found it to be a piece of fine transparent sugar-candy of a tolerable diamond figure. He demanded to know what price she set on it, and she told him with a pleasant air, that it was worth a lakh of rupees, or \u00a312,500 sterling. He ordered the money to be paid, and, falling into discourse with her, found her wit was as exquisite as her beauty, and ordered her to sup with him that night in his palace. She accordingly went and stayed with him three nights and days, and then went back to her husband, whose name was Jam\u0101l Khan. The husband received her very coldly, and told her that he could not bear to see she would not live with her again but in the same manner as if she was his sister. Upon which she went to the palace, fell at the emperor's feet, and told him what her husband had said. The king in a rage gave orders to carry her husband to the elephant garden, and there put him to death by an elephant. The poor man was soon apprehended, and as they dragged him from his house, he begged to have leave to speak to the king. A friend of his ordered the messengers of death to stop awhile, till he had acquainted the king with the request, which was accordingly done, and he was ordered to be carried into the court of the palace, that the king might hear what he had to say; and being carried thither, the king demanded what he would have. He answered, that what he had said to his wife was the greatest honour that he was capable of doing his king, because, after he had honoured his wife with his embrace, he thought himself unworthy ever after to cohabit with her. The king, after pausing a little, ordered him to be unbound, and brought to his own room, where, as soon as he came, the king embraced him, and ordered a royal suit to be put upon him, and gave him command of five thousand horse more, but took his wife into his own harem.\u2014Asiatic Journal, Vol. XXX., p. 215.\n\n**Jam\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn Ahmad**, \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f, a celebrated Muhammedan saint of Hans\u016b, and grandfather of Sh\u0101kh Kuth-ud-d\u012bn Manaww\u0101r.\n\n**Jam\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn At\u0101ull\u0101h**, \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631, nephew of Sayyad Asf-ud-d\u012bn 'Abdull\u0101h.

Even princes, who were themselves men of erudition and exalted talents, have lavished upon him the most unbounded praises and the highest honours. He was very intimate with Sult\u00e2n Abu Sa'id Mir\u00e2z of Hir\u00e2t, who continued the friend of J\u00e2m\u00ee so long as he lived.

He is celebrated as the founder of Persepolis, which is to this day called Istakhr and Takht Jamshed. He introduced the solar year and ordered the first day of it, when the sun entered Aries, to be celebrated by a splendid festival. His country was invaded by Zuh\u00e2r, a Syrian king, and the unfortunate Jamshed was obliged to fly before the conqueror. He was pursued by the agents of Zuh\u00e2r through S\u00eef\u00e2n, India, and China, and was at last seized and carried before his cruel enemy like a common malefactor, who ordered him to be placed between two boards and sawn asunder with the bone of a fish. We are told by Firdaus\u00ee that his reign lasted 700 years. He is supposed to have flourished 800 years before the Christian era. His goblet, called J\u00e2m Jamshed and J\u00e2m Jam, was wondrous. A hundred marvellous tales are told of his celebrated cup, which used to dazzle all who looked on it, and has often been employed by the poets to furnish a simile for a bright eye.\n\nJamshed, this title is sometimes given by the Musalm\u00e2ns to king Solomon the son of David, and they say that his magic ring and throne possessed extraordinary powers, and his control was absolute over genii and men.\n\nJamshed Kutb Shah, son of Kuli Kutb Shah I, ascended the throne of G\u00f4lkonda in the Dakhin after the death of his father in September, 1643 A.D., Jum\u00e2da II, 960 A.H.

Akbar Shah, who before the death of Muhammad Baki had gone to India, and had remained there for some years, expected a personal visit from Jani Beg; but being disappointed he proceeded to take measures for the subjugation of that country. He therefore in the year 1691 A.D., 999 A.H. directed his commander-in-chief 'Abdul Rahim Khan, the son of Bairum Khan to proceed and occupy the place in his name. The first action took place on the 3rd November, 1591 A.D., 26th Muharram 1000 A.H. when the Sindhis were totally defeated. Notwithstanding, daily skirmishes took place between the two armies; at last Mirza Jani Beg offered to acknowledge fealty to the emperor and to proceed to the presence. Shortly after, 'Abdul Rahim Khan celebrated the nuptials of his son Mirza Frich with the daughter of Jani Beg, and after the rainy season of the year 1592 A.D., 1001 A.H. accompanied Mirza Jani Beg to the presence of Akbar who created the latter a noble of the realm; and from that date the whole kingdom of Sindh reverted to the sovereignty of the empire of Delhi.

He had built a fine house at Agra on the banks of the Jamna, the surrounding walls of which are still standing, and his followers brought his infant children and his women who did not burn with him, towards their native country. Orders were sent by the emperor 'Alamgir to conduct them to court, where on their arrival, he insisted on the children being made Musalmans. Upon this the r\u00e1jput attendants, determined to die rather than submit to this order, set fire to their chariots towards the r\u00e1j\u00e9's tent, and, instead being pursued by the emperor's troops, fought valiantly, and were mostly cut to pieces, but the women and infants arrived safe at Jodhp\u00far; they were, however, compelled to take refuge in the hills and the woods, and on the death of 'Alamgir in 1707 A.D., regained their former possession.

The rule of the Mughals, historic severe and barbarous, changed its character in the reign of this prince, who adopted entirely the manners of the Chinese, and who is regarded, even by that people, as one of the best and most illustrious of their emperors.

His life is connected with a thousand fables, which though improper in this place, form excellent materials for Ferdousi, who has given, in his history of this period, the extraordinary and affecting tale of the combat between Rustam and his unknown son, Sohrab, who is killed by his father. This part of the Shah-nama has been beautifully translated in English verse by J. Atkinson, Esq., Assistant Surgeon on the Bengal Establishment, and member of the Asiatic Society in 1814.

Soon after these events Kaikhusro resolved to devote the remainder of his life to religious retirement: he delivered over Kabul, Z\u00e1b\u00fal\u00edst\u00e1n and Nimroz to Rustam as hereditary possessions, and resigned his throne to Luhr\u00e1n the son-in-law of Kaik\u00e1s and his own son by adoption and affection. After these arrangements he went accompanied by some nobles to a spring which he had fixed upon as the place of his repose.

This prince had retired to the mountain of Alburz, from which place he was brought by Rustam the son of Z\u00e1l and proclaimed king of Persia. He committed the administration of government into the hands of Z\u00e1l, whose son Rustam, was appointed to lead the Persians against the dreaded Afrasi\u00e1b who had again passed the Oxus and invaded Persia. In this battle, Rustam overcame Afrasi\u00e1b, and afterwards a peace was concluded, by which it was agreed that the Oxus should remain as it had been before, the boundary between the two kingdoms. Kaikub\u00e1d lived some time after this in peace, and is said to have reigned 120 years. He left four sons: Kaik\u00e1s, Arish, R\u00fam and Armen.

In the year 1287 A.D., 686 A.H., his father having heard the state of affairs at Dehl\u00ed, marched from Bengal to visit and advise his son. They met on the banks of the Gh\u00e1gra at Beh\u00e1r, and the whole scene was so affecting, that almost all the court shed tears. On this occasion the celebrated poet Amir Khusaro wrote the poem called the \"Kir\u00e1n-us-Sadain,\" or the conjunction of the two planets. Kaikub\u00e1d was assassinated through the instigation of Fir\u00f3z Malik Khilj\u00ed in 1288 A.D., who ascended the throne by the title of Jal\u00e1l-udd\u00edn Fir\u00f3z Sh\u00e1h Khilj\u00ed, and became the first Sult\u00e1n of the 2nd branch of the Turk dynasty called Khilj\u00ed.\n\nKaiomurs, the first monarch of Persia according to all Muhammedan writers. This king is stated to have reclaimed his subjects from a state of the most savage barbarity.

His son Si\u00e1mak was killed in one of the battles with the barbarians or Devs; and when that monarch carried Hoshang, the infant son of Si\u00e1mak, to share in the revenge he meant to take upon his enemies his son was joined by all the lions, tigers and panthers in his dominions, and the Devis were rolled and torn to pieces by the auxiliaries who had left their native forest to aid the just king. After this victory, Kaiomurs retired to his capital Halhkh.

In four books, containing on the average fifty-four stanzas each, he has given such illustrations of their subject as can never be surpassed. This work has been published in France, with a Latin translation by a continental scholar, Ferdinand Bouyer. No reason can be assigned why K\u00e1li D\u00e1s should be omitted from the history of N\u00e1la and Damayanti, after it had been so elegantly written in flowing verse by Vy\u00e1sa Deva, except that he intended in this simple story to show forth his ingenuity in alliteration.

He is commonly called Kam\u00e1l Khuj\u00e1nd\u00ed, born Khuj\u00e1nd\u00ed, a town situated in one of the most beautiful and fertile districts of Persia. After having made the pilgrimage to Mecca, he settled at Tabrez, a place which he found extremely agreeable during the reign of the princes of the family of Jal\u00e1y\u00e9r. The principal personages of Tabrez became his pupils, and he led a life of literary ease and enjoyment; but when Tuktam\u00edsh Kh\u00e1n surprised Tabrez, Shaikh Kam\u00e1l was made prisoner, and was carried to Serai in Kapj\u00e1k by order of Mang\u00fa Kh\u00e1n the grandson of Changz\u00e9 Kh\u00e1n, where he remained four years, after which he was permitted to return to Tabrez, near which city the Sultan Awes Jal\u00e1y\u00e9r built him a house. Kam\u00e1l did not sing the praise of princes in Kas\u00edda, nor did he write Magnaw\u00eds, but only Ghazals, and fragments. He died in the year 1394 A.D., 792 A.H., and his Burz\u00ed at Tabrez, a M.S. of the Diw\u00e1n of Kam\u00e1l, which had been the property of a Sult\u00e1n, is possessed by the Imperial Library at Vienna, and is a great treasure as a specimen of splendid writing, and, also, for the superbly executed miniatures which adorn it, illustrating\nthe poems.

He came from Kh\u00f3z\u00edst\u00e1n to the villages near K\u00fafa, and there pretended great sanctity and strictness of life, and that God had enjoined him to pray fifty times a day; pretending also to invite people to the obedience of a certain Im\u00e1m of the family of Muhammed; and this way of life he continued till he had made a very great party, out of whom he chose twelve apostles to govern the rest, and to propagate his doctrines. Afterwards his courage failing him, he retired to Syria, and was never heard of any more. This sect began in the Khilaf\u00e1t of Al-Motamid: they multiplied greatly in Arabian Ir\u00e1k or Chaldea, and raised many civil wars against the Khalif. In the year 921 A.D. they bombarded and took the city of Mecca, filled the well Zamzam with dead bodies, pillaged and plundered the temple and carried away the black stone; but they brought it again in 950 A.D. and fastened it to the seventh pillar of the portico, giving out, that they had both taken it away, and brought it back again, by express order from heaven.

The English, deceived by his elegance of manners, and convinced of his skill in the finances of Bengal, raised him to the magad in the room of his father-in-law in 1760 A.D., 1174 A.H. He, in the latter years of his government, retired to Munger, and acteduated by a keen resentment against the English, for their extensive encroachments on his authority, and the commerce of his country, formed the plan of throwing off their yoke, and annihilating their influence in Bengal; but was deposed and defeated, in a battle fought on the Odwa Nala on the 2nd August, 1762 A.D., 1177 A.H., and the deposed Nawab Ja'far 'Ali Khan was again placed on the magad. Kasim 'Ali, incensed to madness at these reverses, fled to Patna from Munger, and there cruelly ordered the massacre of the English in his power: there were 60 gentlemen, Messrs. Ellis, Hay, Lushington, and others, and 100 of lower rank. On the 6th October, they were brought out in parties, and barbarously cut to pieces, or shot under the direction of a German, named Samru or Sombre. Munger fell to the English early in October. Patna was stormed on the 6th November, and the Ex-Nawab Kasim 'Ali fled to the wazir of Audh, with his treasures, and the remnant of his army. On the 23rd of October, 1764 A.D., Major Carnac fought the celebrated battle of Buxar, completely routing the wazir Shuja-uddaula's army. The following day the Mughul emperor Shah Alam threw himself on the protection of the British, and joined their camp with the imperial standard of Hindustan. The British army advanced to overrun Audh. The wazir refused to deliver up Kasim 'Ali, though he had seized and plundered him. Kasim 'Ali made his escape at first into the Rohela country, with a few friends and some jewels, which he had saved from the fangs of his late ally, the wazir, and found a comfortable asylum in that country; but his intrigues rendered him disagreeable to the chief under whose protection he resided, he was obliged to leave it, and took shelter with the Raja of Gohad. After some years residence in his country, he proceeded to Jodhpur, and from thence came to try his fortune in the service of the emperor Shah Alam in 1774 A.D., 1188 A.H., but was disappointed, and died shortly after in 1777 A.D., 1191 A.H., at Kotwal an obscure village near Delhi, unpitied even by his own family. With Kasim 'Ali ended, virtually, the powers of the Subadars of Bengal.\n\nKasim Ali Khan, Nawab, uncle to the nawab of Rampur.

He was born at Tabriz; and was a member of a considerable family of the tribe of Sayyad, descended from the same stock as the Prophet. In his youth he dedicated himself, under the guidance of Sheikh Sadruddin Musa Ardibeli, to the contemplative life and deep study of the Sufis. He then journeyed to Ghilan, where he soon acquired great fame; and subsequently went into Khurasan. During his residence at Hira, he obtained such celebrity, and was surrounded by so many princes and learned men, his followers, that Mirza Shahrukh (the son of Amir Timur), moved by jealousy of the Sayyad, and attentive to the danger of the increase of the Sufi creed, commanded him to retire from the capital. In order to mitigate the harshness of this command, Baisanghar, the son of Shahrukh, learned and noble prince, came upon the steps of the Sayyad, and it is known to the Sayyad, which he did in the most humane manner, inquiring of him, in the course of conversation, why he did not follow the counsel contained in his own verse. The Sayyad inquired in which verse, and Baisanghar immediately quoted the following:\u2014\n\n\"Kasim cease at once thy lay;\nRise and take thy onward way;\nOther lands have waited long,\nWorthy thy immortal song:\nGive the bird of paradise\nWhat the vulture cannot prize;\nHoney let thy friends receive,\nTo thy foes the carrion leave.\"\n\nThe Sayyad thanked him, and immediately set out for Balkh and Samarkand, where he remained for a time. He afterwards, however, returned to Hira, where as before, he was constantly followed by great and powerful men. His death occurred in the village of Kharjard in Jam near Hira, where a garden had been bought for him by his disciples, in which he greatly delighted. This event took place in the year 1431 A.D., 835 A.H., and his tomb was erected in the very garden which he so much enjoyed. Amir Alisher afterwards piously endowed it.

Nizam Shah of Ahmadabad Shah, became entirely independent, and leaving to the king only the town and fort of Ahmadabad Bidar, read the public prayers and coined money in his own name. After having ruled his estate for a period of twelve years, during the lifetime of his sovereign, he died in the year 1504 A.D., 910 A.H., and his son Amir Barid succeeded him in office, and assuming still greater power, deprived Mahmud Shah of what little power had been left him by his father.

In the year 1700 A.D., 1112 A.H., he was appointed governor of Bid\u00e1r in the Dakh\u00edn by the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr, and subsequently of Karnatic Bij\u00e1spur. After the death of R\u00fah-ull\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n II, in 1703 A.D., he was honoured with the post of grand steward of the household with the rank of 2500 horse. At the time of 'Alamg\u00edr's death, he held the rank of 3000. He espoused the cause of 'Az\u00edm Sh\u00e1h against his brother Bah\u00e1d\u00edr Sh\u00e1h, and died of his wounds a few days after the battle in June, 1707 A.D., 1119 A.H.\n\nKhudyja, \u062e\u062f\u06cc\u062c\u0627, or Khadija, the first wife of Muham-mad. She was a widow and dealt in merchandise. She had employed Muham-mad for some time to drive her camels, and afterwards married him. Muham-mad had several children by her, but all of them died young, excepting three daughters, one of whom was F\u00e1tima, who was married to 'Ali. After her marriage with Muham-mad she lived 22 years, and died at Mecca three years before the commencement of the Hijr\u00ed era, and three days after the death of Ab\u00fa T\u00e1lib, the father of 'Ali, and uncle of Muham-mad. In August, 19 A.D., aged 69 lunar years, Mr. Buxkh\u00e1rdt informs us that the tomb of Khudyja is still remaining, and is regularly visited by pilgrims. It is enclosed by a square wall, and presents no objects of curiosity except the tombestone, which has a fine inscription in Kufic characters, containing a pas-sage from the Kur\u00e1n, from the chapter entitled, \"S\u00faratul-Kur\u00eds\".\n\nKhurd\u00e1dib\u00e1, \u062e\u0631\u062f\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0628, or Ibn-Khurd\u00e1dib\u00e1, surname of Ab\u00fa'l Kasim 'Ubd-ullah bin-'Ahmad (or 'Abdullah) Ibn-Khurd\u00e1dib\u00e1. This author has been the object of considerable controversies among the orientalists of Eu-rope. Khurd\u00e1dib\u00e1 (the grandfather of our author) was a magician, and was converted to Isl\u00e1m by the Bar-makides. Ab\u00fa'l Kasim (our author) was consequently appointed over the post and intelligence department in the provinces belonging to the Jab\u00e1l, (mountain); sub-sequently he came to the court of the Khalifa Mo'tamid, and became one of his privy counsellors. He is the author of several works, among which are\u20141, \"Kit\u00e1b Al\u00e1d-d\u00edn-Sam\u00e1,\" (for which H\u00e1n\u00e1d\u00ed gives very terri-tories, in fact in his life of Mo'tamid); 2, \"Kit\u00e1b Jamh\u00far Ansh\u00e1-ul-Fars\" containing the most celebrated Genealogies of the Persians; 3, \"Kit\u00e1b-al-Maslik-wal-Mum\u00e1l\u00edk,\" a geographical work on the roads and kingdoms; 4, \"Kit\u00e1b-al-Sharh\u00ed,\" on playing and amusements; 5, \"Kit\u00e1b-ul-Lahw\u00edwal-Mal\u00e1hi,\" on playing and amusements; 6, \"Kit\u00e1b-al-Anv\u00e1,\" on the stars, and 7, \"Kit\u00e1b-ul-Nud\u00e1m-wal-Julas\" on courtiers and companions. The Geography of Ibn-Khurd\u00e1dib\u00e1, says Sir H. M. Elliot, is the only work which we possess of this author, and of this there is only one copy in Europe. The MS. in question is ancient, bearing the date of 1282 A.D., 630 A.H., but it wants in most instances the diacritical points. It is preserved in the Bodleian Library at Ox-ford, No. 993.

His father Amir Mahm\u00fad Saif-udd\u00edn, a Turk of the tribe of L\u00e1ch\u00edn, came from Balhk to India and fixed his residence at Pat\u00eda where Khusr\u00f3 was born in the year 1253 A.D., 651 A.H. Khusr\u00f3 died six months after the death of N\u00edz\u00e1m-udd\u00edn Aulia, who was his spiritual guide, and was buried close to his tomb at Ghay\u00e1s-p\u00far in old Dehl\u00ed. His death hap-pened in September, 1326 A.D., Ram\u00e1zan, 725 A.H. Khusr\u00f3 unfortunately lived at a period, says Sir H. M. Elliot, when vice was triumphant throughout Hindust\u00e1n. He, however, had the happiness, during the last few years of his life, to see a just prince, Ghay\u00e1s-udd\u00edn Tughl\u00e1q, on the throne whose virtues he has commemorated in his history, called \"Tughl\u00e1k-n\u00e1ma,\" and whom he survived but a few months. The following beautiful poems are particularly admired by his countrymen; and in fact they rival those of the most esteemed poets of Persia.\n\n1. Tuhf\u00e1t-ul-Saghir.\n2. Shatt-ul-Hay\u00e1t.\n3.

Ris\u00e1la Na\u00e9r.\n\nBesides these there are several other poems, viz., \"Nuh S\u00edpehr,\" or the nine spheres, a beautiful mystical poem; the \"Kir\u00e1n-us-S\u00e1'd-dyn,\" or the auspicious conjunction, a poem in praise of Sult\u00e1n Mu'izz-udd\u00edn Kaikub\u00e1d, king of Dehl\u00ed, and his father N\u00e1s\u00edr-udd\u00edn Baghra Kh\u00e1n, king of\nKhusro\n\nBengal, who came to visit him. The \"Mak\u0101la\" containing memoirs of the first four Khalifas, viz., Abu Bakr, Umar, Usman and Ali, with a treatise on the Sufi tenets written in 1324 A.D., the \"Ishkia,\" a collection of poems on love subjects; the \"Matla'-ul-Anwar,\" on the Sufi doctrines, and his Diwan which is held in great estimation in India, containing poems chiefly on mystical theology and divine love: many of them have been set to music, and are chanted by the devotees or Sufis; frequently producing extravagant ecstasies, termed by them waqf, or spiritual delirium. The Khamsa or five celebrated books of Amir Khusro, which contains about 18,000 verses, are the following:\n\n1. Haft Bahisht.\n2. Sikandar-nama.\n3. Panj Ganj.\n\nKhusro is said to have written 99 books, some of which, besides the abovementioned, are the following:\n\n1. Ajia Khurshid.\n2. Afna Sikandar.\n3. Khizar Khani.\n4. Jalal-ud-Din Khurshid.\n5. Jawahir-ul-Bahr.\n\nKhusro Malik, son of Khusro Shah, was the last Sultan of the race of Ghaznavides. He ascended the throne at Lahore after the death of his father in 1160 A.D., 555 A.H., was defeated in 1184 A.D., 580 A.H., by Shahabuddin Ghori, then governor of Ghazni, who took him prisoner and sent him to his brother Ghayasuddin to Firoz Koh, where he died after some years.\n\nKhusro Malik, the brother-in-law of Sultan Muhammad Shah I, Tughlaq, whose sister named Khudwandzada he had married. He had once formed the project of taking the life of Sultan Firoz Shah the successor of Muhammad Shah, by concealing a number of persons in the rooms adjacent to where the king sat, but was saved by Dawar Malik, the son of Khusro Malik, who made a sign to him that danger was to be apprehended, upon which the king left the room and took refuge on the top of the house.\n\nKhusro Parvez, the son of Hurmus III (or IV), king of Persia of the Sassanian race. He, by the assistance of the Roman emperor Maurice, after defeating Bahram Chobin, his father's general, who had taken possession of the kingdom, ascended the throne of Persia 691 A.D. The empire being firmly established on the throne, he fulfilled in the most faithful manner the engagements he had entered into with his ally; and publicly adopted the emperor Maurice as his father; but when that emperor was slain in 603 A.D., he instantly declared war, on the grounds of avenging his father and benefactor. His generals invaded the Roman territories; Dara, Edessa, and other strong places on the frontier, were soon subdued; Syria was completely pillaged, Palestine overrun; Jerusalem taken, and the true cross, which had been enclosed in a golden case, and buried deep in the earth, was discovered, and borne in triumph to Persia. His reign of more than 30 years, was marked by a success never surpassed by the most renowned of his ancestors. Persia was, however, invaded by Heraclius the Roman emperor, who defeated the troops of Khusro wherever he encountered them, and marched, in one direction as far as the Caspian, in another to Isfahan; destroying in his way, preserving all his splendid palaces, plundering his hoarded treasures, and dispersing, in every direction, the countless slaves of his pleasure. The subjects of Khusro had lost all regard for a monarch whom they deemed the sole cause of the desolation of his country: a conspiracy was formed against him: he was seized by his eldest son Sheroya or Siros; his 18 sons were massacred before his face, and he was cast into a dungeon, and soon afterwards died or was put to death in 628 A.D., 7 A.H., after he had reigned 38 years. The glory of the house of Chosroes (Nauhurvan) ended with the life of Khusro: his unnatural son enjoyed only eight months the fruit of his crime.\n\nThe Muhammadan authors say, that Khusro had received an epistle from Muhammad, inviting him to acknowledge Muhammad as the apostle of God. He rejected the invitation, and tore the epistle. \"It is thus,\" exclaimed the Arabian prophet, \"that God will tear the kingdom, and reject the supplications of Khusro.\" The historians of Muhammad, says Gibbon, date this embassy in the seventh year of the Hijri which commenced 11th May, 628 A.D. Their chronology is erroneous since Khusro died in the month of February of the same year. Gibbon, Vol. VIII, p. 205.\n\nKhusro Shah, a descendant of the ancient kings of Badakhshan, whom Babar Shah defeated about the year 1505, and took possession of his country and made it over to his cousin Khan Mirza.\n\nKhusro Shah, surnamed Nizam-uddin, was the son of Bahr\u0101m Shah of Ghazni. He succeeded his father at Lahore in 1152 A.D., 547 A.H., and died there after a reign of seven years in 1160 A.D., 555 A.H. He was succeeded by his son Khusro Malik.\n\nKhusro Shah, called also Malik Khusro, a favourite slave and wazir of Sultan Mubarak Shah Khilji, king of Delhi, who was murdered on the 4th April, 1391 A.D., 5th Rajab, 721 A.H., and ascended the throne by the title of Nasiruddin Khushro Shah. He was soon after assassinated on the 26th August, 1391 A.D., 30th Rajab, 721 A.H., by Ghazi Beg Tughlaq, who the next day, mounted the throne and assumed the title of Ghayasuddin Tughlaq Shah I.\n\nKhusro, Sultan, the eldest son of the emperor Jahangir; was born in the month of August, 1587 A.D., Ramzan, 995 A.H., at Lahore. His mother was the sister of Raja Man Singh, the son of Raja Bhagwan Das, and after the birth of Khusro she got the title of Shah Begum. He died in the Dakhin on the 16th of January, 1622 A.D., 13th Rab' I, 1031 A.H., aged 36 lunar years, and his remains appear to have been transported to Allahabad, where he lies buried in a garden surrounded by pukka walls, called the garden of Sultan Khusro, and where his mother Shah Begum is also buried. The dome over his tomb has an inscription of several Persian verses, and contains the chronogram of the year of his death in the words \"Faiz Lask.\" It is related in the work called \"Maq\u0101\u1e63ir Kutb Shahi\" that Khusro was strangled by a man named Raz\u0101 by the order of Shah Jah\u0101n his younger brother.\n\nKhusai, a celebrated author, descendant from a tribe of Arabs called Khuzai.

The different rulers who have governed in the provinces of Jaunp\u00far and Antardab (territories south of Delhi lying between the rivers Jamna and Ganges) are styled by historians the Shark\u00ed kings. It appears from the T\u00e1v\u00e1r\u00edkh Mub\u00e1r\u00edk Sh\u00e1h\u00ed, that Sultan Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, son of F\u00edr\u00fas Sh\u00e1h Tughlak, king of Delhi, created one of his eunuchs, named Malik Sarwar, his prime-minister, and honoured him with the title of Khwaja Jah\u00e1n; that upon the death of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, and on the accession of his son Sultan Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h Tughlak, a boy of ten years of age, in 1594 A.D., 996 A.H., he was appointed governor of the Eastern provinces of India, viz. Jaunp\u00far, and the Khyber Pass, and Jaunp\u00far, the latter of which he made the seat of his government. The reign of Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h was interrupted by serious internal commotions; and Khwaja Jah\u00e1n taking advantage of these circumstances, and perceiving the weakness of the government arising out of the king's minority, assumed the title of Malik-us-Shark (King of the East), founded an independent kingdom at Jaunp\u00far, and died in the year 1400 A.D., 802 A.H., after a short reign of six years. He was succeeded by his adopted son Malik W\u00e1s\u00edl or Karanf\u00e1l, who assumed the title of Mub\u00e1r\u00edk Sh\u00e1h Shark\u00ed, and died in 1402 A.D., 804 A.H. After his death his brother Ibrahim Sh\u00e1h Shark\u00ed succeeded him, and died about the year 1441 A.D., 846 A.H., after a reign of more than forty years. He was succeeded by Sultan Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h Shark\u00ed, who died in 1452 A.D., 864 A.H., and left the kingdom to his son Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, who was killed in battle about the year 1468 A.D., 861 or 863 A.H., when Hum\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h, his brother, succeeded him. He had several battles with Bahlol Lodi, king of Delhi, and was at last obliged to seek refuge in the court of Sultan 'Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, king of Bengal, where he died in 1499 A.D., 905 A.H.\n\nKhwaja Jahan, Khwaja Jahan, an Amir of 5000, who died in the time of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, in the year 1619 A.D., 1029 A.H., at Lahor.\n\nKhwaja Jahan, Khwaja Jahan, vide Mahm\u00fad G\u00e1w\u00e1n.\n\nKhwaja Kamgar, Khwaja Kamgar, vide Ghair\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n.\n\nKhwaja Kirmani, Khwaja Kirmani, an excellent Persian poet of Kirm\u00e1n\u00ed, surnamed Malik-al-Fuq\u00e1, or king of the learned.

This prince was the founder of the sovereignty of Golkanda. His father Kutb ul-Mulk was originally a Turkish adventurer who came to try his fortune in the Deccan and embraced the service of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h Bahman\u00ed. By degrees he was promoted to high rank; and in the reign of Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h obtained the title of Kutb ul-Mulk and the Tarafd\u00e1r\u00ed or government of Teleng\u00e1na. In 1493 A.D., 899 A.H., he received orders to besiege the fortress of J\u00e1mkonda, and as he was reconnoitring, was killed by an arrow from the walls. After his death, his office and titles were conferred by the king on his son Sult\u00e1n Kuli with the territory of Golkanda, part of Teleng\u00e1na, in j\u00e1g\u00edr. On the decline of the Bahmani authority, when 'Adil Sh\u00e1h and others assumed royalty, he also in the year 1512 A.D., 918 A.H., styled himself Sult\u00e1n of Teleng\u00e1na under the title of Kuli Kutb Shah. He was a chief of great abilities and ruled the country for a period of 50 years, during which he governed Teleng\u00e1na in the name of Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h and reigned as king 32 lunar years; at the end of which he was assassinated by a Turkish slave supposed to have been bribed by his son and successor, J\u00e1msh\u00e9d Kutb Sh\u00e1h. His death happened on Sunday the 2nd September, 1543 A.D., 2nd Jam\u00e1da II, 950 A.H. The kings of the Kutb Sh\u00e1hi dynasty who reigned at Golkanda, are as follows:\n\n1.

In the beginning of his reign he was engaged in war with 'Adil Sh\u00e1h of Bij\u00e1pur, with whom he concluded peace in the year 1587 A.D., giving him his sister in marriage. The air of Golkanda not agreeing with his constitution, he founded a city at about eight miles distance, which he called Bh\u00e1gnagar, after his mistress Bh\u00e1gmat\u00ed a celebrated courtezan; but being afterwards ashamed of his amour, he changed it to Mah\u00e1nagar. Sh\u00e1h Abbas, emperor of Persia, courted his alliance, by giving his daughter in marriage for one of his sons; and Kutb Sh\u00e1h, estimating connection with so august a monarch as an honour, complied with his request. He was much esteemed for his abilities, was an encourager of literature, and is the author of the work called \"Kulli\u00e1t Kutb Sh\u00e1h,\" a very copious volume, containing Hindi, Dakhni, and Persian Poema, on a variety of subjects. He was the fourth Sultan of the Kutb Sh\u00e1hi dynasty and reigned 31 years.

He was installed by the Sult\u00e1n about the year 1140 A.D., and became the first king of Khw\u00e1rizm of the race called Khw\u00e1rizm Sh\u00e1hi.

He married the daughter of Sult\u00e1n Bahr\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, king of Ghazn\u00ed, and having founded the city of Fir\u00f3zkoh in Gh\u00f3r, made it his capital, and assumed all the dignities of a sovereign. At length he was induced to attack Ghazn\u00ed. Sult\u00e1n Bahr\u00e1m obtaining intimation of his invitations contrived to get him into his power, and eventually put him to death. This is the origin of the feuds between the houses of Gh\u00f3r and Ghazn\u00ed. Saif-uddin S\u00far\u00ed, prince of Gh\u00f3r, brother of the deceased, raised an army to revenge his death; with which he marched direct to Ghazn\u00ed, which was evacuated by Bahr\u00e1m, who fled to India.

He was still an idolater when Muhammed commenced publishing his laws. One of his poems commenced with this verse: \"All praise is vain which does not refer to God: and all good which proceeds not from Him is but a shadow;\" no other poet could be found to compete with it. At least the chapter of the Kor\u00e1n entitled S\u00e1hid, was attached to a gate in the same temple, and Lab\u00edd was overcome by the verses at its commencement as to declare that they could only be produced by the inspiration of God, and he immediately embraced Isl\u00e1mism. When Muhammed was apprised of the conversion of Lab\u00edd, the finest genius of his time, he was exceedingly delighted, and requested him to answer the invectives and satires of Amra-alkys and other infidel poets who wrote against the new religion and its followers. The following sentence is also attributed to him, which is the finest which ever fell from the lips of an Arab:\u2014\"All is vain which is not of God.\" Lab\u00edd is said to have lived to the age of 140 years, and died at the city of K\u00fafa in 141 of the Hijra (758 A.D.)

These two lovers are very famous throughout the East. Laili was the daughter of a neighbouring Chief. She was equally accomplished with her lover: and nothing seemed likely to disturb the happiness which their permitted attachment promised, till the avarice of her father destroyed at once all their hopes. Laili was commanded to take up Kais no more, as she was destined to be the bride of one much rich and powerful; and in spite of the grief and remonstrances of the unfortunate pair, they were separated. Kais became insane from disappointment, and his name was therefore changed to Majn\u00fan (the distracted). Death at length put a period to his miseries, and his faithful mistress soon followed him, leaving her cruel parent to his late and vain remorse, and the memory of these victims of avarice to eternal honour and regret.

He is the greatest of the Oriental moralists, and held in the highest esteem by the Orientals for his wisdom and virtues; even Muhammad speaks of him in the 31st chapter of the Koran which is called \"Sura Lukman,\" with profound reverence. Lukman's wisdom, like Solomon's, is supposed to have been of divine origin. One day as he was in his room, working at his trade (he was a carpenter) several angels invisibly entered and saluted him. Lukman, hearing voices, looked around him, but not seeing any one, made no reply. The angels then said: We are messengers from God, thy Creator and ours, who hath sent us to thee to inform thee, that He designs to make thee a monarch and His vicegerent on earth. Lukman answered: If it be the absolute will of God that I shall become a monarch, that will must be accomplished; and I assure that He will give me grace to execute His commands faithfully; but if the liberty of choice be given me, I should prefer abiding in my present condition; the only favour that I ask from God being, that He would preserve me from offending Him, for were I to offend Him, all the dignities of the earth would be but a burden to me. This reply was so agreeable to God that He at once bestowed on Lukman the gifts of Knowledge and Wisdom to a degree hitherto unparalleled. The Maxims of Lukman are ten thousand in number; and \"any one of these,\" says an Arabian commentator, \"is of much greater value than the whole world.\" His wisdom and the striking morality of his fables, are so like those of Aesop that he is considered by some as the same personage.\n\nLutf, the poetical name of Mir Amman, a Hindustani lyric poet, and one of the learned natives formerly attached to the College of Fort William.

After his death, the Sult\u00e1n built a magnificent mausoleum at the western gate of the city, and endowed therein a shrine to the memory of the holy man; opposite to it he caused to be raised another edifice, surmounted by a superb dome, which was intended as a resting-place for his own mortal remains, and these may still be seen. Lutfull\u00e1h proceeded to England as secretary to Mir Ja'far 'Ali the son-in-law of Mir A'z\u00e1f-udd\u00edn, Naw\u00e1b of S\u00farat in March 1844, and after his return from England he wrote his adventures in 1854, entitled the \"Autobiography of Lutfull\u00e1h\" in English, and dedicated it to Colonel W.

He was raised to the throne of Delhi after the death of his brother Humayun Shah in April, 1394 A.D., Jumada II, 796 A.H., at the age of ten years. His minority and the dissensions of the nobles encouraged many of the surrounding chiefs to revolt against the same imperator. In his time Amir Timur invaded India and defeated Mahmud Tughlak in a battle fought (according to Firuztah) on the 15th of January, 1399 A.D., 7th Jumada I, 801 A.H., and according to Sharafuddin Yezdi, on Tuesday the 7th of Rabi' II, 801 A.H., corresponding with the 17th December, 1398 A.D., when Mahmud fled to Gujrat, and Timur the next day took possession of Delhi:\n\nOn the eighth of Rabi'-us-Sani', with the sun In Capricorn, Timur died Delhi won.\n\nTimur soon after his conquest of Delhi returned to Persia with an immense treasure from India. After the departure of that conqueror, Nasrat Khan, son of Fatha Khan, the son of Firuz Shah took possession of Delhi, and ascended the throne with the title of Nasrat Shah.

But the governors of provinces no longer acknowledged allegiance to the throne, having established their independence during the civil war. Mahmud Shah died on the 4th of March, 1412 A.D., 26th Zil-Ka'da 815 A.H., and was succeeded by Daulat Khan Lodhi. With Sultan Mahmud the empire of Delhi fell from the race of the Turks who were adopted slaves of Sultan Shahabuddin Ghori.\n\nMahmud, Sultan, the celebrated king of Ghazni, was the eldest son of Sultan Nasiruddin Subuktigin. His father at his death, 997 A.D., 387 A.H., unmindful of the superior right of Mahmud (who was then employed in the government of Khurasan) bequeathed his kingdom to Isma'il, a younger son. Isma'il attempted to confirm himself in the power to which he was raised, but on the approach of Mahmud, after a vain attempt at resistance, he was compelled to throw himself upon the clemency of his offended brother. Mahmud reigned more than 33 lunar years, during which he made twelve expeditions into India; took Lahore, Delhi, Kanauj and other parts of Hindustan; many hundred temples of the Hindus he levelled with the ground; many thousand idols he demolished, and broke to pieces the famous idol of Somnath, the fragments of which he distributed to Ghazni, Mecca and Medina.

This was doubtless another marriage of policy, for Maimuna was 51 years of age, and a widow, but the connexion gained him two powerful proselytes. One was Kh\u00e1lid, the son of Wal\u00edd, a nephew of the widow, who by his prowess obtained the appellation of \"The Sword of God.\" The other was Kh\u00e1lid's friend, 'Amr\u00fa the son of 'As; the same who assailed Muhammad with poetry and satire at the commencement of his prophetic career. Maimuna was the last spouse of the prophet, and, old as she was at her marriage, survived nearly all his other wives. She died many years after his death, in a pavilion at Sarif, under the same tree in the shade of which her nuptial tent had been pitched, and was there interred. This event took place about the year 671 A.D., 51 A.H.\n\nMaisana, the Bedouin bride of the khal\u00edf Mu'\u00e1wiya I, and the mother of Yez\u00edd, was a daughter of the tribe of Kal\u00e1b; a tribe remarkable for the purity of direct speech in it. She was married to Mu'\u00e1wiya whilst very young; but this exalted situation by no means suited the disposition of Maisana, and amidst all the pomp and splendour of Damascus, she languished for the simple pleasures of her native desert. She was an excellent poetess, and had pleased Mu'\u00e1wiya's fancy to that degree with some of her verses, that he made her go back into the desert amongst her own relations, and take her son Yez\u00edd along with her, that he also might be brought up a poet. This part of his education succeeded, for he was reckoned to excel in that way, though his chief talent consisted in making himself a drunken wretch.

He had been raised by the death of his father in August, 997 A.D., Sh\u00e1h's 87 A.H. when very young, to the government of the city and the surrounding country. During the minority of this prince, all the power was in the hands of his mother, Mahm\u00fad commanded one of his officers to inform the lady, that she must submit to his authority, or prepare for war. \"Had such a message been sent,\" replied the heroine, \"in the life of my deceased lord, it must have occasioned great embarrassment. That is not the case now. I know Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad; and from his character, am assured he will never undertake an expedition without calculating all the chances. If he attack and conquer a weak woman, where is the glory of such an achievement? If he be repulsed, the latest ages will hear of the shame of such a defeat!\" Mahm\u00fad, either swayed by the above reasons, or others of more weight, did not prosecute his designs upon Rei, till Majd-uddaula was of age, when he assumed the reins of government.

The Hindus insist that the emperor Akbar was a Hindu in a former generation. The proximity of the time in which this famous emperor lived, has forced them, however, to account for this in the following manner:\u2014\"There was a holy Brahman of the above name, who wished very much to become emperor of India, and the only practicable way for him was to die first, and be born again. For this purpose he made a desperate Jagrata, wishing to remember the very things he knew in his present generation. This could not be fulfilled; but he was indulged with writing upon a brass plate a few things which he wished more particularly to remember; then he was directed to bury the plate, and promised that he should remember the place in the next generation. Makunda went to Allahabad, buried the plate and then buried himself. Nine months after he was born in the character of Akbar, who, as soon as he ascended the throne, went to Allahabad, and easily found the spot where the brass plate was buried.\" (Mill's British India, Vol. II, page 152.) The translation of the inscription on the brass plate, is as follows: \"In the Sambat year 1598 on the 12th day of the 2nd fortnight of the month of Magh, I Makunda Bramchhari, whose food was nothing but milk, sacrificed myself at Parag (Allahabad) the grand place of worship, with the design that I should become the ruler of the whole world.\" The above date corresponds with the 27th of January, 1542 A.D., and Akbar was born on Sunday, the 15th of October the same year, being three or four days less than nine lunar months after the above circumstance.\n\nMaldeo Rao, \u0645\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648 \u0631\u0627\u0624, a raja of Marwar of the Rathor tribe of Rajputs, and a descendant of Jodha Rao who founded Jodhpur.

When Sir Seymour Fitz Gerald sent a peremptory message directing the brother Khanda Rao to replace his mission (Diwan) by some man of character, the Gaekowar fell into so violent a rage, that the conflict of passion deprived him of life. At that time Malhar Rao the present ruler was a prisoner.

About this period several complications happened in the Delhi Government, owing to the rebellion of Sultan Salim, the death of Akbar, and revolt of Sultan Khusrav, successively. Ambar had leisure to regulate his country, levy great armies, and even dared to seize several of the imperial districts. When the authority of the emperor Jahangir was established, he sent frequent armies to the Dakhin, but Ambar was not to be subdued. He at length gave up the places taken from the Mughals to the prince Shah Jah\u00e1n, to whose interest he became attached, and continued loyal till his death which took place in the year 1626 A.D., 1035 A.H., in the 80th year of his age.

In the well-known town of Mhow in Azimgarh, there is a place which obtains the distinguished title of \"N\u00e1th Bhanjan\" from the great exploits of a saint called Malik Jahir who ejected the evil genius Deo N\u00e1th together with the original Hind\u00fas, and colonized the place with Muhammadans. The story is thus related: During the reign of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, king of Delhi, about 1609 A.D., one Abhim\u00e1n Singh, Rajah of the Satran tribe, having separated from his brothers, owing to the inadequacy of the share allotted to him in his hereditary possessions, took service under that monarch, and on his having embraced the religion of Muhammed, Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr granted to him the whole Zamind\u00e1r\u00ed of Azimgarh, under the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Abhim\u00e1n Singh 'Ali Muhammed Nazir-uddaula Kh\u00e1n. From that period up to the time the Naw\u00e1b of Audh resumed the grant, the Muhammadans had the supremacy over the Hind\u00fas, but in 1801 A.D., when the district was ceded to the British, the Hind\u00fas taking courage came and resided there; since then there have always been feuds between the parties.\n\nMalik Kummi, Mulla, \u0645\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u06a9\u0645\u06cc, a native of Kumm in Persia.

He succeeded his father Alp Arsalan in December, 1072 A.D., 465 A.H., and reigned twenty years. His right to the crown was disputed by his brother Kadir Beg, also called Kardar (which see) prince of Kirm\u00e1n; but that chief was defeated and taken prisoner, and afterwards poisoned or put to death. Malik Shah subdued almost the whole of Syria and Egypt: being more fortunate than his father, not only conquered Bukhara, Samarqand and Khwarizm, but received homage from the tribes beyond Jaxartes. After the death of his wazir Nizam ul-Mulk, he moved from Isfahan to Baghdad, with the design of transplanting the khalifa Al-Mukhtari, and fixing his own residence at the capital of the Moslem world. The respite successor of Muhammad obtained a respite of ten days; and before the expiration of the term the Sultan was summoned by the angel of death. He died in the 38th year of his age in the month of November, 1092 A.D., Shawwal, 485 A.H., a few days after Nizam ul-Mulk his wazir, who was assassinated by a follower of Hasan Sabbah. The greatness and unity of the Seljukian empire expired in the person of Malik Shah. He invented an era called T\u00e1rikh Malikshahi or Jal\u00e1l\u00ed (Jalal\u00ed Era). This Era, according to Dr. Hyde commences 15th March, 1079 A.D., corresponding with the 11th Ramaz\u00e1n 471 A.H. Malik Shah left four sons Barkay\u00e1rak, Muhammad, Sanjar and Mahmud, all of whom attained power in their turns. Mahmud the youngest, was only four years of age when his father died; but the ambition of his mother, the Sultana Kh\u00e1tun Tur\u00e1nk, placed the crown upon his infant head. However, she was soon compelled to resign, and after some time they both died, and Sultan Barkay\u00e1rak succeeded him.\n\nMalik Sharki, Mirza, an author.\n\nMalik ul-Afzal, Malik al-afzal, surnamed Nuruddin Ali, the eldest of the seventeen sons of Salahuddin Yusuf ibn-Ayyub. On the death of his father at Damascus in 1193 A.D., 689 A.H., he took possession of that kingdom which his brother Malik al-Aziz Usman obtained that of Egypt, and their brother Malik uz-Zahir continued to hold Aleppo. Damascus was afterwards besieged and taken by his uncle Malik ul-'Adil Saifuddin Abu Bakr (the Saphadin of Christian writers). Nuruddin Ali in a poetical address to the khalifa Nasir, lamented the similarity of his own fate to that of the khalifa 'Ali ibn-'Abd Talib (his namesake) in being thus excluded from his rights by Abu Bakr and Usman; the khalifa in his reply consoled him by the assurance that in him he should find the Nasir (protector) whom Ali had sought in vain; but the intercession of the khalifa was unavailing to procure the restitution of any part of his territories. In 1198 A.D., however, on the death of his brother, the Sultan of Egypt, Nuruddin became Atabak, or guardian, to his infant nephew Malik ul-Man\u1e63ur, and attempted by the aid of his brother the Sultan of Aleppo, to recover Damascus from his uncle, but the expedition failed, and Nuruddin retaliated by invading Egypt, and expelled the young Sultan and his guardian, 1199 A.D. The unfortunate Nuruddin now retired to Samoata, where he died apparently without issue. He was born in June, 1171 A.D., whilst his father was acting as wazir to the Egyptians. He died suddenly in February, 1225 A.D., Safar 622 A.H., and was buried in Aleppo.

These Mamlukes reigned in Egypt 275 lunar years, that is to say, from 1250 to 1517 A.D., 648 to 923 A.H., when Salim I, emperor of the Turks, entirely subdued and exterminated them.

In the reign of Sh\u00e1hp\u00far, the son of Ardish\u00e9r, king of Persia, about the year 277 A.D., a painter named M\u00e1n\u00ed, having learned from the conversation of some Christians, that the Redeemer had promised to send a Comforter, after him, formed the wild design of passing for the Paraclete; and, as no opinions are so absurd, as not to be embraced, he soon drew together a multitude of proselytes. Sh\u00e1hp\u00far was enraged at this imposture, and wished to punish the author of it; but M\u00e1n\u00ed found means to escape, and fled as far as the borders of China, having first told his followers, that he was going to India, and promised to meet them in a certain grot, at the end of the year. In this retreat he amused himself with painting a number of strange figures and views, which at the year's end, he showed to his disciples, as a work given to him by angels. He was a very ingenious artist, and had a lively fancy, so that his pictures, which were finely coloured, easily persuaded the credulous multitude, in the infancy of the art in Asia, that they were really divine; they were bound together in a book called Ariang, which is often alluded to by the Persian poets. Mingling the pure doctrines of Christianity with paganism, he taught that there were two principles of all things, coeternal and coeval, that is, God and the Devil, that from the former all good, and from the latter all evil proceeded. The good being, he called, the author of the new testament, the bad of the old. God, he added, created the soul, the devil, the body. He pretended that he had received letters, and therefore sent for Sh\u00e1hp\u00far to cure his son, but his pretended power failed him, the child died in his arms, and the disappointed father ordered the prophet to be flayed alive, and his skin stuffed with chaff to be hung up at the gates of the capital, where Epiphanius who refuted his doctrines, saw it.

The Musalm\u0101ns differed in their opinions about the character of this person. Some took him to be a saint, and gave out that he performed miracles; others believed him to be a sorcerer or a juggler, and that he only deceived people with his tricks. He was, however, condemned and sentenced by the khalif of Baghd\u0101d, Ma\u1e33\u1e6d\u0101dir, and was put to death, because he used to proclaim \"An-ul-hak,\" i.e., \"I am the truth,\" or in other words, \"I am God.\" When they had thrown him to the dogs of execution, they first cut off both his hands, then his legs, then plucked out his eyes, cut out his tongue, and separated his head from his body. They then burned his mangled corpse to ashes, and threw it into the Tigris. This circumstance took place in the year 919 A.D., 306 A.H., but according to Ibn-Khallik\u0101n, on the 24th Zi-Ka'da, 309 A.H., corresponding with 26th March, 922 A.D.

Manuchehr died after a reign of 120 years, and was succeeded by his son Narim\u0101n, the chief part of whose reign died S\u0101m, the son of Narim\u0101n. After the death of S\u0101m, Pashang the king of T\u016br\u0101n invaded Persia with a force of 30,000 men, commanded by his son, Afrasi\u0101b.

During the reign of Karim Khan, he went from India to Shiraz, where his\nfollowers soon amounted to more than thirty thousand. The orthodox priests took alarm, and prevailed on the mild Karim Khan to banish the saint from his capital, but his reputation was increased by the act of power which proclaimed him dangerous. After Karim Khan's death, Mir Mas'um, who resided in a small village near Isfahan, disputed his first disciple, Fayz Ali, to teach in that city. That holy person soon died, and was succeeded in his office by his son Nur Ali Shah; who, though young in years, was, (to use the phrase of his historian), \"old in piety.\" The number and rank of Mir Mas'um's followers excited alarm in the priests of Isfahan, who transmitted an exaggerated account of the vile heresies of the Sufis to Ali Murad Khan, the king, and recommended him so strongly to support the faith, by punishing those whose opinions were alike hostile to true religion and good government, that the moment he received these representations, secret orders to cut off the noses and ears of some among the most zealous of the obnoxious sect; and as a further disgrace, to shave the beards of all who had adopted their opinions. The ignorant soldiers intrusted with the execution of this mandate, were not very capable of discriminating between true believers and infidels: and we are assured by a contemporary writer, that many orthodox Muhammadians had their noses and ears cut off, and their beards shaved on this memorable occasion.\n\nMir Mas'um Ali and Nur Ali Shah, after wandering from one place to another, re-visited Kirm\u00e1n, where Muhtak Ali, the most pious of his disciples, was put to death. At Kirm\u00e1nshah Nur Ali Shah was placed in confinement; and Mir Mas'um was murdered when at prayer in the midst of his followers. This act, however, neither checked nor checked efforts of their religious continuance to increase in numbers, and Nur Ali Shah, with all who adhered to him, were banished the kingdom. His avowed disciples were at this period about sixty thousand; but many more were supposed to be secretly devoted to him. He is said to have been poisoned at Mauasal. It is related that two inhabitants of Kirm\u00e1nshah, who were distinguished by an extraordinary appearance of zeal, dressed his dinner on the day that he was suddenly attacked by violent spasms, which in a few hours terminated his existence. Their flight led all to suspect them of having poisoned him. Nur Ali died at 9 o'clock on the morning of the 3rd June, 1800 A.D., 10th Mu-harram, 1215 A.H.

According to a chronogram of Jurat, he died in 1807 A.D., 1222 A.H.\n\nMuhammad, \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f, (or Mahomed) the Arabian prophet, author of the \"Kur\u00e1n,\" was born on Monday the 20th of April, 671 A.D., 10th Rab' I, A.H. at Mecca in Arabia, and was of the tribe of Kureish, the noblest of the country. Arab writers make him to be descended in a right line from Ishmael the son of Abraham; but do not pretend to any certainty in the remote part of his genealogy. He lost his father, Abdullah, before he was two years old, and his mother, Amina, before he was six; but their attention was supplied by the care of his grand-father 'Abdul Muttalib, and of his mother's father, named Khudrya, who sent merchandise into Syria. This woman fell in love with Muhammad, the driver of her camels, and married him. In his frequent journeys through Arabia, he had observed the various sects which divided the opinions of the eastern Christians, and he considered that nothing could so firmly secure to him the respect of the world as laying the foundation of a new religion. He, in his 40th year assumed the title of the Apostle of God, and gradually increased his fame and his followers by the aid of pretended visions. When he found himself exposed to danger at Mecca, he left the city, and retired to Madina, where his doctrines found a more friendly reception. This event, which happened in the year 622 A.D., forms the celebrated era of the Muhammedans, called the hirja or hirj, which signifies Separation. At Madina the prophet erected his standard, and as for thirteen years before he had endeavoured to spread his doctrines by persuasion, he now propagated them by the sword. In the eleventh year of the Hijra the prophet fell sick, and after a confinement of thirteen days, he died on Monday the 8th of June, 632 A.D., 12th Rab' I, 11 A.H., aged 63 lunar years. He was buried in the same place where he died, in the chamber of the most beloved of his wives 'Ayesha, the daughter of Abu Bakr, at Madina, where his remains\nare still preserved. It is very remarkable that though Muhammad himself so often declared in the Qur\u00e1n that he wrought no miracles, yet his followers have ascribed a great many to him. For instance, they affirm, that he caused water to flow from his fingers; that he split the moon in two; that the stones, trees, and beasts acknowledged him to be the true prophet sent from God, and saluted him as such; that he went one night from Mecca to Jerusalem, from whence he ascended up to heaven, where he saw and conversed with God, and came back again to Mecca before the next morning; with many more miracles equally incredible. Muhammad permitted by his laws the wives of each of his followers; but did not limit himself to that number; for he observed that a prophet, being peculiarly gifted and privileged, was not bound to restrict himself to the same laws as ordinary mortals. The authors who give him the smallest number of wives, own that he had fifteen, four of whom, however, never shared conubial rites. Their names and the year when they died, are as follow:\n\n| A. D.

His reign was begun with preparations for war; he besieged Constantinople, and conveyed over the land some of his galleys into the harbour, which the Greeks had shut up against the invaders. Constantineople was taken by him on Tuesday the 29th of May, 1453 A.D., 20th Jumada I, 857 A.H., and in her fall poured forth her fugitive philosophers and learned men to revive literature in the Western world. Muhammad by his victories, deserved the name of Great; and the appellation of Grand Seignor, which he assumed, has descended to his successors. After subduing two empires, twelve tributary kingdoms and two hundred towns, he was preparing for the subjugation of Italy, when a colic proved fatal to him, and he died on Thursday the 3rd May, 1481 A.D., 3rd Rabii I, 886 A.H., after a reign of 31 lunar years. His death was the cause of universal rejoicings over the Christian world, whose religion he had sworn to exterminate, and the tenets of Muhammad. He was of an exceeding courage and strength, of a shrewd wit, and very fortunate; but within he was faithless and cruel; and in his time occasioned the death of 80,000 Christians of both sexes. His son Bayezid II succeeded him.\n\nMuhammad III, (or Mahomet III), emperor of the Turks, succeeded his father Murad III in January, 1595 A.D., 903 A.H., to the throne of Constantinople. He began his reign by ordering nineteen of his brothers to be strangled, and ten of his father's wives to be drowned, whom he supposed to be with child. He made war against Rodulphus II, emperor of Germany, and invaded Hungary with an army of 200,000 men, but his progress was checked by Maximilian the emperor's brother, who would have obtained a decisive victory, had not his troops abandoned themselves to pillage. Muhammad, obliged to retire from Hungary, buried himself in the indolence of his seraglio. He died of the plague, after a reign of 9 years in January, 1604 A.D., Shaban, 1012 A.H., aged 59 years, and was succeeded by his son Ahmad I.\n\nMuhammad IV, (or Mahomet IV), emperor of the Turks, was the son of Ibrahim, whom he succeeded on the throne of Constantinople in 1649 A.D., 1059 A.H. He pursued the war with the Venetians, and after reducing Candia, with the loss of 200,000 men, he invaded Poland. His arms proved victorious, but the disgrace was wiped off by the valor of Sobeski, king of Poland, who the next year routed his enemies at the battle of Chocim. He was deposed in 1687 A.D., 1088 A.H., and sent to prison where he died in 1691 A.D., 1101 A.H. He was succeeded by his brother Sulaiman II.\n\nMuhammad Abd, author of a Persian work on jurisprudence called \"Asa' ul-Islam,\" the Foundation of Muhammadanism, and of one called \"Fitna Sunnat wa-Jama'a.\"\n\nMuhammad 'Adil Shah, king of Bijapur, succeeded his father Ibrahim 'Adil Shah II, in the year 1626 A.D., 1036 A.H. As the armies of the emperor of Delhi were daily extending their conquests in the Dakhin, and he knew that should the country of Ahmadnagar be reduced, his own would become the object of attack, he assisted Nizam Shah against the imperial arms; and more than once suffered for his conduct, being obliged to purchase peace by large contributions. In the year 1634 A.D., 1044 A.H. the armies of the emperor Shah Jah\u00e1n invaded the Dakhin on three quarters and laid waste the country of Bijapur without mercy. After the reduction of Daulatabad and other forts, with most part of the kingdom of Nizam Shah, Muhammad 'Adil Shah agreed to pay a considerable tribute to the emperor. He was the last king of Bijapur who struck coins in his own name. In the latter part of his reign, his vassal Sewaji, the son of Sahib Bhoela, by stratagem and treachery obtained great power, and the foundation of Bijapur's church became weakened. He died in November, 1666 A.D., March, 1077 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Ali 'Adil Shah II. His tomb at Bijapur called \"Gol Gumbaz,\" has a dome which measures 130 feet in diameter which can be seen from 30\nMuhammad Afzal, author of the work named \"Madnat ul-Aubia.\" It gives an account of the creation of the world, and a history of all the prophets prior to the birth of Muhammad.\n\nMuhammad Afzal, Shaikh, son of Shaikh 'Abdur Rahim, a p\u00edrada and native of Gh\u00e1zipur, who by the command of his murshid or spiritual guide, Mir Syyid Muhammad of K\u00e1li, fixed his residence at Allahabad where he held a school and passed the remainder of his life in teaching Arabic and Persian and making proselytes. He is the author of several works; was born on the 28th October, 1634 O.S., 10th Rab\u00ed I, 1038 A.H., and died aged 37 lunar years on Friday, the 2nd of January, 1713 O.S., 15th Zil-hijjah, 1124 A.H.

His state came under the immediate control of the Political Department in the end of 1870 when his son Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm 'Ali Kh\u00e1n was installed as Naw\u00e1b of Tonk.\n\nMuhammad 'Ali, Mir, of Burh\u00e1np\u00far, author of the Mirat-us-Safi.\u2014(See All the Year Round, Vol. XVIII, p. 167.)\n\nMuhammad 'Ali, Viceroy of Egypt. Upwards of twelve centuries have passed since Egypt fell under the arms of the successful General of the Khalif Omar; for a little over five centuries it remained in the possession of the successors of the conqueror; their power was put to an end by the Turkomans in 1171 A.D., and about eighty years afterwards the latter were in their turn supplanted by the Mamlooks. The Mamlooks raised one of their own number to the throne, with the title of Sult\u00e1n, and the dynasty lasted till 1517, when the last of the Mamlook Sult\u00e1ns was put to death by the Turkish Sultan Salam, who appointed a Pasha to the government assisted by a council of twenty-four Mamlook beys or chiefs. This state of things lasted till 1798, when the French under Bonaparte landed in Egypt, and after destroying the Mamlooks, were themselves attacked and defeated by the British in 1801. After the departure of the British, the country fell into anarchy till it was restored by Muhammad 'Ali, who by the massacre of the remaining Mamlooks made himself master of the situation. The treaty of London in 1841 made the government of Egypt hereditary in the family of Muhammad 'Ali, and Isma'il Pasha is his grandson. Egypt has now ceased to be a province of Turkey. Its ruler has had all along been an independent sovereign conceded to him by the Porte, which dates from the 8th of June, 1873 A.D. Muhammad was born in 1769, entered the Turkish army, and in 1798 was sent to Egypt at the head of a contingent to co-operate with the British against the French invaders. Here his fine military qualities rapidly developed themselves, and he at length became the Commander of the Albanian Corps d'arm\u00e9e in Egypt. He was soon after involved in disputes with the Mamlooks who had long practically ruled Egypt. They were at length entirely exterminated in 1820. He declared himself independent of the Porte in 1838, and died on the 2nd August, 1849 A.D. He was succeeded by his son or grandson Isma'il Pasha.\n\nMuhammad 'Ali Shah, whose former title was Naw\u00e1b Nasir-udd\u00edna, was the son of Sa'd\u00e1t 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, Naw\u00e1b of Audh. He was placed on the throne of Lakhnau by the British, after the death of his nephew Sulaim\u00e1n Jah Nasir-udd\u00edn. He died on the 8th of July, 1837 A.D., 4th Rab\u00ed II, 1253 A.H., at the age of 70 years, and took the title of Ab\u00fa'l Fath Nasir-udd\u00edn Sult\u00e1n Zam\u00e1n Muhammad 'Ali Sh\u00e1h. He reigned exactly five lunar years, and died at Lakhnau on Tuesday the 17th May, 1842 A.D., 5th Rab\u00ed II, 1258 A.H., when his son Suryya Jah Amjad 'Ali Sh\u00e1h succeeded him.\n\nMuhammad al-Mahdi, the first khal\u00edf or king of Barbary of the race of the Fatimites. He began to reign in 908 A.D., 296 A.H., and was supposed to be a descendant of H\u00fasain the son of 'Al\u00ed and F\u00e1tima, whence the race is called Fatimites. His descendants conquered Egypt. He died in 938 A.D., 321 A.H., and was succeeded by his son K\u00e1'im Bilm\u00e1r-ull\u00e1h, who died in 946 A.D., 354 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Mans\u00far Bil\u00edsh in 952 A.D., 341 A.H. Vide Maizl\u00ed-ud-d\u00edn-Allah.\nMuhammad Amin, son of Daulat Muhammad al-Husain al-Balkh\u012b, is the author of the work called \"Anfa' ul-Akhb\u0101r,\" or Useful Chronicle; was in the service of Naw\u0101b Sipahdar Kh\u0101n, who receives a long and laudatory notice at the close of the work. He concluded it in 1628 A.D., 1038 A.H., and styled it Anfa' ul-Akhb\u0101r, because the Hijri year 1038 A.H., in which it was completed, is represented by the letters composing those words. He resided chiefly at Ahmadnagar.\n\nMuhammad Amin, author of the work entitled \"Asr\u0101r ul-Ma'\u0101n\u012b,\" a collection of poems on the conquests of the emperor 'Alamg\u012br, and a panegyric on several cities of the Dakhin, which previous to its being subduced by his arms, was esteemed the garden of India.

He was the chief counsellor of the emperor Muhammad Sh\u0101h, and was appointed Waz\u012br with the above title after the death of Sayyad Husain 'Ali Kh\u0101n and the imprisonment of his brother Sayyad 'Abdullah Kh\u0101n in 1720 A.D., 1133 A.H., but he had scarcely entered on his office, when he was taken ill and died suddenly on the 17th of January, 1721 O.S., 29th Rabi' I, 1133 A.H. After his death the office of prime-minister was only filled by a temporary substitute, being ultimately designed for Niz\u0101m ul-Mulk 'Asaf Jah, who was then in the Dakhin.\n\nMuhammad Amin Razi, vide Am\u012bn Ahmad, author of the Haft Ak\u012bm.\n\nMuhammad Amir Khan, of Agra, author of the \"Maul\u016bd N\u0101dir\u012b\" containing the history and miracles of 'Abdul Kadir Gil\u0101n\u012b in Urdu, written in 1847 A.D., 1263 A.H., vide Muhammad Kas\u012bm.\n\nMuhammad Ansar, author of the work called \"Malf\u016bz\u0101t Shaikh Ahmad Maghrab\u012b,\" or the Memoirs of Shaikh Ahmad Khatt\u016b, a very celebrated Suf\u012b of Gujrat, whose tomb is at Ahmad\u0101bd\u0113d, and still held in veneration.

This work, though mentioned by H\u00e1j\u00ed Kh\u00e1lifa, had hitherto escaped the industry of European explorers, but a portion of it (four books) has been found in the Royal Library of Paris, and the remainder in Herr von Hammer-Purgstall's collection. By a passage in the Fehrist, that learned gentleman has found that the Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights) had a Persian origin. In the eighth book, the author says that the first who composed tales and ap\u00f3logues were the kings of the first race of the Persians; then those of the Arsacides and the third, the famous royal dynasties of Persia: these tales were augmented and multiplied by the Sasanides. The Arabs, he then proceeds to say, translated them into their tongue, composing others like them. The first book of this kind was the Ha\u00e9dar Af\u00e9dna or Thousand Tales, the subject of which the writer explains, mentioning Shahrz\u00e1da and Dim\u00e1rs\u00e1da as the two females who practice the ruse upon the king. \"It is said,\" continues the author, \"that this book was composed by Hum\u00e1\u00e9, the daughter of Bahman.\" The truth is, that the first who\nMuhammad had these tales told him at night, was Alexander the Great, in order that he might keep awake, and be upon his guard. The kings who came after him made use, for the same purpose, of the Thousand Tales, which fill up a thousand nights, and two hundred conversations beside, in the light of the moon, which were related in a number of nights.

He by the command of the khalif in the year 711 A.D., 92 A.H., marched with a large army to Sindh and having defeated and killed the chief of the country took possession of it on Thursday the 23rd June, 712 A.D., 10th Ramazan, 93 A.H. From amongst the prisoners captured in the fort of Alor, two daughters of the raja were sent to Damascus, and the khalif sent them to his harem, consigning them to the care of his people until their grief should be assuaged. After two months, they were brought to the presence of the khalif; when they raised the veils from their faces, the khalif was smitten with their beauty, and asked their names; one was called Girpaloo, the other Sirajuddin. The khalif ordered one to his own bed; she said, \"O my Lord, I am not fit for the king's service, we have both for three days been with Bin-Kasim, who after dishonouring us, sent us here.\" The king was highly incensed, and directed that his servants should send Bin-Kasim, sew him up in a cow-hide, and send him to India. When Bin-Kasim received this order, he directed the messengers to do as they were directed. They obeyed the order, conveyed Bin-Kasim with a raw cow-hide; after enduring the torture for three days he died. They then put his body into a box, and conveyed it to the khalif who opening it in the presence of the two women, said, \"Behold how absolute is my power, and how I treat such servants as Bin-Kasim.\" The women replied, \"Oh king, just men ought not to be precipitate in great affairs, or be too hasty to act, either upon the representation of friends or foes.\" The khalif asked their meaning, they said, \"We made this accusation against Bin-Kasim because of the hatred we bore him, seeing that he slew our father, and through him we lost all our property and possessions, and became exiles from our own country; but Bin-Kasim was like a father and brother to us, he looked not on us for any bad purpose, but what his object was revenge for the blood of our father, we accused him of doing so; this end attained, do with us as you will.\" The khalif, hearing this, suffered great remorse: he ordered the two women to be tied to horses, and dragged to death, and they buried Bin-Kasim in the burial place at Damascus.

He lived in Kulbarga in the reign of the Bahamani Sultans and had the artifice to engage Prince Ahmad Shah, to become his disciple, and build him a fine house and a superb convent. When this prince ascended the throne, in 1422 A.D., 825 A.H., the credit of the saint became so great, that from the lord to the artificer, all made it their glory to follow his instructions; so that his tomb became a place of pilgrimage to all sects.

His tomb is a magnificent edifice covered with a dome, in the middle of an extensive court.

He afterwards went to Gwalior, where he engaged himself in the pursuits of his holy calling and in making proselytes; and managed to content himself with the proceeds of a jagir, which yielded a crore of tangas. He was the murshid or master of Sh\u0101h\u012bf Wajih-uddin 'Alw of Gujrat, and died on the 14th September, 1662 O.S., 14th Muharram, 970 A.H.

The name of this monarch, as inscribed on the walls of some of the apartments of the Alhambra, was Ab\u00fa 'Abdullah, but is commonly known in Moorish history as Muhammad Ibn-Alahmar. He was born in Granada in 1196 A.D., 591 A.H., of the noble family of the Ban\u00ed Nasar; when he arrived at manly years, he was appointed Alcaide or governor of Arjona and Ja\u00e9n, and gained great popularity by his benignity and justice. Some years afterwards, on the death of Ibn-H\u00fad, when the Moorish power of Spain was broken into factions, many places declared for Muhammad Ibn-Alahmar; he seized upon the occasion, made a circuit through the country, and was everywhere received with acclamation. It was in the year 1238 A.D., that he entered Granada amidst the enthusiastic shouts of the multitude. He was proclaimed king with every demonstration of joy, and soon became the head of the Moors in Spain, being the first of the illustrious line of Ban\u00ed Nasar that had sat upon the throne. He caused the mines of gold and silver, and other metals found in the mountainous regions of his domain, to be diligently worked, and was the first king of Granada who struck money of gold and silver with his name, taking great care that it should be skilfully executed. It was about this time, towards the middle of the 13th century, that he commenced the splendid palace of the Alhambra. He retained his faculties and vigour to an advanced age. In his 79th year, he took the field on horseback, accompanied by the flower of his chivalry, to resist an invasion of his territories, but was suddenly struck with illness, and in a few hours he died vomiting blood, and in violent convulsions.

It contains 9,400 traditions, selected from 167,000; recording, notably all the revelations, inspirations, actions, and sayings, of Muhammad, besides containing many of the difficult passages of the Kur\u00e1n. It relates both many miracles and anecdotes of the ancient prophets, and other inspired persons.

This work is one of the most important of several treatises which have been composed by that sect. The main object of the author in composing it, was, in the first instance probably to shew his own learning; in the next, to justify the claims of Sayyid Ahmad, (of whom he was a constant and confidential adherent,) as a devotee, gifted with a surpassing degree of religious capacity and illumination. It makes reference especially, in its explanations and allusions, to the peculiar divisions which prevail in India, among those who aspire to the honors of religious initiation. These are generally numbered as the followers of one or other of three principal sects, each of whom has given name to a distinct school or order thereof, the Tar\u00edka-i-K\u00e1dir\u00eda, which traces its origin to 'Abdul-K\u00e1dir Jifk\u00e1ri; another, the \"Tar\u00edka-i-Chisht\u00eda,\" so called from its founder Khw\u00e1ja Mo'in-udd\u00edn Chisht\u00ed, whose tomb is at Ajmer; the third, the \"Tar\u00edka-i-Nakhshbandia,\" derived from a Khw\u00e1ja Bah\u00e9-udd\u00edn Nakhshband, a native of Bukh\u00e1ra. It was one of the peculiar pretensions of Sayyid Ahmad, that he held himself privileged to be the founder of a school of his own, to which he gave the name of the \"Tar\u00edka-i-Muhammad\u00eda.\" His book was written some time about the year 1822 A.D., and it is to be remarked, as a new feature in the history of efforts for the propagation of Muhammadanism, or for the reform of its corruptions, how extensively the emissaries of this sect have availed themselves of the press to disseminate their tenets. The \"Sir\u00e1t ul-Mustak\u00edfim,\" the \"Takw\u00edr ul-\u00cdm\u00e1n,\" the \"Hid\u00e9t ul-\u00cdm\u00e1n,\" the \"Sir\u00e1t ul-\u00cdm\u00e1n,\" the tract attached to it, named the \"M\u00e1wil ul-K\u00e1fir\u00ed wa Bida't,\" and two other tracts, entitled the \"Nash\u00e1t ul-Ma'\u00e1l\u00ed,\" and \"Tann\u00fam ul-Gh\u00e1fiin,\" have all been printed at private presses in Calcutta or at Hughli.

When it was presented to him, he forbade its being continued; and prohibited all other historians or authors from relating the events of his life, preferring (says his panegyrist) the cultivation of inward piety to the ostentatious display of his actions. This monarch, whose reign is admired by the Muhammedans, and detested by the Hindustanis, after having imprisoned his father, mounted the throne of Delhi, 1658 A.D., 1068 A.H. At this period the glory of the empire of Bijapur may be said to have arrived at its zenith. The empire extended from the north-west mountains of Kabul to the southern limits of Chittagong; and the kings of Golconda and Bijapur paid tribute. He is also the author of a \"Shah-nama,\" a \"Roz-nama\" or Journal, and another work entitled \"Akbhar Hasania.\"\n\nMuhammad Khalilullah Khan, surnamed Ashiq, is the author of a history of Amir Hamza, uncle of Muhammad, which he professes to have drawn from a compilation made by order of Sultan Mahmud, the Ghaznavide; and observes, \"What renders this present history at all times interesting is this, that it informs us of the customs of various nations, and that it instructs us in the art of doing battle, and of taking towns and kingdoms. Accordingly Mahmud, to avoid the necessity of counsel from any one, had portions of it read to him as a daily observance.\"\n\nMuhammad Khan Bangash, Nawab, styled Ghazanfar Jang, a Rohela chief of the tribe of Bangash. He founded the city of Farrukhabad in the name of his patron the emperor Farrukhsiyar. In the reign of Muhammad Shah, 1730 A.D., 1143 A.H., he was appointed governor of Mavia, but unable to deal with the Marathas, in account of their frequent incursions, he was removed in 1732 A.D., 1145 A.H., and appointed governor of Allahabad. Muhammad Khan having planned the reduction of the Bundelas of whom Raj Chaturdai was chief, entered that country in 1738 A.D., 1146 A.H. with an army, and took several places; but as he was but little acquainted with the roads, Chaturdai, with the assistance of Peshwa Baji Rao, surrounded him suddenly with an army. The nawab, unable to combat a superior force, took refuge in the fortress of Jaigarh, where he was closely blockaded by the enemy for some time, when his son Kasim Jang having collected an army of the Afghans, marched to Jaigarh and escorted his father in safety to Allahabad. The imperial ministers, making a pretence of Muhammad Khan's ill-success, removed him from the Subadar. He died in the month of June, 1743 A.D., Jumada I, 1156 A.H., and was succeeded in his jagir by his son Kasim Jang, commonly called Kasim Khan.\n\nThe following is a list of the Nawabs of Farrukhabad:\n\nMuhammad Khan, Bangash.\nKasim Jang, son of ditto.\nAhmad Khan, brother of Kasim Jang.\nMuazzaf Jang, son of Ahmad Khan.\nTafassul Husain Khan.\n\nMuhammad Khan, Mir, commonly called Khan Kalan, was the eldest brother of Shamsuddin Muhammad Anka Khan. He served under the emperors Humayun and Akbar, and was made governor of the Panjab by the latter, which office he held for several years, and died 1675 A.D., 983 A.H. He was an excellent poet, and has left a Diwan in Persian, and another in the Turkish language. He was a native of Ghazni, and therefore chose for his poetical name \"Ghaznawi.\" There is a work on Sufism entitled \"Burhan ul-Fman,\" either written by him or some other Muhammad Khan.\n\nMuhammad Khan Shaibani, vide Shahi Beg Khan Uzbak.\n\nMuhammad Khan, Sultan, also called Muhammad Kasim and Khan Shahid, as the eldest son of Sultan Ghayasuddin Balban, king of Delhi, who had appointed him viceroy of all the frontier provinces, viz., Multan, Lahore, Dehlipur and other districts. This prince was blest with a bright and comprehensive genius, taking great delight in learning and the company of learned men. He, with his own hand, made a choice collection of the beauties of poetry, selected from the most famous in that art. The work consisted of 20,000 couplets, and was esteemed the criterion of taste. Among the learned men in the prince's court, Amir Khusro and Khwaja Hasan bore the first rank in genius and in his esteem. The throne of Persia was at this time filled by Arghun Khan, the son of Abka Khan, and grandson of Halaku Khan. Timar Khan Changezi who was then an Amir of mighty renown in the empire of the race of\nChanges Kh\u00e1n, and governed Hir\u00e1t, Kandah\u00e1r and other districts; invaded Hind\u00fast\u00e1n with 20,000 chosen horse. Having ravaged all the villages about Debalp\u00far and L\u00e1h\u00f3r, he turned towards Mult\u00e1n. The prince Muhamm\u00e1d Sult\u00e1n hearing of his designs, hastened to the banks of the river of L\u00e1h\u00f3r, where both armies drew up in order of battle, and engaged with great fury. The prince, unfortunately, received a fatal arrow in his breast, by which he fell to the ground, and in a few minutes expired. Very few of the unfortunate Muhammad's party escaped from this conflict. Among the fortunate few was Am\u00edr Khusr\u00fa, the poet, who relates this event at large, in his book called \"Khizir Kh\u00e1n\u00edf.\" This event took place on Friday, the 9th of March, 1285 A.D., 30th Zil-hijjah, 688 A.H.\n\nMuhammad Khan Talpur, vide M\u00edr Muhammad Kh\u00e1n T\u00e1lp\u00far.\n\nMuhammad Khuda Banda, Sultan, named Sult\u00e1n Sikandar Shah, was the eldest son of Shah Tahmasp I., and born in the year 1531 A.D., 938 A.H., and succeeded to the throne of Persia on the death of his brother Shah Isma'il II., in November, 1577 A.D., 985 A.H. The fortunes of this monarch, who from a natural weakness in his eyes, was incapable of rule, had been for many years upheld by the character of his eldest son, Hamsa Mirz\u00e1, and his power terminated at the death of that prince, who fell under the blow of an assassin in his own private apartments on the 24th November, 1586 A.D., 22nd Zil-hijjah, 994 A.H. The chiefs of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n immediately proclaimed 'Abb\u00e1s, the king's second son, as king of Persia, and in the year 1588 A.D., 996 A.H., marched with him to Karwin, the capital of the empire, which they took possession of without opposition, and the unfortunate Muhammad was deserted by every inhabitant of Karwin and by his own army.\n\nMuhammad Khuda Banda, Sultan, named Alj\u00e1d\u00ed, a descendant of Changes Kh\u00e1n, succeeded his brother Sultan Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, the son of Argh\u00fan Kh\u00e1n to the throne of Persia in May, 1304 A.D., Shaww\u00e1l 708 A.H. He is said to have been a just prince, and was the first monarch of Persia who proclaimed himself of the seed of 'Ali. He gave a public proof of his attachment to this seed, by causing the names of the twelve Im\u00e1ms to be engraven on all the money which he coined. He built the celebrated city of Sul-t\u00e1n\u00edya in Azurb\u00e9gj\u00e1n or Media, which he made the capital of his dominions, and where he afterwards was buried. The dome over his tomb is fifty-one feet in diameter, and is covered with glazed tiles. He died on the 17th December, 1316 A.D., 1st Shaww\u00e1l, 716 A.H., after a reign of 13 lunar years, and was succeeded by his son Sultan Ab\u00fa Sa'id Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n.\n\nMuhammad Khusro Khan, author of a Medical work called \"Makhzan ul-Adwia.\"\n\nMuhammad Kuli Khan, governor of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, was the son of Mirz\u00e1 Muhs\u00edn, the brother of Naw\u00e1b Safdar Jang of Audh.

On his arrival at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d in 1761 A.D., 1174 A.H., he was seized and imprisoned, and ultimately put to death in the fort of Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d by order of Shuj\u00e1'uddaula, he being jealous of his ambitions views in assisting the prince in the invasion of Bengal, and regarding Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d as his right, it having been given only in deputation by his father, Safdar Jang, to Muhammad Kuli Kh\u00e1n, who had refused to surrender it to the son.\n\nMuhammad Kuli Kutb Shah, vide Kuli Kutb Shah II.\n\nMuhammad Kuli Salim, vide Salim.\n\nMuhammad Kuresh, Mirza, named Qasim Mirza, the second son of Bah\u00e1dur Shah.

He was born on Friday the 7th of August, 1702 O.S., 24th Rabi' I, 1114 A.H., and crowned by the two Sayyads after the death of Rafi-uddaula, on the 29th September, 1719 A.D., 26th Zil-Kad\u00e1, 1131 A.H.

This emperor may be termed the last of the race of Amir Taimur who reigned in Dehl\u00ed and enjoyed any power. The few princes of that sovereign's family who were raised to the throne after Muhammad Sh\u00e1h were mere pageants, whom the nobles of the court elevated or cast down as it suited the purposes of their ambitions.\n\nMuhammad Shah 'Adil or 'Adli, \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f \u0634\u064e\u0627\u0647 \u0639\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650\u0644, an Afgh\u00e1n of the tribe of S\u00far, whose original name was Mub\u00e1riz Kh\u00e1n, was the son of Niz\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n S\u00far, the brother of Sher Sh\u00e1h, and brother-in-law of Salim Sh\u00e1h after whose death in 1564 A.D., 961 A.H., having murdered his son Fir\u00f3z, a boy of twelve years of age who had been raised to the throne, he assumed royal dignity with the title of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h 'Adil. He was illiterate, hated men of learning and kept company with illiterate persons like himself, whom he raised to the highest dignities in the State; among whom, one Him\u00fa, a Bani or Indian shopkeeper, whom his predecessor Salim Sh\u00e1h had made superintendent of the markets, was intrusted with the whole administration of affairs. This naturally created hatred among the Afghan chiefs, who having conspired against him, deposed him from his authority. Ibrahim Kh\u00e1n S\u00far, who had the king's sister for his wife, soon after raised a considerable army, and, getting possession of the city of Dehl\u00ed, ascended the throne in 1555 A.D., 962 A.H., and assumed the ensigns of royalty. Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, finding himself betrayed, fled to Chun\u00e1r, and contented himself with the government of the eastern provinces. He was slain in a battle fought at Munger with Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, king of Bengal, 1556 A.D., 963 A.H. The period of his reign at Dehl\u00ed was only eleven months.\n\nMuhammad Shah Bahmani I, \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f \u0634\u064e\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0651\u0644, the second king of the Bahmani dynasty, was the son of Sult\u00e1n 'Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Hasan Kangoh Bahmani, whom he succeeded to the throne of the Dakhin in February, 1358 A.D., 19th Zil-Kad\u00e1, 776 A.H. He reigned 17 lunar years and died on the 21st of March, 1376 A.D. His son Mujahid Sh\u00e1h succeeded him.\n\nMuhammad Shah Bahmani II, \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f \u0634\u064e\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0627\u064e\u0644\u062b\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0644\u0650\u062b, the thirteenth Sultan of the Bahmani dynasty, was the son of Humay\u00fan Sh\u00e1h the Cruel. He succeeded his brother Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h to the throne of the Dakhin in July, 1463 A.D. in his ninth year; and the affairs of government were conducted, as in the reign of his late brother, by Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n and Khw\u00e1ja Mahm\u00fad G\u00e1w\u00e1n, under the direction of the queen mother. The former was murdered under mysterious circumstances, and the title of Khw\u00e1ja was conferred on Mahm\u00fad G\u00e1w\u00e1n, adding the duties of Wakil-us-Saltanat to his other functions. Muhammad Sh\u00e1h reigned nearly 20 lunar years, and died a year after he had caused his minister Mahm\u00fad G\u00e1w\u00e1n to be put to death, i.e., on the 24th March, 1482 A.D., 1st Safar, 887 A.H. His son Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h II succeeded him. The year of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h's death is comprised in a Persian verse, the translation of which runs thus:\n\nSult\u00e1n Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, ruler of kings,\nWhen suddenly summoned to yield up his breath,\nAbandoned the Dakhin, and all worldly things,\nAnd \"the ruin of the Dakhin,\" recorded his death.\n\nMuhammad Shah Sharki, \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f \u0634\u064e\u0627\u0647 \u0634\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0643\u0650\u064a, succeeded to the throne of Jaunp\u00far after the death of his father Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h Sharki, in 1452 A.D., 866 A.H., and was killed after five months in a battle which he fought against his brother Husain Sh\u00e1h Sharki, who succeeded him.\n\nMuhammad Shah Sh\u00e1hid, \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f \u0634\u064e\u0627\u0647 \u0634\u064e\u0647\u0650\u064a\u062f, whose garden is still to be seen on the left bank of the Jamna at \u00c1grah where the swimmers of \u00c1grah assemble after bathing in the Jamna in the rainy season.\n\nMuhammad Shah, Sayyad, \u0633\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0651\u062f \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f \u0634\u064e\u0627\u0647, son of Sayyad Wali of Pand\u00fara, author of a collection of documents containing Forms of Letters, Parwanas, instruments or Contracts of Law, &c., &c., entitled \"J\u00e1ma' ul-D\u00e1st\u00far,\" written about the year 1800 A.D.\n\nMuhammad Shah Tughlak I, \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f \u0634\u064e\u0627\u0647 \u062a\u064f\u063a\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0643 \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0651\u0644, whose former name was Malik Fakhrudd\u00edn J\u00fan\u00e1n, succeeded his father Ghay\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn Tughlak Sh\u00e1h on the throne of Dehl\u00ed in February, 1325 A.D., 725 A.H.

As success in any project seldom fails to draw in imitators, Muhammad having raised himself to such a degree of power and reputation, by acting the prophet, induced others to imagine they might arrive at the same height by the same means. His most considerable competitors in the prophetic office was Musailima, son of Al-Ash'ath. Musailima pretended to be joined in commission with Muhammad, and published revelations in imitation of the Koran, in these words: \"From Musailima, the apostle of God, to Muhammad, the apostle of God. Now, let the earth be half mine and half thine.\" But Muhammad believing himself too well established to need a partner, wrote him this answer: \"From Muhammad the apostle of God, to Musailima the liar. The earth is God's; he giveth the same for inheritance unto such of his servants as he pleaseth; and the happy issue shall attend those who fear him.\"\n\nDuring the first month, when Muhammad lived after the setting up of this new imposture, Musailima grew very formidable. Ab\u00fb Bakr, Muhammad's successor, in the second year of his reign and the 12th of Hijri, (633 A.D., 12 A.H.) sent an army against him under the command of Kh\u00e2lid, the son of Walid, who defeated and slew him in battle. Al-Aswad set up for himself the very year that Muhammad died; but a party, sent by Muhammad, broke into his house by night, and cut off his head.

He flourished about the year 950 A.D., 339 A.H.; his father was a water-carrier in Kufa. His principal patron was Saifuddaula, prince of Damascus, of the family of Hamdan. The surname of \"Al-Mutnabbi,\" (the pretended prophet) was given him because he had set up for a prophet in the flat country near Sawama, where he was followed by a great multitude of the Banu Kalb, who acknowledged him as their chief, governor of Emessa, having marched against him took his prisoners and dispersed his partizans. He kept Mutnabbi in confinement for a long period, and having at length brought him back to the Muslim faith, he set him at liberty. He was attacked by a chief of the tribe of Asad, at the head of a troop of partizans: a combat took place in which he was killed with his son Al-Mubassad and his slave Mufik.

He was the son of that nobleman's daughter, and on his death, he collected an army and gave out that his grandsire had in his will not only appointed him to inherit the greatest part of his treasures, but had likewise nominated him to succeed to the government of the southern provinces of N\u0101sir Jang, his uncle, who had taken possession of his father's wealth, and enabled to keep his father's army in pay; and this was so numerous, that the forces which Musaffar Jang had collected were not sufficient to oppose him with any probability of success. Musaffar Jang subsequently went to \u0100rk\u0101t (Arcot) where he defeated and killed Anwar-uddin Kh\u0101n, the naw\u0101b of that place, by the assistance of the French in a battle fought on the 23rd of July, 1749 A.D., and was acknowledged the lawful S\u016bbd\u0101r of the Dakhin.

He was the son of a shepherd, born in the province of Khurasan, 1687 A.D., but by selling some of his father's sheep, he collected a number of desperate followers who shared his dangers and the booty gained in plundering caravans. By degrees he saw himself at the head of 6,000 brave adherents, and his assistance was solicited by Shah Tahmasp II, king of Persia, whose throne was usurped by Ahraraf, the chief of the Afghans. With impetuous valour, Nadir attacked and routed the enemy, and then seated his master on the throne of his ancestors at Isfahan 1730 A.D. He then pursued the flying Afghans to Kandahar, and on his return, taking advantage of the odium created by an unfavourable treaty made by Shah Tahmasp with the Turks during his absence, he deposed the king; and his son, an infant of six months, he proclaimed Shah, by the name of 'Abbas III. This event took place on the 16th August, 1732 A.D., 1145 A.H. In his name Nadir assumed to himself the sovereign power, and after having recovered all that had been taken from Persia, he concluded a peace with the Ottoman Porte in 1736 A.D. On the death of the young Shah 'Abbas the same year, he signified his intention of resigning his honours; but the nobles, excited by his private intrigues, invested him with the sovereign power. The historian of Nadir is careful in informing us, that the crown of Persia was placed upon the head of the conqueror exactly at 20 minutes past 8 in the morning of the 26th February, 1736 A.D., Shawwal, 1148 A.H. Nadir, now elevated to the height of his ambition, wisely saw that war was the only support of his greatness, and therefore with a numerous army he marched against India in 1739 A.D. The Mughal empire was rapidly conquered, 200,000 men were put to the sword, and a booty of one hundred and forty-five millions, in which was the imperial throne set with diamonds of enormous value, called the Peacock Throne, was brought away by him from Delhi. He latterly became capricious, proud and tyrannical, and was guilty of such cruelty, that the nobles conspired against him and assassinated him on the night of Sunday the 10th May, 1747 A.D., 10th Jumada I, 1160 A.H., after he had reigned 20 years over one of the most extensive and powerful empires of the world. He was buried at Mashhad nine days after his death. His nephew and murderer Ali Kul Kh\u00e1n who took the title of 'Ali Shah or 'Adil Shah, succeeded him. On his accession, he put to death thirteen of the sons and grandsons of Nadir; the only descendant of the conqueror that he spared, was his grandson, Shahruth, the son of Rasul Kul, who died at 14 years of age. 'Adil Shah was soon after deprived of sight and imprisoned.

Vide Najat (Mir).\n\nNajaf Khan, styled Amir ul-Umra Zulfiqaruddaula, was born in Persia of a family said to be related to the Safavi sovereigns of that empire, and in his infancy was, with many of his relations, a prisoner to the usurper Nadir Shah, who kept all the personages, any way allied to the throne, in confinement for his own security. At the request of Mirza Mubin Khan, the brother of Nawab Safdar Jang, who was sent on an embassy to Nadir Shah by Muhammad Shah the emperor, after his invasion of Hindustan, Najaf Khan and a sister much older than himself were released. This lady married her deliverer, and Najaf Khan accompanied her and her husband to Delhi. He was treated with parental affection by Mirza Mubin, and at his death attached himself to Muhammad Kuli Khan his son, the governor of Allahabad, who was shortly after assassinated by his own cousin Nawab Shujauddaula, the son of Safdar Jang. Najaf Khan upon this event, retired with a few followers into Bengal, and offered his services to the Nawab Mir Kasim Ali Khan, then at war with the English, who gave him great encouragement. When Kasim Ali took refuge with Shujauddaula, Najaf Khan not choosing to trust himself in the power of the latter, repaired to Bundelkhand, and served Guna Singh, one of the chiefs of that country. Upon the flight of Shujauddaula, after the battle of Buxar, he offered his services to the English, representing himself as the rightful lord of the province of Allahabad, was received with respectful welcome, and even put in possession of a part of it; but when peace was concluded with the Nawab Wazir, the English discovering the falsehood of his claim, set it aside, and rewarded his attachment with a pension of two lakhs of rupees and strong recommendations to the emperor Shah Alam. The recompense was greater than his services to the English, as he had kept up a correspondence with Shujauddaula, whom he would have joined, had he been successful in the battle of Koja. From Allahabad he accompanied the emperor Shah Alam to Delhi in 1771 A.D., and having reduced the city of Agra from the Yate, he was appointed Amir-ul-Umra with the title of Zulfiqaruddaula. The Rajas of Jaipur and several other Hindu princes were his tributaries.

He came into Rohelkhand during the administration of Ali Muhammad Khan. He was at first appointed to the charge of a very small party, not consisting of more than twelve horse and foot. But his courage and activity soon brought him to the notice of his patron, who entrusted him with a respectable military command, and procured for him in marriage the daughter of Dundee Khan the Rohela chief. He afterwards espoused the imperial cause, and was honourably received at Delhi by the wazir Ghaziuddin Khan, and being soon after promoted to the command of the army, he attacked Safdar Jang, who had avowedly announced his hostile disposition to the court, and compelled him to cross the Ganges 1753 A.D., 1167 A.H. On the successful conclusion of this campaign, in which he was wounded, he received from the emperor Ahmad Shah the title of Najibuddaula. He was created Amir-ul-Umra to the emperor Alamgir II, by Ahmad Shah Abdali on the return to Kandahar in 1757 A.D., 1170 A.H., but was soon after that conqueror's departure deprived of his office by the wazir Ghaziuddin Khan, who conferred it on Ahmad Shah Bangash the Nawab of Farrukhabad as a return for his services. Najibuddaula was present in the famous battle fought near Ahmad Shah Abdali with the Marhattas in January, 1761 A.D., and on its defeat, he was again restored to his former situation of Amir-ul-Umra, and was entrusted with the care of the city of Delhi and protection of the royal family. He governed Delhi and the few districts yet in possession of the royal family with moderation and justice till his death which took place in October, 1770 A.D., Rajab, 1184 A.H., when he was succeeded in his dominions by his son Zabita Khan who continued to protect the royal family; the emperor Shah Alam residing at Allahabad with the English.

He is the author of a number of excellent poems; one of which is called \"Husn wa-Ishk,\" but that held in the greatest estimation is a satire on the conquest of Golconda by Alamgir, 1657 A.D., in which the author lashes not only the generals, but even the emperor himself, whose conduct in destroying the Muhamadan kings of Bijapur and Golconda, while the Marathas and other Hindu chiefs had exalted the standard of defiance, was much disapproved of by many of the zealous Musalmans. The officers and soldiers were also much disgusted by incessant wars in the Dakhin, and the very great hardships they suffered during his campaigns in that country. This book goes by the name of the author, \"Na'mat Khan 'Ali,\" and has no other name. It is sometimes called \"Wakaya Na'mat Khan 'Ali.\" He also compiled a very excellent book on Oriental Cookery.

This miscreant was an adopted son of B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o II., the ex-Peshw\u00e1 of P\u00edn\u00e1 who died in December, 1852 A.D. According to Mr. Shephard's narrative of the Kahnpur Mutiny, B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o died on the 28th January, 1851 A.D. Of all the butcheries in the disturbances of 1857, that enacted by this vile wretch, stands pre-eminent. Out of seven hundred and fifty living souls (all Christians) was the strength and vigour of life, four escaped to tell the horrible tale. Lieutenant Wellesse and Thomson of the 53rd N.I., Ensign Brown, 66th N.I., and two other soldiers, were the only survivors of the massacre. Three men and four women are reported to have also escaped and reached Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. They escaped the massacre in the river and were hid in Kahnpur, until the arrival of General Havelock's forces. The pension of the ex-Peshw\u00e1 amounting to 8 laks of rupees per annum, was not continued to the N\u00e1nh\u00e1, and this appears to have been his principal, if not sole grievance, though he invariably maintained friendly relations with the European residents, and indeed on many occasions treated them with apparently cordial hospitality. His residence was at Bith\u00far, situated ten miles from Kahnpur, where he owned an estate left him by his patron the ex-Peshw\u00e1, and he was allowed a retinue of 500 infantry and cavalry, with three guns of small calibre, and these troops were of course entirely independent of European authority. A proclamation was issued by the Governor-General in March, 1858 A.D., wherein a reward was offered of one lakh of rupees to any person, who should deliver N\u00e1nh\u00e1 Dhondh\u00fap\u00e1nt of Bith\u00far to the district officer commanding in any military camp or at any military post; and, in addition to the pecuniary reward, a free pardon was guaranteed to any mutineer, deserter or rebel (excepting the Naw\u00e1bs of Farrukh\u00e1t\u00e1b\u00e1d, Bareli, Banda and R\u00e1j\u00e9 of Mainp\u00far) who should so deliver up the N\u00e1nh\u00e1 S\u00e1hib.\n\nNanak, \u0646\u0627\u0646\u06a9 \u0634\u0627\u06c1, or N\u00e1nh\u00e1k Sh\u00e1h, the founder of the sect called Sikhs, was born in the year 1469 A.D. He was the son of a Hind\u00fa grain-merchant, and disciple of Sayyad Husain, or as some say of Kabir, and consequently a sort of Hind\u00fa deist, but his peculiar tenet was universal toleration. He maintained that devotion was due to God, that forms were immaterial, and that Hind\u00fa and Muhammedan worship were the same in the sight of the Deity. During his travels, N\u00e1nh\u00e1k was introduced to the emperor Babar, before whom he used to have defended his doctrine with great firmness and eloquence. N\u00e1nh\u00e1k died in the month of August, 1539 A.D., aged 70 years. After his death had silently increased for more than a century, it excited the jealousy of the Musalm\u00e1n government, and its spiritual chief, the Gur\u00fa Arjun, was put to death in 1606 A.D., within a year after the decease of the emperor Akbar. This tyranny changed the Sikhs from inoffensive quietists into fanatical warriors. They took up arms under Harg\u00f3b\u00ednd, the son of their martyred pontiff, who inspired them with his own spirit of revenge and of hatred to their oppressors.\n\nThe following are the names of the Sikh Gur\u00fas from N\u00e1nh\u00e1k.\n\nGur\u00fa N\u00e1nh\u00e1k Sh\u00e1h, the founder of the sect, died 1539 A.D.\n\nAngad, who wrote some of the sacred books, 1552\n\nAmar\u00edd\u00e1s, 1574\n\nR\u00e1m\u00edd\u00e1s who beautified Amritsar, 1581\n\nArjumal, he compiled the Adi Granth, 1606\n\nHarg\u00f3b\u00ednd, who was the first warlike leader, 1644\n\nHar R\u00e1\u00e9, grandson of Harg\u00f3b\u00ednd, 1661\n\nHar Krishan, son of Har R\u00e1\u00e9, 1664\n\nTeigh Bah\u00e1d\u00far, uncle of Har Krishan, 1675 put to death.\n\nGobind, son of Teigh Bah\u00e1d\u00far, He remodelled the Sikh government.

He was convicted of a forgery, condemned to suffer death, and was hanged at the appointed place of execution in Calcutta on the 5th August, 1775 A.D., 7th Jum\u00e1da II., 1189 A.H. His treasure and effects were given up to his son R\u00e1j\u00e1 G\u00fard\u00e1s. It is said there were fifty-two laks of rupees in money, and about the same amount in jewels and rich goods. In his house were found the seals of several eminent persons which he had forged. The British at Calcutta were struck with such horror when that execution took place, that they rushed into the sacred waters of the river to purge themselves of the pollution of such a sight, and looking upon Calcutta as a second A\u00ebolams or field of blood, they crossed the river and settled at Bali, six miles from the scene of execution.

Nasir-uddin Haidar was succeeded by his uncle Nasir-udda, who took the title of Ab\u00fa Muazzaf M\u00f3i-udd\u00edn Muhammad 'Ali Sh\u00e1h, and Mun\u00e1n J\u00e1n the illegitimate son of Nasir-uddin Haidar was sent to the fort of Chun\u00e1r where he died on the 15th January 1846 A.D., 16th Muharram 1262 A.H.\n\nNasir-uddin Mahmud, also called Firishta Nasir-uddin Mahm\u00fad Awadh\u00ed, surnamed Chir\u00e1gh Dehl\u00ed or the Candle of Dehl\u00ed, a celebrated Muhammedan saint, who was a disciple of Shaikh Niz\u00e1mudd\u00edn Auli\u00e1, whom he succeeded on the masnad of Ir\u00e1sh\u00e1d or Spiritual Guide, and died on Friday the 16th of September, 1356 A.D., 18th Ram\u00e1zan, 757 A.H.

He was the son of Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, Muhammad R\u00e1zi, was born at T\u00fas in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n on Saturday, the 3rd of March 1201 A.D., 11th Jam\u00e1d\u00e1 I, 597 A.H., and though a somewhat over-zealous Sh\u00ed\u00e1, was one of the best, and certainly the most universal scholar that Persia ever produced. He wrote on all subjects, and some of his works are to this day standard books in Persian Universities. He was a fair Greek scholar, and made a new translation of Euclid into Arabic, wherein he proves most of the propositions, sometimes in two, three, and four ways, wholly different from the demonstrations of the Greek author. He likewise translated the Almaj\u00edsti, and wrote a volume of learned explanatory notes upon it. He also wrote several works on geometry, astronomy, philosophy, theology, and dissertations on miscellaneous subjects. During the Mughal persecutions he wandered among the mountains of K\u00far\u00e1s\u00e1n, and was taken captive by Azad\u00ed\u00ed Muhammad, a descendant of Has\u00e1n Sabbah who forced him to remain with him for several years and employed him as his w\u00e1z\u00edr. It was during his captivity,\nthat he wrote the most celebrated of all his treatises, a well-known and excellent little work on moral philosophy, which he styled \"Akhlaq Nasiri,\" or the morals of Nasir in complement to Nasir-uddin 'Abdul Rahim, governor of the fortress of Dez; but this flattery did not procure him his liberty, he remained in that mountainous region till he was released by Halak Kh\u00e1n in November 1256 A.D., 654 A.H. It was Nasir-uddin that persuaded Halak Kh\u00e1n to march against Baghdad, which was taken in 1258 A.D.\n\nThe \"Akhlaq Nasiri\" is a translation in Persian of the \"Kitab ut-Taharat fil Hikmat Amali,\" an Arabic work by Abu Ali Muhammad of Mecca. There are two other works on Sufism which he wrote, one called \"Asaf ul-Arab,\" and another called \"Hikmat al-Ma'ani,\" the \"Sea of Truth.\" He is also the author of a work entitled \"Khilafat-nama Ishi,\" and of another work on Prosody called \"Mazrash-shohra.\"\n\nNasir-uddin died in the reign of Akbar, the son of Halak Kh\u00e1n, on the 24th June, 1274 A.D., 18th Zil-hijja 672 A.H., and was buried at Baghdad near the tomb of Imam Musi Kazim.

He reigned two years and a half, and was slain on the 5th December, 1750 A.D., 17th Muharram, 1164 A.H. by a conspiracy of his own servants, assisted by the French who surprised his camp while he was engaged in quelling a rebellion raised by his nephew, Muazzaf Jang, who had been imprisoned by him. On his death Muazzaf Jang was placed on the masnad of the Dakhin by the conspirators; but this young prince did not long enjoy his dignity, for he was assassinated almost immediately after his accession by the same persons who had raised him to power.

He is the author of several works, among which are the two following, viz., \"Rostai-nama\" in verse, and \"Kanzul-Haek\" in prose. He has also left us a Diwan consisting of 30,000 verses. He was a contemporary of Khwaja 'Abd'l Hasan Jurjani and the celebrated physician Avicenna. Some say that he was a Deist, and others considered him to be an Atheist, on which account he was persecuted by the Muhammadans, and fled from one city to another, till at last he was obliged to conceal himself among the hills of Badakhshan. Daulat Shah has given a very interesting account of Nasir Khusro in his History. In 1876 there was discovered, among the Elliot papers, an Arab work by Nasir Khusro on the buildings and water-works of Jerusalem. He is most precise in his information. It is said, that if this work had been found a little earlier, it might have saved the Palestine Exploration Committee some diggings and considerable outlay. There is also a work of the same kind in Persian called \"the Travels of Nasir Khusro,\" which he wrote in 1052 A.D., corresponding with 444 A.H.\n\nNasir Shah Purbi, \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u067e\u0648\u0631\u0628\u06cc, a lineal descendant of Shams-uddin Bhangira, was placed on the throne of Bengal in 1427 A.D., 831 A.H., after the murder of Nasir-uddin Ghulam, who had usurped the throne for several days after the death of his master Ahmad Shah. General Briggs, in his translation, says that he reigned only two years, whereas it appears from Major Stewart's Bengal History, which seems to be correct, that he reigned 32 years, consequently his death must have happened in the year 1458 A.D., 863 A.H. He was succeeded by his son Barbak. He is also called Nasir Husain Shah as appears from an Arabic Inscription on a mosque lately discovered in the district of Hughli.\nNasir, Shaikh, of Akbarabad, a Musulman saint who is said to have performed a number of miracles, and was highly respected by the emperor Shah Jahan. He died on the 7th June, 1647 A.D., 13th Jumada I, 1057 A.H., and was buried at Agra.\n\nNasiruddin Kabbacha or Fattah, ruler of Sindh. It is related in several Histories such as the \"Khulasa ul-Hikmat\" the \"Hajj-nama,\" and the History of Hajji Muhammad Kandahari, that the first establishment of the Muhammedan faith in the country of Sindh took place in the time of Hajji bin-Yusuf, governor of Basra, at the time when Walid the son of the Khalif 'Abdulmalik was ruler of the provinces of both Irak. Hajji deputed Mahmud Hussain in the year 706 A.D., 97 A.H., with a select army into Mikrav, and he subdued that country; and made converts of many of the inhabitants called Balochis. He afterwards deputed Budmin to conquer Dibal (modern Thatta on the Indus). Budmin failed in his expedition, and lost his life in the first action. Hajji, not deterred by this defeat, resolved to follow up the enterprise by another. In consequence, in the year 712 A.D., 98 A.H., he deputed his cousin Imad-uddin Muhammad bin-Kasim the son of Akil or Urali Thakuri or Sakari with six thousand soldiers to attack Dibal, and he in a short time conquered the place, and Raji Dahin, the ruler of Dibal was killed in battle. After the death of Muhammad bin-Kasim, a tribe who trace their origin from the Ansaris, established a government in Sindh; after which the zamindars, of the tribe of Suman, usurped the power, and held independent rule over the kingdom of Sindh for the space of 500 years. In the course of years, the dynasty of Suman was subverted, and the country subdued by another dynasty called Suman, whose chief assumed the title of Jam. During the reigns of these dynasties in Sindh, the Muhammedan kings of India Proper, such as those of Ghazni, Ghor and Delhi, invaded Sindh, and seizing many towns, appointed Muhammedan governors over them. Among these rulers, Nasiruddin Kabbacha asserted his independence, and caused the public prayers to be read in his name as king of Sindh. Nasiruddin was also the first governor of Sindh under Muhammad Ghori, who made him governor of Uchcha in Multan about the year 1203 A.D., 600 A.H. He espoused the daughter of Sultan Khwaja Saifuddin, viceroy, and afterwards king of Delhi, after whose death in 1210 A.D., 607 A.H., having seized many of the towns subjected to the Sindh government, he reduced the territory of Sumanas to the small tract of country around Thatta, and relinquishing the allegiance to the throne of Delhi, became independent. Besides Sindh, his kingdom embraced the provinces of Multan, Kohram and Sureti. He was twice attacked by Tajuddin Eldus of Ghazni, but he successfully repelled both these invasions. In 1226 A.D. Shamsuddin Altumah, king of Delhi, made several attempts to remove him from his government, and even marched for that purpose as far as Uchcha, when Nasiruddin having no hopes of eventually repelling the armies of the Delhi sultan, placed his family and personal attendants with his treasure in boats, and landed on a contiguous island; when a storm coming on, the boat foundered, and every one perished. This monarch reigned in Sindh and Multan for a period of 22 years. In the latter end of the reign of Muhammad Tughlaq of Delhi, Sindh owned allegiance to that monarch; nevertheless, occasionally taking advantage of local circumstances, the Sindhis contrived, for a considerable period, to shake off their allegiance. The first of the family of which we have any account was Jam Afrid.\n\nThe following is a list of the Jam dynasty of Suman, originally Edjafat:\n\n| A.D. | Name |\n|------|------|\n| 737 to 740 A.H. | Jam Afrid, reigned 3 years and 6 months from 1336 |\n| 754 | Choban, his brother, reigned 14 years and 1 month |\n| 769 | Bani, son of Jam Afrid, reigned 16 years and 1 month |\n| 782 | Timmaji, son of Jam Afrid, reigned 13 years |\n| 793 | Salihuddin, converted |\n| 796 | Nizamuddin, his son |\n| 812 | Alshar, his son |\n| 827 | Giran, son of Timmaji, died on the 2nd day after his accession |\n| 854 | Fatha Khan, son of Iskandar Khan |\n| 856 | Tughlaq, his brother-in-law, reigned 27 years, and was succeeded by his kinsman Jam Mubarak, who was deposed after a reign of 3 days |\n| 894 | Sikandar, son of Fatha Khan, reigned 18 months and 1 day |\n| 927 | Sandar, a descendant of the former kings of Sindh, was elected in 1459, reigned 8 years and 1 day |\n| 930 | Firuz, his son, reigned about 33 years, when Shah Beg Arghun, governor of Kandahar in 1520 A.D., marched to conquer Sindh, and occupied the whole country, even to the possession of Thatta |\n| 966 | Shah Beg Arghun, reigned 3 years |\n| 982 | Shah Hussain Arghun, Mahmud of Bakkar, reigned till 1572 A.D., when the emperor Akbar annexed Sindh to the empire |\n\nNasiruddin Kazi Baizawi, the son of Imam Bedruddin Umar bin-Fakhruddin Ali Baizawi.

When the emperor B\u00e1bar slew Ibrahim the son of Sikandar Lod\u00ed, and ascended the throne of Delh\u00ed in 1526 A,D., 932 A.H., many of the adherents of the Lodi dynasty sought protection at the court of Beng\u00e1l, and among others the prince Mahm\u00fad, who created a fortification site Lodi also took refuge there, and his sister became the wife of the monarch Nasrat Sh\u00e1h died in 1538 A.D., 946 A.H., and Mahm\u00fad who was then one of his ministers succeeded in usurping his throne.

After an administration of 30 years, the fame of the sultan, his wealth and even his services were transformed into crimes. This venerable statesman, at the age of 39 years, was dismissed by his master, accused by his enemies, and was stabbed by an assassin, who was a follower of Hasan Sabbah, the Old Man of the mountain, on Friday night the 16th of October, 1092 A.D., Ramazan, 485 A.H. at a place called Nahawand. His body was carried to Isfahan where he was interred with great pomp. It is said that the assassin was suborned against him by Malikshah, who was fatigued to see him live so long. The Sultan survived him 35 days only. Nizam-ul-Mulk appears to be the author of the work, entitled \"Siar-ul-Mulk.\"\n\nNizam-ul-Mulk, \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0641\u06a9, Asaf Jah, whose original name was Chin Kulich Khan, was the son of Ghazi-uddin Khan Firoz Jang a favourite officer of the emperor 'Alamgir, under which monarch he also distinguished himself. In the reign of the emperor Farrukh-siyar, he held the government of Moradabad and was afterwards appointed governor of Malwa, which province he restored to a flourishing condition, but the reputation he acquired rendered him an object of jealousy to the two brothers, Sayyad 'Abdullah Khan and Husain 'Ali Khan, who wished to remove him to another quarter less favourable to his interest than the frontier of the Dakhin; but Nizam-ul-Mulk not willing to quit his post, excused himself, and resolved to seek an independent power in the Dakhin. The disturbed state of that country gave him a pretence for raising troops, and turned his attention to the conquest of the Dakhin. By degrees he became lord of the fort of Aurangabad about the year 1717 A.D., and prevented the junction of several officers of the province. He was pursued from Hindustan by the force under Dilawar Khan and another under 'Alam 'Ali Khan, both of whom he defeated and slew in battle in April, 1720 A.D., and at last remained without a rival in the Dakhin. In the reign of Muhammad Shah, after the death of the two Sayyads, he was invited to court by that emperor; and on his arrival at Delhi, the high office of wizarat was conferred on him, but Nizam-ul-Mulk being soon disgusted with\nthe state of things at court, sent in his resignation, and marched off for the Dakhin, and though he continued to send honorary presents, on fixed occasions to the emperor, he thenceforth conducted himself, in other respects, as an independent prince, and governed the provinces of the Dakhin for 30 years with great ability and success. He was present in the battle which took place between Muhammad Shah and Nadir Shah, and is the progenitor of the present Nizams of Haiderabad. He died on the 22nd May, 1748 A.D., 4th Jumada II, 1161 A.H., thirty-seven days after the death of the emperor Muhammad Shah, aged 104 lunar years, and was buried at Burhanpur near the tomb of Shah Burhanuddin Gharib. He left behind him six sons, viz., Ghazi-ud-din, Nasir Jang, Salabat Jang, Nizam Ali, Basa\u00efat Jang and Mughal Ali, and was succeeded in the government of the Dakhin, by the second, Mir Ahmad surnamed Nasir Jang, who was proclaimed at Burhanpur when his father died; the eldest Ghazi-ud-din Khan then residing at Delhi, was the one of Amir-ul-Umara. Nasir Jang was assassinated in December, 1759 A.D., and Musafar Jang a grandson of Nizam-ul-Mulk was placed on the throne, and soon after assassinated in February, 1761 A.D.; Salabat Jang, by the influence of the French, was then proclaimed and reigned until 1761 A.D., when he was imprisoned, and in 1763 A.D. put to death by his brother Nizam Ali, who ascended the throne and reigned until the 6th August, 1803 A.D. when he died, and was succeeded by his eldest son Mirza Sikandar Jah. Sikandar Jah died on the 23rd May, 1829 A.D., and was succeeded by his son Mir Farukhanda Ali Khan the present Nizam (1858). Nizam-ul-Mulk appears to be the author of a Diwan which was found in the Library of Tipu Sultan called \"Diwan 'Asaf Nizam-ul-Mulk.\"\n\nNizam-ul-Mulk Bahr\u00ee, \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u06a9 \u0628\u062d\u0631\u06cc, the father of Ahmad Nizam Shah Bahr\u00ee who was the first king of the Nizam Shahi dynasty. Nizam-ul-Mulk was originally a Brahmin of Bijapur, but being taken prisoner in his infancy by the army of Sultan Ahmad Shah Bahmani, was made a Mussulman, and was educated as one of the royal slaves. He finished his education under the same tutor with the king's eldest son Sultan Muhammad, and became eminently learned in Persian and Arabic literature. On the accession of Sultan Muhammad to the throne of the Dakhin in 1463 A.D., he was raised to the rank of a thousand and the charge of the royal falconry was entrusted to him, on which account he was called Bahr\u00ee, i.e., a falconer. By degrees he rose to the highest honours and was appointed governor of Tilangana. On the death of Muhammad Shah in 1482 A.D., he by his will became first minister to his son Sultan Mahmud II, who added Bir and other districts to his jagir. This he committed to his son Malik Ahmad, who took up his residence at Khairas and employed himself diligently in the affairs of his government, and after his father's death set up a separate dynasty in the Dakhin called Nizam Shahi, the capital of which was Ahmadnagar. Nizam-ul-Mulk who had the sole power of the administration in his hands, latterly paid little or no regard for the king's authority, was murdered by the orders of the Sultan about the year 1486 A.D., 891 A.H., or some time afterwards.\n\nNizam-ul-Mulk Mahm\u00fbd, \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u06a9 \u0645\u0639\u0645\u0648\u062f, the son of Abi Sa'id Junaidi, a general and wazir of Shamsuddin Altamsh, king of Dehli.

She had attracted the notice of the prince Sultan Salim (afterwards Jahangir); but was, at the suggestion of his father the emperor Akbar, in order to withdraw the lady from the attentions of the prince, married to Sher Afghan Khan, a young Persian lately come into the service, and to whom Akbar gave a jagir in Bengal. After the death of his father, Jahangir appointed Kutb-uddin Khan his foster-brother the son of Shaikh Salim Chisti, as governor of Bengal, with the intention that he might procure for her the object of his passion. Kutb-uddin Khan on his arrival at Burdwan was slain by Sher Afghan Khan, who was himself doomed by Kutb-uddin's attendants. Nur Jahan was seized and sent as a prisoner to Delhi, and was at first placed by the emperor among the attendants of his mother, but he subsequently married her in the sixth year of his reign 1610 A.D., 1019 A.H., changed her name, which was Mehr-un-Nisa', into Nur Jahan (the light of the world), and raised her to honours such as had never before been enjoyed by the consort of any king in India. From this period her ascendancy knew no bounds; the emperor took no step without consulting her; and on every affair in which she took an interest, her will was law. A circumstance so uncommon in an Asiatic government is thus recorded on the coins of that period. \"By order of the emperor Jahangir, gold acquired a hundred times additional value by the name of the empress Nur Jahan.\" Her father Mirza Ghayyur or Ayaz was made prime minister with the title of Ya'tmad-uddaula; and her two brothers were raised to the first rank of 'Umar, by the titles of Ya'tkad Khan,\nand 'Asaf Kh\u00e1n. One of the accomplishments by which she captivated Jah\u00e1ngir, is said to have been her facility in composing extemporary verses. After the death of her husband, she was treated with much respect and allowed a stipend of \u00a3250,000 a year. She survived Jah\u00e1ngir eighteen years, and died aged 72 in 1645 A.D., 1055 A.H., at L\u00e1h\u00f3r, where she was buried in the mausoleum of her husband close to his tomb; some say, near the tomb of her brother 'Asaf Kh\u00e1n on the banks of the R\u00e1wi, at L\u00e1h\u00f3r. Hugh Murray in his History of British India, p. 230, by his erroneously asserting, that she was buried in the mausoleum at Agrah called the T\u00e1j Mah\u00e1l, has misinformed many. Even in the year 1858 A.D., the author of the \"History of the Indian Revenue,\" page 109, says \"that this was the mausoleum of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n and his favourite wife N\u00far Jah\u00e1n.\"\n\nNur Muhammad, \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f \u0646\u064f\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0650\u0651\u064a\u0646\u060c a Sayyad of Badshah, was a learned and pious Musulm\u00e1n of the sect of Nakshband.

He succeeded his father, Azz-udd\u00edn Mass\u00fad, 1193 A.D., 589 A.H., (the year of the death of Salah-udd\u00edn). During a reign of 18 years, he established in some measure the declining power of his house, and compelled the minor princes of his family, to acknowledge his supremacy as lord paramount. He died 1210 A.D., 607 A.H., regretted by his subjects as a mild and beneficent ruler. His son Azz-udd\u00edn, after a reign of between seven and eight years, was succeeded by an infant son bearing the title of N\u00far-udd\u00edn Arsal\u00e1n II who survived him only a few months.\n\nNur-udd\u00edn 'Ali, Malik Mansur, \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u0646\u064f\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0650\u0651\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a, the second Sult\u00e1n of the dynasty of Tartar or Baharit\u00e9 Maml\u00faks in Egypt, was placed on the throne by the Amir after the assassination of his father Malik Mo'izz 'Azz-udd\u00edn Eib\u00e1k, 1257 A.D., 655 A.H., at the age of fifteen. His short reign of two years was troubled by continual feuds among the Maml\u00fak chieftains, and attempts on the part of the Ayy\u00fab\u00edte princes of Syria to recover the lost sway of their family in Egypt; and the apprehension of an irruption of the Mughals under Hal\u00e1k\u00fa, who had taken Baghd\u00e1d and destroyed the Khil\u00e1f\u00e1t, showed the necessity of substituting a ruler of matured years and experience.

At the death of his father, who was murdered by his own Maml\u00faks at the siege of Jabb\u00e1r, 1146 A.D., 541 A.H., Nur-udd\u00edn hastening to Aleppo with the signet of the deceased prince, secured the possession of that city and of his father's Syrian dominions; while Mesopotamia, with Mouz\u00e1l for a capital, fell to the lot of the elder brother Saif-udd\u00edn; and the feeble attempts of Alp Arsal\u00e1n, a prince of the house of Salj\u00fak, to assert his ancestral claims to the dominion of these provinces, were easily frustrated by the combined power of the two brothers. The earliest exploits of the reign of N\u00far-udd\u00edn were in continuance of the Holy War which his father had assiduously waged against the Latin Christians of Palestine. Josceline de Courtenay, whose capital of Edessa had been taken by Zang\u00ed a few years previous, was signally repulsed in an attempt to recover it, and the Christian inhabitants, who had aided the enterprise, were put to the sword without mercy by command of N\u00far-udd\u00edn, who even levelled the fortifications of the town to prevent its ever again becoming a bulwark to the kingdom of Jerusalem. The recovery of this important fortress was the avowed object of the second Crusade, undertaken 1148 A.D., 543 A.H., under Louis VII of France and the emperor Conrad: but of the mighty hosts which they led from Europe, only a miserable and dispirited remnant escaped the arrows of the Sulj\u00fak Turks in their march through Anatolia to Palestine, the project of retaking Edessa was abandoned as hopeless, the siege of Damascus, which was attacked by the crusading monarchs in conjunction with Baldwin III of Jerusalem, was yielded up to the forces successively by the adherents with which the minister of the Muslim prince Mujir-udd\u00edn fomented the mutual jealousies of the Christian leaders; and this vast armament, which if properly directed might have overwhelmed the rising power of N\u00far-udd\u00edn, only served by its failure to extend and confirm it. Resuming the offensive immediately after the departure of the crusaders, he invaded the territory of Antioch, and in a pitched battle (27th June, 1149 A.D.) routed and slew the prince Raymond, whose head was sent as a trophy to the Khal\u00edf at Baghd\u00e1d; and though he sustained a severe defeat in the following year from his ancient opponent Josceline de Courtenay, who surprised his camp, this disgrace was amply compensated by the captivity of that active leader, who was soon after seized while hunting by a marauding party of Turkomans, and died in captivity. While the remaining dependencies of Edessa, the fortresses of Aintab, Tollbacher, Ravend\u00e1n, &c., fell almost without resistance into the power of N\u00far-udd\u00edn, whose dominions now included the whole of Northern Syria. Mujir-udd\u00edn was still the nominal ruler of Damascus and the southern portion, but the government was entirely in the hands of his waz\u00edr Mo'in-udd\u00edn An\u00e1r, whose daughter N\u00far-udd\u00edn had married; and after the death of this able minister, the inhabitants, alarmed at the capture of Ascalon by Baldwin III in 1153 A.D., and dreading an attack from the Christians, voluntarily offered their allegiance to N\u00far-udd\u00edn (1154) as the price of his protection. The weak Mujir-udd\u00edn resigned his power, and sought an asylum at the court of the Khal\u00edf of Baghd\u00e1d, which then seems to have been the usual refuge of deposed princes; while N\u00far-udd\u00edn, the circuit of whose realms now encompassed on all sides by land the Latin territories in Palestine, and extended to the frontiers of the Fatimite possessions\nin Egypt, fixed his capital at Damascus, which he raised from the ruinous state in which it had been left by an earthquake, and adorned with mosques, fountains, colleges, and hospitals. The death of Baldwin III in 1162 A.D., released Nur-uddin from the ablest of his antagonists, his brother and successor, Almaric, or Amoury, being far inferior to Baldwin, both in prowess and abilities. Mesopotamia, ruled by the Sultan's nephews, acknowledged his supremacy as head of the family; he was now, by his officers, absolute master of Egypt; his name was recited with that of the Khalif Mustazi of Baghdad in all the mosques throughout the Dominions, and even in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, which the Sultan's mother of Salahuddin, had made dependencies of Egypt. But the power and glory of Nur-uddin had now attained their highest pitch, the three remaining years of his life were unmarked by any memorable achievement, and disquieted by the forebodings of the future downfall of his house by the ambition of Salah-uddin, who, though still ostensibly acting as his lieutenant, and making public professions of loyalty and obedience, had in fact become independent master of Egypt, and eluded or disregarded all the orders of his nominal sovereign. Nur-uddin was preparing to march into Egypt to reduce or expel his refractory vassal, when an attack of quinsy terminated his life at Damascus after a prosperous reign of 27 years on the 26th of May, 1175 A.D., 21st Shawwal, 669 A.H. His son Malik-us-Salih Ismail, a youth, 11 years old, succeeded to the titular sovereignty of his extensive dominions, but was speedily stripped by Salah-uddin, of Damascus and the greater part of Syria, and died 8 years afterwards, reduced to the sovereignty of Aleppo and its dependencies.\n\nNur-uddin Muhammad, Mirza, son of 'Ala-uddin Muhammad, the son of Khwaja Husain.

He cut a canal from the river Jamna to Karnal in the year 1569 A.D., 977 A.H., and named it \"Sheikhul Nahr,\" in honour of the prince Sultan Salim, who was born in that year and was nicknamed by his father the emperor Akbar, Sheikhul Baba.

The accounts given by Eastern and Western authors, of the success attending his invasions of the Roman empire, differ very little. Some of the former have falsely asserted that he took an emperor of the Romans prisoner; and they have all, with a partiality that, in national historians writing of this monarch, seems almost excusable, passed over the few reverses which his arms sustained. But the disgraceful peace which the emperor Justinian purchased at the commencement of the reign of Nousherwan, the subsequent war, the reduction of all Syria, the capture of Antioch, the unopposed progress of the Persian monarch to the shores of the Mediterranean, his conquest of Iberia, Calchoa, and the temporary establishment of his power on the banks of the Phasis, and on the shores of the Euxine, are facts not questioned by his enemies. They, however, assert, that his genius, as a military leader, even when his fortune was at the highest, was checked by Darius, who was too great to oppose his progress; and whose success, considering his want of means, and the character of the court he served, was certainly wonderful. In all the negotiations which took place...\nNousherwan\n\nplace between the emperor Justinian and Nousherw\u00e1n, the latter assumed the tone of a superior. His lowest servants were treated, at the imperial court, in a manner calculated to inflame the pride, and raise the insolence of a vain and arrogant nation; and the impressions which this conduct must have made, were confirmed by the agreement of the Roman emperors to pay 30,000 pieces of gold; a sum which could have been of no importance to Nousherw\u00e1n, but as it showed the monarch of the Western world in the rank of one of his tributaries. In a second war with the Roman emperors Justin and Tiberius, Nousherw\u00e1n, who though 80 years of age, still led his armies, experienced some reverses of fortune: but the perseverance and valour of the aged sovereign were ultimately rewarded by the conquest of Dara and the plunder of Syria 674 A.D. He died after a prosperous reign of 48 years about the year 679 A.D., and was succeeded by his son Hurmas IV.\n\nMuhammad, who was born during the reign of Nousherw\u00e1n, 671 A.D., used to boast of his fortune, in being born when so just a king reigned. This is great praise, and from a source that cannot be suspected of flattery.\n\nNousherwan Kirmani, \u0646\u0648\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc, an author who translated the \"Ardai Vinsf-nama\" originally written in the Zend, into the modern Persian.

He was murdered by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaupur while engaged in the congenial occupation of lifting some of the R\u00e1j\u00e1's property. He was succeeded by his son Damaji who was an unfortunate imitator of his illustrious sire. He had the audacity to declare open war against the Peshwa while the Peshwa was unembarrassed with any other quarrels, and as the result of this unequal contest, he lost half of his possessions, and was forced to hold the other half himself as a fief from the Peshwa. Syaj\u00ed, the son of Dauroji, was a fool, and Anand R\u00e1o was a fool, that is, not fools in the conventional and uncomplimentary sense of the word, but literally fools\u2014persons of weak intellect. But they were the heirs to the throne, and it was sought to make them the victims of an usurpation. The British Government was horrified at this iniquity and they stepped in to prevent it. Afterwards when the British were engaged in their fresh struggle with the Peshwa, Baroda sided with us. The Marhatta confederacy was broken up, and in the final settlement, the Gaikw\u00e1 received a large accession of territory.

The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sit\u00e1ra, R\u00e1mr\u00e1j\u00e1, a weak prince, being upon the throne, it was concerted between the two principal officers of the state, Baji R\u00e1o the Peshw\u00e1, and R\u00e1ghoji Bhosla, the Bakhshi or Commander-in-Chief, to divide the dominions of their master. In consequence of this arrangement, the former assumed the government of the western provinces, continuing at its ancient capital of P\u00fana, and the latter took the eastern, and fixed his residence at N\u00e1gpur, the principal city in the province of Ber\u00e1r; whilst R\u00e1mr\u00e1j\u00e1 was confined to the fortress of Sit\u00e1ra, the Peshw\u00e1 administering the government in his name. Hence the distinction between the Marhattas of P\u00fana and Ber\u00e1r. R\u00e1ghoji was the son of Vimb\u00f3ji who was killed in Audi during the lifetime of his father Parsoj\u00ed, who was Bakhshi under his brother S\u00e1hoj\u00ed the son of Sambhoj\u00ed the son of Sew\u00e1j\u00ed the founder of the Marhatta empire. R\u00e1ghoji Bhosla died in 1749 or\nRaghoji\n\n1753 A.D., and transmitted his government to his son J\u00e1noji, who dying in 1772 A.D., left his inheritance to his nephew and adopted son R\u00e1gh\u00f3ji Bhosla II the son of his younger brother Madh\u00faji. This occasioned a contention between J\u00e1noji's brother Samoji and Madh\u00faji. The former claimed the government in the right of priority of birth, and the latter as father and guardian of the adopted child. They were accordingly engaged in hostility until the death of Samoji or Sabhoji, who was killed in an engagement with his brother on the 27th of January, 1776 A.D. From that period the government of Ber\u00e1r was held by Madh\u00faji or Madh\u00faji Bhosla.\n\nBhosla R\u00e1j\u00e1s of N\u00e1gpur or Ber\u00e1r.\n\n| Raghoji Bhosla I | died 1758 |\n|------------------|-----------|\n| J\u00e1noji or R\u00e1coji | 1772      |\n| Madh\u00faji          | 1788      |\n| Raghoji Bhosla II | 1816     |\n| Parsoji (strangled by Ap\u00e1 Sahib) | 1816 |\n| M\u00fad\u00f3ji (Ap\u00e1 Sahib) was acknowledged by the English in 1816 and... | deposed 1818 |\n| Part\u00e1p Singh N\u00e1riy\u00e1n grandson of Raghoji Bhosla put on the throne | 1818 |\n| Raghoji Bhosla III | 1853 |\n\nRaghoji Bhosla II, succeeded his father Madh\u00faji Bhosla in the government of Ber\u00e1r or N\u00e1gpur in May, 1788 A.D. and died on the 22nd of March, 1816 A.D., when his son Parsoji succeeded him.\n\nRaghunath Shah, of the Mandla district, who was a direct descendant of the eldest branch of the Gond dynasty, was executed in 1857 A.D. for rebellion, and his estates confiscated.

Madh\u00f3 R\u00e1o was enabled to take the reins of government into his own hands after some time, but died in 1772 A.D., and was succeeded by his brother N\u00e1riy\u00e1n R\u00e1o. He was soon after murdered in consequence of a plot which Ragho\u00f3b\u00e1 had formed against him. Ragho\u00f3b\u00e1 was acknowledged Peshw\u00e1 after his death; but it appeared soon after that the widow of N\u00e1riy\u00e1n R\u00e1o was with child.

In order to convince him of his sincerity, he sent him many rich and valuable presents.

On quitting the place of his nativity in 1750 A.D., he wandered over the country, and eventually repaired to Bhiw\u00e1ra, in the Udaipur territory, where, after a residence of two years, Jhim Singh, R\u00e1ja or prince of that state, was urged by the priests to harass him to a degree which compelled him to abandon the town. The chief of Sh\u00e1hpura offered the wanderer an asylum at his court, where he arrived in the year 1767 A.D., but he does not seem to have settled there permanently until two years later, from which time, it may be proper to date the institution of the sect. Ram Charan expired in April, 1798 A.D., in the 79th year of his age, and his corpse was carried to ashes in the great temple at Sh\u00e1hpura. Ram Charan composed 36,260 Sabds or hymns, each containing from five to eleven verses. He was succeeded in the spiritual directorship by R\u00e1msjan, one of his twelve disciples. This person died at Sh\u00e1hpura in 1809 A.D. after a reign of 12 years 2 months and 6 days. He composed 18,000 Sabds. The third hierach Dulh\u00e1 R\u00e1m succeeded him and died in 1824 A.D. He wrote 10,000 Sabds, and about 4000 S\u00e1ki, or epic poems, in praise of men eminent for virtue not only of his own faith, but among Hind\u00fas, Muhammadans and others. After him Chatra D\u00e1s ascended the gaddi, and died in 1831 A.D. He is said to have composed 1000 Sabds, but would not permit their being committed to paper. N\u00e1ry\u00e1n D\u00e1s the fourth in descent from Ram Charan, succeeded him and was living in 1856 A.D.

He obtained an appointment at the Customs Department at Benares which gave him 1,200 rupees per month. He is the author of several Masnav\u00ed, such as \"Muhit-i-Tehb,\" \"Muhit-i-Raf\u00ed,\" \"Muhit-i-Gha'm,\" &c. He also translated some books on mysticism from the Sanskrit, as \"Muhit-ul-Hak\u00edk\u00ed,\" \"Muhit-ul-Astr,\" \"Gulsh\u00e1n-i-Ma'rif\u00e1t,\" \"Muhit Ma'rif\u00e1t,\" &c.\n\nRamji, \u0631\u0627\u0645\u062c\u06cc, son of Raj\u00e1 Bhagw\u00e1n D\u00e1s the uncle of the celebrated Raj\u00e1 M\u00e1n Singh. He, together with his two brothers, Bij\u00e1i R\u00e1m and Say\u00e1m R\u00e1m, was crushed to death under the feet of an elephant by order of the emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr in the early part of his reign.\n\nRam Mohan R\u00e1e, \u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0648\u0647\u0646 \u0631\u0627\u0621, afterwards Raj\u00e1 R\u00e1m Mohan R\u00e1e, a Br\u00e1hman of a respectable family in Bengal, whose birth and mission are briefly stated in Mauder's Biographical Treasury, was early celebrated for his precocious genius, high linguistic attainments, and other natural gifts which in his after-life procured for him the reputation of a reformer. Among several other reforms, the degenerate state of Hind\u00faism demanded his earliest attention, and he with his wonted zeal and assiduity, took upon himself to introduce a reform which at the risk of his person and reputation, he succeeded in a great measure in effecting among his former religious followers. His object was to reconstruct and varnish the old Hind\u00faism, and not to abandon it altogether as some of the modern pseudo-reformers propose. He picked up morals and precepts from the Vedas, Dussanas and Upanishads, which he thought most appropriate and instructive; but never accepted them as revelations. He likewise borrowed rules and precepts from other religions, but more particularly from Christianity. His originality of mind, his natural logical powers, his mastery of mental and moral philosophy, and above all his ardent desire to establish the true knowledge of God among his countrymen, made him discard all the prevailing religions of the world as revelations. When in England, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 always\nattended the Unitarian church and much approved of its doctrines. He embarked for England and arrived at Liverpool on the 8th April, 1831 A.D., and died at Stapylton Grove near Bristol, while on a visit to that country, for the purpose of giving information and of promoting the interests of his countrymen, by advocating a more liberal intercourse with India. After his death his followers in Bengal strictly adhered to the faith, and multiplied in number by thousands. The works of Sir W. Hamilton and Bishop Berkeley have also become their guides in points of philosophy. In India the Brahmins are not idolaters, as considered by some, nor infidels as supposed by many. They are rather the religious and enlightened people of the age as they consider themselves. Raj\u00e1 R\u00e1m Mohan translated the Upanishads of the Yajur Veda according to the Comment of Sankar Acharya, into English, establishing the unity and comprehensibility of the Supreme Being, whose worship alone can tend to eternal beatitude. A translation of the Vedant (an abridgment of all the sacred writings) in Hindustani and Bengali, was made by this Hindu philosopher and philanthropist. The Raj\u00e1 also published an abstract of it in English. His tomb is in Arno's Vale cemetery in Bristol.\n\nRamraj, \u0631\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062c, a Raj\u00e1 of Bij\u00e1nagar or Bij\u00e1nagar, who was slain in battle against the four Muhammadan princes of the Dakhin. This celebrated action took place on the banks of the Krishna river on Friday the 26th of January 1656 A.D., 20th Jum\u00e1da II, 974 A.H. It cost Ramraj his life, and ended in the defeat of the Hindu army with the loss of nearly one hundred thousand men. Ramraj being defeated, was taken prisoner and brought before Husain Shah, who ordered his head to be struck off, and caused it to be placed on the point of a long spear, to be announced to the army; and afterwards kept at Bijapur as a trophy.\n\nRam Narayan, \u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0646\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0646, Raja, was deputy governor of Patna in the time of Mir Ja'far 'Ali Khan the Naw\u00e1b of Bengal. Mir K\u00e1sim 'Ali, on his accession to the masnad in 1760 A.D., 1174 A.H., having detected embezzlements of large sums from the revenues, the jagirs, and pay of the troops, confiscated his effects. About seven lacs of rupees in money and goods were found in his house, and nearly the same sum was recovered from persons to whom it had been entrusted by himself and his women. He was then kept in confinement with several others on suspicion. In August 1763 A.D., Muharram, 1177 A.H., a few days before Mir K\u00e1sim 'Ali's defeat by the English on the banks of the Udwa nala, he commanded these persons to be put to death, and Raj\u00e1 R\u00e1m Narayan was drowned in the Ganges with a bag of sand tied round his neck. Ram Narayan was a Persian scholar and wrote poetry in Persian and Urdu, having adopted the word \"Maus\u00fad\" for his poetical name.\n\nRamraja, \u0631\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0627, succeeded Sahib II as Raj\u00e1 of Sit\u00e1ra in December, 1749 A.D. He was the adopted son of Sahib and grandson of T\u00edr\u00e1 B\u00e1i. He died on the 19th December, 1771 A.D., having a short time before his death adopted Abu Sahib, son of Trimbakji Phule.

He poisoned Bakht Singh his uncle, and usurped the throne. At his death 1778 A.D., disorganization prevailed in M\u00e1rwar, promoted by the Marhattas, who then got footing in Rajp\u00fatana, and by the evils generated by its feudal institutions. At Tonga, however, the Rathors defeated De Boigne, the celebrated general of Scindia; but they were crushed at the subsequent battles of P\u00e1tan and Mairta by the reigning prince Bijai Singh.\n\nRam Singh I, \u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0633\u0646\u06af \u0627\u0648\u0644, Raj\u00e1 of Jaipur, he was honoured after the death of his father Raj\u00e1 Jai Singh I, by the emperor 'Alamgir in 1666 A.D. with the title of Raj\u00e1, and put in possession of his father's territories.

He rebelled against the emperor Jah\u00e1ngir for some time, but was at last compelled by force of arms to acknowledge fealty to the throne of Delhi. The emperor ordered to be cut in marble, the images of Amar Singh and his son Karan, which, when finished and brought to him, he took to Agra and placed in the garden-seat, called Jharokha Darsh\u00e1n, where the people assembled every morning to pay their respects to the emperor.

His son Udai Singh is the founder of the capital Udaipur. The Udaipur chief is, in the estimation of all the Hind\u00fa\ndynasties of India, per excellence the head, without a rival and free from stain. It is true that the independence of the \"great R\u00e1ns of Chittour\" was assailed by the Moguls, and that they succumbed to circumstances; but they never once faltered or acknowledged a superior power. The family dates back upwards of a thousand years. It was in 1614 A.D., in the reign of the emperor Jah\u00e1ngir, that the house was first compelled by force of arms to surrender that complete independence it had then maintained for eight hundred years, and to acknowledge fealty to the throne of Dehl\u00ed. In 1612 we first hear of the renowned R\u00e1n\u00e1 Sang\u00e1 of Chittour. His army consisted of 80,000 horse, supported by 500 war elephants. Seven R\u00e1js of the highest rank, and a hundred and thirteen of inferior note attended his stirrup in the field. The R\u00e1js of Jaipur and M\u00e1rw\u00e1r served under his banner, and he was the acknowledged head of all the R\u00e1jp\u00fat tribes. In 1627 A.D. he espoused the cause of the dethroned dynasty of Delhi. All the princes of R\u00e1jputana ranged themselves under his banner, and he advanced with 100,000 men to drive Babar across the Indus. The first conflict took place at Bannur, where the advance guard of the Moguls was totally routed by the R\u00e1jp\u00fats. In 1668 A.D. Udai Singh, the son of R\u00e1n\u00e1 Sang\u00e1, came under the displeasure of Akbar. He fled and left the defence of his capital Chittour to R\u00e1j Jaimal who was killed by Akbar himself. His death deprived the garrison of all confidence, and they determined to sell their lives as dear as possible. The women threw themselves on the funeral pile of the R\u00e1j, and the men rushed frantically on the weapons of the Moguls and perished to the number of 8000. In 1614 Part\u00e1p Singh reigned and recovered the greater portion of his dominion before Akbar died. In 1678 A.D., Aurangzib marched against Udaipur and succeeded in subjugating it, but the alienation of the R\u00e1jp\u00fats from the Moguls was now complete, and never changed. The great boast of the chiefs of Udaipur is, that their house never gave a daughter to the Mogul sovereigns. Jaipur and Jodhpur did, and gloried in these imperial alliances as conferring additional dignity on their families.\n\nList of the R\u00e1ns of Udaipur.\n\n| R\u00e1n\u00e1 S\u00e1nk\u00e1 | died 1528 |\n|-------------|-----------|\n| Udai Singh, son of R\u00e1n\u00e1 S\u00e1nk\u00e1 | |\n| Part\u00e1p Singh, son of Udai Singh | 1694 |\n| Amar Singh, son of Part\u00e1p Singh | 1619 |\n| Karan, son of Amar Singh, established Udaipur | |\n| Jagat Singh, son of R\u00e1n\u00e1 Karan, tributary to Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n | 1662 |\n| R\u00e1j Singh, son of Jagat Singh | 1680 |\n| Jai Singh, son of R\u00e1j Singh | |\n| Amar Singh II. | |\n| Sangram Singh | |\n| Jagat II pays chouth to the Marhattas. |\n\nRanbir Singh, Maharaja, the present independent ruler of Kashmir, is the son of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Gul\u00e1b Singh whom he succeeded about the month of July or August, 1887 A.D.\n\nRanchhor Das, a learned K\u00e1yeth of Jaipur, and author of a work on the art of writing prose and poetry, entitled \"D\u00e1k\u00e9k-ul-In\u00e1h\u00e1,\" which he wrote in the year 1732 A.D., 1146 A.H.\n\nRandhir Singh, the J\u00e1t R\u00e1j\u00e9 of Bharptpur, was the eldest son of Ranjit Singh whom he succeeded.

He flourished in the time of Sult\u00e1n Ats\u00edz son of Khw\u00e1rizm Shah one of the Sult\u00e1ns of Khw\u00e1rizm. He was a contemporary of Anw\u00e1ri, and was in the fort of Haz\u00e1r Asp, while besieged by Sult\u00e1n Sanjar, in whose service Anw\u00e1ri was. During the siege the two poets wrote very severe satires against the parties of each other, which they exchanged by means of arrows; but the fort being at length taken, Watw\u00e1t was made prisoner. He was, however, released at the intercession of Anw\u00e1ri, and they have been intimate friends. He was called Watw\u00e1t, which is the name of a small animal, on account of his being of a small stature and thin in body.

He was born in the city of Hamd\u00e1n in 1247 A.D., 645 A.D., was by profession a physician, and it was probably from his skill in the science of medicine that he procured office under the Tartar Sult\u00e1ns of Persia. He passed part of his life in the service of \u00c1b\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, king of Persia. At a subsequent period, Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, who was a friend to literature, appointed him to the post of Waz\u00edr in 1298 A.D., 697 A.H. in conjunction with Sa'd-udd\u00edn who became his enemy. Rash\u00edd-udd\u00edn was maintained in his office by Alj\u00e1it\u00fa, surnamed Khud\u00e1 Banda, the brother and successor of Gh\u00e1z\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, and was treated by him with great consideration and rewarded with the utmost liberality. Rash\u00edd-udd\u00edn was at first rumoured that he would be compelled in self-defence to denounce him, and to cause him to be put to death. Amir '\u00c1l\u00edf Sh\u00e1h J\u00f3b\u00e1n a person of low origin, was appointed Sa'd-udd\u00edn's successor at Rash\u00edd-udd\u00edn's request, but they soon fell out, and shortly after the death of Alj\u00e1it\u00fa who was succeeded by his son Sult\u00e1n Ab\u00fa Sa'id, Amir '\u00c1l\u00edf Sh\u00e1h so far succeeded in prejudicing the Sult\u00e1n against the old minister, that he was removed from the wizar\u00e1t in 1317 A.D., 717 A.H. A short time afterwards he was recalled, but it was not long before he again lost favour at court, and was accused of causing the death of his patron Alj\u00e1it\u00fa Kh\u00e1n. It was charged against him that he had recommended a purga-\ntive medicines to be administered to the late king, in opposition to the advice of another physician, and that under its effects the king had expired. He was condemned to death, and his son Farshid, the chief butler, who was only nine years old, was ordered to hand the poison said to have been given to the king, was put to death before the eyes of his parent, who was immediately afterwards cloven in twain by the executioner. His head was borne through the streets of Tabreiz, and proclaimed by the public crier as the head of a Jew. Rashid-uddin was 73 years old when he died, and his death occurred on the 19th July, 1318 A.D., 17th Jamada I, 718 A.H. His eldest son Ghayyis-uddin was subsequently raised to the same dignities as his father, and met with an equally tragic death. Amir 'Ali Shah continued by his address to maintain his high honours and the favour of his master for the space of six years when he died; being the only Wazir, since the establishment of the Mongol monarchy, who had not met with a violent death. Besides the \"Jama-at-Tawarikh,\" Rashid-uddin composed several other works, such as the \"Tafseer-e-Tanqib,\" \"Miftah-at-Tafseer,\" and the \"Bislatul-Sulfiya,\" vide Fasilullah. The body of Rashid-uddin was buried near the mosque which he had constructed in Tabreiz, but by a strange fatality, it was not destined to repose quietly in this, its last asylum. Nearly a century after his death, the government of Tabreiz together with Azurbejjan, was given by Taimur to his son Miran Shah. This young prince, naturally of mild disposition, had become partially deranged in consequence of an injury of the head occasioned by a fall from his horse, and one day, during a temporary access of madness, caused the bones of Rashid-uddin to be exhumed, and they were finally deposited in the cemetery of the Jews.\n\nRashid Billah, \u0631\u0634\u06cc\u062f \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0647, a Khalifa of Baghd\u00e1d, vide Al-Rashid Billah.\n\nRashk, \u0631\u0634\u06a9, poetical name of 'Ali Asad, who is the author of a dictionary and three Urdu Diwans, the last of which he composed in 1846 A.D., 1261 A.H.\n\nRasikh, \u0631\u0627\u0633\u062e, the poetical appellation of Mir Muhammad Zam\u00e1n of Sarhind.

His bread was made of singh\u00e1ras that were produced in the reservoir of S\u00edri. His son K\u00fat-buddin was killed in Bengal by Sher Afkan, first husband of Nur Jah\u00e1n. His grandson Is\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, the son of Badr-uddin was raised by the emperor Jah\u00e1ngir to the rank of an Amir and was appointed governor of Bengal in 1608 A.D., 1017 A.H.

He reigned nine years and became afflicted with a fistula, of which he died at Gw\u00e1l\u00edar 1554 A.D., 961 A.H., in which year also died Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h king of Gujrat, and Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h king of Ahmadnagar. In commemoration of the remarkable circumstance of these monarchs dying almost at the same time, Maul\u00e1n\u00e1 'Ali the father of the celebrated historian Fir\u00e1shi, wrote a short epitaph, in which the words \"the ruin of kings\" exhibit the Hijri year 961 A.D.

It is said that Mik\u00e1fi became known to Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed, and was greatly honoured by that monarch. They relate, that on Mahm\u00fad asking the ambassador of their chief, what force they could bring to his aid; \"Send this arrow,\" said the envoy, presenting one of two which he held in his hand, \"and 50,000 horse will appear!\"\u2014\"Is that all?\" exclaimed Mahm\u00fad. \"Send this,\" said he presenting the other, \"and an equal number will follow.\" \"But suppose I was in extreme distress,\" observed the monarch, \"and wanted your utmost exertions?\"\u2014\"Then,\" replied the ambassador, \"send my bow, and 200,000 horse will obey the summons!\" The proud conqueror heard with secret alarm this terrifying account of their numbers: and he was told that he anticipated the future overthrow of his empire. Tughral Beg and his brothers reigned for several years under Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad. In 1036 A.D., 429 A.H., the former resisted Sult\u00e1n Mass'\u00edd the son of Mahm\u00fad, and received investiture as Sult\u00e1n of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n from the Khalifa of Bagh-\nSalman, \u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646, a poet who died in 1630 A.D., 937 A.H.\n\nSalman, 'Aka, also called Mirza Hissibi, is the author of a commentary on the Preface of the Gulistan, of about 3000 lines.

Is said to have been a native of a small place near Isfahan, and that on passing one day by a Christian Church, he was so much struck by the devotion of the people, and the solemnity of the service therein, that he became disgusted with the idolatrous faith in which he had been brought up. He afterwards wandered about the East, from city to city, and convent to convent, in quest of a religion, until an ancient monk, full of years and infirmities, told him of a prophet who had arisen in Arabia to restore the pure faith of Abraham. He then journeyed to Mecca, and became a convert to Muhammadanism.

He held at his father's death, 1092 A.D., the government of Khurasan, and took little concern in the troubles that ensued on that event; but after the death of his brother, Sultan Muhammad, he may be deemed the actual sovereign of Persia. He forced Bahram Shah, a monarch of the race of Ghazni, whose capital was Ikhor, to pay him tribute; and Alaudin, prince of Ghazni who had defeated Bahram Shah and taken Ghazni, yielded in the face to the power of Sanjar, by whom he was defeated, made prisoner and tributary to the house of Saljuq. But Sanjar, after a long reign marked by singular glory and success, was destined to experience the most cruel reverses of fortune. In the year 1140 A.D., 535 A.H., he advanced far into Tartary to attack Gour Khan, the monarch of Kara Khat\u00e9, and suffered a signal defeat in which almost his whole army was cut to pieces, his family taken prisoner, and all his baggage plundered. He next marched, 1153 A.D., 547 A.H., against the Turkman tribe of Ghus who had withheld their usual tribute of 40,000 sheep; an action ensued, in which he was defeated and taken prisoner. During his long confinement of four years, his dominions were ruled by his favourite Sultan Kh\u00e1t\u00fan Turkman, whose death in 1166 A.D., 551 A.H., Sanjar made no effort to escape and was successful; but he lived only a short time after having regained his liberty, for he died on Friday the 24th May, 1157 A.D., 11th Rabii II., 552 A.H., in the 73rd year of his age, and was buried in Marv.

He was the uncle of Shaikh Junaid as well as his master. The following anecdote is related on good authority: Sari Sakti said that for thirty years he never ceased imploring divine pardon for having once exclaimed, \"Praise be to God!\" and on being asked the reason, he said: \"A fire broke out in Baghd\u00e1d, and a person came up to me and told me that my shop had escaped, on which I uttered those words, and even to this moment I repent having said so, because it showed that I wished better to myself than to others.\" He died on Wednesday the 9th of August, 870 A.D., 6th Ram\u00e1zan, 256 A.H., and is buried at Baghd\u00e1d.

The modest damsel, overwhelmed with confusion and terror, entreated the prince's pardon, and, pleading eloquently for her honour, declined to gratify his curiosity; but he, being charmed with her exquisite grace and the delicious tones of her voice, was fired with a hasty determination, and himself withdrew the veil. He gazed in ardent admiration on her lovely countenance for a few seconds; then dropping the drapery, he asked forgiveness for his rudeness, and paying the beauty some princely compliment, passed on.

He began life in an indifferent school for the character of reformer and saint, which he ultimately assumed, as a sawar serving with Amir Khan's free-booting horse in Malwa. Quitting that service, he repaired to Delhi, and became a disciple of Shah Abdul Aziz, a very celebrated devotee of the city; the fame of whose knowledge and piety has been widely extended throughout this side of India. It is frequently said by natives, that it was from Shah Abdul Aziz, that Sayyad Ahmad derived his peculiar opinions, which he frequently promulgated, and the design which he adopted of preaching up a religious war. It is at least certain, that the chief of his first disciples, and the most constant associates of all his fortunes, were two near relatives of Abdul Aziz, one his nephew, Maulwi Muhammad Isma'il, author of the Sirat-ul-Mustakim, the other his son-in-law, and also partially a contributor to the book, named Maulwi Abdul Hai. By these persons, Muhammad Isma'il is generally esteemed to have been a man of much talent and learning. The extreme honour which he and his brother Maulwi paid to Sayyad Ahmad, who was himself nearly illiterate, had a powerful effect in attracting towards him the respect of the vulgar. They rendered him almost menial offices, running, it is said, with their shoes off, by the side of his palankeen, when, he moved out with his servants. From his first leaving Delhi, he assumed the name of a religious teacher, and commenced spreading his religious doctrines. The general spirit by which these were animated (identical nearly with that of the tenets of the Arabian Wahabis, of whom the sect of Sayyad Ahmad may perhaps be accurately termed an Indian imitation) was the ardent profession of Muhammadianism in its primitive simplicity and fervour, and the utter rejection of all idolatry or superstitious novelties, whencesoever derived. The times in which they were at first actually received was, however, highly favourable. When Sayyad Ahmad at last came down to Bengal, he had got together many followers, and had established an extensive reputation. He arrived in Calcutta with a considerable retinue towards the end of 1821 A.D., and immediately a great majority of the Muhammadians of the place, of all ranks and stations, flocked to become, or to profess themselves, his disciples. In the early part of 1822, he proceeded with his friends, the two Maulwis, to Mecca, from whence he returned in October of the next year, having touched for a few days at Bombay, where, with reference to the shortness of his stay, his success, in gaining numerous followers, was nearly as remarkable as in Calcutta. In December, 1823 A.D., he again started for Upper India. The next important event of his career, his commencing a religious war in the Lahore territories, did not occur till after a considerable interval, though the enterprise was one in which he had long openly announced his intention to engage. Its directions given in the \"Targhib-ul-Jihad,\" or \"Incitement of Religious War,\" a little treatise written in Hindustani during the continuance of the struggle, by a Maulwi of Kanauj, with the view, as its name purports, of rousing the Faithful to rally round the standard which had been raised in the Panjab. \"The tribe of Sikhs,\" says the indignant Maulwi, \"have long held sway in Lahore and other places. Their oppressions have exceeded all limits. Thousands of Muhammadians they have unjustly killed, and on thousands have they heaped disgrace. The Azan, or summons for prayer, and the killing of cows, they have entirely prohibited. When at length their insulting tyranny could no longer be borne, Sayyad Ahmad, going to the direction of Kabul and Kandahar, rounded the Muhammadians of those countries, and called on their courage for action in the service of God; some thousands of believers became ready at his call to tread the path of God's service; and on the 21st December, 1826 A.D., 20th Jamadi I, 1242 A.H., the Jihad against the Kafir Sikhs began.\" The events of this war were watched with a natural interest by the Muhammadian population of India generally, whether followers of Sayyad Ahmad or not. Many of the inhabitants of our Western Provinces went in bodies to range themselves under his standard; and his emissaries gathered large contributions of money and jewels, even from our own distant Presidencies, and from the principal Muhammadian towns of the Dakhin. The prominent occurrences of the war, the perseverance with which it was kept up, the temporary and occasional successes which Sayyad Ahmad met with, and his ultimate death in battle, are well known. With his death, the struggle appears to have entirely ceased.\u2014Journal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. I, p. 480.\n\nSayyad Ali or Sayyad Ali Hamdani, \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0647\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646\u064a, a famous Sayyad who fled to Kashmir from his native city of Hamdan where he had incurred the wrath of Amir Taimur.

His son Mir Muhammad Hamdani, also a fugitive, brought in his train three hundred Sayyads to Kashmir.\nwhere he remained twelve years.

The connection of the British with Muskat commenced in the beginning of the present century, when in conjunction with the then Im\u00e1m, Sayyad Sa\u00edd, the English were engaged in suppressing the Wah\u00e1bi pirates who infested the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. Sayyad Sa\u00edd lived to a great age and filled the throne of Muskat for about fifty years. He died in 1856 A.D., and was succeeded by his son Thowayni who has recently been murdered by his son Sal\u00edm. The old Im\u00e1m left several sons, one of whom received as his share the kingdom of Zan-zib\u00e1r and the other Sayyad Turki another chiefship.\n\nIn the year 1868 A.D., one Az\u00e1n bin-Ghais, aided by the other potentates, having attacked and driven the Sultan from the throne, occupied it himself. Sultan Sal\u00edm fled to Bandar Abb\u00e1s, where he is now.

He kept no property or places for himself, and lived upon rice only; yet his expenses in charity were so great, that, as he never accepted any presents, men were astonished whence his finances were supplied, and actually believed, that he possessed the art of transmuting other metals into gold. He made nothing of bestowing two or three thousand pieces of gold to relieve the wants of any noble family in distress. In short, he displayed more magnificence in his feasts than the princes themselves. He expended daily upon the poor 1000 maunds of flour, 500 maunds of meat, 80 maunds of sugar, besides rice, oil, butter and other necessaries in proportion. He latterly began to bestow titles and offices upon his disciples, and to assume a tone and manner sufficiently indicative of his design on the throne. One of his followers disguised with the part assigned to him, went privately to the king (Jal\u00e1l-udd\u00edn F\u00edr\u00fas Khilj\u00ed) and disclosed the plot. The king caused him to be apprehended and trodden to death by an elephant. This event happened in the year 1291 A.D., 690 A.H., and is accounted one of the most remarkable\nevents that took place in the reign of that monarch, for many believed him entirely innocent of the charge.\n\n**Sidi 'Ali Kapudan**, \u0633\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u06a9\u067e\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0646, or Captain of the fleet of Sultan Sulaiman I, emperor of Constantinople. He is the author of the work called \"Mirat-ul-Mamluk,\" or Mirror of Countries, containing a description of his journey overland from the Indian shores to Constantinople; and of the \"Muhi\" that is the Ocean, a Turkish work on Navigation in the Indian Seas. This work the author finished at Ahmadabad the capital of Gujrat in December 1564 A.D., Muharram 978 A.H.

Bhim Sen, rana of Udaipur, the first in rank among the Hind\u00fa princes, had a son named Bhag Singh by a concubine of a tribe very inferior to his own. On the death of his father, Bhag Singh finding himself despised and neglected by his relations, the Sisodias rajaits, who from the case of his mother regarded him only as a bastard, and not of their tribe, became weary of the indignities shewn him; and moved from Udaipur to Kh\u00e2ndesh where he embraced the service of a Zamindar, named Raj\u00e1 Ali Mohan. He afterwards retired into the Dakhin, where he purchased a tract of land near the present Maratha capital of Puna, and settled upon it as Zamindar, in which situation he died. Bhag Singh had four sons, two of whom, Mall\u00faji and Bamduji, being of an enterprising spirit, entered into the service of J\u00e1tio R\u00e1e, a Maratha chief of distinguished rank at the court of Bahadur Nizam Shah. Mall\u00faji had a son named Sah\u00edji or Sah\u00faji who married the daughter of J\u00e1tio R\u00e1e, and thus the Bhola family became incorporated with the Marath\u00e1s, and are commonly esteemed as such in Hindust\u00e1n. Sah\u00edji, after the death of his father, left Ahmadnagar with his followers and entered into the service of Ahmad Adil Shah, king of Bijapur, who gave him a jagir in the Karnatic, with a command of about thousand horse. Soon after this in May, 1627 A.D. his son Sew\u00e1ji, afterwards so celebrated in the Dakhin, was born, from the daughter of J\u00e1tio R\u00e1e Maratha. Sah\u00edji having disagreed with his wife, sent her, with the infant Sew\u00e1ji, to reside at Puna, of which, and the vicinity, he had obtained a grant. Sew\u00e1ji though neglected by his father was properly educated, and at the age of seventeen excelled in every accomplishment. Military fame was his first passion; and the government of Bijapur being now weakened by intestine divisions and the encroachments of the Mughals, he had soon an opportunity of signalising himself among other rebels. He raised a banditti, and plundered the neighbouring districts, and having now taken possession of the jagir, raised more troops, successfully levied contributions on several Zamindars, and much extended the limits of his territories. At this crisis the prince Aurangzeib, governor of the imperial territories in the Dakhin, was meditating the overthrow of his brother D\u00e1rk Shikoh, the favourite son of the emperor Shah Jah\u00e1n, who was now in a dangerous state of health. For this purpose he was preparing an army to march to Agra; and, observing the enterprising genius of Sew\u00e1ji, sent him an invitation to his service. Sew\u00e1ji pretending to be struck with horror at the rebellion of a son against a father, received the prince's messenger with indignity, drove him from his presence, and ordered the letter he had brought, to be tied to the tail of a dog. Aurangzeib for the present stifled his resentment, but never would forgive Sew\u00e1ji's insolence, and hence may be dated his tedious war in the Dakhin, and finally the ruin of the Mughal empire by the Marath\u00e1s. Aurangzeib having left the Dakhin in 1658 A.D., 1068 A.H., Sew\u00e1ji resolved to take the initiative of the imperial troops, and the weakness of the Golkanda and Bijapur princes, to the utmost advantage. He took the fortresses of R\u00e9j\u00e1garh, which he fixed upon as the seat of his government. The Bijapur government having in vain desired his father Sah\u00edji, (who disclaimed all connection with him) to repress the excesses of his son, at length sent against him a considerable force under a general named Afzul Kh\u00e1n. Sew\u00e1ji with artful policy invited him to come and receive his submission. Afzul Kh\u00e1n advanced without opposition to his tent, when he was stabbed by the treacherous Zamindar in embracing him. Upon a signal given, the Marath\u00e1s rushed from an ambuscade, attacked the unsuspecting army of Bijapur, which, deprived of their chief, was quickly defeated. Sew\u00e1ji plundered their rich camp, and by this victory became master of all R\u00e9j\u00e1garh, the Zamindars of which flocked to acknowledge his authority, to save their possessions. The strong fortresses of Sit\u00e1ra and other places also opened their gates to receive him. In the course of only three years, Sew\u00e1ji became a powerful prince, his authority being acknowledged over almost the whole coast of M\u00e1rwar. He built palaces and erected fortifications in every part of his country; gave much trouble to the emperor Alamgir; reigned more than twenty years, and left a character which has never since been equalled or approached by any of his countrymen. He died on the 14th April, 1680 A.D., 24th Rab\u00ed I, 1091 A.H., but according to Elphinstone's History of India, on the 5th April the same year, aged 63 years. His funeral pile was administered with the same sacrifices as had been devoted the year before to the obsequies of the Maharaj\u00e1 Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur; attendants, animals, and wives, were burnt with his corpse. He was succeeded by his son Sambha or Sambah\u00e1ji.\n\n**Secoji or Shioji**, \u0633\u06a9\u0648\u062c\u06cc, a grandson of the renowned Jaichand, the last R\u00e1thor monarch of Kanauj. He with a few retainers migrated in the year 1213 A.D., and planted the R\u00e1thor standard in M\u00e1rwar. His successors in process of time, by valor, and by taking advantage of the times, enlarged the state, and in 1438 A.D., Jodh R\u00e1o of M\u00e1rwar, founded the modern capital of Jodhpur, to which he transferred the seat of government from Mand\u00f3r. The name of M\u00e1rwar is a corruption of M\u00e1r\u00eddwar, also called M\u00e1r\u00f3-deis, or \"the region of death.\" Apparently, and properly, it included the entire western desert, from the Satlaj to the ocean.\n\n**Shabib**, \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06cc\u0628, the son of Yazid, the son of Na'im, was a Kh\u00e1rajite. It is related that his\nfather Yezid was sent by 'Usw\u00e1n the Khalif to assist the Syrian Muhammedans against the Greeks in the twenty-fifth year of the Hijra. The Musalm\u00e1ns obtaining the victory, the Christians were exposed for sale. Among the captives Yezid espied a beautiful maid, whom he bought, and married. She proved with child of Shabih, who was born on the 10th of the month of Zil-hijja, being the day on which the pilgrims kill the sacrifices at Mecca. He opposed Hajj\u00e1j the governor of Mecca for a long time, and was at last drowned in a river. His body being drawn out, his head was cut off and sent to Hajj\u00e1j. This happened in 696 A.D., 77 A.H.\n\nShadan, \u0634\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0646, poetical title of R\u00e1e Chandra L\u00e1l, an Amir in the service of the Niz\u00e1m of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nShaddad, \u0634\u062f\u0627\u062f, the Adite, was the son of 'Adand the first king of the 'Adites, a race of ancient Arabs; the smallest of their tribe is said to have been 60 cubits high, and the largest 100 cubits. 'Ad had two sons, Shadid and Shadd\u00e1d; on the death of their father they reigned conjointly over the whole earth. At length Shadd\u00e1d died, and his brother Shadd\u00e1d ruled after him. Shadd\u00e1d was fond of reading the ancient books, and when he met with descriptions of Paradise and of the world to come, his heart enticed him to build its like upon the earth. A pleasant and elevated spot being fixed upon, Shadd\u00e1d despatched one hundred chiefs to collect skilful artists and workmen from all countries. He also commanded the kings of Syria and Oman to send him all their jewels and precious stones. Forty camel-loads of gold, silver, and jewels were daily used in the building, which contained a thousand spacious quadrangles of many thousand rooms. In the areas were artificial trees of gold and silver, whose leaves were emeralds, and fruit clusters of pearls and jewels. The ground was strewed with ambergris, musk and saffron. Between every two of the artificial trees was planted one of delicious fruit. This romantic abode took up 500 years in the completion. To this paradise he gave the name of Ir\u00e1m. When finished, Shadd\u00e1d marched to view it, and when arrived near, divided two hundred thousand youthful slaves, whom he had brought with him from Damascus, into four detachments, which were stationed in cantonments prepared for their reception on each side of the garden, towards which he proceeded with his favorite courtiers. Suddenly, was heard in the air a voice like thunder, and Shadd\u00e1d, looking up, beheld a personage of majestic figure and stern aspect, who said, \"I am the Angel of Death, commissioned to seize thy impure soul.\" Shadd\u00e1d exclaimed, \"Give me leisure to enter the garden,\" and was descending from his horse, when the seizer of life snatched away his impure spirit, and he fell dead upon the ground. At the same time lightnings flashed, and destroyed the whole army of the infidel; and the rose-garden of Ir\u00e1m became concealed from the sight of man.\n\nIt was during the reign of Mu\u00e1w\u00eda, the first Khalif of Damascus, that some of the principal incidents connected with the Paradise of Shadd\u00e1d, are said to have taken place. This Paradise, though invisible, is still supposed to be standing in the deserts of Aden, and sometimes, though very rarely God permits it to be seen.\n\nCrighton, in his \"History of Arabia,\" says that \"The whole fable seems a confused tradition of Belus and the ancient Babylon; or rather, as the name would import, of Benhad, mentioned in Scripture as one of the most famous of the Syrian kings, and who, we are told, was worshipped by his subjects.\"\n\nShadid, \u0634\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u062f, an eminent Musalm\u00e1n doctor and author who died in the year 1447 A.D., 861 A.H.\n\nShadid, \u0634\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u062f, an author, whose proper name is Muhammad bin-Far\u00e1surr.\n\nShadman, Sultan, \u0634\u0627\u062f\u0645\u0627\u0646, a poet who had assumed the title of Sult\u00e1n on account of his being a descendant of the royal race of Gibk\u00e1r, whose territory was between the countries of the Panj\u00e1b and Hasan Abdal.

He is the author of several works, and is said by al-Suy\u00fat\u00ed writers to have been a learned and virtuous man, who laboured to arrange the traditions so as to render them useful as a code of laws. In his youth he was a pupil of M\u00e1l\u00edk ibn-'Aun. His followers were at one time very numerous in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n; but at present his opinions are rarely quoted, either in Persia or India. He is reputed to have composed two collections of traditions, namely, the \"Masnad\" and the \"Sunan.\" Besides the works on the traditions, he is said to have composed a most excellent treatise on jurisprudence, called \"Al-Fikh-ul-Akbar;\" but it has been questioned whether he was the author.\n\nShafa'i, \u0634\u0627\u0641\u06cc, poetical appellation of a poet.

According to the work called Haft Ak\u00edfim, he was starved or put to death at Aleppo in 1189 A.D., 585 A.H., aged 36 or 38 years. He is the author of the Commentaries called \"Sharah Hay\u00e1kal\" and \"Sharah Ay\u00e1z.\" In the 4th Vol. of H\u00e1ji Khalifa, p. 236, he is said to be the author of another work called \"Akl Surkh.\"\n\nShahab-uddin Suharwardi, Shaikh, the son of Ab\u00fa Najib; was born at Suharward in January, 1145 A.D., Raj\u00e1b, 589 A.H. He was a pious Shaikh, most assiduous in his spiritual exercises and the practise of devotion. He is the author of several works, among which is one called \"Aw\u00e1rif-ul-Mafr\u00edf\" also called \"Aw\u00e1rif-ul-H\u00e1k\u00e9k.\" He died on the 26th September, 1234 A.D., 1st Muharram, 632\nShahab-uddin, Sultan, the son of Sultan 'Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn whom he succeeded on the throne of Kashmir, 1356 A.D., 767 A.H. He turned his attention to foreign conquest, and during the succeeding ten years subdued Thibet, K\u00e1fghar, Badakhsh\u00e1n and K\u00e1b\u00fal. He then, according to the historian Haidar Malik, invaded Hind\u00fast\u00e1n with an immense army, and is said to have worsted F\u00edr\u00faz Shah, king of Delhi in a pitched battle on the banks of the Satlaj; the result of which was to cause that potentate to acknowledge him as sovereign. Shahab-uddin then returned to Kashmir, where his religious zeal led him to destroy the idol temples at Bih\u00e1rih\u00e1ri and elsewhere. He died after a reign of 19 years, 1376 A.D., and was succeeded by his brother Khur\u00e1id\u00edn, during whose reign, the famous Sayyad 'Al\u00ed Ham\u00e1d\u00e1n\u00ed arrived at Kashmir.\n\nShahadat, poetical name of Mirz\u00e1 S\u00e1l\u00e1h of Balkh, who died in 1742 A.D., 1155 A.H.\n\nShah 'Alam, king of Dehl\u00ed, whose original name was 'Al\u00ed G\u00f3h\u00e1r, was the son of the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr II, by Z\u00edn\u00e1t Mah\u00e1l surnamed Bil\u00e1l K\u00fanwar; was born on the 16th of June, 1728 A.D., 1172 Z\u00ed-Ka'da, 1140 A.H. In the year 1758 A.D., 1172 A.H., fearing he might be made a prisoner by 'Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk Gh\u00e1z\u00ed-udd\u00edn Kh\u00e1n the minister of his father, he left Dehl\u00ed to try his fortune in Bengal, the Naw\u00e1b of which province, Sir\u00e1f\u00ed-uddaul\u00e1 had been deposed by the assistance of the English, and Mir J\u00e1f\u00e1r set up in his room. He was in Beh\u00e1r, when he received the intelligence of the murder of his father, and having assumed the imperial authority, he ascended the throne on the 25th of December, 1758 A.D., 4th Jum\u00e1da I, 1173 A.H. with the title of Shah 'Alam. After the defeat of Shuj\u00e1-uddaul\u00e1 his prime-minister, at Buxar on the 23rd October, 1764 A.D., 26th Rabi' II, 1178 A.H., and his flight to the upper province, the king followed the English to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d where he granted the East India Company the Sanad of the Diw\u00e1n\u00ed of Bengal dated 12th August, 1765 A.D., 24th Safar, 1179 A.H., on the Company agreeing to pay the emperor 24 lacs of rupees annually from the revenues of the three provinces, viz., Bengal, Beh\u00e1r, and Ury\u00e1s. This important business being settled by Lord Clive, he returned to Calcutta, leaving General Smith to attend the emperor, but in fact to rule him; for the General resided in the fortress, and his majesty in the town; and the sound of the imperial nautch in the fort being disagreeable to General Smith, he forbade the emperor's ladies and the servants of the company to refuse. Shah 'Alam continued to reside at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d under the protection of the English till the year 1778 A.D., 1185 A.H. when growing weary of his retirement, he proceeded to Dehl\u00ed where he arrived on the 25th of December the same year, but not long after fell into the power of Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir Kh\u00e1n a Rohela chief, who put out his eyes on the 10th of August, 1778 A.D., Rama\u1e0d\u00e1n, 1185 A.H. Shah 'Alam after this event re-assumed the throne and died on the 19th November, 1806 A.D., 7th Rama\u1e0d\u00e1n, 1221 A.H., aged 81 lunar years. Shah 'Alam's poetical name was 'Af\u00e1h. He was a good poet, and has left a Diw\u00e1n called Diw\u00e1n 'Af\u00e1h, in Persian and Urdu verses.

He passed the first part of his life as a Dervish or mendicant, but was afterwards employed by the emperor Akbar, and raised to the dignity of Amir. He was appointed governor of Bengal in 1584 A.D., 992 A.H., and died in the 44th year of the reign of that monarch, 1599 A.D., 1008 A.H., aged 70 years. He was buried at Ajmeir near the mausoleum of Khw\u00e1ja Mo'in-udd\u00edn Chisht\u00ed. His liberality and the money he expended was so great, that it made the people think that he had in his possession the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nShah Beg Arghun or Urghun, king of Sindh and founder of the Argh\u00fan family, was the son of Mirz\u00e1 Zunn\u00fan Beg Argh\u00fan, the commander-in-chief and head of the nobles at the court of Sultan Husain Mirz\u00e1 king of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and governor of Kan-dah\u00e1r and the provinces of Sh\u00e1l, S\u00edt\u00ednak and Argh\u00fan. He met his death in attempting to resist an invasion under Muhammad Khan Sh\u00e1h\u00e1n Ub\u00e1k. After his death the government of Kan-dah\u00e1r devolved on his son Shah Beg Argh\u00fan. When the usurper B\u00e1bur Sh\u00e1h invaded the province of Kan-dah\u00e1r, Shah Beg unable to resist him retreated towards Sindh, and having overcome J\u00e1m Fir\u00faz the last king of the Sam\u00e1na dynasty, 1621 A.D., 927 A.H., he settled himself as king in that country. His reign was, however, but of short duration, for he died two years and some months after the conquest, in the year 1524 A.D., 930 A.H., and his eldest son Shah Husain Argh\u00fan succeeded him.\n\nShah Begam, this was the title conferred by Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr on his first wife who was the daughter of Bhagw\u00e1n D\u00e1s the son of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Beh\u00e1ri M\u00e1la. She was married to prince Sal\u00edm (afterwards Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr) in 1584 A.D., 993 A.H., and became the mother of Sultan Khusr\u00f3 who was born in 1587 A.D., 996 A.H. When Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr rebelled against his father Akbar, and was living independently at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, he got himself up more than ever to debauchery. He had always entertained a peculiar dislike for his eldest son Sultan Khusr\u00f3 whose own levity and violence seem to have given him reasons for his displeasure. Some circumstance in their disputes so affected Khusr\u00f3's mother, that she swallowed poison (opium) in 1603 A.D., 1012 A.H., and died at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d where she was buried in a place called Sultan Khusr\u00f3's garden, where her son Sultan Khusr\u00f3 also was afterwards buried.\n\nShah Begam, a daughter of Muhammad Muk\u00edm, brother of Shah Beg Argh\u00fan, governor of Kan-dah\u00e1r and afterwards king of Sindh.

He was, however, defeated and slain in a battle against Shah 'Isma'il Safwi, in 1610 A.D., 916 A.H., when his skull was overlaid with gold, and made into a drinking cup by that monarch. After his death Taim\u00far Sult\u00e1n succeeded him and J\u00e1n\u00ed Beg Sultan and 'Abdull\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n divided Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1 between themselves. The Uzbaks were Tartars who came from the borders of Russia, where they had been governed by a race of princes descended from Sh\u00e1h Safwi, the grandson of Chaghas Kh\u00e1n; but they derived their name from Uzbak, the seventh of their race, who introduced the Muhammedan religion among them. The last prince of this tribe was Bur\u00faz Kh\u00e1n, who was slain by Sh\u00e1h Bakti, upon which the Uzbaks quitted their ancient habitation, and conquered Khuras\u00e1n, Khwarizm, &c.\n\nShahi, Mir or Amir, poetical name of Ak\u00e1 Malik son of Jam\u00e1l-udd\u00edn Firozkohi.

He wrote a beautiful hand, was a good musician and painter. He flourished in the time of Baisanghar Mirz\u00e1s and Sultan B\u00e1bar, and died at Astrabad in 1450 A.D., 864 A.H., aged more than 70 years. He was buried at his own request at Sabzav\u00e1r.

After his death the government of Sindh was divided between two rivals, Mahm\u00fad the governor of Bakkar and Mirz\u00e1 Isa Turkh\u00e1r governor of Thatta, who both assumed the title of king, and between whom frequent dissensions arose, and battles were fought. The emperor Akbar on coming to L\u00e1h\u00f3r reduced the whole of the province of Bakkar exclusive of the fort, till at last Mahm\u00fad was willing to give it up, and Akbar deputed Geis\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n to receive it, but Mahm\u00fad died before his arrival, 1674 A.D., 982 A.H., after a reign of 20 lunar years, and Akbar thus became possessed of Upper Sindh, and put an end to the hopes of the race of Mahm\u00fad. Isa Turkh\u00e1r who took possession of Thatta after the death of Shah Husain, died after a reign of 13 years in 1687 A.D., 976 A.H.\n\nShah Husain Safwi, succeeded his father Shah Sulaim\u00e1n, king of Persia in 1694 A.D., 1184 A.H. In the year 1722, Mahm\u00fad, an Afghan chief of Kandah\u00e1r besieged Isfah\u00e1n, and compelled Sultan Husain to surrender and resign his crown to him. This circumstance occurred on the 23rd of October the same year 1185 A.H., and the unfortunate Sultan was confined in a small palace, where he remained seven years; when a reverse of fortune which threatened their downfall led his enemies, whose chief was Ashraf the successor of Mahm\u00fad, to put an end to his existence. This unhappy event took place in the year 1728 A.D., 1142 A.H. The Safw\u00e1n family may be said to have actually terminated with Sultan Husain. His son Tahmasp, assumed the title of king, and struggled for a few years with his fate, but a weak effeminate, and debauched youth, was unsuited for such times; and he only merits a place in history, as his name furnished a pretext for the celebrated N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h to lay the foundation of his great power.\n\nShah Husain Sayyad, vide Hak\u00edmat.\n\nShahidi, poetical name of Mir 'Abdul Wah\u00edd of Bilgr\u00edm, which see.\n\nShaista Khan, Nawab, the son of Asaf Kh\u00e1n the prime minister.\n\nShahidi Kummi, an author who was a native of Kumm, and died in 1529 A.D., 936 A.H.\n\nShah Jalal, a Muhammedan saint of great sanctity, whose tomb is in Sylhet.

He was born at L\u00e1h\u00f3r on the 6th January, 1593 A.D., 9th Rab\u00ed I, 1000 A.H., and named Mirz\u00e1 Khurram.

He marched towards L\u00e1h\u00f3r on hearing of the throne being at his disposal; and began his reign 4th February, 1628 A.D., 8th Jum\u00e1da II, 1037 A.H. He was the most magnificent prince that ever appeared in India. The most striking instance of his pomp and prodigality was his construction of the famous Peacock throne. It took its name from two peacocks fashioned splendidly in sapphires, emeralds, rubies and other appropriate jewels which formed the chief ornament of a mass of bullion and precious stones that dazzled every beholder. Tavernier, a jeweller by profession, reports, that it cost nearly six millions and a half sterling. His greatest splendour was shown in his buildings. He founded a new city at Dehl\u00ed called after him Shahjah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d, but of all the structures erected by him, there is none that bears any comparison\nwith the T\u00e1j Mahal at Agra, a mausoleum of white marble decorated with mosaics, which for the richness of the material, the chasteness of the design, and the effect at once brilliant and solemn, is not surpassed by any edifice, either in Europe or Asia. T\u00e1j Mahal is a corruption of Mumt\u00e1z Mahal, the name of Shah Jah\u00e1n\u2019s favourite wife, whose sepulchre it forms. Shah Jah\u00e1n reigned thirty years and was dethroned and confined in the fort of Agra, near his own \u2018Kilang\u2019 Agraunghai on 15th of June, 1658 A.D., 7th Ramzan, 1068 A.H., and died at Agra after an imprisonment of 7 years and 10 months, on Monday night the 23rd of January, 1666 A.D., 26th Rajab, 1068 A.H., aged 76 lunar years 3 months and 17 days, and was buried in the T\u00e1j close to his wife\u2019s tomb. There were living at the time of his imprisonment, four of his sons and four daughters. Of the sons, the eldest was D\u00e1r\u00e1 Shikoh, the second Sultan Shuj\u00e1, the third \u2018Alamgir and the fourth Mur\u00e1d Baksh; but \u2018Alamgir, who succeeded his father, murdered two of his brothers, viz., D\u00e1r\u00e1 and Mur\u00e1d, and the third Sultan Shuj\u00e1 died in Arracan, or was murdered by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of that country.

The period of the establishment of the Muhammedan faith in that country took place during the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Seina D\u00e9va, about the year 1816 A.D., 715 A.H., when a person called Sh\u00e1h Mir coming to Kashmir in the habit of a Dervish, was admitted into the service of that prince. Upon the death of the r\u00e1j\u00e1, he was appointed prime minister to his son and successor R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranjan. When this r\u00e1j\u00e1 died, Anand Dev, who succeeded him, also made Sh\u00e1h Mir his minister. The whole of this family not only gained great ascendancy over the r\u00e1j\u00e1, but also over the minds of the people, till the r\u00e1j\u00e1, becoming jealous of their power, forbade them the court. This exclusion drove Sh\u00e1h Mir into rebellion, when having occupied the valley of Kashmir with his troops, most of the officers of the r\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s government also joined him. This insurrection soon brought the raja to the grave, who died of a broken heart in the year 1327 A.D., 727 A.H., leaving his widow regent. Sh\u00e1h Mir after some years married\nKaula Devi, the wife of the r\u00e9j\u00e1, who embraced the Muhammadan faith; an event which secured to him the country which he had before nearly usurped. It is related by another author, that when preparations for the marriage were commenced, the devoted princess, despising and indignant, surrounded by her train of maidens, advanced into the presence of the usurper, and upbraiding him for his ingratitude and treachery, stabbed him before him. Thus perished by her own hand the last Hindu sovereign of Kashmir, and Shah Mir, who is considered the first Muhammadan king of that country, ascended the throne under the title of Sult\u00e1n Shamsudd\u00edn, in the year 1341 A.D., 742 A.H. He died in 1344 or 1349 A.D., 745 or 750 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Jamshid.\n\nList of the Muhammadan Kings of Kashmir.\n\n1. Sult\u00e1n Shamsudd\u00edn Shah Mir.\n2.

After his death, the leading men divided the country into three principalities among themselves, though for form's sake, Nazuk, the son of Ibrahim, was again seated on the throne, and was again deposed the second time, by his brother.\n\nIbrahim II was placed on the throne by Davlat Chak, and after a short time was deposed and blinded, and his brother Isma'il was raised to the throne in 1556. He reigned nearly two years, and was succeeded by his son Habib who ascended the throne and reigned 3 years, after which he was imprisoned by Ghazi Chak. Ghazi Chak declared himself king and assumed the title of Ghazi Shah, and reigned 4 years, when being attacked with sickness he abdicated the throne in 1563 A.D.\n\nHussein Shah, his brother mounted the throne, reigned 6 years and was compelled to abdicate in favour of his brother 'Ali Khan in 1569 A.D.\n\n'Ali Shah ascended the throne in 1569, and in the year 1572, Mull\u00e1 Ishk\u00ed and K\u00e1s\u00ed Sadr-udd\u00edn came as ambassadors from the court of Dehl\u00ed, the result of which was that Akbar was proclaimed emperor of Kashmir in the public prayers; and 'Ali Shah at the request of Akbar, sent his niece the daughter of his brother Husain Shah to be married to the prince Salim. In the year 1578, 'Ali Shah was killed by a fall from his horse after a reign of 9 years and was succeeded by his son.\n\nYusuf Chak who proceeded to the court of Akbar in 1586 and Yakub Chak succeeded to the throne in consequence of his father's detention at the court of Dehl\u00ed. In the year 1687 A.D., 996 A.H. Akbar appointed Muhammad Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, Amir-ul-Bahr (Admiral) to march and subdue Kashmir. Yakub was defeated and at last seized and sent to Dehl\u00ed in 1588, where Akbar enrolled Yusuf Shah and his son Yakub among the nobles of his government. Each of them received estates in the province of Behar, and from that period the kingdom of Kashmir has been a province of Dehl\u00ed.\n\nShah Muhammad, Khalifa, author of the book called \"Insh\u00e1e J\u00e1m\u00e1-ul-Kaw\u00e1n\u00ed,\" commonly called \"Insh\u00e1e Khalifa,\" containing forms of letters.\n\nShah Murad, \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0634\u0627\u0647, vide Murad Mirz\u00e1.\n\nShahnawaz Khan, \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0632 \u062e\u0627\u0646, son of Abdul Rah\u00edm Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n.

But the author of the Masir-ul-Umr says that he was the son of Mirza Rustam Kandah\u00e1r\u00ed. He was appointed governor of Gujrat in the room of the prince Murad Bakhsh who was imprisoned by order of his brother 'Alamgir in July, 1658 A.D. When D\u00e1r\u00e1 Shikoh through various adventures, after his flight from Mult\u00e1n came to Ahmadabad Gujrat, Shahnawaz Khan, his maternal uncle was then in that city, and his daughter the wife of Murad Bakhsh was in his palace. Her bitter supplications against 'Alamgir, the avenging murderer of her husband, prevailed on him to join the cause of D\u00e1r\u00e1, for whom he levied an army, and marched with him towards Ajmeir where on their arrival, a bloody battle ensued between the armies of D\u00e1r\u00e1 and 'Alamgir, on Sunday the 13th of March, 1659 A.D., Jum\u00e1da II, 1069 A.H. which ended in the defeat and flight of D\u00e1r\u00e1 and death of Shahnawaz Khan who fell by the lance of Dileir Khan. He was buried by the orders of 'Alamgir in the mausoleum of Khw\u00e1ja Mo'in-udd\u00edn Chishti at Ajmeir.\n\nShahnawaz Khan, \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0632 \u062e\u0627\u0646, a nobleman of Shah 'Alam's court, author of the book called Mirat-e-Aft\u00e1b-numai a work on the history of Modern Dehl\u00ed.\n\nShahnawaz Khan, \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0632 \u062e\u0627\u0646, entitled Sams\u00e1m-ud-dul\u00e1. The original name of this nobleman was 'Abdul Razz\u00e1k; he was descended from the family of Sad\u00e1t of Khaw\u00e1f in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, but his great-grand-\nfather Amir Kamal-ud-din left Khawaf, and came to Hindustan in the reign of the emperor Akbar, when he was admitted amongst the nobles of the court of Delhi. Mirk Husain, the son of Khusro-ud-din held a situation in the service of the state, in the reign of Jahangir. The son of Mirk Husain, Mirk Mohsin-ud-din, commonly called Amat Khan, was in great favour with Shah Jahin, and rose to the first rank. He retained also the patronage of Jahangir, was appointed by him to various important governments as those of Lahore, Multan, Kabul and Kashmir. Amat Khan was the ablest man in the court, and a great favourite of Jahangir. When the emperor resided in Upper India, he bestowed the Sibadari of the Dakhin on Khan Jahin Bahadur Kokaltash about the year 1670 A.D., 1081 A.H., and Amat Khan was appointed Diwan of the Dakhin or Paymaster General, and Historiographer. He had four sons of eminent character; the first Abdul Kadir Dayanat Khan, was the keeper of the Privy Purse. The second Mir Husain Amat Khan, was the public treasurer and governor of Sirmur; after his death the latter post was assigned to his elder brother. The third son was Mir Abdul Rahman Wizaret Khan who was promoted to the Diwan of Malwa and Bijapur. He was an excellent poet and composed a Divan under the poetical title of Birkami. The fourth son Kasim Khan was Diwan of Multan. Mir Hasan Ali the son of Kasim Khan was the father of Nawab Samsam-uddaula Shahnawaz Khan. He was born on the 10th of March, 1700 A.D., 29th Ramazan, 1111 A.H. at Lahore, but repaired to Aurangabad at an early age, and took up his abode with his relations and kindred who resided there before him. He was engaged first by Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah under whom and his son Nasir Jung he served as Diwan of Berar for several years. In the time of Safdar Jang, he was raised to the rank of 7000 with the title of Samsam-uddaula. On the 12th of May, 1754 A.D., 3rd Ramadan, 1171 A.H., the day on which Abdul Rahman Haider Jang, the counsellor of Nawab Bussy, the French General, was assassinated by the instigation of Nizam Ali the brother of Safdar Jang, he also was murdered in the confusion together with his youngest son Mir Abdul Nabi Khan, but his two other sons, Mir Abdur Salam and Mir Abdul Hai escaped. The remains of the father and son were interred in the tomb of their ancestors in the southern part of the city of Aurangabad. The chronogram of this event gives the following: \"We have been murdered by Abdul Rahman\" Shahnawaz Khan is the author of the work called \"Masiq-ul-Ummra Taimuria\" containing the Memoirs of the nobility who served in Hindustan and the Dakhin under the house of Taimur. It was commenced by him, but he left it unfinished, and in the turbulent scenes which attended his death, the manuscript was scattered in various directions, and was considered as lost; some short time afterwards Mir Ghulam Ali Arzad, a friend of his collected the greater portion of the missing leaves, and restored the work to its entire form with a few additions, amongst which was the life of the author: at a subsequent period again, his son Mir Abdul Hai Khan who had received the title of Samsam-uddaula Samsam Jang after his father's death, completed the work in the form in which it now occurs, in the year 1779 A.D., and died on the 28th April, 1782 A.D., 15th Jumada I, 1196 A.H.\n\nShah Nur Ashhari, a famous poet who was a pupil of Zahir-ud-din Farzadi and flourished in the reign of Sultan Muhammad Khwairiz Shah son of Taksh.

His father Razul Kul's mother Fatima Sultan Begum was the daughter of Shah Sultan Husain Safvi. Shahrukh was placed on the throne some time after the death of his grandfather, but was soon after seized by the arrival of sight. He retired to Mashhad, where province was allowed to hold in his possession till the time of his death, which happened at Damghan in 1796 A.D. His death was the consequence of the tortures that had been inflicted upon him by Akbar Muhammad, king of Persia, who by this act extorted from him many precious stones of great value which had once belonged to Nadir Shah.\n\nShahrukh, Mirza, \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0648\u062e \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627, was the fourth son of Amir Taimur and held the government of Khurasan at his father's death which took place in February, 1405 A.D. After the imprisonment of Sultan Khalil his nephew, ruler of Samarkand 1408 A.D., 811 A.H., he marched from Khurasan to take possession of his dominions. His authority was immediately acknowledged, not only in Samarkand, but over all Transoxiana. He was brave and generous, but not an ambitious prince: and during a reign of 42 years, we bear of no wars in which he was engaged, except with the Turkman tribes of Asia Minor whose power Taimur had overcome, but not destroyed. Mirza Shahrukh was born at Samarkand on the 21st July, 1371 A.D., 7th Rabti, 779 A.H., and died at Firdaws in the province of Rey, on the Persian new year's day, viz. Sunday, the 12th March, 1447 A.D., 26th Zil-hijja, 850 A.H., aged 71 lunar years. He reigned 42 years during which the conquests of his father in India seem to have remained in subjection to his authority. At his death he left 5 sons, viz., Mirza Ulugh Beg, Ibrahim Mirza, Mirza Baisanghar, Sayyurghamish and Muhammed Jugi. He was succeeded by his son Mirza Ulugh Beg.\n\nShahrukh Mirza, \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0648\u062e \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627, a descendant of Amir Taimur, was the son of Ibrahim Mirza, the son of Mirza Sulaiman ruler of Badakhshan. His mother's name was Muhtiar Khanum. About the year 1575 A.D., 983 A.H., he forcibly took possession of Badakhshan from his grandfather and reigned there about 10 years, after which in 1685 A.D., 993 A.H., that province was conquered by Abdullah Khan Uzbek, and Shahrukh compelled to fly to India, where he was kindly received by the emperor Akbar, who gave him his daughter Shakharaun-Nisa Begum in marriage in the year 1593 A.D., 1001 A.H. and raised him to the rank of an Amir of 6,000. In the time of Jahangir the rank of 7,000 was conferred on him. He died at Ujjain 1607 A.D., 1016 A.H., and was buried there.\n\nShahrukh Mirza or Mirza Shahrukh, \u0634\u0627\u067e\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627, who had a Jagir in Gujrat, was murdered by his younger brothers in the year 1032 A.H.\n\nShahryar, \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0631, a king of Persia of the Sassanian race, who reigned in Persia a few months in 629 A.D., vide Sheiroya.\n\nShahryar, Sultan, \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646, the youngest son of the emperor Jahangir, was married to a daughter of Nur Jahin Begum by her former husband Sher Afghani Khan. On the death of Jahangir in 1627 A.D., 1037 A.H., this prince who was then at Lahore, seized the royal treasure, bought over the troops, and forming a coalition\nwith the two sons of his uncle the late prince Daniil, marched out to oppose 'Asaf Khan the wazir, who had released prince Dwar Bakhsh surnamed Bulak, the son of Sultan Khosro from prison and proclaimed him king. The battle ended in Shahryar's defeat, he fled but being given up by his adjutants was imprisoned in the citadel. He was after three months put to death together with Dwar Bakhsh and the two sons of Daniil, named Tahmur and Hoshang by order of Shah Jahan who ascended the throne on the 4th February, 1628 A.D., 8th Jumada II, 1037 A.H.\n\nShah Sadr, \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0635\u062f\u0631, a Muhammedan saint whose tomb is situated at the foot of a large mound of Siwistan, at the distance of about 300 yards from the village of Lakki in Sindh which belongs to the Sayyida of that place. This famous saint, says Lutf-ullah in his Autobiography, originally came from Arabia, and brought thousands of infidels to the light of Islam from the darkness of idolatry in Sindh. The year of his death is not known, but his tomb was built here by order of Nadir Shah, king of Persia, in 1155 A.H. Tradition states, that Nadir in a dream was invited by this saint to come to Amarkote where he was to find a very large treasure. Nadir having acted upon the visionary command, discovered the treasure promised to him, and received a very large amount, as a tribute from the Amir of Sindh. Nadir then bestowed a large sum of money upon the Sayyida of the village, directed them to have the edifice built over the remains of the saint. They thus carried into execution, and the following inscription at the door of the shrine gives the date of its completion:\n\n\"I inquired of intellect the year of its date.\n\"Inspection informed me, It is the Paradise of the members of the sacred house.\"\n1742 A.D., 1155 A.H.\n\nAll Sayyida of Sindh that are called Lakki Sayyida, are, I am informed (says Lutf-ullah) the descendants of this saint, whose parentage ascends up to the Imam Ali Naki. I am therefore inclined to think that the word Lakki is a corruption of Naki, which is the name of the tenth Imam.\n\nShah Safi, \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0635\u0641\u06cc, grandson of Shah Abbas the Great, king of Persia. His father's name was Safi Mirza and his original name Bahram Mirza. He succeeded his grandfather in January, 1629 A.D., Jumada I, 1038 A.H. and took the title of Shah Safi. He was a capricious tyrant; and every year of his rule presented the same horrid and disgusting scene of barbarous cruelty. All the princes of the blood royal, and almost every minister, or general of family or character, were either put to death, or deprived of their eyes, by command of this monarch. He reigned nearly 14 years, died in May, 1642 A.D., Sahar, 1052 A.H., and was succeeded by his son, Abbas II.\n\nShah Sharafuddin, \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0634\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646, a Muhammedan saint who died in the year 1379 A.D., 761 A.H., and is buried in Behar, where his monument is still standing and is visited by the Muhammedans. There is an inscription in the Kufi character over the entrance to the dome, which however time has rendered illegible with the exception of the date of the death of the saint, and of the erection of the tomb in 1569 A.D., 977 A.H. The dargah is held in great veneration by the Muhammedans who at the Urs or anniversary of the death of the saint, assemble from all parts of the country, it is said to the number of 50,000. He is also called Makhdoom-ul-Mulk Shah Sharafuddin and Shaikh Sharif. The emperor Sikandar Shah the son of Bahlol Lodhi went to visit his tomb about the year 1495 A.D., 900 A.H., vide Sharafuddin Ahmad Ahia Maneri.\n\nShah Shuja', \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0634\u062c\u0627\u0639, Sultan of the Musaffarians whose capital was Shiraz. It is said that this prince was in such a manner plagued by a malady called Jau'l Bakar, or canine hunger, that he could not satisfy his hunger, neither on his journey, nor when he was at rest. He deprived his father Muhammad Musaffar of his sight in 1369 A.D., and held the reins of government in his own hands. His brother Shah Mahmud of Isfahan besieged Shiraz in 1364, took possession of that country and died before his brother in 1376 A.D., 9th Shawwal, 776 A.H. after a reign of 16 years. Shah Shuja' died on Sunday the 9th of October, 1384 A.D., 21st Shaban, 786 A.H. He was succeeded by his son Zainul Abidin, who on the approach of Amir Taimur to Shiraz retired to Tishdar, where his uncle Shah Mansur seized him and deprived him of his sight. Shiraz was bestowed by Amir Taimur on Shah Akbar the son of Muzaffar, but it was soon after taken by Shah Mansur, in whose possession it remained till it was retaken by the Safavids in 1503 A.D., 796 A.H. There is a garden near Shiraz called Haft-tan, which contains the remains of Shah Shuja', and has, on one side of it, a small building, ornamented with a variety of pictures.\n\nShah Sufi, \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0635\u0648\u0641\u06cc, a Muhammedan saint whose shrine is at a village called Stippur in the Pargana of Firozabad in Agra. It is related by the Khidims of the dargah that in the reign of the emperor Akbar, Shah Sufi a fakir of some celebrity wandered from Isfahan to India, and took up his hermitage among the Jamna ravines near the city of Chandwar, then the county town of the Pargana of the same name, and which from the remains which still cover the surrounding country for miles\u2014ruined mosques, dilapidated octagon mausolea, fallen entrance gates and such like works of costly strength, must have been an important post in a fiscal and military point of view. All the time from which the fable of Shah Sufi's miracles commences, Raja Chandarsen was the lord of the fort of Chandwar, and a troublesome tributary of the Delhi court. Non-compliance with the royal demands for payment of revenue, brought upon the raja the investment of his fort by the army of Akbar, who is said to have commanded his forces to pause, and to have proceeded his attack with the approach to success for a period, which the credulous or imposing Khidims of the establishment have exalted into a term of ten years. In the language of Oriental metaphor, the emperor is said to have planted a mango tree on the commencement of the siege, and to have eaten the fruit of it, ere his success was secured. This success he owed to the anchorite of the ravines Shah Sufi. During a severe land storm, the lamps of the entire camp were put out, and the light of the Shah's hut alone glimmered in the surrounding darkness. This extraordinary fact led to the Shah's being\nvisited by some of the courtiers. The miraculous character of the event being much commented on by the visitors, the Shah acknowledged himself to be under the special favour of Heaven\u2014and in the end the conversation turned upon the difficulties of the siege, and the grateful sense of the hermit's interference which the sovereign would entertain in the event of its being brought to a close by his holy means. The Shah promised the required aid, and declared that the fort should be captured by a fixed day. Thus much for the emperor. In respect to the raja, the Shah acted very effectually upon his superstitious fears\u2014told him that the fort was destined to fall, and professed his own miraculous powers to secure for the raja, safe and sound, a retreat for himself, family, and valuables. The whole were accordingly possessed instantly through the besieging camp, and the raja quitted Hindust\u00e1n for the eastward. In return for this valuable service, the emperor bestowed half of an hamlet of Chandw\u00e1r on the Shah. The place assumed the name of Safipur, and has since been inhabited by the descendants of the Shah. The decease of Shah Safi took place soon after the grant was made, and he was buried on the brow of a deep ravine, a handsome tomb being erected over his remains. The mausoleum is still in good order and forms a picturesque object in the midst of the desolation of the Jamna ravines in the vicinity of Chandw\u00e1r and Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d. Its pretty dome and minarets commanding as they do, the heights of the Jamna ravines, often lead the voyagers on the river to visit the shrine of the saint, and landmark the building is an object of interest and beauty, which (say the natives) is reflected in Agra in a letter to the Commissioner of Revenue at Agra of 26th May, 1837, No. 125 all would regret to see lost to the country.

In 1656 he was employed by 'Alamgir (Aurangzeb) at that time viceroy of the Dakhin, to serve as lieutenant to his eldest son Sultan Muhammad in the war of Golkanda. In the contentions of Shah Jahan's sons for the throne in 1658, he served with Dara Shikoh, whom he betrayed by giving intelligence and guides of Aurangzeb.

He is called Shamgir by Daulat Shah.\n\nShamru, Samru or Sombre. His real name was Walter Reinhard, a person of obscure parentage in the Electorate of Treves. He entered early as a common soldier the service of the French, taking for his Nom-de-Guerre, Summer, which his comrades, from his saturnine complexion, turned into Sombre, and the Indians, by corruption, Samud. At length he repaired to Bengal, and enlisted in one of the Swiss Companies then employed at Calcutta; but at the end of eighteen days deserted to the French at Chandernagar, where he became a Sergeant. Deserting this post, he fled into the Upper Provinces and was for some time a private trooper in the cavalry of Safdar Jang, father to Shuja-ud-daula. This service he quitted, and led a vagabond life in different provinces; but in 1760 was with the rebel Faqirdar of Purnia Khadin Hussain Khan. Upon his being expelled from Bengal, Shamru left him and entered into the service of Gregory, an Armenian, then in high favour with Nawab Kasim Ali Khan and distinguished with the title of Gurgin Khan. From him he had the command of a battalion of sepoys, and afterwards obtained from the nawab the addition of another. In this station he massacred the English captives at Patna in 1763. Some time previous to the battle of Buxar, he treacherously delivered Kasim Ali with his corps, and embraced the cause of the Nawab Shuja-ud-daula, who had gained him over by bribes. Upon the nawab's defeat at Buxar, he was entrusted with the protection of the Begams, and remained with the nawab till he had made peace with the English; when, fearful of being delivered up to them, he retired to Agra, and entered into the pay of the Jat raja Jawahri Singh; but quitted him for the service of the raja of Jaipur, who soon dismissed him on a remonstrance from the English General. He then again served the Jats; quitted them once more, and came to Delhi, from whence he followed the fortunes of Nawab Najaf Khan, in whose service he died. Such are the outlines of the fortune of this man, who had some merit as a soldier, but wholly obscured by a treacherous and blood-thirsty disposition. His career was continued after his death, in the name of his son and a favourite concubine, who received for their maintenance the sum of 65,000 rupees per month. He died or was murdered in the year 1778 A.D., 1192 A.H., at Agra, where his tomb is to be seen in the Roman Catholic Burial-ground with a Persian inscription in verse, mentioning the year of his death and his name. Vide next article.\n\nShamru Begam, the celebrated princess of Sardhana, whose original name is Zeib-un-Nisa, was the wife, or rather concubine of Shamru or Sombre. She held an extensive jagir at Sardhana, and died on the 27th of January, 1836 A.D., 8th Shawwal, 1251 A.H., aged 88 lunar years. She was buried in the church of Sardhana of which she was the founder. She was one of the oldest and most sincere allies of the English. At her death she left upwards of six lakhs of rupees to various charitable and pious purposes, and gave instructions for founding a college for young men, to serve on the apostolic mission of Thibet and Hindustan. Captain Mundy in his \"Journal of a Tour in India,\" says that the history of her life, if properly known, would form a series of scenes, such as perhaps, no other female could have gone through.\n\nColonel Skinner had often, during his service with the Mahattas, seen her, then a beautiful young woman, leading on her troops to the attack in person, and displaying in the midst of carnage the greatest intrepidity and presence of mind. She became a convert to the fatal marriage in 1793. Her first lord, Reinhardt, who bought her when a young and handsome dancing girl; married, and converted her to the Roman Catholic religion. Her second husband was a French adventurer, a soldier of fortune named Levasseur who commanded her small army. It is of this man that the following anecdote is related, which is wondrous strange, if it be true. Skinner used to say that her husband had become possessed of wealth, power, and a numerous army; of these his ambitious wife coveted the undivided possession, and she then accomplished her purpose. A mutinous disposition, on the subject of pay, having manifested itself among his body-guard, the Begum, then about twenty-five, exaggerated the danger to her husband, and got intelligence conveyed to him that the rebels had formed a plan to seize and confine him, and to dishonour his wife. They, consequently, engaged a number of the best infantry of the soldiers, and at night, started secretly from their palace, in palankeens. Towards morning the attendants, in great alarm, announced that they were pursued; and our heroine, in well-feigned despair, vowed that, if their escort was overcome, she would stab herself to the heart. The devoted husband, as she expected, swore he would not survive her. Soon after, the pretended rebels came up, and after a short skirmish drove back the attendants, and forced the bearers to put down the palankeens. At this instant he (Sombre) heard a scream and his wife's female slave rushed up to him, and exclaimed that her mistress had stabbed herself to death. The husband, true to his vow, instantly seized a pistol, and blew out his own brains. His tomb is at Sardhana.\n\nShamsheir Bahadur I, an illegitimate offspring of the Peshwa Baji Rao Maratha by a Musalman concubine named Mastani, who brought him up in the Muhammadan religion. He was severely wounded in that famous battle which took place between the Marathas and Ahmad Shah Abdali in January, 1761 A.D., got to Dig where Sirdajal Jat had his wounds treated with the greatest care, but he died soon after, and was buried at Dig.\n\nShamsheir Bahadur II, Nawab of Banda, was the eldest son of Ali Bahadur, the son of Shamsheir Bahadur I, the son of Baji Rao Peshwa. He succeeded to the territories of his father in Bundelkhand about the year 1802 A.D., but subsequently a pension or stipend of four lacs of rupees annually was granted him in perpetuity by the British Government. He died on the 30th August, 1823 A.D., 24th Zil-Ka'da, 1238 A.H., and was succeeded by his brother Zulfiqar Ali Khan.\n\nShams Fakhri, a poet.\n\nShamsheir Khan, a nobleman at whose request a prose abridgement of the Shahnama of Ferdowsi was made by Tawakkul Munshi in 1652 A.D., 1063 A.H.\n\nShams Shahab Afif, the son of Malik Sad-ul-Mulk who was Amaldar of Abuhar and Dibapir in the reign of Sultan Ghayasuddin Tughlak. He was born the very day that Sultan Firoz Shah came into the world, i.e., in the year 1309 A.D., 709 A.H., and was the grandfather of Shams Siraj Afif, the author of the Tarikh Firoz Shah.\n\nShams Siraj Afif, the grandson of\nShams Shahab Affi, was an historian who flourished in the reign of Sultan Firoz Shah Barak, king of Delhi who reigned from 1351 to 1388 A.D. He is the author of the entire history of that monarch, called \"Tafikh Firoz Shahi,\" in which he relates that when that emperor built the city of Firozabad adjoining to that of (old) Delhi in the year 1354 A.D., 765 A.H., he (the author) was then twelve years of age, and that the red stone pillar in the Koshak of Firozabad near the mosque or Jama Masjid, was brought by that emperor in the same year with great expense and labour from a place called Naweira in the vicinity of Sitaura near Khairabad, a city situated on the foot of the hills about ninety-six distant from old Delhi where it then stood. The whole length of this pillar, says the author, was 32 gaz; 8 of which the king ordered to be buried in the earth or sunk in the building and the remaining 24 to be above the surface. This pillar was called by the emperor, \"Minar Zarrin,\" i.e., the Golden Minar. The second pillar which the emperor set up within his hunting place, called Shikargah Firoz Shah, was brought from Mirath, and was somewhat smaller than the one just mentioned. This pillar is now called the Lath of Firoz Shah. These two pillars were even at that period, as they are now, believed by the Hindus to have been the hand sticks of a famous hero of antiquity named Bhim Sen. The character engraved round these two pillars, the most intelligent and learned men of all religions were not able to decipher. He also observes that the high Minar in the Jama Masjid, called \"Kuwait-ul-Islam\" in (old) Delhi was built by Sultan Shams-uddin Altamsh.

It is supposed that the Kutb Minar in old Delhi, which is now commonly called the Lath of Kutb Shah because it stands close to the darwesh of the celebrated saint Khwaja Kutbuddin Bakhshiya Kaki, was built and completed by Sultan Shams-uddin Altamsh some time before the year 1236 A.D. A part of it was injured by lightning and was repaired and completed on the 26th October, 1501 A.D., 13th Rabii II, 907 A.H., by Fatha Khan Masmad 'Ali in the reign of Sultan Sikandar Shah Lodhi.\n\nShams-uddin Bahmani, Sultan, \u0634\u0645\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0647\u0645\u0646\u064a, the son of Sultan Mahmud Bahmani.

Fraser the British Commissioner of Delhi, on the evening of the 22nd March, 1835 A.D., for which act Karim Khan was hanged on the 26th August following, and subsequently the nawab, who after a full investigation of the case, being found guilty, was executed on the 8th of October of the same year at Delhi.

His estate included various villages, and at times three to ten lacs of rupees a year. The actual cause of his animosity towards Mr. Fraser and the reason which induced him to instigate his murder, will perhaps ever remain a mystery. The supposition is, that Mr. Fraser had, in the faithful discharge of his duty, apportioned to Am\u00ednuddin and Ziyyuddin, the younger brothers of the nawab, a part or whole of Lohari, an extensive estate, to which the latter considered himself the best entitled.\n\nShams-uddin Khwaja, Khwaja\n\nthe son of an Amir of Khawaf in Khurasan by name Khwaja 'Al\u00eduddin.

He was, they say, sentenced to be flayed alive, on account of his having raised a dead person to life. We are told that, after the law had been put in force, he wandered about, carrying his own skin, and solicited some food to appease his hunger; but he had been excommunicated as well as flayed, and no one would give him the slightest help. After four days he found a dead ox; but he could not obtain fire to dress it. Wearyed out with the unkindness of men, he desired the sun to boil his meat. It descended to perform the office; and the world was on the point of being consumed, when the holy Shaikh commanded the flaming orb to resume its station in the heavens.\n\nShams-uddin Purbi I, Shamsuddin Purbi I\n\nsurnamed Bhangeira.

His ancestors were \"Rafugurs\" or shawl-darners. At an early age he travelled to the Dakhin, where he obtained employment under the Nizam. He did not, however, remain long at Haidarabad; the reputed splendour of the court of Lakhnau brought him to Audh where he became a friend and uncle of celebrated Maulvi Ahsan, the residency Waki during the reign of Nasiruddin Haidar. On the accession of Muhammad Ali Shah to the throne in 1839 A.D., Maulvi Ahsan was advanced to the post of prime-minister, vice Hakim Mahdi, deceased, and Sharafuddaula was appointed residency Waki vice his uncle promoted. Maulvi Ahsan dying soon after, Sharafuddaula succeeded him as prime-minister. He held the office up to the time of Muhammad Ali Shah's death which took place in May, 1842 A.D., when Amjad Ali Shah succeeding to the throne, he nominated his favourite, Aminuddaula to the premiership, obliging Sharafuddaula to retire. By the Resident personally the nawab was so much esteemed that, after he lost office, he, the Resident, deemed him the fittest man in Lakhnau to manage the very responsible and important concerns of the Husainabad Dalmatia, of which he became the chief and made him \"Wadiqdar\" or stipendiary. Sharafuddaula was known by every one to be the most sincerely attached friend the British had in Audh. He was, therefore, looked upon with much jealousy and rancour by all the courtiers, but especially by Nawab Ali Naqi Khan, the father-in-law and prime-minister of Wajid Ali Shah the last king. Viewing him always as his rival, Ali Shah often contemplated his ruin, and at one time in league with Nawab Wasif Ali Khan, one of the famous abominables of the court of Lakhnau, he would have compassed his end, as he had succeeded in getting the king to issue an order of banishment against Sharafuddaula, with his whole family, but for the timely interference of the Resident who had the order revoked. During the early part of the rebellion (in 1857) the insurgents surrounded his house, insisting that he should become prime-minister of the rebel government. He refused and tried to excuse himself in every way, but they forcibly installed him in the office, which he knew he only nominally held, since Mammad Khan was the ruling spirit with them. Against him the arrival of General Havelock's force for the relief of the Lakhnau garrison, he was in the Kaiser Bagh and received a bullet in the shoulder. When the final grand attack was made on the city by the Commander-in-Chief, which caused the Begum and her party to remove to the Musa Bagh, Sharafuddaula took advantage of the confusion and skulked behind, and endeavoured to steal out of the city, when he was recognised by some sepoys, who bound him with cords, took him to Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah, who after starving him for four days had him put to death.\n\nSharif Jurjani, Mir or Sayyad, whose full name is Sayyad Sharif Ali bin Muhammad, is the author of the \"Hashia Kashshafi\" and \"Hashia Taqir Anwar-ut-Tauzil,\" also of an Arabic work on philosophy called \"Adab-ul-Sharif,\" and the marginal notes on the \"Sharah Matla-ul-Anwar\" and on the \"Mawakif Azdia\" a work on Jurisprudence in Arabic.

Some call her Mary and others Irene. The Greeks only describe her as a Roman by birth, a Christian by religion; but she is represented as the daughter of the emperor Maurice in\nShidi\n\nthe Persian and Turkish romances, which celebrated the love of Khusr\u00f3 for Shir\u00edn, of Shir\u00edn for Farh\u00e1d the most beautiful youth of the East. This celebrated beauty has been accused of giving those affections, which a monarch so anxiously sought, to the lowly Farh\u00e1d, in whose breast her beauties kindled a flame, which deprived him of reason and life. We are told that the son of Khusr\u00f3, after putting his father to death, sought the favours of his father's mistress; who appeared to consent, but desired to take one look at the remains of his father. The murdered body of her former lover was shown to her, and she immediately put an end to her existence by stabbing herself. *Vide* Farh\u00e1d.\n\nShidi, \u0634\u06cc\u062f\u06cc, an African.\n\nShidi Foulad Khan, \u0634\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u0641\u0648\u0644\u0627\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646, *vide* Foul\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n Shidi.\n\nShefta, \u0634\u0641\u062a\u0647, his proper title and name is Naw\u00e1b Must\u00e1fs Kh\u00e1n of Dehl\u00ed, the son of Naw\u00e1b Murt\u00e1z\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n.

After being twice banished by the king, he returned, and kindled fresh troubles for which he was scourged to death at Agr\u00e1h, by order of the king 1648 A.D., 955 A.H.

The price was an asper a bottle. One day, however, a stranger, passing by and observing the bloodshot eyes of the poet, stopped to purchase a bottle, and in paying for it laid down two aspers. \"I charge but one asper,\" said Shaikh\u00ed, \"did you not know that?\" \"Certainly, I know it,\" said the stranger, and therefore you see I give you a second.\" \"Give me my second!\" replied Shaikh\u00ed angrily, \"for what?\" \"To enable you to buy one of your own bottles, my friend,\" replied the other coolly, \"and curse yourself!\" The poet shrugged his shoulders and shut up his shop.

Those Muhammadans who assert the rights of \u2018\u00c1li, are called Sh\u00edas or Sh\u00edf\u00e9s or Sectaries, whilst those who consider the first three Khal\u00edf\u00e1s preceding \u2018\u00c1li as the rightful successors of Muhammed, are called Sunnis or Sannites or Traditionists.

However the Sultan after his accession to the throne of Dehli in 1289 A.D. sent for the poet, and having tied a rope round his own neck presented himself like a criminal before the king, who embraced him and made him one of his principal confidants.

Clive, subsequently made a secret treaty with Mir Ja'far, an officer of the Nawab, and advanced in June towards Murshidabad, the nawab's capital. On the 23rd of June, 1757 A.D., Clive fought the battle of Plassey against 18,000 horse and 50,000 infantry, and aided by the treachery of Mir Ja'far, routed the Nawab's troops. Sirajuddaula fled, but in a few days was seized and cruelly assassinated on the 4th July, 1757 Shawwal, 1170 A.H., by order of Miran the son of Mir Ja'far. Thus perished Sirajuddaula in the 30th year of his age and the 16th month of his reign.

The names of Shori, Sayyad Ali, Lemat, Sururis and Shamal occur also as commentators on Hafiz; but Sudi excels all as an enlightened and accurate critic, not only on account of his eminent success in correcting the exuberances of this fanciful and extravagant mode of interpretation, but of the singular happiness with which he has illustrated the ambiguous and more obsolete allusions of the Poet.\n\nSufi, a sect among the Muhammadans.

He was the grandson and successor of Muzaffar Jang, also called Muzaffar Husain Kh\u00e1n. This man, a British prot\u00e9g\u00e9, murdered sixty-two Englishmen, women, and children, during the insurrection of 1857, under circumstances of the most cold-blooded atrocity. After months of unavailing pursuit, Major Barrow, Commissioner of the district of Auh, to which he had fled, offered him his life provided he had himself committed no murders. The Naw\u00e1b surrendered, was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death. The Governor-General, however, while fully coinciding in the verdict, held that the word of a British officer must be maintained, declared the criminal innocent from the punishment of death, on the condition that he should immediately quit the British territory forever. If, ran the order, he accept this condition, he will be conveyed to the frontier as a convict under a Military guard and there set at liberty. If he refuse the condition, or if having accepted it, he shall break it, or attempt to break it, now, or at any future time, the capital sentence pronounced upon him will be carried out. The Naw\u00e1b elected to be sent to Mecca. Accordingly on the 23rd of May, 1859 A.D., he was taken to the Magistrate's office under a European Guard, and there fettered. He was allowed to see his children but not his wife. Two hundred men of the Fathag\u00e1h Levy were ordered to guard him to Bombay on his way to Mecca.\n\nTaftazani or Tuftasani, which is sometimes erroneously written Tught\u00e1z\u00e1n\u00ed, is the surname of an author who was called so from his birth-place, a city in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n.

Elliot in his \"Historians of India,\" calls it the \"Rauzat-us-Naf\u00e1,\" this is evidently a mistake, for that book was written by M\u00edr Kh\u00e1wand Sh\u00e1h who died in 1498 A.D.\n\nT\u00e1hir Wahid, Mirz\u00e1, son of Hussain Kh\u00e1n Kazwini, commonly called W\u00e1q\u00edr Naw\u00ed, the news-writer, was one of the greatest poets of the age.

The reign of this prince owed much of its celebrity to the truly royal and hospital reception he gave to the emperor Humay\u00fan 1543 A.D., when that monarch was forced to fly from India, and to take shelter in his dominions. All the messengers of the kingdom were called forth to do honour to the royal guest, and they were as liberally furnished to replace him upon his throne. Shah Tahmasp died at the age of 64 after a reign of more than 53 lunar years, on Tuesday the 15th of May, 1576 A.D., 15th Safar, 984 A.H. His fourth son Isma'il Mirz\u00e1 succeeded him.

He assumed the title of king of Persia after the confinement of his father by Mahm\u00fad the Afgh\u00e1n chief, and struggled a few years with his fate; but a weak, effeminate, and debauched youth was unsuited for such times: and he only merits a place in history, as his name furnished a pretext for the celebrated N\u00e1dir Kuli Kh\u00e1n to lay the foundations of his great power. He was confined at Sabzv\u00e1r in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and put to death by R\u00e1z\u00e1 Kuli Kh\u00e1n, the son of N\u00e1dir Shah who was then absent in his expedition to India in 1739 A.D., 1151 A.H.\n\nTahmasp Kuli, Mirz\u00e1, a Turk, and an excellent poet, who flourished in the time of the emperor Shah Jah\u00e1n, and wrote a beautiful chronogram consisting of nineteen verses in Persian on the marriage of the emperor's eldest son D\u00e1r\u00e1 Shikoh, each hemistich of which gives the year 1633 A.D., of the Hijra, 1043 A.H.\n\nTahmurs, commonly called Deoband or the Magician binder, a title which he derived from the success with which he warred against the enemies of his family.

He was captured in the jungles of Perona on the 7th and hanged on the 18th of April, 1859. It is said that before his death he solemnly affirmed that he was the instigator of the Cawnpore massacre, and that the Nana who had sworn to protect the Europeans was angry with him for his conduct and never saw him afterwards. If true, this confession was made evidently with the view of saving the Nana, when it would no longer injure himself. At his confession Tantia described himself as a Brahmin of high caste, a native of Puna, which place he had left about 30 years before for Central India, where he became an Artillery soldier (Topi). His next obtained employment in the Nana's establishment at Bithur in connection with the Treasury, and was so employed in 1857 when the mutiny broke out. He also said, that he commanded the rebel army of 9,000 men which attacked Colonel Greathed's column on the parade ground at Agra on the 10th October, 1857. He declared he was aware of the arrival of the column from Delhi before he opened fire on the encampment that morning, and did not suppose he had only the Agra brigade to deal with, as we imagined. He was deceived, however, after the action had commenced, by seeing a re-enforcement of European redcoats coming up (Greathed's men being dressed in Khaki) for whose appearance and apparent numbers (for they were reported to be 2,500 men) he could not account, but supposing them to be new arrivals from down-country, he immediately retreated; otherwise he would have held his ground, and not have allowed Col.

She was elevated on the throne of Persia some time after the death of her brother Sheiroya, 631 A.D. We are told by Persian historians that this queen restored the sacred cross, which had been borne away from Jerusalem by Khurso Parwez; and by that act, acquired great power with the Roman emperor. But this is evidently erroneous: for there is no doubt that the emperor Heraclius, when he returned from Persia, carried that precious relic to Constantinople, which was deemed a more splendid trophy of victory, than all his spoils and conquests. Taurandukht ruled Persia only one year and four months. She was succeeded by her cousin and lover Shah Shamsa. His son Rehmat Shah died in 1232 A.D., when he was deposed, and 'Amir or Arzandukht, another daughter of Khurso Parwez was raised to the throne 632 A.D. This princess, who was alike distinguished by her sense and beauty, resolved to take the whole management of the affairs of the kingdom into her hands. She would not even appoint a wazir. But the fatal passion of a Persian noble defeated all her designs. Farrukh Hurmuz the governor of Khurasan fell violently in love with her, or perhaps, with her dominions. He proceeded to court and made his love known to his royal mistress; she refused her hand, and he was soon after murdered through her instigation. As soon as his melancholy fate was known to his son Rustam, he collected a large army, and marched from Khurasan to Madain. The queen was unable to oppose him; and the young chief revenged his father by putting her to a cruel death. After this event, Rustam became the sovereign. Parwez, by a female singer of Isfahan was raised to the throne, but before he had reigned a month, his days were terminated by poison. Such were the events which immediately preceded the reign of Yezdijard III, and the fall of the Persian monarchy.\n\nTauran Shah, surnamed Malik-ul-Muazzim, was the brother of the famous Salah-uddin who had appointed him as his lieutenant in Damascus.

He was called Tughrai on account of his excellence in the species of writing styled Tughra, and also had the title of \"Honors of Writers,\" but better known in Europe by his admired Arabic poem, entitled \"Cantos of Tughrai.\" Being taken prisoner in a battle where his sovereign was defeated by his brother Mahmud, 1190 A.D., 574 A.H., he was put to death by that prince's wazir who hated him for his great abilities. A collection of the poems of Tughrai has been made, the most celebrated of which is that called \"Lama-ul-Ajam.\"\n\nTughrai, title of Amir Yemin-uddin of Alahhad, a poet and author of the Kulliat Tughra Mashhadi, a collection of poems, odes, elegies, &c., which also contains the following prose works, all of which are entertaining novels, viz.: \"Miftar-ul-Matfai,\" \"Kanz-ul-Maani,\" \"Maktab-ul-Ghafir,\" \"Chakhabar Feir,\" \"Zafar-ul-Nubank.\" He died at a place called Farcomud in 1324 A.D., 724 A.H.

Tughral Beg and his brother Jafar Beg Daud were in the service of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni. After defeating Sultan Masud I son of Sultan Mahmud in a battle fought in 1038 A.D., 429 A.H., he assumed the title and state of a sovereign at Naishapur. He subdued Irak, took Baghdad, and by its reduction, became master of the person of the Khalifa Al-Kaim Billah, who invested him as Sultan of Khurasan, appointed him viceregent or vicar of the holy prophet, and the lord of all Muhammedans. He gave his sister in marriage to the khalif, and his nephew Alp Arslan afterwards married the daughter of the khalif Al-Muktadi. The Saljuk family divided into three branches and settled in Hamdan, Kirman and Rum or Anatolia. Tughral Beg died after a reign of 26 lunar years 1063 A.D., 455 A.H., aged 70 lunar years, and as he had no issue, he was succeeded by his nephew Sultan Alp Arslan the son of Abu Jafar Daud. The following are the names of the Sultans of the Saljuk dynasty of Iran or Persia:\n\n1. Tughral Beg the son of Mikail the son of Saljuk.\n2. Alp Arslan, nephew of Tughral Beg.\n3. Malikshah the son of Alp Arslan.\n4. Barkayrak the son of Malikshah.

His brother Masud succeeded him.\n\nTughral III., a Sultan of the Saljukian family, was the son of Arsalan Shah the son of Sultan Muhammad the brother of Sultan Sanjar. After the death of Sultan Sanjar, 1167 A.D., 552 A.H., Persia continued, for a period of forty years, to be distracted with the wars of different branches of the Saljukian dynasty. The last who exercised power was Tughral III who succeeded his father Arsalan Shah in January, 1176 A.D., 571 A.H., and after a reign of ten years was seized and imprisoned by his uncle and wazir Kizal Arsalan, who resolved to usurp the throne, but fell by the hand of an assassin in 1191 A.D., 587 A.H., and the kingdom restored to Tughral. He was, however, after some years defeated in a battle, taken prisoner and executed by Takash ruler of Khwarizm, 1194 A.D., 590 A.H., and his head sent to Nasir the khalifa of Baghdad. With this prince terminated the Saljukian monarchs of Persia, who had governed that country, from the commencement of his reign of Tughral I to the death of Tughral III, 158 years.\n\nTughtasani, vide Tuftasani.\n\nTokaji Holkar, vide Takaji.\n\nTuktamish Khan, ruler of Dasht Kapchak whom Amir Timur defeated in 1395 A.D.\n\nTulshi Bai, widow of Jaswant Rao Holkar, vide Jaswant Rao Holkar.\n\nTulshi Das, a Brahman and a celebrated poet among the Hindus.

He beheaded Muslim, Husain's cousin, and his troops surrounded Husain at Karbala, who having desperately engaged his troops, was after long resistance cut to pieces with all his men in October, 680 A.D., Muharram, 61 A.H. In the reign of 'Abdulmalik, Ubeidullah was sent to Kufa with leave to plunder it for three days; but before he reached that city, Al-Mukhtar, then ruler of that place, sent his forces against him under the command of Ibrahim the son of Alashtar, when after a sharp engagement, Ubeidullah's forces were beaten and himself killed in the camp. Ibrahim having cut off his head, sent it to Al-Mukhtar, and burnt his body. This circumstance took place in August 686 A.D., Muharram, 67 A.H.\n\nUbeidullah-al-Mahdi, a chief of Barbary in Africa, who in 910 A.D., 298 A.H., rebelled against the king of that country of the race of Aghlab, and assumed the title of Khalif of Kairwan (the ancient Cyrenaica, and residence of the Aghlabite princes). To give the greater weight to his pretensions, he also took the surname of Al-Mahdi, the director. According to some, also, he pretended to be descended in a right line from 'Ali the son of Abu Talib, and Fatima the daughter of Muhammad; for which reason, the Arabs called him and his descendants Fatimites. He likewise encouraged himself and his followers by a traditional prophecy of Muhammad, that at the end of 300 years the sun should rise out of the West. Having at length driven the Aghlabites into Egypt, where they became known by the name of Maghribians, he extended his dominions in Africa and Sicily, making Kairwan the place of his residence. He sent several of his generals at different times to conquer Egypt, but they were always defeated and obliged to fly to Kairwan. Al-Mahdi reigned in Barbary 24 years, and was succeeded by his son Abu Kassim, who then took the surname of Al-Kayem Mahdi.\n\nUbeid Zakani, a celebrated jester and poet, was contemporary with the poet Salman Sawaij.

In his time the fort of Chittor was taken by the emperor Akbar in March, 1568 A.D., Shaban, 975 A.H. His son Rana Partap founded the new capital called Udaipur, which is still occupied by his descendants.

He reigned at Samarqand for 40 years during the lifetime of his father whom he succeeded in March, 1447 A.D., 851 A.H. He was a prince who made peaceful studies the chief object of his life, and had entirely neglected the art of war. He assembled all the astronomers of his kingdom, and the celebrated Tables which are known by his name, viz., \"Zij Ulagh Beg\" were the result of his labours. He is said to have had very large instruments for making his observations; particularly a quadrant as high as the church of Santa Sophia at Constantinople, which is 180 Roman feet. His fate was cruel, he was defeated, taken prisoner, and put to death by his son Mirz\u00e1 'Abdul Latif on the 27th of October, 1449 A.D., Ramaq\u00e1n, 859 A.H. It is not certain to show that this unnatural prince enjoyed the power he had attained, by so monstrous a crime; only for the short space of six months; he was slain by his own soldiers. Ulagh Beg's Catalogue of fixed stars rectified for 1434 A.D., was published by Hyde at Oxford in 1665 in 4to. with learned notes.\n\n'Umar-al-Maksus, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u06a9\u0633\u0648\u0633, the favourite master of the khal\u00edf Mu'aw\u00eda II, who after his father's death consulted him whether he ought or not to accept the khal\u00edfat. His master said that if he thought himself able to administer justice duly to the Musalm\u00e1ns, he ought to accept it; but otherwise he ought not to charge himself with it. This khal\u00edf had scarcely reigned six weeks, when he found himself too weak to sustain the weight of the government, and resolved to lay it down. This he did, and had no sooner renounced the khal\u00edfat, but he shut himself up in a chamber from whence he never stirred till he died, not long after his abdication, of the plague, according to some, and according to others of poison. The family of Umayya was so greatly irritated at his proceedings, that they vented their resentment upon the person of 'Umar-al-Maksus, whom they buried alive, because they supposed that it was by his advice that Mu'aw\u00eda deposed himself. This circumstance took place in the year 683 A.D., 64 A.H.\n\n'Umar bin-'Abdul Aziz, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632, grandson of Marw\u00e1n I, was the ninth khal\u00edf of the house of Umayya. He succeeded Sulaim\u00e1n at Damascus in September or October, 717 A.D., 99 A.H., and died after a reign of two years and some months in February, 720 A.D., 101 A.H., at Dyr Sam\u00e1n. He was succeeded by Yezid II. This khal\u00edf ('Umar 'Abdul Aziz) was eminent above all others for temperance and self-denial, insomuch, that according to the Muhammedan faith, he was raised to Muhammed's bosom, as a reward for his abstinence in an age of corruption.\n\n'Umar bin-'Abdul Aziz, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632, was an eminent Musalm\u00e1n who died in the year 742 A.D., 124 A.H.\n\n'Umar bin-'Abdul Aziz bin-Maja, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0627\u062c\u0629, commonly called Husam-ush-Shah\u00edd, author of most esteemed Commentary.

He succeeded Ab\u00fa Bakr Sad\u0131k as second khal\u00edfa after Muhammad in August, 634 A.D., Jum\u00e1da II, 13 A.H. He spread his conquests over Syria and Phoenicia, and took Jerusalem after an obstinate siege in 637 A.D., 16 A.H. His generals extended his conquests over Persia and Egypt and increased the worshippers of Muhammad. The fall of Alexandria under his power was marked by the destruction of its celebrated library, but he restored the canal between the Nile and the Red Sea. During his reign the Muhammedans conquered 36,000 towns, destroyed, 4,000 Christian temples, and built 1,400 mosques. He was the first who was called \"Amir-ul-Momin\u00edn\" or the Lord of the Believers, and this title was ever afterwards used by all succeeding khal\u00edf\u00e9s. He was married seven times, and one of his wives was Umm Kulth\u00fcm, the daughter of 'Ali. He was stabbed on Wednesday the 3rd of November, 644 A.D., 26th Zilhijjah, 23 A.H., by a Persian slave named Firuz whilst saying his morning prayers in a mosque, and died three days after, aged 63 lunar years. He reigned 10 years 6 months and 8 days, and was succeeded in the khal\u00edfat by 'Usm\u00e1n the son of 'Aff\u00e1n. Waring in his \"Tour to Shir\u00e1z,\" mentions that while he was at Shir\u00e1z (1802 A.D.), the Persians (who are Shias) celebrated the death of the khal\u00edf 'Umar. \"They erected a large platform, on which they fixed an image, disfigured and deformed as much as possible. Addressing themselves to the image, they began to revile it for having supplanted 'Ali the lawful successor of Muhammad; at length having exhausted all their expressions of abuse, they suddenly attacked the image with stones and sticks, until they had shattered it into pieces. The inside was hollow, and full of sweetmeats, which were greedily devoured by the mob who attended the ceremony.\"\n\n'Umar Khan Khilji, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u062c\u064a, the youngest son of Sult\u00e1n 'Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Khilji a boy of seven years of age, was raised to the throne of Delhi after the death of his father, by Malik K\u00e1f\u00fcr the eunuch, in December, 1316 A.D., Shawwal, 716 A.H. Malik K\u00e1f\u00fcr was assassinated after 30 days and soon after 'Umar Kh\u00e1n was deposed by his brother Mubarak Kh\u00e1n who ascended the throne in January, 1317 A.D., 716 A.H.\n\n'Umar Khayam, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062e\u06cc\u0627\u0645, He was originally a tent-maker and hence his takhallus of Khay\u00e1m. He is held to be one of the most remarkable of Persian poets, unprecedented in regard to the freedom of his religious opinions. The Voltaire of Persia, his works gave great offence to the priests, but are, nevertheless, highly esteemed by general readers, apparently with justice, as the animation and brilliancy of his style are unquestionable. His hatred of hypocrisy and the tricks of false devotees, appears his crime in the eyes of the supposed pious; his tolerance of other creeds was looked upon with equal suspicion and dislike. He was born at Naishapur, and devoted much of his time to the study of astronomy, of which science he was a distinguished professor; but it is said that, instead of his studies leading him to the acknowledgment of the Supreme Being, it prompted his disbelief. The result of his reflections on this important subject is given in a poem of his, much celebrated under the title of \"Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of 'Umar Khayam.\" He was the friend of Hase\u00e9 Sabb\u00e1h, the leader of the sect of the Assassins, and, it has been conjectured, assisted him in the establishment of his diabolical doctrine and followership. Some allowance must, however, be made for the prejudices of his historians, who would, of course, neglect\nnothing calculated to cast odium on one so inimical to their superstitions. 'Umar Khay\u00e1m seems particularly to direct his satire against the mysticism of Mawlawi, the most exalted poet of his time, though inferior in this extraordinary and incomprehensible style to the later followers of the same school, Att\u00e1r and 'Abd al-Gh\u00e1fiq. However reprehensible his mockery would be if really directed against religion in general, it scarcely deserves the severity it met with when we consider that it was the abuses he attacked and the absurdities he ridiculed; and as for the incongruities introduced into his poems, and his professed love of pleasure, he is only following or rather pointing out as absurd, the contradictions of the mystic poets, which are difficult enough to reconcile to the understanding, whether allegorical or not. The following will give an idea of the style of 'Umar Khay\u00e1m:\n\n\"Ah! ye who long that, in time's coming night\nYour names should shine in characters of light,\nLet not this duty ever be forgot;\u2014\nLove well your neighbour; do him no despite.\"\n\n\"Ah! strive your best no human heart to wring,\nLet no one feel your anger burn or sting;\nWould you be wrapped in everlasting joy,\nLearn how to suffer, and cause no suffering.\"\n\nSome English versions of the Quatrains by Mr. Edward Fitzgerald have been published by Quaritch of London. 'Umar Khay\u00e1m was contemporaneous with Hasan Sabbah, Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk wa\u1e63ir of Malikh\u0101n, and Mav\u1e63\u00e1li the poet. Khus\u0101gho in his Tazkira has recorded the year of 'Umar Khay\u00e1m's death 1128 A.D., 517 A.H., and this appears to be correct. Wajid 'Ali in his Matla-ul-Ulum says that he died in 1121 A.D., 615 A.H.\n\n'Umar Mahrami, author of a work called \"Hujjatul-Hind,\" written in 1646 A.D.\n\n'Umar Mirza, one of the sons of Mir\u00e1nsh\u00e1h the son of Amir Taim\u00far.

He died after a reign of 26 lunar years and 2 months on Monday the 5th of Rabi', 1494 A.D., 898 A.H., from the fall of a scaffold upon which he stood to see his pigeons flying; aged 39 lunar years.

Four hundred and twenty-one poems, besides all the students of the university of Ghazni acknowledged him for their master. Among the works of 'Unsari there is an heroic poem upon the actions of Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad. The king one night in a debauch having cut off the long tresses of his favourite slave, Ayas, was much\nUnsi\n\nconcerned in the morning for what he had done.

His corpse lay unburied for three days; at last it was removed bloody at it was, and buried in the same clothes he was killed in, without so much as being washed, and without the least funeral solemnity. The dissensions which arose on the death of the Prophet, with regard to the succession to the Khil\u00e1fat, were revived with renewed fury when, on the murder of 'Usm\u00e1n, the noble and unfortunate 'Ali succeeded to the dignity of Amir-ul-Mom\u00edn\u00edn; and they eventually caused the division of Islam into two great parties or sects, called respectively the Sunnis, and the Shiites who differ materially in the interpretation of the Kur\u00e1n, and in admitting or rejecting various portions of the oral law. The animosity entertained between these rival sects has been the cause of constant religious wars and persecutions scarcely to be surpassed in the history of any nation or creed, and still separate the followers of Muhammad into two classes, by a barrier more insurmountable than that which divides the Roman Catholic from the Protestant.\n\n'Usman bin-Issa bin-Ibrahim Sad\u0131k, \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0625\u0633\u062d\u0627\u0642 \u0628\u0646 \u0625\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0635\u062f\u064a\u0642, author of a collection of traditions in Arabic called \"Gh\u00e1\u00e9et-ut-Touzih.\"\n'Usman Mukhtari, a poet who flourished in the reign of Sultan Thirum of Ghazni and was a contemporary of Sheikh Sanai the poet.\n\n'Utba, the son of Abu Lahab.

After he had extinguished his rival Jafar Shah, the son of Kard Yezdan in 1478 A.D., and put all his relations to death, he engaged in a war with Sultan Abdul Sajid Mirza king of Persia who fell into his hands and was slain 1449 A.D. Uzzan Hasan from this event, became sovereign of a great part of the dominions of the house of Taimur. After he had made himself master of Persia, he turned his arms in the direction of Turkey; but his career of greatness was arrested by the superior genius of the Turkish emperor, Muhammad II, from whom he suffered a signal defeat, which terminated his schemes of ambition. He died after a reign of eleven years at the age of seventy on the 7th of December, 1477 A.D., 882 A.H. Catherine Comnenus, who is called by the Persians Carum Comnenus, was married to him. She had a daughter named Martha, married to Shaikh Haidar, father of Shah Ismail Safvi, first monarch of the Safavid dynasty of Persia. Uzzan Hasan was succeeded by his son Yakub Beg.\n\nV.\n\nVictoria Gaurama, Princess.\n\nThe Princess Victoria Gaurama is daughter of his Highness Prince Bir Rajindar Wader, ex-raja of Kurg (Coorg), a small principality of Hindustan, situated near the Mysore country; its greatest length is about seventy miles, and the most breadth about seventy-five miles. Haidar Ali continued in the middle of the last century, to get possession of Kurg by treachery; but in 1787 the young raja, Bir Rajindar, his prisoner, escaped from confinement through the aid of several of his subjects and succeeded in establishing himself in his dominions. At his death, in 1808, he left the succession to an infant daughter, to the exclusion of his brother, to whom of right it belonged according to ancient usages; but the young princess soon after abdicated in favor of her uncle, with the sanction of the British Government.\n\nThe Princess Victoria Gaurama was born in February 1841. The most likely circumstance of the death of the mother, two days after the birth of the child, seems to have led to increased affection for his offspring on the part of the father, who from his own previous convictions in favor of Christianity, determined that his favorite daughter should be brought up in the principles of the Christian faith. From this period the ex-raja entertained an anxious desire to visit Europe, in order that, when she had arrived at a suitable age, she might be introduced into European society; and thereby receive such impressions as would promote a feeling favourable to Christianity. Accordingly in the early part of 1862, the prince quitted India for England, leaving at the city of Benares the rest of his family, consisting of eleven children, with their mothers. On his arrival in England the object of his visit was made known to the Queen, who at once most kindly and graciously consented to become sponsor to the young princess. The baptismal ceremonies were performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 30th June, 1862, in the presence of Her Majesty, the Prince Consort, and numerous other members of the royal family; the princess received the prefix of \"Victoria\" to her Indian name of \"Gaurama,\" by which she had been called after one of the pagan divinities of her country.\n\nThe princess is said to have become a good scholar under the care of those charged with her education. Her personal appearance was exceedingly interesting and intelligent, and the complexion of her skin but little darker than that what Europeans call a deep brunette. Her portrait, which Winterhalter painted by command of Her Majesty, is at Buckingham Palace.\u2014The Art Journal, Vol. III, p. 293.\n\nVikramaditya, commonly called Bikramjit, which see.\n\nW.\n\nWa'il Khusai', an Arabian poet who lived in the time of Harun-al-Rashid and his son Mamun.

This monarch is represented by Persian historians, to have been a cruel prince, and we are told, the nation rejoiced when he was killed by the kick of a horse. He died after a reign of 16 years, and was succeeded by his son Bahram V.\n\nYezdijard II, \u064a\u0632\u062f\u062c\u0631\u062f, (the Idigertes II of the Romans), succeeded his father Bahram V to the throne of Persia 438 A.D.

He is the Isdigertes III of the Greeks, and a contemporary of 'Umar the Khalif of Arabia. This prince who appears to have been as weak as he was unfortunate, sat upon the throne only nine years; that being the period from his elevation to the battle of Nahawand which decided the fate of Persia, and which from its date 641 A.D., fell under the dominion of the Arabian Khalifs. For a period of ten years afterwards this monarch was a fugitive, possessed no power whatever. He first fled to Sistan, then to Khurasan, and lastly, to Marv where he was murdered 651 A.D. 31 A.H. He was the last sovereign of the house of S\u0101s\u0101n, a dynasty which ruled Persia for 416 years, and is from the commencement of his reign, that the Persian Era, which is still used to this day in Persia, is called after him the Era of Yezdijurd. It began on Tuesday the 16th of June, 632 A.D., 29th Rab\u012b' I, 11 A.H. being only eight days after Muhammad's death.\n\nYezid, \u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0633\u0641\u064a\u0627\u0646, the son of Ab\u016b Sufi\u0101n. He died by the plague that raged in Syria in the year 639 A.D. The mortality both among men and beasts was so terrible, that the Arabs call that year \"Am-ul-r\u0101mada,\" or the year of destruction. By this pestilence the Saracens lost 26,000 men, among whom were Ab\u016b 'Obeida, general of the Saracen army at Syria, Sarjab\u012bl, ibn-Hasana formerly Muhammad's secretary, and Yezid ibn-Sufi\u0101n.\n\nYezid I, \u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629, the son of Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya and the second Khalif of the house of Umayya. His inauguration was performed at Damascus on the same day that his father died, etc., on the new moon of the month of Rajab, corresponding with the 7th of April, 680 A.D., 1st Rajab, 60 A.H. He was a man of considerable taste and refinement, an eloquent orator, and an admired poet. Some specimens of his composition, which are still extant, display no ordinary powers of mind. The first and the last lines of the ode with which the bard of Persia, the celebrated H\u0101fiz, opens his magnificent Diw\u0101n, are borrowed from Yezid. It was once sarcastically asked of H\u0101fiz, \"How could a distinguished poet like yourself stoop to borrow from Yezid, who was not only a usurper, but also the murderer of Im\u0101m Husain?\" He answered, \"Which of you, seeing a dog running away with a diamond, would not save the brute, and rescue the jewel from its unequal mouth?\" By Persian authors, Yezid is never mentioned without sarcasm; consequently this malediction is added to his name, \"Lanat-ullah,\" that is, the curse of God be upon him;\" in reference not to his vices, but to the death of Husain, the son of 'Al\u012b, whom he first of all attempted to destroy by poison, and afterwards caused to be killed, with all his family, on the plains of Karbala. Under his khilafat the Musalmans conquered all Khur\u0101s\u0101n and Khw\u0101rizm, and put the territories of the princes of Samarkand under contribution. The motto of his seal was, \"God is our Lord.\" Yezid died on the 31st of October, 683 A.D., 4th Rab\u012b' I, 64 A.H. in the 39th year of his age, after he had reigned three years and eight months, and was succeeded by his son Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya II. His mother's name was Maisana a Bedouin of the tribe of Ka\u02bfb\u012b.\n\nYezid was a debauchee and is represented by Moallem writers as an Atheist.\n\nYezid II, \u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643, the ninth Khalif of the race of Umayya, was the son of the Khalif 'Abdulmalik. He succeeded 'Umar the son of 'Abdul Az\u012bz in 720 A.D., 101 A.H. in Syria, and died after a reign of four years, 724 A.D., 105 A.H.

Amongst other works, he wrote the \"I\u02bflal-al-Had\u012bs,\" the \"Ikh-til\u0101f-al-Had\u012bs,\" and the \"J\u0101ma-al-Kab\u012br.\" He is said to have made forty-five pilgrimages to Mecca, and fifty-four Umrats when he merely visited the sacred city, and to have written the surprising number of 1,000 volumes, controverting the opponents of the Sh\u012b\u02bfite doctrines. He died at Madina in 823 A.D., 208 A.H.\n\nYusaf of Ahmadabad, \u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641 \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0628\u0627\u062f\u06cc, author of an Arabic work on Theology called, \"Ak\u1e63ad Yusaf.\"\n\nYusaf, \u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641, author of a collection of letters called \"Baday\u016bl Insha\" or wonders of letter writing.

He ascended the throne of Granada in the year 1333, and his personal appearance and mental qualities were such as to win all hearts. He established schools in all the villages, with simple and uniform systems of education; he obliged every hamlet of more than twelve houses to have a mosque, and prohibited various abuses and indecorums, that had been introduced into the ceremonies of religion and the festivals and public amusements of the people. His attention was also directed towards finishing the great architectural works commenced by his predecessors, and erecting others on his own plans. The Alhambra, which had been founded by the good Muhammad ibn-Alhamar, was now completed. He constructed the beautiful gate of Justice, forming the grand entrance to the fortress, which he finished in 1348. He likewise adorned the courts and halls of the palace, as may be seen by the inscriptions on the walls, in which his name repeatedly occurs. In the year 1354, as he was one day praying in the royal mosque of the Alhambra, a maniac rushed suddenly from behind, and plunged a dagger in his side. He was borne to the royal apartments, but expired almost immediately. The murderer was cut to pieces, and his limbs burnt in public, to gratify the fury of the populace.\n\nYusaf Adil Shah, \u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641 \u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644 \u0634\u0627\u0647, whose original name was Yusaf 'Adil Kh\u0101n, was the founder of the 'Adil Sh\u0101hi dynasty of Bij\u0101pur. He was a nobleman in the service of Muhammad Sh\u0101h II Bahmani, king of the Dakhin. When the Sultan left this world, and dissensions began to prevail in the kingdom, most of the foreign officers and soldiers were thrown to Yusaf Adil Kh\u0101n, who seeing the minister of Sh\u0101h Mahm\u016bd II, the successor of the late king bent on his destruction, withdrew himself from Ahmad\u0101bh\u0101d, with his family and followers, to his government of Bij\u0101pur, and resolving to become the founder of a kingdom, he began to add to his territories by conquest. In the year 1489 A.D., 895 A.H., he, with the assent of Malik Ahmad Bahri, assumed the title of Sh\u0101h, and read the khutba of Bij\u0101pur in his own name.

The introduction of the Muhammadan faith into Multan, says Firuzi, first took place in the latter part of the first century of the Hijra, about the year 700 A.D. by the conquest of that country by Muhammad Kasim, after whom, until the reign of Sulj\u00e1n Mahmud of Ghazni, no account is to be traced of its history. Mahmud conquered Multan from the infidels; but on the decline of the Ghazni power, the inhabitants succeeded in expelling the Muhammadans, and establishing a separate government. From the period of its subjugation by Muhammad Ghori, it remained tributary to Delhi until the year 1448 A.D., 847 A.H. when the governor of that province like most others of the kingdom at the same period, declared independence. After which time several princes reigned in succession. The first of these was one Shaikh Yusaf a man of learning, wisdom and high character, of the tribe of Qureshi, whom the inhabitants of Multan selected to be ruler over the people of Multan and Uchcha, when the public funds were reaped and money coined in his name.

The edifice is a magnificent one about 200 yards long by 30 broad, built of baked bricks and mortar. The whole site is roofed with 100 domes, every one of them painted in a different style from another.

His territories were seized, and he was compelled to make his escape to Shuja-uddaula the nawab of Audh. But not long after, the Marhattas obliged the emperor to confer on Zabita Khan, the rank of Amir-ul-Umr\u00e1, and to restore him the grant of almost all the districts of which he had only a few months before been deprived by their assistance. Zabita Khan was the father of that traitor, Ghulam R\u00e1d\u00ed Khan, who subsequently blinded the emperor Shah 'Alam.

Some say he was an Arabian, but descended from Kyomur; others trace his descent to Shaddad, and term him a Syrian; and it has even been conjectured that he was the Astyages of the Greeks. All agree in one fact, that he was of a cruel and sanguinary temper. He is described as having had two dreadful cancers on his shoulders, which the Persian fabulists have changed into snakes, whose hunger nothing could appease but the brains of human beings: two of his subjects were slain daily to furnish the horrid meal: till the manly indignation of Kawwa or Gawa a blacksmith of Falak, whose two sons were the only hopes of being sacrificed, relieved the empire from this tyrant, and raised Farisidin, the princes of the Pishdadian dynasty to the throne.

On the accession of Bahadur Shah in the year 1707 A.D., 1119 A.H. the title of Amir-ul-Umra was conferred on him with the government of the Dakhin. It was by his aid and intrigues that Jahandar Shah, after the death of his father Bahadur Shah, overcame all his brothers and ascended the throne of Delhi, when he was appointed to be chief Vazir; but after the defeat of that emperor in the battle against Farrukh-siyar, he was taken up and strangled by order of the latter as a punishment for his conduct. His head with that of the late emperor Jahandar Shah who had also been put to death in prison, were placed on poles, and their bodies hung forth for upwards across an elephant, were exposed in the new emperor's train when he made his triumphant entry to the palace of Delhi. This event took place in January, 1716 A.D., Zil-hijjah, 1124 A.H.
