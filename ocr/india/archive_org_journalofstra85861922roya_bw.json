Winstedt (Vice-President for Singapore) in the chair and 26 other members.\n\n1. The Minutes of the Annual General Meeting of 11th February 1921 were confirmed.\n\n2. The Minutes of the General Meeting held 1st July 1921 were read and confirmed.\n\n3. The Annual Report and Statement of Payments and Receipts were adopted on the motion of Mr. H. C. Robinson, seconded by Mr. C. L. Collenette.\n\n4. The Chairman proposed for confirmation, and Mr. Burkill seconded, that Rule 1 be rescinded and the following substituted:\n\n\"The name of the Society shall be 'The Malayan Branch, Royal Asiatic Society'.\"\n\nThis was confirmed unanimously; the change in name to take effect from 1st January 1923.\n\n5. The Chairman proposed for confirmation, and Major Moulton seconded, that Rule 8 be amended as to the first four lines by the substitution of the following words:\n\n\"The Officers of the Society shall be:\n\n\"A President,\n\n\"Vice-Presidents not exceeding six, ordinarily two each from (i) the Straits Settlements, (ii) the F. M. S., and (iii) the Unfederated or other Protected States, although this allocation shall in no way be binding on the electors.\"\n\nThe Resolution was confirmed with one dissentient.\n6. H. H. the Sultan of Johore K.C.M.G., K.B.E. was elected an Honorary Member.\n\n7.

Votes of thanks to Mr. See Tiong Wah for auditing the Society's accounts, to Dr. Lim Boon Keng, O.B.E. for his services on the Council, and to the retiring Council, were passed.\n\n9. The Chairman then gave an interesting lecture on the Antiquities of Malaya, after which Mr. Robinson proposed, and Mr. Amery seconded, a hearty vote of thanks to the lecturer, at the same time expressing a hope that the paper would be printed in the Society's Journal.\n\nAnnual Dinner.\n\nBy kind permission of the Committee of the Singapore Club a dinner was held at that Club on Friday 10th February 1922 at 8.15 p.m.\n\nH. E. the Governor, as Patron of the Society, accompanied by Mr. R. B. Osborne, Private Secretary, and Mr. Foulger A.D.C. was present as the guest of the evening. Sir J. W. Murison, the retiring President, took the chair. Covers were laid for 35. Besides those mentioned, the following Members were present:\u2014 Messrs. C. L. Collenette, H. C. Robinson, W. J. Cullen, Seah Liang Seah, Seah Eng Tong, J. O'May, A. F. Richards, I. H. Burkill, A. Cavendish, W. Lowther Kemp, Drs. A. L. Hoops, F. W. Foxworthy and R. O. Winstedt, Messrs. H. Robinson, E. T. Williams, B. Nunn, C. E. Wurtzburg, J. I. Miller, D. Santry, C. Bazell, W. P. Plummer, J. R. Lynch, A. J. Amery, F. G. Bourne, L. J. Hayes, H. D. Mundell, A. G. Bratton, J. C. Moulton and three guests.\nAfter the usual loyal toast the Chairman proposed the health of H. E. the Governor, who responded in a happy speech emphasizing the importance of the occasion due to the change in the Society's name inaugurated that very day. H. E. referred in eulogistic terms to the valuable work done for the Society by the two Vice-Presidents Dr. Winstedt and Mr. Robinson. In conclusion he gave a two-fold toast: \"to the Straits Branch, Royal Asiatic Society, Vale; to the Malayan Branch, Royal Asiatic Society, Ave,\" and to the latter he added \"Floreat, florebit.\"\n\nDr. Winstedt and Mr. Robinson replied on behalf of the Society.\n\nThe Company then adjourned to the billiard and card rooms where the remainder of the evening passed pleasantly.\nAnnual Report\n\nof the\n\nStraits Branch, Royal Asiatic Society,\n\nfor 1921.\n\nMembership. The membership of the Society at the close of the year stands at 463, as compared with a total of 329 at the end of 1920. There are 14 Honorary Members, 4 Corresponding Members and 445 Ordinary Members.\n\nDuring the year 153 new members were elected by the Council. This is more than double the highest number of new members ever added in any one year (viz. 73 in 1910), and nearly treble the number who joined during 1920. The Council regard this sign of wider interest in the Society as highly satisfactory and reflecting great credit on several energetic members who have been so successful in interesting many in the work of the Society. In addition to many new Members from the Straits Settlements and the F. M. S., several resident in British North Borneo, Sarawak and the Federated States (particularly Kedah) joined the Society.\n\nThe names of the new members elected during the year are:\n\nHONORARY MEMBERS.\n\nProf. Dr. Renward Brandstetter\nThe Sultan of Perak, K.C.M.G.\n\nProf. Dr. Snouck-Hurgronje\nDr. Ph.

Williams  \nDr. W. B. Wilson, M.C.  \nMr. C. E. Wurtzburg, M.C.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. W. Shellabear was elected an Honorary Member of the Society. He joined the Society in 1894, served for several years on the Council and was President from 1914-15.\n\nThe death of the Rev. R. G. Lawes, an Honorary Member since 1883 was reported during the year.\n\nAmong Ordinary Members the Society lost 15 by resignation during the year, of whom 6 were removed under Rule 6.\n\nCouncil. Mr. C. Boden Kloss, Vice-President for the F. M. S. went on leave in June; the Hon. Mr. W. G. Maxwell, C.M.G. was co-opted in his place. The Hon. Dr. Lim Boon Keng, O.B.E. and Mr. J. E. Nathan left the country during the latter half of the year; Messrs. B. Nunn and A. G. Bratton were co-opted to fill their places on the Council.\n\nGeneral Meetings. The Annual General Meeting was held on the 11th February followed by a dinner at the Singapore Club attended by 30 Members and their friends. It is hoped to make this a regular feature of the Annual meeting.\n\nThe General Meeting held on the 1st July, was noteworthy for two reasons:\n\nIn the first place it marked a first attempt to revive the holding of meetings for the purpose of reading and discussing papers. These meetings were held frequently in the early days of the Society: thus 9 general meetings were held and 22 papers read during the first year of the Society (1878), followed by 6 meetings and 8 papers in 1879. But in 1881 only one general meeting was held: the difficulty of forming a quorum proved too great. No mention is made in the Annual Reports of the Society of any similar meetings having been held since, with the exception of one in June 1890. At this \"revival\" meeting in July, 1921, Mr. C. N. Maxwell contributed a paper on Malayan Fishes, and Mr. Colletette one on the enemies of butterflies. Although the majority of the Members reside away from Singapore, it is hoped to arrange more meetings of this nature from time to time, as the experiment was evidently appreciated.\nChange of Name. At the July meeting the important question of changing the Society's name was definitely put to the vote. In April a circular was sent to all members mentioning the proposal to change the name of the Society from the \"Straits Branch\" to the \"Malayan Branch\" of the Royal Asiatic Society.\" Arguments for and against were briefly discussed; members were invited to reply by postcard stating whether they were in favour of the change or not. The result of this informal ballot was 159 members in favour and 17 against the proposed change.\n\nAt the July meeting the following proposal was carried unanimously:\n\n\"That Rule 1 be rescinded and the following substituted:\n\n\"The name of the Society shall be 'The Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society'.\"\n\nThe Resolution is subject to confirmation at the Annual General Meeting to be held in February, 1922.\n\nFranking Privileges. The privilege of free postage for the Society's publications and correspondence addressed to places in the Straits Settlements has now been extended to the F. M. S., the four Unfederated States, and Brunei, whose Governments have kindly agreed to accept the Hon. Secretary's frank. This concession will result in a considerable reduction of our postage expenses.\n\nJournals. Three Journals were issued for the year. No. 83 appeared in April, a general number of 173 pages. A Special number with only a limited number of copies was published in September. This is devoted to a very important Flora of Borneo by Dr. E. D. Merrill, Director of the Bureau of Science, Manila. It fills 637 pages, took 3 years to print and cost the Society $2,870. The Council decided to issue this Journal only to such members who cared to ask for it, as it was thought that the contents being somewhat of a technical nature would not interest all members of the Society.\n\nNo. 84 was printed by the end of the year, but owing to an unfortunate delay over the illustrations, could not be issued until January, 1922. It is devoted to an article by Mr. C. N. Maxwell on Malayan Fishes, covering 102 pages, and illustrated by 72 plates. The total cost of this number is borne by the Department of Supplies for whom a special edition in an attractive cover has been printed off for sale.\n\nThirteen contributed papers to the Journal against twelve in 1920. The variety of subjects covered was well-maintained. Malayan folk-lore heads the list with eight papers from Dr. Winstedt. There were five Zoological papers, including three on mam-\nmals, one on fishes, and one on insects, one important botanical paper by Dr. Merrill already mentioned, one Malay vocabulary, one on Malay History, and other papers on such diverse subjects as Contraband, Chinese Marriages, Malay Studies, the late Odoardo Beccari. Altogether 21 papers were published against 25 in 1920.\n\nIt was pointed out in the last Report that the burden of authorship falls on too few. In the list of Members published in April an asterisk was placed against the name of all those who had ever contributed papers to the Society's Journal. 41 Members are thus distinguished.\n\nIt is hoped that with the big influx of new Members\u2014over 200 in the last two years\u2014the little band of authors will be considerably extended. The Journal now in preparation for issue early in 1922 contains papers from Members who have not hitherto supported the Society in this way. But more are required. Particular attention may be drawn to the need of short articles or notes, which formed such an attractive feature of the earlier Journals. The Society's field of work is wide, covering as it does the whole of the Malay Peninsula and neighbouring Malayan countries. Their history is as yet untold, their ethnological, zoological and botanical secrets still unravelled.\n\nFinances. The Hon. Treasurer's statement of accounts for the year 1921 shows credit balances carried forward to the total of $1,632.96 against $1,609.27 at the end of 1920. A large reserve had necessarily been built up during the last three years to meet the heavy cost of printing Dr. Merrill's important paper. To pay for this the Fixed Deposit of $2,000 was withdrawn, leaving our two investments (Victory Loan $2,500 and S. S. War Loan $2,200) untouched.\n\nThanks to the large addition of new Members the subscriptions for the year showed a considerable increase over those for the previous year: $1,490* against $1,130 for 1920. Ten Members compounded for life membership. The total number of Life Members is now 45, to which must be added 18 Honorary and Corresponding Members who pay no Subscriptions (although many of them have done so in the past before their election to the higher form of membership). The Council decided to set aside $2,500 (invested in Victory Loan) as a \"Life Members' Reserve.\" Receipts from sales of Journals and Maps, amounted to $949 against $765 in 1920.\n\nThe cost of printing remains abnormally high and no relief in this direction appears likely as yet. With larger membership however the Council hopes to maintain an annual output of 300 pages without recommending an increase in subscriptions.\n\n* The Hon. Treasurer's statement shows $1,690 received during the year. This includes $110 for arrears of subscriptions (1919 and 1920), and $90 for subscriptions paid in advance (1922-24).\nLibrary. 76 Institutions and Societies are now on the Society's Exchange List. From these and other sources 248 publications were received during the year.\n\nThe Council's policy of eliminating certain publications was continued.

P. Moquette.\n\n(Translated by Dr. R. O. Winstedt from the Journal of the Batavian Society, Vol. LIX, Part 6).\n\nIn the J. R. A. S., S. B., June 1918, pp. 47-48, Dr. R. O. Winstedt gave a description with photos of two grave-stones purporting to be from the tomb of Sultan Mansur Shah of Malacca.\n\nIt occurred to me at once that the two stones in no way matched, either in shape or ornament or workmanship. The head-stone undoubtedly once was placed on a tomb, while the other stone* belongs to the kind that lies on the ground. On all tombs and graves known to me head and foot stones correspond and it would be very strange if there were any departure from this custom at Malacca especially in the resting place of Sultan Mansur Shah. For the rest I could not learn much from the plates accompanying the article since the inscriptions, blackened for clearness, were thus made illegible.\n\nWinstedt gave readings of the inscriptions on the head-stone and on the sides of the stone from a version procured by Mr. Blagden from Hervey (op. cit. p. 47).\n\nI was certain that after the word Mansur should come the name of his father and that the date given was impossible, because (1) one word was not accounted for and (2) the Malay word dua seemed very strange in a purely Arabic inscription.\n\nFortunately I met Mr. I. H. Evans, Curator of the Taiping Museum, who promised to look up the stones for me at Singapore. Both the stones are in Raflles Museum and plaster-casts were made for me by Mr. Valentine Knight, then acting for Major Moulton the Director. Both, as shown in Dr. Winstedt's photos, are blackened. The head-stone has apparently been broken off the tomb, so that the inscription on the lowest line is damaged, and the other stone has a large round hole making the middle line of obverse and reverse illegible. As I am positive that the second stone neither came from the grave of Sultan Mansur nor from any other tomb, I shall leave it out of this discussion.\n\n* Note. The stone, in my opinion, has no historical value. Heer G. P. Rouffaer informs me that the round hole in it shows that it was used for the taking of oaths. Should the headstone belonging to it be discovered, possibly my view might not stand. [There is a stone at Pengkalan Kempas, Negri Sembilan, with a round hole in it, which tradition avers will tighten on the arm of the person who takes a false oath R. O. W.].\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nThe head-stone is worth deciphering, because it is so far as is known the only extant stone of the tombs of the Sultans of Malacca and secondly because Mansur Shah played a great part in Malay and Chinese records.\n\nBy the help of the casts I was able to decipher the inscriptions and by reconstructing a pair of damaged words to get an absolutely certain reading of the names and of the date. Only the first line presented difficulties but by the help of my friend R. A. Dr. Husein Jaya-diningrat a reading in my opinion satisfactory was secured, so that all the words on that line with the first word of the second line duly accounted for are meant to glorify not the Sultan as in Hervey's version but the grave. Major J. C. Moulton kindly sent me at my request photos of all four sides of the stone which is now placed on a cement pedestal for its better preservation. I give my reconstruction for each side on the accompanying plates so that any one more competent than I may express his views on it.\n\nThe reading is as follows: (Plate I. obverse):\n\n\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0636\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u062f\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0647\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0627\u0641\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644\n\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0637\u0627\u062a(\u0646) \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0635\u0648(\u0631) \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0638\u0641\u0631 \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0648\u0645\n\nPlate II (Reverse) reads:\n\n\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0631\u0628\u0639\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0631\u062c\u0628 \u0633\u0646\u0629\n\u0627\u062b\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644 \u0647\u062c\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u0648(\u0628\u0629) \u0627\u0644 (\u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u064a\u0629)\n\nCompared with the Hervey version it thus reads: Hadzihi al-raudzat al-mukaddasat al-mutahharat al-zawiyat al-safiyat al-munawwarat lil Sultan al-adil al-badzil al-Sultan Mansur Shah bin Muzaffar Shah al-marhum: kad intakala min dar al-mahal ila dar amal yaum al-arbaa min Rajab sanat thanatein wa thamanin wa thaman mi'ah min al-Hijrah al-Nubawyah al-mustafawyah\n\nOr translated\n\n\"This is the consecrated the holy grave the brilliant illuminated tomb of the just Sultan, the magnanimous ruler Sultan Mansur Shah son of the deceased Muzaffar Shah. He removed from this mortal abode to the abode of hope on Wednesday of Rajab in the year 882 after the Hijrah of the Prophet, the Chosen One.\"\n\nAs my reading of the gravestone differs in many places from that of Hervey, I must add an explanation of some details. The difference in my conception of the words of the first line is great and I take it that mim has been broken off in the middle words, and read \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0647\u0631\u0629 (stands in the lower corner), but the reading is of little or no consequence since, once we know who the person entombed is, it matters relatively little if one takes a word to be in praise of the grave or of the dead. However the correct reading of the bottom line on Plate I is of very great importance for the\ndetermination of the father's name; it is now irrefragably established that we have to do with the gravestone of Sultan Mansur Shah of Malacca, who according to all accounts was a son of Sultan Muzaffar Shah. It is clear that between \"Mansur\" and \"Muzaffar\" the word \u0646 stands, but the \"r\" of \"Mansur\" and the \"n\" of \"Sultan\" cannot be traced. Mistakes on these gravestones are very frequent so that it is quite possible the mason omitted the letters. As regards the reverse, it is clear that in the top line not dar al-wirad but dar amal occurs. More important however is the date. The cast showed at once how the faulty reading dua came about.

A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nThe Malay Pantun.\n\nBy H. Overbeck.\n\nFrom the study of Malay pantuns arises the question how far this peculiar kind of quatrain is the sole property of the Malays, or if something identical, similar or akin is to be found amongst other peoples in their neighbourhood. Research would naturally turn first to Java, as both the Javanese and the Sundanese language are akin to Malay.\n\nI do not recollect to have heard any Javanese pantuns during my stay in East Java, and J. J. de Hollander, who fully describes the Malay pantun and s\u0113loka (on the relationship of the two something will be said later) in his work on the Malay language, does not mention any similar quatrains in his work on the Javanese language. Plain love songs of course may exist, as given in chapter XIV of the \"S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu\":\u2014the Malay author, by the way, gives to the ditties sung in honour of Hang Tuah the name of pantun, though it is not a Javanese name. The word s\u0113loka is known and according to the dictionary means a figurative expression, or way of speaking with the purpose of conveying a thought in a more or less veiled form. Whether the word s\u0113loka is used also to designate moral verses as in India, I have been unable to discover. Generally speaking, Javanese poetry differs entirely from the Malay sha\u0113r and pantun; a verse similar to that of the Malay sha\u0113r is unknown. The Javanese poet has at his disposal ten or more different metres, the verses of which have from 4 to 12 lines, the lines being of different structure within each verse, with a rhyme hardly noticeable for a European ear, and a prosody on which the views of learned men differ. In this poetry, wherein the greater part of Javanese literature is written, there is no place for anything like the Malay pantun. Mention is made by some writers of the Javanese wangsallan, which according to the dictionary is a kind of charade or riddle in verse, wherein in an enigmatical way principally by the last, or also by the first syllable of a word something is hinted at, whilst in a second verse, called jawab (answer) the thing hinted is plainly stated. But I cannot give any examples of such wangsallan or say if there exists in Javanese any unwritten literature as in Sundanese.\n\nSundanese poetry generally follows the way of her Javanese sister; the Sundanese poet works with the same metres as his Javanese neighbour, and their names are identical in both languages. But besides the written literature there is the pantun, which in Sundanese means a tale taken from legends or from the\n\n---\n\n1. F.

Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nhistory of old times, half sung, half recited by the bard, the tukang pantun, to the accompaniment of a sort of violin (tarawangsa) or lute (kachapi). Mr. C. Pleyte has edited some of these Sundanese pantun with their different versions, together with a synopsis, a partial translation and a glossary. Although these tales are taken mostly from legends or history of old times, they resemble the Malay penglipor lara tale, being also interspersed with blank verse and sindir.\n\nThe blank verse Mr. Pleyte calls purwakanti, a Javanese word which according to the dictionary means \u201ca verse or verses, being a combination of words having the same sound, which sometimes are not much more than jingling nonsense.\u201d These blank verse, often roughly humoristic, describe the proceedings of a festival, the dress of a man or woman, their way of walking or journeying and so on and they are often repeated. Without being quite identical with the blank verse of the Malay penglipor lara tale, they have the same metre and quaintly resemble them in their way of being used. An attempt at a translation would be pretty hopeless for anybody but a Rabelais; they abound in onomatopoeics and synonyms, in which the Sundanese language is exceedingly rich.\n\nAs regards the sindir appearing in the pantun edited by him, Mr. Pleyte in the preface to the glossary writes as follows:\n\n\u201cTo Mr. J. Knebel . . . is due the credit of having pointed out the nature of the Javanese wangsallan, i.e. charades, of which the beginning lines give the rhyme-word for the solution given in the following lines. So too, many of sindir, are something more than simple rhymes, which they are always represented to be. They contain hidden warnings, lessons of life, admonitions and so on clad in the garment of a play upon words or a pun, sometimes more, sometimes less ingenious, as will be seen from the examples in the text.\n\nAttention ought to be drawn to this, not only because without such knowledge some passages in the pantun would remain unintelligible, but also because the sindir are so closely interwoven with daily conversation, that a fairly animated colloquy seldom passes without the use of these puns, which are understood everywhere. They season discourse as quotations season ours, and for an intimate chat one ought to know at least some of them. Also for easy intercourse with the kampong people they are indispensable, as they are the common property of the chachah, the common people, as well as of the highest educated class.\n\nA few examples may serve as illustrations.\n\n1. Batavia, 1906, 1910, 1911 in the Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal, Land en Volken Kunde, Part XLIX, afl. 152, and in Verhandelingen van het Bataviaansch genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschapen, Part LVIII.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\n\"In a native household a new servant is to be engaged. A candidate has offered his services, makes a good impression and is therefore accepted, say, with the following words: 'Tapi hant\u00f6 salisung gardu, \u0113nya.' 'Akh, mo\u00e4l,' 'Oh no!' is the reply. As the first sentence, literally translated, means 'but not a watch-house-mortar (for rice-pounding),' the question arises as to what has actually been said to the man.\n\n\"Under salisung gardu is to be understood the sahkokol, i.e. 'a sounding-board' hanging in the watch house, whereon the hours are struck and wherewith the watchmen also give alarm-signals. Even then it has no meaning here. But the meaning will become clear if one knows that the catch-word or rhyme-word on sahkokol is sakongkol, i.e. 'go-siping,' and we therefore get the following: h\u00ebnt\u00f6 salisung gardu = h\u00ebnt\u00f6 sakahkol = ulah sakongkol\u2014'no gossip!'\n\n\"Not only in the presence of grown-up people are such covert sayings used; they are addressed also to children. A naughty child has repeatedly been bidden to obey, but remains obstinate. At last the mother loses her temper and exclaims angrily: 'Ah, sia mah sok k\u00f6k\u00f6k aing mah; mun kitu, m\u00ebntak m\u00ebntil hiris ng\u00ebmbang b\u00ebdil:'\u2014'Well, you put your will against mine; if you persist, it will be m\u00ebntil hiris ng\u00ebmbang b\u00ebdil.'\n\n\"M\u00ebntil hiris\u00b9 means k\u00ebpokan,\u00b2 and the naughty one is made to understand matak kapok, in other words, 'It will not be long before you will be kapok. i.e. you will come to grief, which will so frighten you that you will not do it again, and then it will be ng\u00ebmbang b\u00ebdil,\u00b3\u2014obat, which means here totobatan, 'I shan't do it again.'\n\n\"But the sindir are by no means always of a moral tendency, and least of all in the allegorical language of courting, wherein they play an important part and often show an unmistakable ingenuity. For example.\n\n(Puchung metre).\n\nJaring panjang aya-na di-parahu\n\nT\u00f6 puguh kahayang\n\nBengkel kawung chumawene\n\nDiyuk nongtung barang t\u00ebda h\u00ebnt\u00f6 ng\u00f6nah.\n\n\"Which means literally translated.\n\n'A long net is lying in the ship,\n\nFoolish is the desire.\n\nTapping-peduncle of a virginal arenga-palm,\n\nWhether one sits or stands up, one does not enjoy one's meal.'\n\n1. i.e. the hiris (a kind of pulse) is forming the first fruit after flowering.\n2. i.e. a very young fruit.\n3. i.e. the flowering of a gun.\n\nJour.

Under 'lying in a ship' one should under-\nstand 'in the house.' Mayang is not used in this, but in\nanother of its meanings, i.e. 'the blossom of the betel-\npalm'\u2014a marriageable maiden.\n\n\"The second line contains a question to be rendered as\nfollows: would it be too foolish to desire you?\n\n\"Bengkel kawung chumawene again is a paraphrase.\nInstead of bengkel, 'tapping-peduncle of a sugar-palm,' one\nshould take the synonym jonah, suggested by the rhyme-\nword ngonah. Kawung chumawene means 'a virginal, i.e.\nnot yet tapped Arenga saccharifera,' the word chumawene,\n'to be a virgin,' being a form of chawene 'virgin.' Now,\nas an incarnation of Nyi Pohachi Sanghyang S\u00e9ri, the\nprimitive goddess of agriculture, the kawung-palm is con-\nsidered as a female being, who from earliest youth, until\nthe palmwine-tapper marries her when she is grown up, is\ndeemed to go through all stages of development from a little\ngirl to a marriageable maid. Bengkel kawung chumawene\ntherefore means: 'a just budding virgin.'\n\n\"The last line does not need further explanation, and it\nwill be clear that the whole is a lover's entreaty.\n\n\"However, sindir are rarely as intricate as the above.\nThe plainness of the following lampoon on divorced women,\nleaves nothing to be desired:\n\n\"Anak kuda susurian\n\"Tikait tali kanchana\n\"Aya rangda s\u00f6\u00f6riian\n\"Ngar\u00ebbut \u00f6si chalana.\"\n\nIn the texts edited by Mr. Pleyte sindir in versified form\nare not used as pantun are used in a Malay Hikayat, i.e. to form\ndialogues and so on, but occur apparently mixed up with the blank\nverse, which have the same metre as the last verse quoted above.\nThe puchung-metre of the first sindir-verse given above is a four-\nlined one of the different metres at the Sundanese poet's disposal,\nalready referred to.

They do so in some few instances.\u201d \u201cDhammapada\u201d or \u201cWay of Truth,\u201d a collection of Buddhist verses, contains many quatrains in which the first couplet contains a picture, the meaning of which is applied in the second:\n\n\u201cAs into a house, which is badly thatched,\nThe rain will enter.\nThus into an untrained mind\nThe craving will enter.\u201d\n\nor\n\n\u201cAs a beautiful flower,\nBrilliant of hue but yielding no fragrance,\nThus is the well-spoken word\nFruitless to him, who does not act (accordingly).\u201d\n\nWithout the \u201cas\u201d (vatha) and \u201cthus\u201d (evam) there would not be much difference between these Pali verses and many a Malay pantun.\n\nPali is a daughter-language of Sanskrit, and in Sanskrit poetry \u201cby far the most frequent and most useful form of verse\u201d is the Sloka.\\(^2\\) The Sloka consists of two lines of sixteen syllables, or rather four lines of eight syllables each, only four of which are fixed in quantity, the others being at option long or short.\\(^3\\) Of the Slokas in the Sanskrit Ramayana some in the first two lines have a picture or poetic thought, whose meaning is applied in the second couplet. The following quatrains are translated by Romesh Chandra Dutt in his condensation of the Ramayana, book IX, Canto 9,\n\n\u201cRaindrops fall upon the lotus,\nBut unmingle hang apart;\nFalse relations round us gather,\nBut they blend not heart with heart.\u201d\n\n---\n\n1.

The following quotations are taken from Arthur W. Ryder's translation of \"Shakuntala\" in \"Everyman's Library.\"\n\nAct. IV, 2. King Dushyanta, owing to the curse of the Rishi Durvasas, has entirely forgotten that he had married Shakuntala, and her foster-father, the hermit Kanva, decides to send her to the King's palace. One of his pupils on the dawn of the day of her departure, says:\n\n\"Night-blooming lilies, when the moon is hidden,\nHave naught but memories of beauty left;\nHard, hard to bear! Her lot, whom heaven has bidden\nTo live alone, of love and lover reft!\"\n\nAct V. When the hermits, who bring Shakuntala to the palace, are received by the king, one of them says:\n\n\"Fruit-laden trees bend down to earth,\nThe water-pregnant cloud hangs low;\nGood men are not puffed by power;\nThe unselfish are by nature so.\"\n\nWhen Shakuntala reminds him of his former kindness and promises, the king replies:\n\n\"A stream, that eats away the bank,\nGrows foul and undermines the tree;\nSo you would stain your honour, while\nYou plunge me into misery.\"\n\nAnd when the hermits reproach him, the king reminds them of the verse:\n\n\"Night blossoms open to the moon,\nDay-blossoms to the sun;\nA man of honour ever strives\nAnother's wife to shun.\"\nThe use of verse, especially of some well-known epigrammatical sloka, to illustrate one's words, is of course common in Indian literature and probably in daily conversation, but in the king's reply to Shakuntala, if correctly translated, we have an ex tempore improvisation to suit the occasion.\n\nWith Sanskrit we are in India, and India of course has greatly influenced the Malay language and literature. \"Neg\u00e9ri Keling,\" the country of the dark people of the Kalingas, mentioned in the Ramayana and Mahabharata as living on the East-coast of the Indian peninsula, would seem to be the source of this influence. Tamil is a Dravidian, non-Aryan language, but has been influenced largely by Sanskrit. The Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Panchatantra have been translated into Tamil. From the Tamil translation of the Ramayana the Malay Hikayat Seri Rama is derived. Speaking of the different kinds of Tamil poetry, the Abbe Dubois mentions the \"Padam,\" which corresponds to strophe, stanza or couplet. The \"Padam\" includes not only odes in honour of gods, princes and great personages, but also obscene and amorous ditties, sprightly dialogues between gods and goddesses and similar compositions. Dubois further mentions Slokas or stanzas, and gives translations of a number of \"niti-slokas\" or moral stanzas, familiar to all educated Hindus. \"They are written in Sanskrit-verse, but as this classical language is not understood by many people, each sloka is accompanied by a literal translation in the vulgar tongue.\" The Hindoos take great delight in introducing these slokas into their ordinary conversation. Many of these slokas, of which Dubois gives a prose-translation, have in their first part a picture or saying, whose moral is given in the last part. For instance,\n\n\"When one sees blades of Dharba-grass on white-ant-heaps,\none can tell at once that snakes are there. So when one sees anybody frequenting the company of wicked men, one may feel sure that he is as wicked as they.\"\n\nPerhaps Sanskrit scholars can tell us how it came that the word sloka, which appears to have been formerly the name of a metre or stanza, later came to mean an epigram.\n\nThe Malays, too, know the word seloka. According to Wilkinson's dictionary it means \"rhyme, especially when humorous; ironical or satirical poetry when not in the form of the pantun.\" A pantun, according to the same dictionary, is a \"quatrain, the first line of which rhymes with the third, and the second with the fourth.\" Mr. Wilkinson has further laid down the principle of assonance and that of the veiled and unveiled thought referred to above. That the principle of assonance is not always kept, a\n\n1. Abbe J. A. Dubois, Hindu Manners, Custom and Ceremonies, 3rd ed., Oxford, 1906, p. 619.\n2. Dubois chapter XXII, page 392 et seq. and chapter XXIII, page 474 et seq.\n3. The sacred grass, Poa cynosuroides, essential in all sacrifices.\nglance over any collection of pantuns will show. The veiled and unveiled thought also occurs in many Indian selokas. As regards the rhyme the Malays seem to be rather careless, and a pantun may sometimes have the same rhyme in all four lines:\n\nMasok hutan bawa senapang\nHendak bedil anak beruang.\nEnche' laksana binatang kongkang\nKepala di-tundok chelah kangkang.\n\nAda satu panglima garang\nJanggut panjang misai berchabang;\nPokok pisang boleh tuan tebang\nKa-pada sahaya jangan di-chadang.\n\nMarsden, Crawford and others make no distinction between pantun and seloka. J. J. de Hollander, however, remarks that in Malay writings a distinction is made and quotes a passage from the Hikayat Shah Mardan or Indera Jaya:\u2014\"segala dayang pun berpantun dan berseloka.\" In the Hikayat Hang Tuah we are told of Hang Tuah and his friends, when they were in the forbidden park of the Batara of Menjapahit:\u2014\"maka ia dudok... bersenda, bernyanyi dan berpantun dan berseloka berbagai-bagai ragam-nya.\" The word pantun has in the Hikayat Hang Tuah a double meaning: it is used several times for such a proverbial saying as pagar makan padi, as pointed out by Dr. Winstedt in his preface to \"Pantun Melayu,\" and it is used also for the quatrain.\n\nIn my collection of pantuns I find the following quatrains:\n\nSabar sunggoh Raja Kuantan,\nMenjikut perang dari kuala.\nAdinda tuan sa-pantun intan,\nTidak ternilai yang punya harga.\n\nPanah memanah Raja Andoman,\nPanah lalu ka-segara.\nAdinda sa-pantun sharbat minuman,\nSa-puloh tahun ta' hilang rasa.\n\nYa Galoh Raden di-pinang,\nTempat raja dari Patani;\nTuan sa-pantun si-pohon pisang,\nKawan-nya banyak kanan dan kiri.\n\nThese three quatrains belong to an incomplete series of pantuns of the kind called Alif-ba-ta. The series was procured from a Chinese collector and probably hails from Malacca. In these quatrains the word pantun or sa-pantun is used in place of the laksana or sa-umpama of modern times. Is it possible that the seloka, either with the alternate or the fourfold rhyme, existed long ago and that those quatrains containing a pantun or simile in the first two lines have in course of time received the name pantun in\n\n1. Pantun Melayu No. 970.\n2. ib. No. 1021. Compare further the pantuns in \"Pelandok Jenaka.\"\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\ncontradistinction to the s\u0113loka, in which the same thought runs through all four lines? The following quatrains would then be called s\u0113loka:\n\nAnak dara dua sa-pasang,\nPakai baju, pakai k\u0113rosang,\nSa-biji nanas, sa-biji pisang,\nBelum tahu r\u0113z\u0113ki musang.\n\nSudah b\u0113rt\u0113mu kaseh sayang,\nDudok t\u0113rkurong malam siang,\nHingga sa-tapak tiada r\u0113nggang,\nTulang s\u0113ndi habis b\u0113rgunchang.\n\nChakapan pelet orang P\u0113tani,\nMari ka-tanjong h\u0113ndak m\u0113mb\u0113li,\nBodoh kurang paham h\u0113r\u012bti,\nKamb\u0113li di-kata p\u0113rmaidani.\n\nJalan-jalan sa-panjang jalan,\nSinggah-m\u0113nyinggah di-pagar orang,\nPura-pura m\u0113nchari ayam,\nEkor mata di-anak orang.\n\nThe verse of the s\u0113loka would be the usual sha\u0113r verse, which in its turn is possibly the old Indian sloka or stanza. A study of such s\u0113loka would probably show that the principle of the fourfold rhyme is not always strictly observed. Whoever has read a Malay sha\u0113r, knows the awful difficulties the Malay poet has to master to get the fourfold rhyme, a difficulty which would make the popular use of such a quatrain rather impossible. When the pantun became popular, the double thought in it possibly caused the alternate rhyme, which is much easier to find.\n\nA collection called \"Sha\u0113r Pantun S\u0113loka\" has been published in Singapore by the Malay press. It contains a number of series of pantun b\u0113rkait, but I have failed to find any essential difference between the quatrains of this collection and the usual pantun.\n\nSomething which seems akin to the Malay pantun is to be found in the Chinese language. When trying to read the \"Kin Ku K'i Kuan,\" \"Stories of old and new times,\" the well-known collection of 40 Chinese novels dating from the Ming dynasty (1368\u20141644 A.D.) I came across some Chinese verses interspersed in the text which even to my imperfect knowledge of Chinese seemed to be on the lines of a pantun. Grube in his \"Geschichte der Chinesischen Literatur\" quotes from the preface of V. von Strauss's translation of the \"Shi-King,\" \"The Book of Odes,\" one of the four classical books of Chinese literature, as follows:\n\n\"The Chinese editors always indicate at the end of each stanza whether it contains a direct statement (fu) a simile or comparison (pi) or a metaphor or symbolical saying (hsing). Only the latter is something peculiar, as in each stanza, before coming to the real object of the poem, in one or two lines a peculiar natural phenomenon, a well-known event or occurrence is mentioned as an introduction not unlike a clever arabesque in order to prepare reflection, sensa-\n\n1. \"Pantun Melayu,\" No. 8.\n2. ib. No. 951.\n3. ib. No. 975.\n4. ib. No. 955.\n\"tion and the state of mind for that which follows. The symbol is either the same in all stanzas, or a new one is taken each time. Thus we find in the symbolical introduction of different poems absolutely independent from each other the same picture or metaphor.\"\n\nThe few examples given below are taken from the few pretty, but rather free translations in the little volume, \"The Book of Odes\" in the \"Wisdom of the East\" Series.

Cranmer-Byng says: \"Concentration and suggestion are the two essentials of Chinese poetry. There is neither Iliad nor Odyssey to be found in the libraries of the Chinese; indeed, a favourite feature of their verse is the 'stop short,' a poem containing only four lines, concerning which another critic has explained that only the words stop, whilst the sense goes on. But what a world of meaning is to be found between four lines! Often a door is opened, a curtain is drawn aside in the halls of romance, where the reader may roam at will.\" As regards the rhyme, the same author says: \"in the four-line or stop-short poem . . . the first line rhymes with the second and fourth, curiously recalling the Rubayat-form of the Persian poets.\" It is difficult to find one of these stop-short poems from the translations given in the \"Lute of Jade,\" as probably the English version does not follow the Chinese metre. There is one from Po Ch\u00fc I (A.D. 772\u2014846):\n\n1. The stanza of the Chinese original have 4, 4, and 3 lines respectively\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nA Palace Story.\n\n\"A network handkerchief contains no tear.\n'Tis dawn at court, ere wine and music sate.\nThe rich red crops no aftermath await.\nRest on a screen, and you will fall, I fear.\"\n\nIn the above-named \"Kin Ku K'i Kuan,\" verses similar to the epigrammatical sloka or to the pantun are used much in the same way as similar verses are used in Indian literature, at the beginning, in the middle and at the end. Perhaps Chinese scholars can tell us whether there are quatrains of a similar kind used in daily life as the pantun is used in Malaya. Chinese literature is a bad collecting-ground for popular ditties, on which university literates look down with even more contempt than they already do on the popular novel, the \"Hsiao Shuo.\"\n\nIt seems rather far out of the way to look for something akin to the Malay pantun in Chinese poetry, but between the two languages there is a certain affinity in idiom. Common to both languages are the \"classifiers,\" certain words used in addition to the numeral, different according to the class of objects referred to, as in Malay ekor, 'tail' for animals, buah 'fruit,' for countries, houses, ships and so on. No such classifiers are to be found in the Javanese or Sundanese language. In one of his lectures on \"Language and Letters\" Dr. Graebner drew a comparison between Arabic as a most subjective and Chinese as a most objective language. The Chinese, he said amongst other things, in expressing himself, shows us a picture, a sort of cinematographic film, which he has before his mind's eye and which he describes and explains to us by degrees. Hence the usual co-ordination instead of our subordination of sentences, hence the frequent use of the possessive and of the demonstrative pronoun, and hence possibly the use of the classifiers. All these characteristics are to be found also more or less in the Malay idiom. The co-ordination of sentences is much more frequent than subordination, the possessive suffix -nya is to be found in nearly every sentence, and the demonstrative pronouns ini, itu and pun are used much more frequently than in any European language, and much in the same way as in Chinese.\n\nIs it possible that to Chinese influence may be attributed the fact that the connection between the first and last couplet in the Malay pantun is often so very loose?\n\nIn the Indian sloka, to judge from translations, the rule that the picture given in the first lines must absolutely agree with the thought conveyed in the second lines, is always strictly observed. In all Indian verses the picture is quite clear; it is always an obvious illustration of the thought which follows and not merely as in the Malay pantun an impressionist sketch, whose connection with the following lines a European mind often fails to understand. In Chinese poetry we have just this very loose-\nness of connection between the picture and the thought it illustrates. A literal translation of course would make this point much clearer than the verses quoted above, but even some of these, translated into Malay, would not be much out of the way in a Pantun. In the noisy blue-bottles and the slanderers, in the lazy fishes and the king feasting at Haou we have pictures and thoughts, which a European mind can as well connect as the picture of the creeper that winds round the tree and the thought of the snake that coils round the flower in the pantuns of the \"Guarded Rose.\" But in \"May-time\" the first lines are of that class which, to use Dr. Winstedt's expression, \"sound inane enough on a gramophone-record, but may well have given the spirit of the hour and place of its original context.\" Parallels for the green upper robe and yellow lower robe could be found in many pantun.\n\nThe points of resemblance between many Chinese verses and Malay pantun appear to be so numerous and so close that the thought of fortuitous coincidence seems hardly satisfactory. Perhaps Chinese scholars could help us to fathom the meaning of the introductory lines in many a Chinese verse and their inner connection with the following lines in the same way as Dr. Winstedt has done for the pantun in his preface to \"Pantun Melayu.\"\n\nI once went through my collection of pantun with a clever Malay munshi from Sumatra and learned something about the meaning of the second lines, but very little of their connection with the first pair. The munshi indeed declared the first couplets to be meaningless, and observing my apparent incredulity, pointed triumphantly to the passage in the \"Pelayaran Abdullah\":\n\n\"Ada pun jalan segala pantun itu empat-empat mistar adanya; bermula mistar yang di atas dua itu, tiada erti-nya, melainkan ia itu menjadi pasang-nya sahaja; maka yang dua mistar di-bawah, itu-lah yang ada bererti, ada-nya.\"\n\nMenjadi pasang-nya the munshi declared to mean that they were only there \"to carry the rhyme.\" Undoubtedly there is a grain of truth in Abdullah's statement, at least as far as modern Malays and pantuns are concerned. A glance over the quatrains of \"Pantun Melayu\" will show that the principle of assonance is frequently dispensed with, and as regards the \"veiled and unveiled thought\" I would venture to add the \"compulsion of rhyme\" to the long list of explanations enumerated by Dr. Winstedt to solve the difficulties of the European student when he meets with an apparently meaningless first pair of lines.\n\n\"Out of a big repertory of old-world verses the singer chooses one suitable for the purpose or possibly invents a new verse or changes and adapts an old.\" \"Favourite quatrains have undergone a little Odyssey of adventure up and down the Malay Archipelago.\" The real meaning of a pantun lies in the second coup-\n\n1. Pantun Melayu, Nos. 306-313.\n2. From the preface to \"Pantun Melayu.\"\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nlet; what the singer wants to say, he expresses in the second couplet, and apparently the second couplet lingers in the memory of the Malay much stronger than the first. When hearing extemporised pantun, I have often noticed that the singer has fixed in his mind only the last couplet and improvises the first simply to get the rhyme, without paying any attention to principles of assonance and veiled thought. If he finds in his momentary surroundings or occupation a motive for the rhyme he needs, he will seize it at once. Again any adept in pantun has at his command a large number of rhyme-equivalents which will enable him to construct at a moment's notice the first couplet that gives the rhyme for the second, and even to do it in a neat style, giving a nice little picture, which however has hardly any inner connection with the thought expressed in the second couplet. Sometimes he simply alters a stock-phrase just to get at the rhyme. The choice of fruits put by the extemporiser into a puan or dulang very often seems to be determined solely by the rhyme, and so too the use of stock-phrases dari...belayar ka..., orang...pulang ka...; kalau tuan pergi ka..., charikan sahaya.\n\nBelow are given some quatrains taken from Pantun Melayu, Pantun Dondang Sayang and my own collection, in which the third and fourth lines are quite or very nearly identical, whilst the first two lines differ more or less. Sometimes the rhyme-words still linger in the singer's memory, and sometimes the principle of assonance makes itself felt vaguely. These examples may serve to illustrate the working of the Malay pantun-singer. Experts perhaps will be able to discriminate between the work of the poet and that of the plagiarist.\n\nKumbang terbang keliling kota,\nMakan rukam sa-pokok habis;\nAdinda jangan bimbang ta' suka,\nAmbil keris tikam sa-kali.\n\nZamzam t\u00e9laga ada di-Mekah,\nMinum orang anak si-Ali;\nAdinda jangan bimbang ta' suka,\nAmbil keris tikam sa-kali.\n\nYu puteh si-lumba-lumba,\nLalu ber\u00e9nang ka-Tanjong Jati.\nAnak sungai kalau ku-tuba,\nLotong siamang jatoh mati.\n\nJin besar turun bertapa,\nMakan sa-hari sa-gantang padi;\nAnak sungai kalau ku-tuba,\nLotong siamang jatoh mati.\n\nBaik-baik tuan mengikat;\nAnak balam terbang tinggi;\nBaik-baik tuan menyurat,\nKalam jangan buat penyugi.\n\nAda suatu Haji Tambi,\nBerjumpa kolam turun mandi;\nBaik-baik tuan menulis,\nKalam jangan buat penyugi.\n\n4.

A \u201cHikayat Ch\u0113ndawan Puteh\u201d was published in Singapore in 1328 (1909 A.D.) and a \u201cSha\u0113r Ch\u0113ndawan Puteh\u201d in 1331 (1912 A.D.). The date of the latter in the writer\u2019s copy is blurred and it may be 1321, but in any case the Sha\u0113r must be a later production, as many facts and episodes of the Hikayat are missing, and towards the end the poet, apparently weary of his task, is progressing by leaps and bounds, which makes the Sha\u0113r fairly unintelligible without the knowledge of the Hikayat. Many of the pantun of the Hikayat have been taken over into the Sha\u0113r, but the poet has altered them according to his taste. A few quatrains will show how he did it.\n\nHikayat Ch\u0113ndawan Puteh.\n\nPadi di-sawah p\u0113tek tangkai-nya,\nOrang F\u0113ringgi jadi k\u0113lana;\nTuan di-bawah patek b\u0113rtanya,\nS\u0113karang p\u0113rgi akan ka-mana?\n\nOrang F\u0113ringgi jadi k\u0113lana,\nM\u0113nchari landak sa-kawan lima;\nS\u0113karang p\u0113rgi akan ka-mana?\nPatek nan h\u0113ndak b\u0113rtanya nama.\nM\u0113nchari landak ka-kawan lima,\nDi-makan ch\u0113ndawan di-pohon uni;\nPatek nan h\u0113ndak b\u0113rtanya nama,\nSiapa pula tuanku ini?\n\nRajawali raja p\u0113rman,\nSinggah m\u0113manah burong k\u0113didi;\nTinggal-lah balai, tinggal-lah la-man,\nTinggal pengkalan t\u0113mpat ku-mandi.\n\nSha\u0113r Ch\u0113ndawan Puteh.\n\nPadi di-sawah p\u0113tek tangkai-nya,\nOrang F\u0113ringgi m\u0113langgar China;\nTuan di-bawah patek b\u0113rtanya,\nS\u0113karang p\u0113rgi h\u0113ndak ka-mana?\n\nOrang F\u0113ringgi m\u0113langgar China,\nB\u0113rapa banyak mati penglima;\nS\u0113karang tuan p\u0113rgi ka-mana?\nKami nan h\u0113ndak b\u0113rtanya nama.\nB\u0113rapa banyak mati penglima,\nDi-bantu oleh s\u0113gala S\u0113ran\u012b;\nKami nan h\u0113ndak b\u0113rtanya nama,\nAnak siapa tuanku ini?\n\nM\u0113rak m\u0113ngigal di-dalam taman,\nMati di-patok ular-nya lidi;\nTinggal mahligai kampong halaman,\nB\u0113s\u0113rta kolam, t\u0113mpat-ku mandi.\n\nR.

There are pantuns belonging to certain series of quatrains strung together by a connection between the different first couplets, other than \"pantun berkait.\" Such series for example are those which in the first couplets narrate a legend like that of Panji S\u00ebmerang or S\u00ebri Rama, or series of mnemonic verses such as the R\u00ebjang Sombang, R\u00ebjang Siak and R\u00ebjang Sindiran, and the Alif-Ba-Ta series. In those quatrains which are mostly inferior in quality as compared with the usual pantun, the first couplet is apparently the most important, and the second often differs in different versions, whilst the first couplets are identical. The second couplets often seem to be taken from a general stock of puji-pujian, k\u00ebnang-k\u00ebnangan or\nm\u0113r\u0113ndahkan diri verses, and show no individuality. In a contest of singers they may be used to show the wit of the rivals, or during a long trip on a river a lover may drone them to his sweetheart. Most of these series are too long to be given here, but two variant versions of the \"Storm in a tea-cup\" will illustrate the point.\n\n\"Pantun M\u0113layu.\"\n\nAnak ayam turun sa-b\u0113las\nMati sa-ekur tinggal sa-puloh.\nMata siapa tidakk\u0101n b\u0113las\nM\u0113l\u012bhat kapal b\u0113raleh laboh.\n\nAnak ayam turun sa-puloh\nMati sa-ekur tinggal s\u0113mbilan.\nM\u0113l\u012bhat kapal b\u0113raleh laboh\nDi-laut Pulau S\u0113mbilan.\n\nAnak ayam turun s\u0113mbilan\nMati sa-ekur tinggal lapan.\nDi-laut Pulau S\u0113mbilan\nDi-situ-lah banyak kapal b\u0113ragan.\n\nAnak ayam turun d\u0113lapan\nMati sa-ekur tinggal tujoh.\nDi-situ-lah banyak kapal b\u0113ragan\nAnak k\u0113lasi habis gadoh.\n\nAnak ayam turun tujoh\nMati sa-ekur tinggal \u0113nam.\nAnak k\u0113lasi habis gadoh\nKapal di-laut habis j\u0113hanam.\n\nAnak ayam turun \u0113nam\nMati sa-ekur tinggal lima.\nKapal di-laut habis j\u0113hanam\nPanggilk\u0101n-nya tukang China.\n\nAnak ayam turun lima,\nMati sa-ekur tinggal \u0113mpat.\nPanggilk\u0101n-nya tukang China\nMana yang r\u0113nggang habis rapat.\n\nAnak ayam turun \u0113mpat\nMati sa-ekur tinggal tiga.\nMana yang r\u0113nggang habis rapat\nChe' k\u0113lasi baharu-lah suka.\n\nThe writer's collection.\n\nMissing.\n\nAnak ayam turun sa-puloh\nMati sa-ekur tinggal s\u0113mbilan.\nAngkat tangan jari sa-puloh\nH\u0113ndak b\u0113rmohon kapada-mu tuan.\n\nAnak ayam turun s\u0113mbilan\nMati sa-ekur tinggal d\u0113lapan.\nH\u0113ndak b\u0113rmohon ka-pada tuan\nNiat di-hati m\u0113njadi kapitan.\n\nAnak ayam turun d\u0113lapan\nMati sa-ekur tinggal tujoh.\nNiat di-hati m\u0113njadi kapitan\nKapal b\u0113rlayar sudah b\u0113rlaboh.\n\nAnak ayam turun tujoh\nMati sa-ekur tinggal \u0113nam.\nKapal b\u0113rlayar sudah b\u0113rlaboh\nDi-pukul ombak sudah jambatan.\n\nAnak ayam turun \u0113nam\nMati sa-ekur tinggal lima.\nDi-pukul ombak sudah jambatan\nKasi baik tukang China.\n\nAnak ayam turun lima,\nMati sa-ekur tinggal \u0113mpat.\nSudah baik tukang China\nMana yang r\u0113nggang kesi rapat.\n\nAnak ayam turun \u0113mpat\nMati sa-ekur tinggal tiga.\nMana yang r\u0113nggang kasi rapat\nKapal baik di-layar juga.\n\n1.

Such pantuns therefore seem to follow rather the \"clever arabesque\" of some Chinese poetry than the way of the picture strictly illustrating the thought of the Indian sloka.\u00b9\n\nIt would be interesting to know if other peoples besides the Malays and Sundanese have verses similar in structure and use to the pantun. Dr. Winstedt in his preface to \"Pantun M\u0113layu\" speaks of the pantun as the love-verse and lampoon of Indonesian peoples, and a comparison with songs from the Philippines, Fiji, New-Zealand should give interesting results. Perhaps the learned societies there could furnish the necessary material.\n\n\u00b9 The writer has since found in Menangkabau tales six-lined pantuns, of which the 1st and 4th, the 2nd 5th and 3rd and 6th lines rhyme. Particulars will be given in another paper.\nA Tamil Malay Manuscript.\n\nBy Dr. Ph. S. van Ronkel.\n\nProfessor of Malay at Leiden University.\n\nIt is well known that Islam and the greater part of Moslem mysticism found its way to the Indonesian Archipelago not from Arabia, but from Southern India. It is, indeed, a truth so well proved, that it seems superfluous to lay stress on it, or to deal with it in detail. It may suffice to remind the reader of the undeniable fact that the very form of popular Islam, the character of its mysticism, the whole Islamic edifying and romantic literature, the form of many Arabic loanwords, the style of Muhammedan tombs and so on point to Southern India as the land of their origin.\n\nThe Tamil words which were introduced by the Dravidian Moslem merchants, who converted the partly animistic partly Hinduistic population of Sumatra and Java, are still in use. Many a Dekhan saint or divine is venerated in these islands to the present day; in short, the Muhammedanism of the Dekhan still flourishes in the Indonesian world, in spite of later orthodox influences from Mecca and Hadramaut.\n\nThe substratum of animistic ideas is always visible through the Islamic tenets in their popular form while the Hindu nomenclature of some Moslem ideas indicates the intermediate layer that preceded the Islamic period. Let us only call to mind that to designate the Moslem teacher, the Islamic fast and the Muhammedan religion old Sanskrit words (guru, puwasa and agama) have survived in many Indonesian languages.\n\nAll such historical evidence as is now available regarding the introduction of Islam into the Archipelago has been elucidated by various scholars in the course of their investigations. The people themselves are not aware of the link which exists between their creed and the distant Mohammedan provinces of Southern India. At best, a few Indian immigrants may have a dim consciousness of the existence of that historical connection. Thus, some thirty years ago, a member of the Indian merchant family Akuan at Samarang showed a trilingual Muhammedan manuscript to Dr. Snouck Hurgronje. \"This document,\" the owner explained, \"shows the way by which the penetration of Islam has taken place; the Persian part representing the original literary language of Islamic culture in India; the portion in a modern Indian idiom, not understood by us, being representative of the interjacent country between Hindustan and these islands, and the third portion, the wholly intelligible Malay part, the speech of Islam as it is now in this country.\" But that intelligent merchant certainly is an exception. In order to follow the current of Islamic civilisation we have to examine historical facts and linguistic and religious evidence. In certain cases we have to rely on a single book, tale or manuscript.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nSo with the subject of the present paper, a manuscript which clearly shows that the Islam of Indonesia is South Indian in its origin, and was introduced by Indian Moslems, who came from the Dekhan, especially from the Tamil country. The MS. I review, is an ancient looking folio, described in my recently published supplementary catalogue of the Malay manuscripts in the Leyden University Library sub No. 754. It mentions neither the place where it was written nor the name of its original owner. Yet it speaks an eloquent language, as it is composed in two idioms, Tamil and Malay, and contains moreover passages in Persian. So here we find the three Islamic languages in question employed in one book.\n\nThis manuscript, moreover, presents an example of Tamil written in Arabic characters and used for the rendering of an Arabic text. Tamil books, it is true, printed in Arabic characters are by no means unknown\u2014(I was shown some specimens in the library of the India Office at London in 1907), but such manuscripts so far as I know, are very rare, and this one at least is unique both in Holland and Dutch India.\n\nI will not tax the reader's patience by an exposition of the system followed in rendering Tamil sounds by Arabic characters; it will suffice to state that a copious use has been made of the so-called emphatic letters and dental letters with dots beneath them. Moreover the transliteration does not seem to be quite consistent. The very first page is typical of the nature of the whole book, Malay being mixed with Tamil without any apparent transition. This page is taken up by a niyah-formula in Malay (the formulary for the inward intention to perform the ritual prostrations, sembahyang), ending in an Arabic prayer, which in its turn is followed by an explanation in Tamil, all by one and the same hand, and in one continuous handwriting. So, after an Arabic prayer, at once the text continues with an explanation in Tamil, and so on. Evidently the author or scribe wrote the three languages with equal ease and understanding.\n\nAfter some introductory matter a regular text begins, viz. an Arabic treatise styled: Iz\u0101m al-taw\u0101'\u012bd fi niz\u0101m al-ak\u0101'\u012bd, on the tenets of the creed, accompanied by a Tamil version with fully vocalised Arabic transcription, many diacritical signs but not a single Tamil letter; so it is all in queer-looking Arabic writing. The Arabic dogmatical treatise, by Mahm\u016bd Ibn Muhammad Labai Kum\u0101ran begins, after the usual eulogy in honour of Allah and the Prophet, as follows: \"The poor slave, who needs the intervention of the Prophet, says: this is a short treatise which deals with what\n\n1.

The original has diaeritical marks.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nadults should know about the right creed and pious works, and which I have compiled from books of great, renowned im\u0101m\u2019s, as Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, Al-Naw\u0101w\u012b, Muhammad Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b, \u2018Abdulkar\u012bm Al-Jabl\u012b, Muhammad Ibn Fadall\u0101h, Ahmad Al-Kush\u0101sh\u012b and others, together with a translation into the Ariw\u012b-language for the use of whosoever does not fairly understand Arabic. I have named it: the great guides in the arranging of tenets, and divided it into an introduction, four paragraphs and a conclusion.\u201d\n\nNow, every sentence of this dogmatical treatise is followed by its rendering into Tamil. The translation therefore is not an interlinear one presenting the equivalents of each separate word and every suffix as is often the case in Malaised and Javanised Arabic texts, but a connected translation of complete periods, in full agreement with the syntax of the idiom used for the translation. But, it is almost superfluous to add, the language used shows an admixture of Arabic words and Persian terms such as is never found in non-Islamic Tamil writings.\n\nThe first question which presents itself is: why is the Tamil language indicated by the curious term Ariw\u012b? Evidently, it represents the Islamic name for the Tamil idiom. At first sight one might be tempted to identify it with Ariw\u012b, the language of Arvi in the Wardha Districts. But according to the Imperial Gazetteer (XXIV, 368):\u2014\u201cabout 86 per cent. of the population are Hindus and nearly 4 per cent. Muhammedans. The statistics of language shows that 79 per cent. of the population speak Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b; of the remainder 13,642 persons (in 1908) probably all Muhammedans speak Urdu, 25,710 Hindi (principally Br\u0101hmans and R\u0101jputs), 39,385 Gond\u012b and 2,428 Telugu.\u201d Arvi moreover does not belong to the Tamil area, and counts too small a proportion of Moslems among its population to give its name to a language used by millions in other parts of India. But, it is known that Aruwa is one of the thirteen countries, in which the inferior type of Tamil is spoken (un pays o\u00f9 l\u2019on parle le bas tamoul), and although the language of this translation is by no means the so-called kodun Tamil (the rude, unpolished form), I am unable to propose a more plausible derivation than that from Aruwa with the Arabic ending \u012b. Perhaps a better etymology may be given by some authority in Tamil matters; it may be added that in Hindustani arwa, being a Dakhni word, means: \u201cof or belonging to Malabar,\u201d which nearly indicates the Tamil-speaking country.\n\n1.

A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nI proceed to quote a few sentences of the beginning of the treatise in Tamil translation: for convenience's sake I abstain from using the elaborate Tamil characters. The Arabic preamble runs:\u2014\"Praise to Allah who created the creatures in order to know Him, and ordained them to follow His commands; prayer and greetings be on His apostle Muhammad the Prophet on whom His mercy be bestowed.\"\n\nThe Tamil translation runs thus:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{ella} & \\quad \\text{pugalum} & \\quad \\text{pugalciyum} & \\quad \\text{Allah Ta'ala} & \\quad \\text{ukku} \\\\\n\\text{all} & \\quad \\text{praise} & \\quad \\text{laudation and} & \\quad \\text{Allah Ta'ala} & \\quad \\text{to} \\\\\n\\text{padaippugalai} & \\quad \\text{padaittan} & \\quad \\text{tanai} & \\quad \\text{ariya} & \\quad \\text{wendi} \\\\\n\\text{creation (acc.)} & \\quad \\text{who created} & \\quad \\text{him} & \\quad \\text{to know} & \\quad \\text{for} \\\\\n\\text{tanudaya} & \\quad \\text{markattudu} & \\quad \\text{nadakkumpadi} & \\quad \\text{parimanan} \\\\\n\\text{his} & \\quad \\text{divine way in} & \\quad \\text{to walk like} & \\quad \\text{he ordained} \\\\\n\\text{Allah Ta'ala} & \\quad \\text{udaya} & \\quad \\text{salamum} & \\quad \\text{awanudaya} \\\\\n\\text{Allah Ta'ala} & \\quad \\text{of} & \\quad \\text{peace and} & \\quad \\text{his} \\\\\n\\text{tudan} & \\quad \\text{ukku} & \\quad \\text{namudaya} & \\quad \\text{nabiyar} & \\quad \\text{Muhammad} \\\\\n\\text{messenger} & \\quad \\text{to} & \\quad \\text{our} & \\quad \\text{Prophet} & \\quad \\text{Muhammad} \\\\\n\\text{rahmattanawidam} & \\quad \\text{awargalci} & \\quad \\text{kottiram} & \\quad \\text{awar} \\\\\n\\text{grace} & \\quad \\text{means} & \\quad \\text{to his} & \\quad \\text{tribe} & \\quad \\text{his} \\\\\n\\text{tolanmar} & \\quad \\text{awarudaya} & \\quad \\text{ummatukku} & \\quad \\text{undawatagawum} \\\\\n\\text{comrades} & \\quad \\text{his} & \\quad \\text{family to} & \\quad \\text{shall become}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nCertain portions which were illegible to me (a Tamil Moslem, no doubt, would be able to read them) I have left vacant. In the same manner the translation runs, ever increasing in its interpretation of the Arabic sentences, so that gradually it develops into an ample commentary, fifteen folios, till there comes an abrupt ending. The last page of these fifteen folios is not covered with writing; on the page immediately following a Malay dogmatical tract of six folios begins. Next come some Tamil pages containing different dogmatical and legal items, and some niyyah-formulae and wedding-formulae, the Arabic prayers being indicated either by Tamil or by Malay titles, on one page even by a Persian one. So we find here the four great Moslem languages united: the sacred Arabic for the formulae, the old literary Persian, which once was the court language in Northern India, the far spread Malay, which is both the intermediary language of all Indonesian nations of the Moslem creed, and the Islamised Tamil, the commercial idiom of the Dekhan.\n\nThe text further deals with the common dogmatical and mystical or divinatory subjects, which are usually to be found in so many Indian and Indonesian religious tracts. It would be extremely tiresome to enumerate the contents of this varied manuscript in detail; it may suffice to point out the characteristic parts only. So we pass by in silence the Malay portions on dogmatics and the mystic circles (so-called dairahs) and on the different\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nspirits (r\u016bh) as well as a treatise in catechism form on isl\u0101m and im\u0101n, which altogether takes up nearly one-third of the whole book. We will restrict ourselves to a summary.\n\nAfter a page filled partly with Malay, partly with Tamil and for the third part with Arabic, follows a small treatise in Arabic, concerning the Prophet Muhammad; each Arabic sentence being followed by its Tamil translation and commentary. Subsequently\u2014we omit prayers, some of them with a Tamil introduction\u2014a Tamil enumeration of the Muhammedan months and the luck attaching to them is succeeded by prayers and invocations, and this portion in its turn by a short Malay tract of dogmatical tendency. This joins on to an enumeration, in Tamil again, of the ancient prophets and of Muhammad's wives, which is concluded by a great magical quadrat, fully and completely elucidated by means of Tamil comments, i.e. an elaborate and crudely worded exhortation regarding sexual matters. It is very remarkable to find a page containing a Persian portion and a Tamil one, the former being preceded by a couple of lines in Arabic characters in a language which is neither Tamil nor Persian nor Hindustani, but presumably some other Indian idiom.\n\nNext there follows a Malay treatise dealing with nearly the same subject, viz. exceedingly intimate and confidential hints about coitus and allied items, and this treatise is succeeded by a Tamil portion of a divinatory kind, with a complete calendar. In order to give an idea of the transcription of Tamil in Arabic characters I mention now the numerals in both scripts. In the original diacritica marks are used Arabic characters.\n\n|   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1 | \u0648\u0646\u062f | ondru |\n| 2 | \u0627\u0631\u0646\u062f | irandu |\n| 3 | \u0645\u0648\u0646\u062f | mundru |\n| 4 | \u0646\u0627\u0644 | nalu |\n| 5 | \u0627\u0646\u062c | anju |\n| 6 | \u0627\u0631 | aru |\n| 7 | \u064a\u0636 | elu |\n| 8 | \u064a\u062f | eddu |\n| 9 | \u0627\u0646\u0636\u062b | onpadu |\n\nFinally the last folio, which is detached, but evidently belongs to the book, concludes with a Malay verse of the ordinary kind, on a lady and her birds, with some Javanese words, by a certain\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nTambi Mirah, who styles his poem Sha'ir Indra Dibawan, a name of no importance. The author pretends that the book was in the possession of an inhabitant of Batavia, but this assertion proves nothing regarding its real origin. Over the poem there is written a date, viz. A.H. 1192, 4 Sha'b\u0101n (1191 warusham Sha'b\u0101n masam 4 tiram) i.e. 29 August, 1767, and its owner's name a certain Kum\u0101ran with an illegibly written name of a town ending in puram, certainly not Singapura. This name, if it be one, is divided into three unvocalised words, viz.\n\nHaving completed my summary of the manuscript I wish to offer a few remarks on the question of its origin. The former proprietor, Professor Snouck Hurgronje, purchased it in Java. But, evidently, it was previously the property of a Moslem, to whom Malay was as familiar as Tamil, and to whom Persian was not an unknown language. An individual of this type one may expect to find in Singapore, at Pulau Pinang, in the Federated Malay States, in short, anywhere in British Malaya and islands, but certainly not in the Dutch Indian Archipelago, not even in Aceh. \"Habent sua fata libelli,\" and Malay books too may have their vicissitudes. I saw in Sumatra Malay manuscripts, which had been the property of descendants of the Sepoys, who on the cession of the Western parts of that island to the Dutch government went over from British to Dutch service. These books had been provided with interlinear comments in Javanese and in Arabic characters, so-called p'egon. Evidently this commentary was due to some later owner of Javanese blood. Almost any collection of manuscripts in Java comprises some books of remote origin, which one would hardly expect to meet with in this part of the world.\n\nThe manuscript which forms the subject of the present note must have been brought to Java by a native of that country. Through the agency of Dr. Snouck Hurgronje, late Adviser to the Netherlands-Indian government and now Professor of Arabic at the Leyden University, it has found its way to the University Library. As regards the original owner, we can only conjecture that he was a Tamil Moslem, who had dwelt long enough in Malaya to know Malay. But we cannot fancy the existence of a Tamil who lives long enough in a Malay country to master the Malay language so that it becomes equally easy for him as his own original idiom. It is obvious therefore that not he but a son of his, born in Malaya from a Malay mother, wrote this book. From his father he got his familiarity with Tamil, from his mother his knowledge of Malay, from both his Islamic creed. Such a man would be a typical representative of the immigrants who introduced Islam into the Archipelago.\nThese settlers, Dravidians or Guzeratis, married native women in the Peninsula and in the islands, and their sons, so-called _peranakan_, were familiar with the languages both of their father and of their mother. The former idiom they gradually forgot so that finally their only language was Malay. Their sons, in their turn, knew neither Tamil nor Persian, but understood and talked nothing but Malay.\n\nThis worm-eaten, slovenly written, manuscript, although neither very ancient nor specially important is a curious historical document belonging to the period when Islam was introduced from the _neg\u00e9ri di-atas angin_ (Persia and Hindustan) into the _neg\u00e9ri di-bawah angin_ (Malaya, Sumatra, Java and the islands further on to the East). It is a document bearing evidence of the great movement that swept away Hindu culture in the Indonesian world. It points to the Straits as the link between Southern India and the Archipelago. Consequently it seemed particularly fitting that an account of this manuscript should appear in the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nLeiden, March, 1921.\nThe Tiger-breed families.\n\nBy Zainul Abidin bin Ahmad.\n\nAmong the peasant population of Jempul, a settlement of Malay villagers along a river of that name in the Kuala Pilah District of negri Sembilan, there is a belief that certain families in the local tribe (suku) of Tiga Batu have a mysterious connection with tigers. Report has it that this belief is not peculiar to Jempul, but extends over a wide area in the Nine States\u2014Juasseh, Rembau, Tampin, Terachi, Gunong Pasir, Jelebu and Pantai. The writer however has not made a study of the belief in all these places, and this paper deals only with Jempul. For want of a better term I call the families in question \u201cThe tiger-breed families.\u201d\n\nThe belief is that members of the particular families become tigers after their death; a man becomes a tiger, and a woman a tigress. Thus, though the belief recalls the were-tiger and were-wolf stories which are widely known and believed in many parts of the world, it is not exactly the same: the one belief supposes the transformation to take place at will during life, and the other that it takes place only after death. In their life-time as human beings members of these families are said to be peculiarly related with certain tigers of the forest, whom they vaguely recognise as incarnations of dead relatives. These tiger \u201crelatives\u201d sometimes come to the compounds of their human kinsmen, protect their cattle from the attack of foreign tigers, their poultry from civet-cats (musang) and their paddy-fields or tapioca plantations from the ravages of wild-boars. The visitors are expected especially during the nights of Hari Raya, or when there is grave trouble in the family to which they belong. But it is seldom that many come together. Usually one or two represent the clan. Often a man will warn a friend belonging to one of these families, not to make mischief when he becomes a tiger. \u201cWhen your turn comes to become a tiger\u201d (i.e. when you die) he will say, \u201cI trust you will still remain a friend to me, and not do me or my folk and cattle any harm. Otherwise I will shoot you. If you require food, you are free to hunt your own fellows in the jungle. Why harm our human kind?\u201d Sometimes such words are spoken jestingly, but more often in a tone of deadly earnestness.\n\nAll this sounds as absurd as it is interesting. But all the villagers living within circumference of the families tell the same tale. They say that when a member of one of these families is ill, there is always one tiger at least haunting the neighbourhood of the patient\u2019s house (as though there had been telepathic communication between the two). He comes closer and closer as night approaches, and at such a time nobody dares to go out of the house unaccompanied. The compound of the Malay villager\u2019s house is\nusually surrounded with scrub and patches of low-lying shrubs: it is in these that the tiger has his hiding place during those anxious moments of the patient's illness. If the illness is serious, or the patient is dying, the tiger will show signs of trouble and uneasiness. He groans, makes piteous noises and restlessly moves from one end of the compound to the other. Occasionally in his seeming anxiety for the patient's condition, he encounters the human visitors who pass with their torches to or from the patient's house. But he is harmless, though the people have their hearts in their mouths. The dying patient in the house seems no longer conscious of his or her identity as a human being. He tosses about, grinds his teeth and looks wild, manifesting a hundred and one of the characteristics of a tiger, trying to force out a tail (m\u011bng-h\u0113jan ekor) from the coccyx, and often giving unmistakable responses to the signals from his tiger-friend below. Very often more than one tiger will come and make circuits round the house. With the first peep of day the inmates of the jungle betake themselves to the nearest bushes, showing themselves at times, and making their presence felt all through the day. The following night brings them back to their sentinel routine. But they are not to be harmed nor do they do any harm. The patient breathes his last and then all is silent till the burial is over.\n\nIn ordinary cases the prospective tiger dies peacefully, and then becomes a tiger. No one has ever cared or dared to go and watch what really happens at the grave during the few nights following the burial. They say that some days after the burial, the white shroud (kain kapan) of the buried body is found lying beside the grave, torn and tattered; and a hole of the size of a man's body is found to have been made into the grave, while the footprints of tigers are seen everywhere. From this it is concluded that the tigers must take the corpse and bear it (usong) into the forest where the metamorphosis takes place in some inexplicable way. A tiger representing the dead person makes his appearance shortly afterwards. Even if the person dies in another country, he comes home to his native village in the shape of a tiger, and announces his arrival through a dream to the principal member of the family. Soon after the announcement, a new tiger appears in the neighbourhood. There are characteristic marks on the tiger answering to the marks on the person when alive as a man. If the person had a deformed leg, the new tiger also has a deformed leg. If the person was bald-headed, the tiger also is bald-headed. He is also distinguishable as the personification of such and such a member of the family by peculiar gait and bearing or general build which are those of the dead person. These tigers understand and respond when called by their human names. I cannot illustrate this better than by a personal story. One night, many years ago, my grand-mother was troubled by a herd of buffaloes breaking again and again into her poorly-fenced compound where vegetables and young fruit-trees were sprouting. The moon was overcast, and the night was cool and calm. Repeatedly the old lady\ndrove the intruders away, but as repeatedly they returned. It happened that she had an old friend named Faseh who had died about a year before and was believed to have become a tiger. In her impatience, the old lady shouted out: \"O Faseh, my friend! If you really have become a tiger, please do me the favour of driving away these nasty buffaloes, and thus save my little garden from being destroyed.\" A few moments passed. Then all of a sudden, the buffaloes bellowed and rushed out of the compound helter-skelter for their life; while above the confusion rose the terrible roar of an angry tiger. We were panic-stricken in the little hovel where we lived, and the old lady felt sorry for having called the tiger. But for the rest of the night and for many nights afterwards the buffaloes never returned.\n\nAnother incident of a different nature illustrates the superstition. A Malay woman named Ba'idah, belonging to one of these tiger-breed families, had a dead brother, believed to have turned into a tiger. One night she dreamt that this brother in the shape of a man returned home from a long journey, very badly wounded in his chest by an accidental shot from a spring-gun (b\u00e9lantek-usa). He came up the verandah (s\u00e9rambi) and there lay groaning with agony and saying he was going to die. When she woke up in the morning she told her husband what she had seen in her dream. On opening the door leading from the main room to the verandah they found that all the verandah was besmeared with fresh blood. They suspected this was the blood of the wounded brother who had come home in the woman's dream. It seemed that the tiger had left the house only a short while ago. Calling their neighbours who came with guns and spears, they followed the track of the blood and foot-prints into the forest. They did not go far when they came upon the carcase of a huge tiger. The distinctive marks they found on the carcase assured them that it was indeed the woman's brother. The mortal wound was exactly in the chest, and appeared to have been inflicted the very same night. Many similar incidents are known throughout Jempul. Time and again it is related these family-tigers visit their relatives' houses during the nights of holy festivities, such as Hari Raya. Sometimes they manage to make their way into the kitchen, and feast over some r\u00e9bus k\u00e9rbau or ikan pindang that may have been left on the hearth. Morning comes to tell the tale from the traces they leave behind and the clean-licked cooking pots and dishes. This would make an interesting counterpart to the well-known nursery tale of Santa Claus who comes on Christmas eve to bring presents for children.\n\nThere are many little graveyards throughout Jempul which are credited with having produced tigers out of human corpses. Two of them deserve special mention, and these are Kubor Nesan and Kubor L\u00e9ban, situated in Kampong Tengah. These two are among many which have become highly revered by the ignorant masses. They pay their vows (niat) there, and propitiate the spirit of the place.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThey say that all the tigers springing from these graves are saints (*Harimau Keramat*) under the more saintly lordship of the great *Dato Paroi* whose abode is Gunong Angsi, as opposed to Gunong Ledang which has its own army of tiger-warriors and settlers. Fancy and superstition have associated endless tales and legends with these two leading personalities\u2014the Dato Paroi and Dato Gunong Ledang. Of them as of a few other tiger-tales I propose to speak in some future article.\n\nBelief in were-tigers whose transformation takes place during life, is general all over the Peninsula. But, as a rule, the power is ascribed to people of the Korinchi tribe from Sumatra. The possession of the power by a person is said to be indicated by the absence of the furrow (*alor*) which ordinary men have on their upper lip immediately below the nose. Tigers of this sort are called *harimau chenaku*, or *harimau jadi-jadian*. They change back into man just as the man changes into tiger. Sir Hugh Clifford in his book \"The Further Side of Silence\" relates a case of a Malay were-tiger.\nTwo Legends of Malacca\n\nBY R. O. WINSTEKT, D. LITT. (OXON.)\n\nThe \"Malay Annals\" (Shellabear's romanized S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu, 1909, Vol. I, p. 60) record how Sultan Iskandar was hunting near Bertam River, when a white mouse-deer kicked his hunting dog into the water. He chose this spot where mouse-deer were valiant for his new settlement and named it M\u0113laka after a tree (Phyllanthus pectinatus of the Order Euphorbiaceae) against which he was leaning at the time of the incident.\n\nNow there exists a similar Sinhalese legend of the founding of Candy, a hare and a jackal taking the place of mouse-deer and dog and the hare's courage being ascribed to recoil from a rock that intercepted her flight (Parker's \"Village Folk-Tales of Ceylon,\" 1914, No. 76, Vol. II, p. 3).\n\nIn the Hikayat Hang Tuah it is related how when they came to Malacca the Portuguese bought as much land as an ox-hide would cover and their captain cut it into strips and so got enough land to erect a large godown (J. R. A. S., S. B. 83, p. 122). Benfey has collected many parallels from mediaeval and modern literature and folk-lore; there is the famous tale of the founding of Carthage, the tale of Hengist in Geoffrey of Monmouth, and another in the French romance Melusine; there is the popular etymology of Hyde Park. Popular etymology erroneously finds the same origin for Bhutnair and Calcutta (Todd's \"Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan,\" II, 235; 1852). \"Thare-kettaya near the modern city of Prome was built 443 B.C. Its name has to do with a very ancient artifice. 'Facti de nomine byrsam taurino quantum possent circumdare tergo.' \" (Scott O'Connor's \"Mandalay,\" p. 301; London, 1907). American Indian attributed the trick to Europeans who bought land from them. In Sanskrit gotsharman (lit. cowhide) = \"a land measure, one hundred feet long and ten broad.\"\nHikayat Si-Miskin or Marakarma.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt, D. Litt. (Oxon.)\n\nThere are 5 MSS. of this tale at Batavia (van Ronkel\u2019s Catalogus,\u201d CXL-CXLIV): two at Leiden (Juynboll\u2019s \u201cCatalogus,\u201d CXII and van Ronkel\u2019s Supplement-Catalogus (1921) 13); one in the possession of the Royal Asiatic Society, London (\u201cEssays on Indo-China,\u201d Second series, vol. II, p. 35). It has been twice (1857 and 1894) lithographed and once (1915) printed in Malay characters at Singapore. It is the printed version I have used for this paper. Newbold mentions the romance and gives a brief synopsis\u2014\u201cBritish Settlements in the Straits of Malacca,\u201d vol. II, pp.328-330 (1839).\n\nMany writers have quoted Professor Snouck Hurgronje\u2019s dictum on the home of most Malay romances being \u201cthat part of South India which is also the source whence are derived the popular mysticism and the popular religious legends of the Muslim peoples of the East Indian Archipelago\u201d (\u201cThe Achehnese,\u201d vol. II, p. 122). At the same time few English scholars have adopted his method of analyzing and giving an outline of a tale, so that it may be accessible to students of comparative folk-lore most of whom are ignorant of Malay. Outlines in English are especially likely to be of value, because so many European and Oriental experts in the folklore of British India will have little acquaintance with Dutch; and it is those experts particularly who should be in a position to identify the sources of Malay borrowings.\n\nI give first an outline of the romance of Marakarma, to use its more apposite title, and I add comparative notes.\n\nIn Anta B\u00e9ronta, a land ruled by Maharaja Indra Dewa, lived a poor vagabond couple, Si-Miskin and his wife, erstwhile rajas from the heaven of Indra but exiled by the curse of Betara Indra. They were driven away with sticks and stones from palace and cottage and market-place, so that to allay their hunger they fed on plant-shoots and picked bundles of rice (k\u00e9tupat) and sugar-sticks from dust-heaps on the highway. When Si-Miskin\u2019s wife had gone three months with child, she longed for a manggo (emp\u00e9lam) from the royal orchard, and the Maharaja granted her husband\u2019s supplication for the fruit. Three months later she longed for a jack-fruit and again the ruler was gracious. She bore a son and named him Marakarma, because he was born in poverty. Digging a site for a hut her husband found a jar (tajok\u2019) full of gold. He went to the town and ordered shoes, a staff, clothes, horse and trappings, creese, sword and shield (otar-otar). Then after bathing he prayed to the dewa that a town might be raised up in the forest. His prayer was heard. He ruled over this town, Puspa Sari, with the title Maharaja Indra Angkasa, and his consort was\nstyled Ratna Dewi. She bore a daughter Nila Kesoma. The merchants from Anta Beranta brought fans, water-kettles, shoes, shields, creeses, spears, saddles and umbrellas. Incited by the jealous ruler of Anta Beranta lying astrologers tell Maharaja Indra Angkasa that his two children will work his ruin. They are driven into exile, with no possessions save a ring, a magic stone (gemala) and seven bundles of rice, the parting gifts of their heart-broken mother.\n\nAfter the departure of the two children, Puspa Sari is consumed by fire and its ruler with his consort left poor and homeless again in the forest.\n\nIn his exile Marakarma learns magic (kesaktian) from genies, botas, raksasas, dragons and snakes. The children come to a revolving hill where dewas play, and they sit down under a waringin tree. The boy catches a bird for his little sister. She wants it roasted. Her brother hearing the crowing of cocks goes in search of a house where he can get fire. The householder mistaking him for a thief, beats the young prince and throws him bound into the sea.\n\nNow the land to which the two children had come was Pelinggam Chahaya. Its ruler Raja Puspa Indra and his queen had a son, Mengindra Sari, who refused to wed. Hunting, Mengindra Sari finds Nila Kesoma under the waringin tree, weeping and holding a wild bird in her hand. His parents adopt her and call her Princess Unfolding Palm-blossom (Mayang Mengurai). Finally she marries Mengindra Sari. There is a dramatic passage describing how in his wooing the infatuated prince teases his young mistress over permission to enter his garden.\n\nOne day the young princess laments the loss of her brother Marakarma. In vain they search for him. Cast into the sea he had been borne by the tide to the shore of a land where a Raksasa and his wife lived in a house of hair and bones and batu hidup. This Raksasa had carried off Chahaya Khirani, daughter of Maharaja Malai Kisna, and was keeping her till she should grow big enough to eat. Three months at a time the demon travelled in search of food; three months at a time he abode in his hut. During his absence Chahaya Khirani finds Marakarma on the shore, and revives him. He woos her and promises to slay her demon captor. They bandy love verses (pantun). When the demon returns, Marakarma hides under his mistress' bed. The demon declares he can smell man but the captive princess denies it. The Raksasa lights a fire as big as a burning town, pours rice on to a mat 300 feet wide, and eats it along with spiders, centipedes, lizards, rats, flies and mosquitoes which overcome by the steam drop into the rice. He drinks a well of water, hiccups like\nthunder, picks from his teeth with a log chunks of food so big that they kill cat, goose or fowl by their impact. Then he sings so that the beasts in the forest flee. He asks his captive if her liver is big enough for him to eat. Instructed beforehand by her lover, she declares it will never grow big enough unless he gives her the livers of 100 animals to eat. The demon bids her kill the lice in his hair. With pincers and hammer she kills centipedes and scorpions which the demon has mistaken for lice; and eating fried beans and maize she pretends the noise she makes is the cracking of the eggs of the lice. The Rak-sasa and his wife go to get the livers of 100 animals but all have fled far from his singing. Marakarma digs a pit near the demon\u2019s hut, and sets it with caltrops. He piles up rubbish and lights an ijok fuse which will take three days to burn. He and his bride escape with the demon\u2019s property in a passing ship. Three days later the Rak-sasa seeing flames rushes home, falls into the pit and is killed.\n\nLustful for his wife and riches, the captain of the ship pushes Marakarma into the sea. A shark, asked by Marakarma to put him out of his misery, does obeisance and carries the prince in his belly in the wake of the ship till it reaches Pelinggam Chahaya. The shark sprawls on the beach by the jetty of the Fairy Godmother (Ninek Kebayan). An eagle instructs the old lady to put rice-grass (daun padi) on the shark\u2019s belly, whereupon Marakarma steps out. Ninek Kebayan tells him of the country, its ruler and the royal family. Marakarma guesses that Princess Unfolding Palm-Blossom must be his sister. He arranges cut flowers in posies. Ninek Kebayan sells one to Marakarma\u2019s wife on the ship, containing the hero\u2019s ring and a letter graved on flower-petals, bidding her go to the palace and tell Princess Unfolding Palm-Blossom of their straits. (The first posy she sold, Ninek Kebayan pretended was arranged by herself. Chahaya Khirani wants to be taught the art. To keep the old lady in countenance Marakarma sends a green fly with her on her next visit which buzzes over the bunch and settles wherever flowers should be stuck!)\n\nChahaya Khirani is invited to the palace, shows her husband\u2019s ring and tells of his plight. The king summons all people to a farewell feast to the wicked ship\u2019s captain. Miraculously provided with a steed a prince\u2019s attire and 40 followers, by means of a magic stone (g\u0113mal\u0101) given him by a bota, Marakarma goes to the feast. The householder who first cast him into the sea and the ship\u2019s captain are both executed (salangkan).\n\nTransported to Puspa Sari by the help of a magic stone, the hero finds his father\u2019s kingdom desolate forest. He meets his mother gathering firewood and stays with his parents in their forest hut. He reveals himself and prays that Puspa Sari be restored. His prayer is heard. He returns to Pelinggam Chahaya and fetches his sister and her husband and his own wife. Ninek Kebayan is twitted with her inability to walk and advised to get a\nyoung husband to carry her. The royal party set out for Puspa Sari in glass sedans (mongkor kacha) and on horseback and are met on the plain Tinjau-maya (\u062a\u06cc\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0648 \u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0627). Maharaja Indra Dewa fearful lest the importance of Puspa Sari eclipse that of Anta Beranta attacks Marakarma. Marakarma invokes the aid of seven genies, whom in his early exile he had met at lake Indra Semandra,\u2014Raja Mengindra Dewa, Dekar Agas Pri, Raja Kisna Indra Dewa, Raja Mengerna Lela, Raja Chindra Lela and his wife\u2019s brother Raja Bujangga Indra. A great battle ensues. Raja Gerdan Shah slays Raja Berma Gangga. Raja Rum Shah is captured and put to scorch in the sun, whereupon firing an arrow that brings rain and mist Raja Shah Pri releases him and ties Raja Bahrum Dewa in his place. The hero causes a town with fort and palace to arise by virtue of a magic stone given to him by Maharaja Dewa Angkasa on the revolving mountain. He encounters his jealous rival, the ruler of Anta Beranta. Each shoots arrows, that turn to fire and to rain that dott the fire, to dragons and to countless demons that devour the dragons. \u201cThunder rumbled and crackled faintly in the distance; a rainbow stretched across the heavens; stormy sunset clouds arose everywhere; rain drizzled; scale-like clouds were in the sky; the rain-bow was hardly visible; a breeze blew softly; the sunlight was yellow, and lightning now and again streaked the sky; black clouds gathered: portents all of a great prince\u2019s death.\u201d Maharaja Indra Dewa, ruler of Anta Beranta, fell slain, charging the victor with his last breath to have mercy on his daughter, Nila Chahaya. His wife and daughter and their women hurry on to the field. The wife stabs herself on her husband\u2019s body. Nila Chahaya is married to Raja Bujangga Indra and the young couple rule Anta Beranta. \u201cWhere are we going now?\u201d asks Ninek Kebayan. \u201cTo marry you to a vizier,\u201d laughs her mistress. \u201cWell,\u201d croaks the old dame, \u201cI did dream last night I was bitten by a snake.\u201d\n\nRaja Bujangga Indra takes his sister and Marakarma and a royal party to visit his father, Maharaja Malai Kisna, in the land Merchu Indra. The Maharaja takes his daughter and son-in-law seven times round the country on a seventeen-tiered throne (pancha-p\u0113rsada). Marakarma becomes Sultan of Merchu Indra.\n\nMengindra Sari becomes ruler of Pelinggam Chahaya.\n\nThe episode of lying astrologers is paralleled in the Hikayat Jaya Langkara, and the folk-tales Raja Budiman and Raja Denan. The episode of two children exiled, separated under a tree, the girl being found and married by a hunter prince and reluctant to tell of the loss of her brother until after her wedding, is found in a Sinhalese tale (Paker\u2019s \u201cVillage Folk-Tales of Ceylon,\u201d vol. II, No. 155 (a)), though details and conclusion differ. A packet of cooked rice is commonly a parting present to a banished child or prince in Sinhalese tales (ib. I, No. 7; II, 146 (a)). The incident of a prince incognito marrying a girl and taking her on a ship, be-\ning thrown overboard but rescued, and coming to a land where he is recognized and honoured, is found in numerous Indian tales (Steel and Temple\u2019s \u201cWide-Awake Stories,\u201d p. 138; F. A. Steel\u2019s \u201cTales of the Punjab,\u201d p. 129; Swynnerton\u2019s \u201cIndian Nights\u2019 Entertainment,\u201d p. 276; Knowles \u201cFolk-Tales of Kashmir,\u201d p. 167) which all commence with the banishment of two princes owing to a step-mother\u2019s cruelty. In a Sinhalese tale with a similar beginning (Parker op. cit. I, No. 7) it is a dried fish he had restored to the water which rescues the prince and put him on a sand-bank near to a \u201cflower-mother\u2019s\u201d house; the flower-mother discovers that the fellow who threw the prince overboard is about to marry the princess; the prince interrupts the wedding; his oppressor is quartered and the prince becomes a king. It is pretty clear that this Indian tale with its many variants is connected with the more elaborate composite Malay romance.\n\nThe comic interludes, in which Ninek Kebayan \u201cthe flower-mother\u201d is twitted, remind one of a passage in Raja Donan (J. R. A. S., S. B. XVIII, p. 242) and of the passage in the Hikayat Maharcja Bikrama Sakti (or Nakhoda Muda) where the princess\u2019 maids are frightened by the parroquet. The description of the demon Raksasa is spirited.\n\nThere are a few pantun in the romance, but to discuss the occurrence of such verse profitably it is necessary always to collate all available MSS. and determine if copyists have followed one original or preferred to substitute verses they happened to fancy.\n\nIn quoting parallels from Sinhalese folk-lore, one must remember \u201cthat stories which are current in central India, or the lower part of the Ganges Valley, or even the Panjab, as well as tales of Indian animals such as the lion, may have been brought direct to Ceylon by immigrants from Kalinga or Magadha or Bengal. Apparently it is in this manner that the evident connexion between the tales of Ceylon and Kashmir is to be explained, the stories passing from Magadha or neighbouring districts, to Kashmir on the one side, and from Magadha or Kalinga to Ceylon on the other\u201d (Parker, op. cit. vol. I, pp. 38-39).\n\nIt will be of interest to students of local folk-lore to learn that according to Perak legend Marakarma, the hero of the romance dealt with in this paper, built a fort of cockle-shells on the plain Anta-Beranta at the mouth of the Bruas River (cf. McNair\u2019s \u201cPerak and the Malays,\u201d pp. 23-24)! A Chinaman is said to have removed the shells to Penang and burnt them for lime.\nHikayat Indraputra.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt, D. Litt. (Oxon.)\n\nIn Journal No. 82 (1920), pp. 145-6, I discussed the date of the Hikayat Indraputra, preface my paper with references to the MSS. of that romance. Here I propose to give an outline of the story from the lithographed Singapore edition and to add notes on some of the incidents and sources of the tale.\n\nIndraputra was the son of Bikrama Puspa, ruler of Samantapuri, and his queen Jumjuma Ratna Dewi. Astrologers prophesied luck for him but declared that at the age of seven he would be separated from his parents and undergo many adventures; they advised that he should not play with animals. One day two craftsmen made the king fishes that swam and a golden peacock. The peacock flew off with Indraputra and set him under a pomegranate tree in the garden of Ninek Kebayan. When the old lady went to sell flowers in the palace, she took Indraputra, pretending he was her grandson. He was brought up by her and a childless vizier. The ruler of that country, Shahsian, speared a deer while hunting and noting how a fawn ran to tend its wounded dam thought of his own childlessness and ordered his viziers on pain of death to discover a means of getting him a child within 40 days. Indraputra volunteered to get from Berma Sakti a cure for the king's childlessness. He sets out. All the beasts of the forest bow to him and beg for help against their persecutor, a Raksasa, who dwells on Mt. Indra Gilan.\n\nHe comes to this bone-strewn mountain, whereupon a human skull warns him not to ascend and tells how the demon in the form of an old man had cut him down. The demon meets Indraputra in the shape of an old woman and offers him a sword: he cleaves the demon in two. The demon changes into a young woman: the hero resists her blandishments. The demon changes into a corpse beside a hill he creates. Indraputra ascends and enters a cave full of riches. He reaches the top of the mountain and descends on the opposite side into an orchard. He comes to a plain (Padang Lela Sri) beside Mt. Teraji where Muslim Genies feed, water and exercise their horses, and practise warriors' games, under Prince Nabat Rum Shah son of Dzahir Johan Shah. Infidel genies under Tamar Jalas the son of Tamar Boga trespass there. The two troops fight. Indraputra helps the Muslim Genies and slays Tamar Jalas. He is given princess Jajama\nRatna Dewi, sister of Nabat Rum Shah, in marriage. Anon he leaves on his quest. He comes to Lake Shamendiran (Samudari Juynboll) and sees corpses strewn under a large tree. One of the corpses warns Indraputra that a man-killing Raksasa lives by the lake whose coming troubles the water. Indraputra pretends to sleep and seizes the demon or fairy (p\u0113ri) by the hair. The fairy gives him a magic stone (guliga) which will raise storms, thunder and lightning; also he tells how once in seven days Princess Gemala Ratna Suri, the betrothed of Raja Dewa Lela Mengerna, bathes in the lake and how atop her bower is a magic stone.\n\nThe fairy bids Indraputra steal her jacket while she is bathing and demand the talisman as ransom. The fairy takes Indraputra to his golden bejewelled palace under the lake.\n\nNow Gemala Ratna Suri dreamt she was nipped by a dragon and her talisman stolen. She and seven serving nymphs (biduanda) don flying jackets and fly (followed by flying caskets of rice-paste and langir) down to the lake, where under a pomegranate tree hides Indraputra, having ascended by virtue of his magic stone from the fairy palace below the lake. The princess and her companions bathe. Indraputra steals their flying jackets and then by virtue of his magic stone descends under the water and nips the princess\u2019 toe. She ascends the shore with her attendants. In vain they hunt for their jackets. The princess waits biting her finger under a date tree. Indraputra bandies verses with the nymphs. At last the princess approaches and promises him the magic stone in return for the flying jackets. Seated on one of the flying caskets he follows the princess to get the stone. The girls enter the bower. Indraputra is left outside. He forces the seven gates of the seven fences, guarded by an elephant, a tiger, a lion, a rhinoceros, a dragon, a roc (Geroada) and Raksasas on horseback\u2014all mechanical terrors with jewelled eyes; their springs cut by the hero, they fall down. He is taken to a pleasance full of singing birds and bathes in a fragrant stream, attended by the nymphs. He is put to sleep in the hall called Rangga Puspa Brahi, whose walls are of glass and ceiling adorned with a tree wherein an owl sits.\n\nHe marvels at the wonders of Allah. The princess gives him the magic stone that can create a country with viziers and thousands of genies under four captains, Degar \u2018Alam leader of genies and fairies, Degar Kilat who in an instant can go to a far country or under the sea, Degar Agas who can fetch fire or wind, Degar Sru who can call down mist and lightning. To use the stone the hero must invoke the princess\u2019 ancestor, Dewa Lak Pri (\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0628\u0631\u064a) who lives in the sea.\nNow Raja Dewa Lela Mengerna got a deer while hunting and sent it to his betrothed. The messenger reported that the bower had been forced and there was a youth with the princess. Raja Dewa Lela Mengerna sets out to fight. Indraputra by means of the magic stone calls up rival forces and engages in single combat with the angry prince, calling rain to douse his rival's fire and so on. Nabat Rum Shah comes to his help. Raja Beatadzir (\u0628\u064e\u062d\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0646\u0650\u0631) Shah, father of the princess Gemala Suri, hearing she has entertained a mortal, is angered and prepares his armies, but the demon of the lake pacifies him. He settles the strife, and weds his daughter to her betrothed. Indraputra stays with the newly married pair. One day while they are hunting Dewa Lela Mengerna leaves Indraputra for a while and the hero falls asleep under a tree, where Tamar Boga flies off with him to cast him into the sea. Indraputra slays Tamar Boga and falling into a vast plain comes to a stream sweet as honey whose shell-fish (karang) accost him by name.\n\nHe eats the fish throwing back the shells which become alive again. A white lotus floats up and accosts him. He puts it in his turban, where it turns to rose-water and drips on his body. A red lotus floats up and then a blue; he wears both and they turn to scent. Fish and crabs greet him; he eats them and throws bones and shells into the water where they come to life. Flowers greet him; he plucks them and they turn to posies (gubah; malai). He comes to mountains of iron, tin, brass, silver, gold and gems respectively, on all of which birds welcome him. He comes to a mountain of fire and in despair uses his talisman to summon Dewa Lak Pri, whom he asks to take him back to Gemala Ratna Suri. It is a long journey, \"seven days' flight for a bird,\" and if he asks for water he will fall into the lake called Sea of Love (Bahar u'l-'Ashek), whose sands are of gold and banks of camphor, and mud of musk, and stones of jewels.\n\nOf course he asks for water and descends at the lake. On its waters are beflagged boats (pelang, lanchang) of gold and silver, and royal genies and fairies race them. By the aid of his talisman Indraputra creates a storm and sinks the boats, drowning many of the fairies; then to the amazement of the survivors he stills the storm and restores the boats and the drowned fairies. He comes to another lake Baharu'l-Waji (\u0628\u062d\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647\u064a) by which is an island Bahrum Dewa.\n\nOn that island is a girl chased by two men; she turns herself into a flower and they become pigs and try to eat the flower; she changes into a gem and the men into eagles which strive to seize the gem. A voice calls Indraputra. The gem falls into the lake and becomes a blue lotus; the birds change into dragons. All vanish. Four maids stand by the edge of the lake. They tell Indraputra that the princess was Seganda Chahaya Iram daughter of\nRaja Buang Shah, being chased by two suitors (mambung) Degar Akas and Ngedan Kilat, both of whom had been encouraged by her father while she was a child. By the advice of astrologers she had been put on the island along with a tablet (loh lazuardi): the astrologers had prophesied that a mortal Indraputra would solve the difficulty of the two suitors. Indraputra reads the writing on the tablet. The maids invoke the princess who rises to the surface a lotus and changes into a princess and talks to the hero. The two suitors appear in anger. Indraputra pacifies them and taking the princess to a well bids her look into the glassy surface. Her shadow becomes a princess identical with herself, who is named Seganda Chahaya Bayang-Bayang. The princess takes Indraputra on an elephant into her kingdom and all the people run to see, \u201csome with skirts half adjusted, some with jackets half donned, others with hair untied.\u201d The two suitors marry the two princesses.\n\nIndraputra comes to a mountain where is the treasury of Raja Bahrum Tabit (\u0635\u0644\u064a\u0646\u0647 v. Ronkel, \u0637\u0627\u0628\u0642 J.) guarded by a cobra (called \u0645\u0645\u062f\u0648\u0648\u062f J. and R.) which he kills. He enters the forty chambers and is attacked by a horse, a genie Zanggi Gerdan, whom he tames with genies\u2019 language. The horse tells him to take a talisman from the head of a glass casket containing a substance (\u0628\u062f\u064a \u0632\u0647\u0631) from the belly of the cobra: that substance will revive the dead.\n\nNow in the land of Zaitun (\u0632\u064a\u062a\u0648\u0646) ruled Raja Puspa Pandai, a Muslim genie, who had a son Detar (\u062f\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0631) Pandai and a daughter Chendra Lela Nur Lela: his subjects were apes and monkeys, sloths, squirrels and beasts of the forest, who by night became human beings. He puts his daughter in a guarded bower with a myna-bird and a parroquet to amuse her. The birds sought a husband for their mistress and thirty-nine suitors came and heard the fish sing in the pond beside the bower but fell severed from the bridge of swords which led up to it:\u2014the first suitor when sought was reading the romance of \u201cBaginda Shah \u2018Alam.\u201d Now Zanggi Gerdan flew with Indraputra to this bower and the hero entered it safely. He dipped his magic substance in water from a glass bowl (mundam) and restored the 39 suitors to life. The princess took him to her parents.\n\nIn Zaitun was a great dewa king, Raja Gohar (\u06af\u0648\u0647\u0631) Jin, who had a daughter Talela Mandu (Madu J.) Ratna he kept in a guarded bower on the plain of \u2018Aji. To this bower came the golden peacock, which had flown off with Indraputra, and told the princess of his prince\u2019s graces. She called a draftsman to draw his likeness. The peacock drew an outline on the draftsman\u2019s breast and the man copied it.\nAfter arranging that princess Chandra Lela Nur Lela marry Nabat Rum Shah, Indraputra departs on his steed and waters him at a pool where a dewa Malik Zahib waters his goats. Malik Zahib is angry. Indraputra by magic dries up the pool and at Malik Zahib's entreaty refills it with water. Talela Mandu Ratna sees him and sends her maid to ask Malik Zahib who he is. Malik Zahib prevaricates, but when the maid threatens his goat will die if he fail to tell, he reveals the name of his visitor. Her mistress tells her to take the golden peacock and pretend to sell him to Malik Zahib in the presence of the stranger prince. Indraputra recognizes the peacock and asks to meet the princess. Verses are bandied between him and the maid. At night his magic steed takes Indraputra into the princess' bower. Using the talisman given by Gemala Ratna Suri he calls up hosts to fight the guards set round the bower by Gohar Jin. A great battle ensues. Indraputra captures and throws into a trance 40 champions including Raja Ghuran Shah, whose sword is a foot broad. Raja Lela Mengerna, Raja Nabat Rum Shah and all the royal fairies and genies, whom Indraputra had helped on his travels, arrive. Raja Gohar Jin accepts the hero's suit for his daughter's hand. The 40 champions are brought to life by a talisman dipped in oil.\n\nIn Samanta Beranta ruled Raja Talela (\u062a\u064a\u0644: \u062a\u064a\u0644 J.) Shah, father of princess Sri Bulan, the sought of many suitors. In that land was a lake and by it a cave where dwelt a demon Ghuran Akas (\u063a\u0648\u0631 \u0643\u0634 J.) who roved and slew folk at night. Efforts to slay the demon and to block his cave failed. Astrologers declared he could be killed only by Indraputra. The ruler sent his sons Maharaja Derkas (\u062f\u0631\u0643\u0633) and Indra Jilani with a letter inviting Indraputra's aid. Indraputra set out, carrying his bride in a pearl casket, and followed by all the warriors and fairies he had helped. (The passage where Talela Shah asks his son if each passer-by in the procession is not Indraputra reminds of an exactly similar passage in the Hikayat P\u00ealondok J\u00eanaka (Malay Lit. Series 13, 1915, p. 65) where Raja Singa puts the same question to Raja Kra before Raja Mousedeer passes). Indraputra enters the cave of Ghuran Akas, lighting its depths by his talisman and slaying the huge demon. In the cave is a treasure chamber, on whose door is inscribed the name of Raksa Shah, ancestor of Raja Bahrum Tabut. It takes a month to traverse the cave, wherein is found a pleasance, a bower and a sea guarded by Derma Gangga who gives Indraputra a magic arrow. Indraputra marries Princess Sri Bulan. The pair are escorted seven times round the country on a seventeen-tiered platform (pancha persada).\n\nBahrum Tabut, ruler of \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0633 \u062f\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0644\u0647\u0648\u0644\u0633 hears how Indraputra has slain Ghuran Akas and sends him a challenge. Indraputra by magic twists the head of the messenger, an infidel.\ngenie, face behind, and sets out to meet his aggressor. On his magic arrow he shoots to the feet of Bahrum Tabut a tablet (loh lazuardi) found in Ghuran Akas' cave predicting death. Terrified Bahrum Shah seeks peace and welcomes Indraputra to his palace.\n\nIndraputra goes to the land of Raja Puspa Pandai and marries Nabat Rum Shah to Princess Chendra Lela Nur Lela.\n\nRaja Dewa Lela Mengerna tells Indraputra that to meet Berma Sakti he must shut his eyes and wish: opening them he will find himself on a plain under a great tree; to sleep under that tree is to invite death from the demon that lives in it; presently a light as of swords will be visible and that light will be Berma Sakti and must be followed. Indraputra observes this advice. The demon of the tree gives him a talisman that will save him from death and enable him to enter rock or timber. The light he follows turns into a pleasance, wherein dwells Berma Sakti surrounded by his pupils (murid). At the full moon Berma Sakti takes Indraputra to the lake Bahar-ulka (\u0628\u062d\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0643) and the island Maalim Khirat (\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u062e\u064a\u0631\u0627\u062a) where a white lotus to cure the childlessness of the ruler of Shahsian is to be found. On the way the pupils of Berma Sakti are scattered by a storm our hero invokes and he arrives before them on his flying horse. At the island he turns into a dragon and frightens them and calls down rain that wets them while he remains dry. Berma Sakti takes him to a pool where floats a white lotus. They all return to Berma Sakti's palace. At night Indraputra calls forth his three wives out of his magic pearl casket. Berma Sakti takes him to the plain Puspa Beranta where a throne mysteriously appears and a sword of its own accord slays the pupils whom Indraputra is ordered to revive with his charm (\u0628\u062f\u064a \u0632\u0647\u0631\u0649). The sword then chops them to pieces and Berma Sakti has to use his own magic stone (\u062b\u0645\u0634 \u0642\u0645) to restore them. Berma Sakti tells how the white lotus must be cooked as vegetable; if it fades, there is poison in the pot, for which he gives Indraputra a talisman that will serve as an antidote. He tells Indraputra to close his eyes and wish. So our hero finds himself back in Ninek Kebayan's untended garden. He presents the white lotus to Raja Shahsian. The jealous viziers poison the dish to kill him. He uses his talisman. He becomes court chamberlain. Two maids of the court eat plants that spring from the discarded seeds of the white lotus and become pregnant. The jealous viziers accuse Indraputra of seduction and set him and the girls adrift at sea on a raft. Raja Shahsian's queen bears a daughter, Mengindra Sri Bunga, and thirty-nine princes come to woo her.\n\nIndraputra's raft is broken in a storm; the girls are lost; Indraputra walking below the sea comes to the bower of an old prin-\ncess, Raja Dewa Al-Kafri (\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0641\u0631\u0649) grandmother of Gemala Ratna Suri, who gives him a cloth Samanta-Puri, (Sutrapuri Juynboll) which laid on the body of a sick person will effect a cure. After wandering seven years below the sea our hero returns to the country of Raja Shahsian and finds his daughter sick. The king proclaims he will marry her even to a slave if he can cure her. Indraputra cures her with his cloth. Then the jealous viziers and the 39 suitors urge the king not to fulfil his promise but to take the princess to the island Pelinggam Dewa and give her hand to the suitor who can catch her favourite parrot. Indraputra uses his talisman and calls genies to build a magnificent barge, which the princess chooses before those of other suitors for her voyage. He calls down a storm which troubles the others while his barge sails through calm waters. On the island the parrot is released. The princely suitors climb a tree (m\u00e9rangsi) to catch the bird. Indraputra fires a magic arrow that turns into wasps and bees which sting the suitors and makes them tumble to earth. Indraputra goes to the tree and the parrot alights on his hand. They return. The princes are defeated by Indraputra at sword-play. Ten of them waylay and slay him. His three wives issue in male attire from the casket wherein he keeps them and restore him to life by using the \u0628\u062f\u064a \u0630\u0647\u0631\u064a. Indraputra on his magic steed beats the prince on horse-back. Again they kill him and hack him to pieces. His three wives in male attire find the corpse and show it to Raja Shahsian. Later they revive him. He beats the princes at archery, his magic arrow creating a cloud and wind to disperse the cloud, fire and rain to douse the fire, the arrow returning each time to the quiver: by his magic the arrows of the princes cannot be drawn out of the quivers. Raja Shahsian prepares to marry his daughter to Indraputra, who sends for all the friends of his travels. The wicked viziers and the princes remove all weapons secretly by night and prepare to attack Raja Shahsian. Indraputra calls on Dewa al-Kafri and uses (tambangkan) his talisman, whereupon is created a country of fairies and spirits armed and mounted on horses and elephants. Also Indraputra\u2019s friends arrive in hosts. The wicked viziers and princes determine to flee by sea. Indraputra calls down storms that destroy their ships. Degar Agas from the air tells them who Indraputra really is, and they return and ask his pardon. He marries princess Mengindra Sri Bunga and finally, taking his four wives in the casket worn at his waist, goes down to a ship and sails to his parents at Samantapuri, where amid great rejoicing he is made Sultan.\n\nThe Hikayat Indraputra bears marks of being a pastiche, containing a number of folk-tales clustered round the person of the hero.\n\nFlying wooden peacocks are common in Indian folk-lore (Parker\u2019s \u201cVillage Folk-Tales of Ceylon,\u201d II, pp. 18-30, III, 88-91; Chavannes\u2019 \u201cCinq Cents Contes et Apologues,\u201d II, p. 378).\nIn one Sinhalese tale (Parker, op. cit. III, p. 194) there is a prince who astrologers say will be spirited away to wander, who is therefore carefully guarded, who is given a toy wax horse and flies off on it to the house of a \"flower-mother,\" the Malay Ninek Kebayan:\u2014the beginning of our tale though the rest of the story is quite different. The incident of a prince seeing a fawn run to its wounded dam is found also in the Hikayat Nakhoda Muda (J. R. A. S., S. B., 83). The incident of a speaking skull is found in the well-known Ht. Jumjumah where a skull addresses Jesus:\u2014the romance was translated in the \"Asiatic Journal,\" 1823. The theft of the flying jackets of a princess and seven attendant nymphs occurs in the Ht. Malim Deman (J. R. A. S., S. B., No. 83), and is the plot of a world-wide tale:\u2014Hartland's \"Science of Fairy Tales,\" ch. X; Parker op. cit., II, pp. 344-355. The talisman that can call up cities and people from the inane is common in Eastern folk-lore: Parker op. cit. III, p. 130; Natesa Sastri's \"Story of Madana Kama Raja,\" p. 20; \"Sagas from the Far East,\" p. 135. The transformation of a girl into a flower and a gem and of her pursuers into pigs finds parallels in the Hikayat Sri Rama, in \"The story of Madana Kama Raja,\" p. 2, and in Swynnerton's \"Indian Nights' Entertainments,\" p. 216; the transformation of a girl into a lotus in Stokes \"Indian Fairy Tales,\" p. 144. A luminous cobra-stone such as lights the cave for our hero is found in many Indian tales:\u2014Frere's \"Old Deccan Days,\" p. 36; Day's \"Folk-Tales of Bengal,\" p. 18; Jataka tale, No. 543, vol. VI, p. 94. So, too, the magic stone that dries up water (Parker, op. cit. II, pp. 14-15) and enables princes to visit palaces under the sea (L Behari Day's \"Folk-Tales of Bengal,\" p. 17). Of the quest for a flower as medicine I have written already (J. R. A. S., S. B., No. 82, pp. 147-8). \"In the Maha Bharata and Ramayana arrows are sometimes represented as returning to the sender, who in such cases was a being possessing supernatural power.\"\nHikayat Putra Jaya Pati.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt, D. Litt. (Oxon.)\n\nSo far as I have been able to trace, only two MSS. of this tale exist. One is recorded in Van der Tuuk\u2019s catalogue of Malay MSS. in the Library of the India Office, London: his account of it runs as follows:\n\n\u201cNo. 98 small 4 vo. Ht. Indra Jaya Pati. The hero son of Kalawandu king of a realm in the west called Langkam Jaya is carried off in his seventh year by a spirit in the form of a tiger to a mountain Mahabiru, where the tiger vanishes after handing him over to Narada to learn magic. When Narada turns himself into a giant and a garuda, Indra Jaya Pati alone of his pupils faces him. Finally the hero marries princess Chindra Nur Lela and is made heir apparent by his father under the title of Maharaja Bikrama Indra.\u201d\n\nThe other MS., which I have used for this paper, is in the library of the Committee for Malay Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Federated Malay States. The title reads Putra for Indra. A golden horse takes the place of the tiger. The MS. is written on blue ruled foolscap and the colophon records the copy was finished on Monday the 6th Shawal, 1238 A.H. in the year alif by Abdul-kadir ibni Hussin Mera, Jawi, of Kedah.\n\nThe following is a summary of this second MS.:\n\nRaja Kalawandu ruler of Langkam Jaya is childless. On the advice of astrologers he lavishes alms on religious mendicants till by their prayers his consort conceives and on Monday the 16th day of Rajab, while thunder rolls and a rainbow is seen and rain falls gentle, bears a son. Astrologers prophesy the child will have magic powers and be a mighty prince but a four-legged creature will soon divorce him from his parents till he reaches the age of thirty when he will return famous with many followers. He is named Putra Jaya Pati, and called Putra Jaya Pati Indra.\n\nOne day the king takes his son to a field to watch other children play. He falls asleep on his dais and the little prince runs off to play. A genie disguised as a golden steed, approaches the field; the little prince mounts and is carried off into the forest toward a blue hill (Gunong Mahabiru). There the horse, who is descended from the genie Afrit, vanishes after telling the prince he will join in wars with genies, fairies, demi-gods and demons and should climb the blue hill and study magic arts from Begawan Narada. He sets out and meets ascetics who feed him with bananas, manggoes, jackfruit, mangosteens and so on, and take him to the teacher, who foreknowing his advent sends his pupils to escort the prince.\nFrom Narada the prince learns all the magical arts of war, how to cause rain of fire and stone and weapons to descend. He turns a spike of grass (lalang) into a caparisoned steed and mounting practices the arts of war with the other pupils, turning the steed back into grass when night falls. One day Narada transforms himself into a large red-eyed demon. All his pupils flee except Putra Jaya Pati who engages him with arrows which turn into fire, rocks, steel, dragons. The demon turns into a roc (geroda); the prince into a harpy (walimana). At last Narada reveals himself and the fight ceases. One day thinking of his parents, Putra Jaya Pati weeps and asks leave of his teacher to go home. Narada gives him a magic casket out of which can be invoked four warrior genies with armies. He calls forth the four warriors\n\n\u0633\u06af\u06a9 \u0645\u0648\u06a9 \u0633\u06cc\u0631\u0647 \u0160ang S\u00ebtiara,\n\nto swear fealty to the hero. The hero departs, and traverses plain and forest till he reaches Lake Samandara, where fishes greet him. He eats shell-fish and casts the shells into the water whereupon the shell-fish come to life and laugh. He eats pomegranates from a tree hard by and casts the husks into the lake, whereupon at once they break into flower and fruit that ripens. A voice warns him. He looks and sees a skull. The skull says it was once a man, Bujang Juara, the servant of the hero\u2019s sire, who was killed by a demon as he slept under a tree at that spot. The hero pretends to sleep and worsting the demon takes his sword. He comes to a plain with a bright light in the centre and asks an old man Malik Indra whom he meets, what it is. It is the bower of Princess Chindra Nur Lela, sister of Indra Samandara Lela, and daughter of Raja Gangga Wijaya. The princess is betrothed to a mighty fairy prince, Raja Indra Warna, against her own and her parents\u2019 will. Malik Indra, guardian of the princess\u2019 garden, invites the hero to his house and takes him to bathe where the princess bathes. He spies on the princess through the wall as she comes to the garden. The princess sends a maid to invite the wife of Malik Indra to accompany her to the garden called Kesoma Angsoka. The maid faints at the sight of the hero\u2019s beauty. Another maid fetches the old lady who tells who her adopted son really is. The princess falls in love with her description. The old lady goes home.\n\nThe princess sends her maid Dang Sangkurana (\u062f\u06a0\u0633\u06a0\u0643\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646) to beg her to detain her adopted son, and invite him to be a spectator of games on the morrow so that she may get a glimpse of him. The hero tells the old lady that if the princess is anxious for a love affair he must see her that night and bids her take a message to the princess:\n\nBasahan sambil berdiri,\nKain pualam di-dalam astana.\nSurohan dari-pada tuan puteri\nSekarang malam beta ka-sana.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nThe princess replies:\n\n*Tetak bengkowan sa-b\u00e9rang sana,  \nT\u00e9rp\u00ebnggal ka-batang p\u00e9lpari.  \nJika tuan orang bijaksana,  \nSilakan abang chuba ka-mari.*\n\nShe prepares a feast and gorgeously attired reclines on her couch reading the romance called \"Perbu Jangga.\" Our hero takes a spike of grass and turning it into a flying steed flies and enters her bower. He speaks in verse:\n\n*Ch\u00ebmp\u00e9dak b\u00e9rbuah di-dalam p\u00ebkan,  \nM\u00ebmb\u00e9lah-b\u00e9lah t\u00e9gah p\u00ebmctang.  \nJika tidak pun di-p\u00e9rasilakan,  \nM\u00ebn\u00ebngar sudah tuan beta datang.*\n\nThe waiting-maids reply:\n\n*Buloh di-b\u00e9lah di-t\u00e9pi kota,  \nM\u00e9lpari ch\u00ebnd\u00ebrong ka-lubok.  \nOleh itu-lah patek p\u00ebrs\u00ebmbahkan  \nDari-pada b\u00ebrdiri ba\u00efk-lah dudok.*\n\nHe walks past the princess' curtains, saying:\n\n*Ch\u00ebmp\u00e9dak di-karang Dang K\u00ebmbayat.  \nB\u00ebkas b\u00e9radu di-dalag bilek.  \nSiapa g\u00ebrangan m\u00ebmbacha hikayat  \nSuara-nya t\u00e9rlantas ka-rumah Malik.*\n\nThe princess accosts him:\n\n*Bunga di-karang oleh dang M\u00ebrdu Lela  \nAkan sunting di-dalam ch\u00ebmbul.  \nSiapa g\u00ebrangan b\u00ebrtanya itu?  \nMadah-nya datang s\u00ebrta chumbu.*\n\nThey feast and bandy love-verses. At last the hero calls to his steed and returns to Malik Indra's hut. He wanders and finds two genies atop a hill disputing whose shall be a bow and magic arrow, one having found the bow and the other the arrow. The arrow can be called by the archer. Our hero offers to settle the dispute, and discharging the arrow bids them race for it, but he himself recalls it to the bow and takes it to Malik Indra's house. His intrigue with Princess Chindra Nur Lela is disturbed by the arrival of her affianced suitor. The princess' father Raja Gangga Wijaya sends to fetch her but she refuses to go. The hero calls forth the four warrior genies from the casket Narada gave him and they and their soldiers defeat all Raja Gangga Wijaya's men, while the hero toys with his beloved. Raja Gangga Wijaya in despair informs his daughter's suitor. A great battle ensues. One side is ranged in the battle order known as \"the writhing dragon\" (naga b\u00e9rb\u00e9lit), the other in the order of \"the gnashing dragon\" (naga b\u00ebrgigit). Arrows are fired that turn to fire and rain and so on. The hero and his rival change into many-headed many-\nhanded demons, dragons, snakes. Indra Warna fires his magic arrow Dewa Laksana, which Putra Jaya Pati spits at and turns to water. Putra Jaya Pati fires the arrows given to him by Narada and slays Raja Indra Warna, whose army is broken and flees.\n\nRaja Gangga Wijaya and his son Raja Indra Samandra Lela had refrained from helping Indra Warna because he had started the battle without consulting them.\n\nPutra Jaya Pati feasts with his warrior genies and takes his ease with the princess.\n\nNow a genie who saw the battle had flown and announced the tidings to the forty princes who had been fellow pupils of the hero under Narada. They take leave of their teacher and come in a cavalcade to visit Putra Jaya Pati. Two go and make peace with the princess' father and take the hero into his presence. Putra Jaya Pati weds the princess and is escorted seven times in a seven-tiered car round the palace. All the women run to see him and fall in love with him\u2014a passage recalling the account of the admiration of women for Hang Tuah, given in the S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu and Ht. Hang Tuah.\n\nThe hero takes his bride to the home of his parents, passing on the way a subject kingdom Beranta Pura Nilam Dewata. His father abdicates and he becomes ruler of Langkam Jaya with the title Maharaja Bikrama Indra Dewa or Paduka Sri Sultan Putra Jaya Pati Sifat Ala'u'd-din Shah.\n\nIn plot this romance is little more than a short redaction of the Hikayat Indraputra. The princeling who astrologers prophesy will be carried off by a four-legged creature, who on his travels eats shell-fish that come to life when the shells are cast back into the water, who is warned by a skull that a fierce demon haunts the lake, who defeats the demon by pretending to sleep, who stays with a gardener and flies by night into a princess' bower, who is helped by warrior genies in his fight for the princess' hand, who returns home at last with his bride and succeeds his father as Sultan\u2014all these episodes occur in the longer romance.\n\nParallels to the tale from Indian folklore are given in my article on the Hikayat Indraputra in this number of the Journal.\n\nThe many quatrains in the tale should be of interest to students of the pantun.\nHikayat Indra Bangsawan.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt D. Litt. (Oxon.)\n\nThere are six MSS. of this tale at Batavia (van Ronkel's \"Catalogue,\" pp. 191-194), one of which has been published in Romanised Malay by the \"Commissie voor de Volkslectuur\" and used by me for this paper\u2014it is, if I may say so, a defect of the \"Commissie's\" publications that they do not record from which Mss. their texts are printed. There is another Ms. at Berlin (Koenigl. Bibliotheek, Collection Schumann V, 21).\n\nLithographed editions were published in Singapore in 1310 and 1323 A.H.\n\nThere is also an Acehnese version (Snouck Hurgronje's \"The Acehnese,\" vol. II pp. 145-7.)\n\nI give an outline of the romance with parallels from Indian tales:\n\nIndra Bangsawan, ruler of Kobat Shahrial was childless. In answer to prayers of the pious his consort Siti Kendi bore twins, Shah Pri and Indra Bangsawan. With the elder was born an arrow, with the younger a sword. The boys learnt religion from Mua'alim Sufian and studied the arts of war. Their father fears jealousy and strife if he selects openly one of his sons to succeed him. So he tells how he has dreamt of a magic bamboo instrument (buloh p\u00e9rindu) and how whoever gets it is fated to be king. The boys go on the quest and are parted in a storm.\n\nShah Pri comes to a deserted bower and finding a drum beats it. A princess hidden in the drum bids him refrain. He slits the drum and out steps Princess Dewi Ratna Sari. She explains how the country of her father Raja Asik-Asikin has been destroyed by a roe (g\u00e9roda) and how she and her eight maids in a casket (ch\u00ebmbul) had been hidden in the drum. Shah Pri kills the roe with his arrow and weds the princess.\n\nMeanwhile Indra Bangsawan comes to a cave, enters it and finds a garden with a house inhabited by a demon (rak\u00e1sa), who receives him hospitably. The demon tells him he is in the country Anta Beranta ruled by Raja Kabir but subject to a monster, Buraksa, who claims any child born to Raja Kabir. Nine princes are suitors for Ratna Kemala Sari, the daughter of Raja Kabir, who will give her to him who can slay Buraksa and brings as evidence of his death the seven eyes and seven noses of the monster. The friendly demon gives Indra Bangsawan a magic garment which will change him into any shape, and a charm (isharat) which will take him to Anta Beranta. He chooses the guise of a\ncurly-haired jungle boy, and is made the slave of Ratna Kemala Sari, who calls him Hutan, \"Jungle,\" and gives him two goats. She relates how she is fated to be freed from Buraksa by Indra Bangsawan and how she is a cousin of Dewi Ratna Sari, whom Shah Pri has rescued from a roc.\n\nRatna Kemala Sari falls sick. Astrologers declare that only the milk of a tigress that has just whelped will cure her eyes. Hutan pours goat's milk into a bamboo and hangs it on a tree; then resuming his former shape he sits beside the tree. The nine princely suitors see the vessel of milk and ask what it is. \"The milk of a tigress who has just whelped,\" says Indra Bangsawan. \"The owner enjoined that it may not be sold but given only to any person who may be willing to have his thigh branded.\" The nine princes submit to branding, and get the milk. But the medicine-men declare it is only goat's milk! Meanwhile the friendly demon (raksasa) gets a tigress' milk for Indra Bangsawan. In the guise of Hutan he takes it to the princess and tells how hunting for his straying goats he had found it hanging from a tree. The sight of the princess is restored.\n\nThe time comes to deliver princess Ratna Kemala Sari to Buraksa. Her father builds a bower outside the country with an iron tank beneath its steps, as a place where Buraksa can drink water impregnated with iron and the nine suitors can fight for the princess. Hutan follows his mistress and she changes his name to Kembar. He gets his friendly demon to help him slay Buraksa. The demon gives him a black (hijau) horse, Janggi Harjin, whereon Indra Bangsawan rides as a prince to his mistress' bower. Instructed by the demon, he ties the bridle of his horse to the water tank so as to noose Buraksa when he comes to drink, and bids the horse kick the monster. He pretends he is a nameless wanderer come to see the nine suitors slay Buraksa. But he takes the terrified princess in his arms when Buraksa arrives. Buraksa is noosed. Indra Bangsawan slays the monster, cuts off his seven noses and seven eyes and rides away. The nine suitors come and finding eyes and noses gone, cut off ears, scalp, fingers, hands and feet as evidence of their prowess. Indra Bangsawan having reentered his magic garment arrives with the eyes and noses of the monster, modestly saying he had kicked against them in the jungle and taking them for the skin of an ant-eater (tenggiling), had brought them for the princess to burn in her incense. The prince gives his daughter to Si-Kembar in return for his two acts of prowess. Si-Kembar pretends still to be a jungle slave and refuses to marry her.\n\nThe nine suitors attack Anta Beranta, sending a rude letter which read by the priest Shaikh Aladin rouses the ruler's ire. Si-Kembar hurries by night to the friendly demon for sword and steed. At dawn \"before the stars have faded, or beasts wake to seek their prey or birds start to preen their feathers\" the armies\nmeet. Indra Bangsawan saves the day, charging \"like a scorpion into fire.\" Then he vanishes. The next day he saves the fight again, and again vanishes. No one knows who he may be. Si-Kembar is missing from the palace. They guess he is the hero. Raja Kabir is hard pressed while Si-Kembar stays five days at the friendly demon's house. At last Raja Kabir alone is left in the field. Finally Indra Bangsawan comes, escorts him into the fort and alone faces the nine suitors whose men have all fled. They recognize him as the prince who sold the goat's milk. He reveals his name. They beg for pardon and that he may not reveal the shame of their branding.\n\nIndra Bangsawan visits the friendly demon, dons his magic raiment and returns to the princess as Si-Kembar. Raja Kabir asks why their marriage is not consummated. The princess says Si-Kembar is unwilling. The kathi sentences both to be imprisoned in a cage in the palace. In the night Si-Kembar (the jungle boy whose race never bathes!) feels hot and uses the princess' bathing water, slipping out of his magic raiment. The princess marvels and asking to be released tells her father. Her father bids her pretend to sleep and seize Si-Kembar's magic raiment. The device succeeds. She recognizes in Si-Kembar the prince who slew the monster (buraksa). He is taken to Raja Kabir but pleads for three days' grace to visit the friendly demon. He calls his magic steed which comes miraculously. The princely demon gives him a magic stone, which will give him whatever he desires, even a kingdom and people under the command of Dekar Sari and Dekar Dewa. Indra Bangsawan journeys to Anta Beranta Permana where he orders the two Dekars to make him a kingdom with a court and people and a bower with a bridge of gold up to the bower of Dewa Ratna Kemala Sari, and to inform her father that on the morrow when the nine princes have come the wedding feast will begin. In due course Indra Bangsawan and his bride are enthroned on a seven-tiered stand (pancha-persada) and taken in procession and married by Kadzi Fa'alud-din. The bride is magnificently arrayed:\n\nb\u00ebrbaju k\u00ebsumba murub pinar \u00e9mas, b\u00ebrurap-urap sari jayeng k\u00ebkatun, b\u00ebrp\u00ebdaka susun t\u00e9lor, b\u00ebrtali leher tiga b\u00eblit, b\u00ebranting-anting kasno jano\u00eb p\u00ebrbuatan Sailan, b\u00ebrchinchin p\u00ebrmata di-apit d\u00ebngan intan ikutan Sailan, b\u00ebrg\u00eblang tiga sa-b\u00eblah p\u00ebrbuatan Pariaman, b\u00ebrkilat-kilat bulu naga suir, b\u00ebrs\u00ebkar suhun, b\u00ebrsifat alis manisan b\u00ebrch\u00eblak s\u00ebni bibir-nya merah b\u00ebrt\u00ebmu urat. dan gigi-nya sap\u00ebrti d\u00eblima m\u00e9r\u00e9kah lidah-nya sap\u00ebrti ch\u00e9rmin.\n\nIndra Bangsawan pretending to visit his goat, goes and begs the magic bamboo instrument (buloh p\u00ebrindu) from the friendly demon and takes leave of his parents-in-law, purporting to take his bride to visit his own parents, and his brother Shah Pri with his bride Dewi Ratna Sari. But by the magic of a sister of the monster (buraksa) whom Indra Bangsawan had slain, he and his consort fall sick unto death.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nNow one night Shah Pri dreamt he met Indra Bangsawan on the top of a high mountain. Next day he sets out to find him, taking a magic stone which dipped in water renders it efficacious to cure folk sick unto death. Disguised as a shaikh he enters Anta Beranta Permana and after curing Indra Bangsawan hands him magic water to cure his bride. In gratitude Indra Bangsawan bestows on Shah Pri his own magic stone that can create a kingdom. Accompanied by the nine princes, they set out and visit Dewi Ratna Sari and the hero\u2019s parents. Indra Bangsawan presents the magic bamboo instrument to his father who abdicates in his favour. All live happily ever afterwards.\n\nPrinces being born, one along with an arrow the other with a sword, find many parallels in Malay and Indian literature (Winstedt\u2019s \u201cLiterature of Malay Folk-lore,\u201d p. 30). The incident of a land destroyed by a roc (garoda) occurs also in the Hikayat Maalim Dewa (ed. Winstedt and Sturrock, pp. 9 and 94-97 and Snouck Hurgronje\u2019s \u201cThe Achehinese,\u201d vol. II, p. 127.)\n\nIn his paper on the Romance of the Rose in Malay literature (Tijd. v. Ind. T. L. en Vk., deel LIV, afd. 5 and 6) Professor van Ronkel has pointed put how several episodes, the search for the magic bamboo and for a medicine, and the incident of the branding, occur also in the Hikayat Gul Bakawali, a Malay Romance from the Hindustani version of 1702 A.D. by Nihal Chand (Garcin de Tassy, Histoire de la litt\u00e9rature hindoue et hindoustanie, tome II, p. 468) of which there is also a Ceylon folk version (Parker\u2019s \u201cVillage Folk-Tales of Ceylon,\u201d vol. I, No. 22, pp. 173-177). Again in the Hikayat Pekar Madi (van Ronkel\u2019s Catalogue of Malay MSS. at Batavia, pp. 167-171) occur the episodes of branding and of a quest for medicine for a prince. There are many parallels in Indian folk-lore for incidents in the Hikayat Indra Bangsawan. In Knowles\u2019 \u201cFolk-Tales of Kashmir\u201d (2nd ed., p. 365) a prince disguised as a gardener is married by a princess. Her relations jealous at this arrange a hunt and leave the hero only a vicious mare to ride. He reached the jungle first, shot jackal, bear and leopard, and cut off the tail of the first, the nose of the second and the ear of the third, which he produced when the others who had shot no game exhibited the three corpses as evidence of their prowess (Cf. an episode in the Hang Tuah, J. R. A. S., S. B. 83, p. 117). In Mary Stokes\u2019 \u201cIndian Fairy Tales\u201d (p. 41) a prince born with a removable monkey-skin has it burnt by his wife and retains his human form; (p. 130) a similar hunt is arranged, the prince disguised as a labourer brands the backs of the six princes, who had found no game and begged a meal from him, and afterwards exposes them.\nHikayat Parang Puting\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt D. Litt. (Oxon.)\n\nAll the recorded MSS. of this tale are in English libraries. There are two copies in the library of the India Office and one in King's College Library (J. R. A. S., S. B. No. 82, 1920 p. 156; Essays relating to Indo-China, 2nd series, vol. II, p. 53). Mr. R. J. Wilkinson has given a MS. of it to Cambridge University Library. The present paper is founded on a MS. in the possession of the Committee for Malay Studies, Kuala Lumpur. This MS. is modern (1920 A.D.) written in Singapore but exhibiting in patek apa to express the plural \"all your servants\" traces of a Kedah copyist: it fills 139 pages of a note-book.\n\nThere are no references to Allah or Islam in the tale. Betara Brahma is the Supreme God and the world is governed by the \"high great gods\" (dewata mulia raya). There is mention of a silambara (Skt.) where a princess chooses a husband from a crowd of rivals.\n\nThere are only two quatrains in the tale, uttered by the hero when he is on the prince's raft beset by dragons:\n\nDian dua, damar pun dua,\nTanglong di-rumah Dewa Laksamana.\nDiam juga, sabar-lah jua,\nAda untong tiado ka-mana.\n\nEnche' Baya selendang batek,\nPandai mengarang bunga di-ukir.\nAdohai tuanku! junjongan patek!\nJangan-lah tuanku berbanyak fikir.\n\nThe process by which a pleasance is created by a magic stone is described as putting the stone exposed on the spot where the pleasance is wanted: by taking it up the hero causes the pleasance to disappear (Maka Mambang Dewa Keinderaan pun mengambil guliga hikmat-nya yang di-tambangkan-nya pada taman itu: maku taman itu pun ghaib-lah dengan sa-ketika itu juga.)\n\nThere are numerous Indian parallels for the main plot, tales of a prince who buys a snake, a parrot and a rat (Jataka, No. 73, vol. I, p. 178) or kitten and snake, or cat, otter, rat and snake, and is taken in all the tales by the snake to his father the king of the snakes who gives the hero a ring that will create a palace and kingdom and bring him a royal bride. (The Story of Madana Kama Raja: Natesa Sastri, p. 20; Boddington's Folklore of the Santal Parganas p. 88; Thornhill's Indian Fairy Tales p. 67; Mrs F. A. Steel's Tales of the Punjab, p. 185; Knowles' Folk-Tales of Kashmir, 2nd ed., p. 20; Parker's Village Folk-tales of Ceylon, vol. III, pp. 127-131.)\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe incident of a dragon growing too big for a river occurs also in the Perak folk-tale *Raja Budiman* (ed.\u2014Clifford, Singapore, p. 5) and in the Achehnese *Hikayat Banta Ahmat* (Snouck Hurgronje\u2019s \u201cThe Achehnese,\u201d vol. II, p. 142).\n\nThe following is the outline of the story:\n\nPrince Dewa Laksana Dewa ruled in fairy-land. His consort Chahaya Khairan bore a beautiful daughter Putri Langkam Chahaya. One day when she was plucking flowers in the pleasance, a fairy (*dewa*) Mambang Indra Segara espied her and fell in love. He cast a spell on a grass-hopper and sent him to fly and settle on the princess and awaken in her thoughts of love. Then wearing his creese and burning \u201cas if he would set fairy-land afire,\u201d he entered the pleasance. The princess sent a maid to call him. His hot words of love call forth her reproof and she bids him seek her parents. He flies away in dudgeon and resolves to bring a sickness upon her. He is sleepless till the dawn when \u201cthe cocks crowed, the birds of paradise (*chenderawaseh*) sang in the heavens, parrots sang in the *angsoka* trees, parroquets on the boughs of the *nagasari*, mynahs on the *chempaka* trees and a drizzle of rain made all the flowers in the garden bloom.\u201d\n\nAfter waiting seven days he charms (*puja*) a frangipanni flower and throws it into the bosom of the princess as she and her maids are picking flowers. She becomes pregnant. Her father curses her and changing her into the form of an ugly mortal woman casts her down into the world. She bears a child in the forest. She lives in an abandoned hut, at first begging rice and cooking-pots and later pounding rice for hire. One day in her absence, while her boy is playing under the house, a stranger offers to sell him a young snake for half a coconut-shell full of rice. He buys the snake and makes it his plaything day and night. Another day he buys a young hawk and later a white rat. The snake grows the horns (*chula*) and claws of a dragon. The boy rides about on the dragon\u2019s back and other children give fruit in return for permission to play with the hero. The harbour-master (*shahbandar*) hears of it and sends for the boy who goes riding on his dragon with the young hawk flying above his head and the white rat following. He is given fruit and rice and raiment. The Raja of the country hears of the marvel and sends for the boy to come on his dragon. He bestows on him rice, raiment and two slaves (*sahaya*).\n\nOne night the dragon who has grown so big he cannot bathe in the river without flooding the country decides to run away to the lake where his father and himself live. His little master follows and overtakes him. The dragon\u2019s grandsire, a terrible beast, gives him a ring out of his mouth which in a moment can provide food for a thousand men. He bids the boy call upon his whilom plaything if ever he needs his help. The hawk and the white rat take leave of their dragon playmate.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nThe hero's mother is in great distress at the disappearance of her son. On his return he loses his way in the forest. His dragon's granddam, angry at hearing that the magic ring has been given to the boy, sends a warrior dragon to ask for it back in return for a magic stick. The dragon finds the boy. When he goes to bathe in a pool, the boy seizes the stick and striking the pool thrice prevents the dragon from leaving it. He hurries away, taking the magic stick. He hears the sound of men felling in the jungle and going near espies a masterless knife (parang puting) felling a tree. At sight of him the knife runs off to a hut where an old man lives. The hero spends the night at the hut and shaking his magic stick provides food for them both. The old man gives him in return for the magic stick his knife which will obey all behests and can enlarge itself and fight foes. Our hero reaches home and goes to pay his greeting to the harbour-master. Always he provides cooked food for his mother and himself by means of the magic ring.\n\nNow the ruler of the country, Raja Indra Mahadewa was childless. He went to the island Chahaya Permana (\u0641\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646) to pay vows that he may get an heir. He and his consort bathed in a lake on the island, prayed and burnt incense. Betara Kala heard the prayer and dropped a manggo in the king's path as he went up from the lake. There was no manggo tree in the neighbourhood. The king accepted it as a sign, and he and his wife partook of the fruit. On their return a dragon bars the bark's way and the king induces him to desist by promising that his child if a girl shall be the dragon's wife, if a boy his friend. The queen bears a daughter \"Princess Mengindra, First Day of the Moon.\" The dragon king sends a lobster to see if the king has got a child. The lobster hiding at a royal landing-stage hears maids grumbling at having to carry up bathing water for the princess. He bids a prawn enter one of the water-vessels and report on the beauty of the princess. The lobster conveys the tale of her loveliness to the dragon king. The dragon king sends one of his warrior dragons to block the estuary of the country of Raja Indra Mengindra and flood the land so that he may remember his promise. A warrior goes down to the estuary and questions the dragon. The king asks for three months' grace, wherein to prepare for the nuptials. His viziers advise him to offer his daughter's hand to whosoever can worst the dragon king. The king sends missives accordingly to the neighbouring princess and all accept the offer. He puts his daughter on a raft in an iron chest and all the princes who have accepted the challenge on other rafts and sends them down to the estuary where the dragon waits. Leaving the hawk and the white rat to look after his mother, our hero takes his magic ring and knife and goes aboard the princess' raft where he is allowed to stay. At the estuary the waiting dragon scatters the rafts of the princes with his breath and bids our hero leave the raft of the princess.\nThe princess promises him her hand if he can worst the dragon suitor. He bids his magic knife decapitate the dragons who approach the raft. The princess and her maids are hungry. The hero's magic ring provides food. He invokes his young hawk and all the hawk tribe fly off with the raft back to the shore, pecking the eyes of all dragons that approach. The king of the dragons sends a huge warrior dragon who swallows the raft with all its crew. The hero by means of his magic ring provides food and lamps. The hawk flies and tells the white rat of his master's predicament. The white rat seeks Mambang Indra Segara who comes with his forces. A great battle follows. The dragons kill the fairy warriors with the blasts and fires of their nostrils. The fairies slay the dragons with arrows. Mambang Indra Segara bids the young hawk enter the dragon's belly and see if his grandson and the princess are alive. The young hawk protests that he is unable and the white rat enters and finds them still alive. The hero bids him tell the fairies to attack the other dragons. He orders his knife to cut the heart of the dragon that has swallowed them and then to cut through the dragon's body and release them. Mambang Indra Segara sends Mambang Ratna Dewa to fetch his son whom he names Mambang Dewa Keindraan.\n\nMambang Indra Segara creates a country and castle by means of a magic jewel. He provides food by means of a ring. Their army is put under four leaders, Mambang Ratna Dewa, Mambang Gangga Dewa, Mambang Beranta Dewa and Dewa Keindraan. But when a great dragon (Naga Gentala) arrives they are so hard pressed that the hero hugging his body invokes his whilom dragon playmate, Naga Ratna Gempita, to their aid. Naga Gentala cannot prevail and returning to the dragon king, Raja Gangga Indra, advises him to make peace. Raja Gangga Indra and all his warriors enter the fray. Ratna Gempita attacks him. The rival dragons turn themselves into crow and hawk, ape, (berok) and tusked monster (gergasi), harpy and roe. Ratna Gempita bites the neck of the harpy and so Raja Gangga Indra dies. Ratna Gempita becomes king of all the dragons. He tows the raft of the princess up-stream. The hero's father retires to fairy-land, leaving him the magic stone which can make cities and bidding his son call him at need. The hero leaves the princess' raft when it approaches the royal settlement. All the princely suitors for her hand seeing her raft drifting on the tide rush and welcome her. They pretend they have saved her from the dragon. Her father builds a dais on a plain where the princess shall sit and choose the prince she favours (di-buat silambara di-tengah padang, p. 110) by throwing him a posy of golden flowers. All the princes, all the chiefs and people of the country, even the halt and blind pass before the princess but she does not throw the posy. At last the hero is told to pass before her. He passes carrying his magic knife, the hawk flying above his head, the white rat following him. The princess throws the golden flowers on him. The 99 princes demand that the marriage shall take place after a procession to the\npalace (bertandang), hoping to kill the bride-groom on the way. By means of his father's magic stone the hero creates a city and palace and castle. The white rat, who is really Raja Indra Bayu in animal shape, goes to fairy-land and invites Mambang Indra Segara and his younger son Mambang Ratna Dewa to the wedding. The harbour-master comes and with limbs and beard trembling and face as \"white as a pealed mushroom,\" sees the city and palace the hero has created, understands he is a fairy prince and does obeisance. The princess' father hears music and sends viziers to see what it portends. They are fed by means of the magic ring and return and tell their master of the city and palace and its furniture. The king sends his future son-in-law word that the 99 princes will attack him during the wedding procession. The hero begs him not to prevent them. Mambang Indra Segara descends to earth on a magic carpet (hamparan kesaktion). The hero's mother sorrows over her mortal form. The young hawk who is really a fairy Darkasila (\u062f\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0633\u06cc\u0644) flies to fairy-land and pleads for her with Dewa Laksana Dewa, who with his consort descends to earth for his grand-child's wedding after begging Dewa Betara Brahma to restore to his daughter her fairy shape. On a moonlight night Betara Brahma descends and sprinkling Princess Langkam Chahaya with golden flowers and rainbow water (ayer pancha rona dari keyangan) restores her fairy beauty, addressing her as \"Blue Lotus.\" The hero goes to the wedding on the flying carpet. Darkasila and his hawks fight the followers of the 99 princes. After the wedding Dewa Laksana Dewa and his fairy followers fly up to fairy-land on a magic carpet. A marriage is arranged at last between the hero's mother and Mambang Indra Segara. The hero picks up his magic stone. City and castle vanish. He and his bride and her father set out for home. The 99 princes waylay them but let the father pass. By his magic stone the hero creates a pleasance. His magic knife fights the princess. Fifty of them surrender and later fight the remaining 49 but fail to worst them whereupon the hero calls his dragon friend Ratna Gempita to capture them:\u2014the magic knife would kill them and the hawks blind them. All the princes who escape death acknowledge the hero's suzerainty. The hero releases the hawk and the white rat to return to fairy-land, whence they visit him often. He rules the kingdom of Indra Mahadewa happily with his consort.\nPenang Malay\n\nBy A. W. Hamilton.\n\nTo any one whose knowledge of Malay has been acquired from the various text books on the subject, with their correct orthography, it comes as rather a shock to find, on arrival in Penang, that he is unable to follow even the simplest conversation between two natives of the place, and that his own Malay, although understood, is not the colloquial of the Northern Settlement.\n\nBefore long, however, the stranger begins to observe that his difficulties lie in well defined directions; and that the body of the language remains much the same as that to which he has been accustomed, so that after a few months the newcomer should have little trouble in conversing in the same strain as his hearers. The differences between the so-called \"Penang Malay,\" which is really the Malay of Kedah altered slightly to suit the needs of a cosmopolitan town population with a large element of Southern Indians from the Madras Presidency, and \"Singapore Malay,\" which is a similar corruption of the speech of Johore to meet the requirements of a busy mart dealing with many races and much influenced by its proximity to Java, come mainly under six heads:\n\n1. Harshness in pronunciation.\n2. The alteration of a final \"l\" into \"i\".\n3. The clipping of certain common words.\n4. The use of peculiar idioms and idiomatic constructions.\n5. The use of words not in common use elsewhere, or confined in use to Kedah.\n6. The inclusion of words of Indian origin sometimes to the exclusion of native Malay words.\n\n1. Dealing with the above seriatim, in Johore Malay the pronunciation is always soft, especially that of a final syllable, so much so indeed that a final a is never pronounced as the long a in father but dies away as the sound of the er in the same word, so that father could be transcribed as f\u0101 tha to a reader of romanised Malay in Johore. In Penang speech on the other hand the letter a is always given its full sound of a long \u0101 or ah even at the end of a word, so that apa (\u0101 pa) \"what\" with its mute final a in Johore, becomes \u0101 p\u0101; ma na, \"where\" becomes m\u0101 n\u0101; di a \"he\" becomes di \u0101; r\u0101 ja \"a king\" becomes r\u0101 j\u0101. In Johore the letter r though pronounced distinctly is never rolled as in Javanese and when appearing as a final is pronounced ever so slightly, so that kotor \"dirty\" could almost be written as ko taw, and akar \"a root\" \u0101 k\u0101\nboth a's being long. In Penang the letter r though not rolled is pronounced in a peculiar gurgling manner at the back of the throat except it be a final when it is pronounced with a steely ring which often makes it difficult to distinguish from a final k which as elsewhere is always enclitic.\n\nAyer \"Water\" is thus pronounced as if it were ayak \"a sieve;\" nyior \"a coconut\" as if it were spelt nyoik; bochor \"leaky\" as if it were spelt bochok; dengar \"to hear\" as if it had been dengak; ajar \"to teach\" as if it were spelt ajak \"to invite.\" Apa khabar? \"What's the news? How are you?\" is often heard as Apa habak the initial kh being changed to h for assonance in conjunction with the alteration of the sound of the final r to k. Words ending in the letter r but having i as the penultimate letter on the other hand are pronounced as if the final syllable were iak and not ir.\n\nPikir, \"to think\" becomes pikiai.\nPasir, \"sand\" pasiai.\nKikir, \"a file\" kikiai.\nHampir, \"near\" hampiai.\nGambir, \"gambier\" gambiai.\n\nAnother peculiarity of Penang pronunciation is the indistinct utterance of ultimate syllables ending in s which are shortened and articulated quickly, resulting in the letter s being sounded as if it were ih, so that beras \"rice\" sounds like beraih; pedas \"pungent\" as pedaih; lekas, \"quickly\" as lekaiah and atas, \"above\" as ataih. Similarly bagus, \"fine\" is pronounced baguih; bungkus, \"a bundle\" as bungkuaih and mampus, \"to die\" as mampuih: whilst words ending in is merely change the s into h; tulis, \"to write\" being pronounced as tulih; baris, \"a line\" as barih: keris, \"a dagger\" as kerih: and chengis, \"crosslooking\" as chengih.\n\n2. The alteration of a final l into i.\n\nOne of the most puzzling features of the Penang dialect is the substitution of an i for a final l, whereby even common words appear strange under their new guise, and in a few instances have to be recognised from the context as being different to the words similarly pronounced but spelt differently; instances in point being bantal, \"a pillow\" which is pronounced bantai and is liable to be mistaken for buntai, \"to thrash, to slaughter\" and tangkal, \"a charm\" pronounced tangkai and liable to be confused with tangkai, \"a stem.\" In those cases where the penultimate letter is i the sound of the final l does not become i as usual but is elided and the sound of the penultimate i is changed to e so that katil, \"a bedstead\" is pronounced kate.\n\nThe following list gives the majority of common words ending in l and their pronunciation.\nAjal allotted span of life ajai\nAkal intelligence akai\nAral hindrance arai\nAsal origin asai\nAwal early awai\nBachul spiritless bachoi\nBatal to repeal batai\nBakul a basket bakui\nBawal a pomfret bawai\nBasal a jaundiced swelling basai\nBangsal a shed bangsai\nB\u00e9tul correct b\u00e9tei\nB\u00e9bal stupid b\u00e9bai\nBisul a boil bisui\nBilal a muezzin bilai\nBogil naked boge\nBotol a bottle botoi\nCh\u00ebngal the name of a wood ch\u00ebngai\nChangkol a mattock, a hoe changkoi\nChungkil to pick out with a pointed instrument chungke\nDajal wicked, mischievous dajai\nDodol a kind of sweetmeat dodoi\nDogol hornless dogoi\n\u011andul a hammock \u011bndui\nGatal itchiness gatai\nGasal odd gasai\nG\u00ebmpal stout g\u00ebmpai\nGomol to strive as in wrestling gomoi\nHalal legitimate halai\nHemul officious intrusion hemui\nIkal curly ikai\nJanggal discordant janggai\nJambul a fruit jambui\nJ\u011bjal to cram into a hole j\u011bjai\nJ\u00e9r\u00e9mal a fishing stake j\u00e9r\u00e9mai\nJ\u00ebngkal a span j\u00ebngkai\nJual to sell juai\nKapal a ship kapai\nKatil a bed kate\nK\u00ebkal lasting k\u00ebkai\nK\u00ebdal a black discolouration of the skin k\u00ebdai\nK\u00ebpul 1/16 gantang k\u00ebpu\u00ed\nK\u00ebnal to know a person k\u00ebnai\nKidal left handed kidai\nMahal expensive mahai\nM\u00ebngkal half ripe m\u00ebngkai\nNakal mischievous nakai\nPangkal beginning pangkai\nPasal reason pasai\nPanggil to call pangge\n\nR.

The clipping of certain common words.\n\nThe number of words clipped is small but as several are words in everyday use, it is as well to master them straight away.\n\nThe most important of these words are,\n\nmari \u201cto come,\u201d which is shortened to mai\np\u0113rgi \u201cto go\u201d which is shortened to pi\nSaya baru mai \u201cI have just come\u201d\nHang pi-lah \u201cGo away!\u201d\n\nSimilarly ini \u201cthis\u201d and itu \u201cthat\u201d are usually contracted to ni and tu which also serve as contractions for sini \u201chere\u201d and situ \u201cthere,\u201d the last named being also sometimes represented by nu.\n\n\u201cThere he is\u201d nu dia.\n\u201cDo you want this or that?\u201d hang mahu yang ni-kah yang tu?\n\u201cHere it is.\u201d ni dia.\n\u201cThat chair.\u201d k\u0113rosi tu.\n\u201cLike this.\u201d macham ni.\n\u201cAbout this matter.\u201d pasai ni.\n\u201cRe that.\u201d pasai tu.\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d sapa tu?\n\nThe contractions ni, nu, and tu with the addition of the word dia, \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d contracted to \u201cde\u201d form the new combinations of deni, \u201cthis person or party\u201d i.e. dia ini, detu, \u201cthat person or party\u201d i.e. dia itu and the vaguer denu, \u201cthose people.\u201d\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n\"This party would like to come to a settlement but the others don't want to.\" Deni suka nak buat sel\u00e9sai, denu ta mahu.\n\n\"Why did you strike him?\" Awat hang pukui detu?\n\nThe word *t\u011bntang* \"facing,\" when contracted to *tang* is combined with *ni* \"this\" and *tu* \"that\" to mean \"in this or that spot or place\":\n\nI am in pain about this spot. Saya sakit tang ni\nGo and put it over there. Hang pi taroh tang tu.\nI don't know where it has got lost. Tang mana dia pi hilang pun ta' tahu-lah.\n\nHe was sitting at the table Dia dudok tang meja.\nThat portion is alright but this is defective Tang tu bagus dah,\ntapi tang ni-lah nampak chachat.\n\nThe word *ikut* \"to follow\" when used in the sense of \"along\" or \"through\" is usually contracted to *kut* (*kot*), thus:\n\n\"By which road did you come?\" Hang mai kot jalan mana?\n\"The thief came through by the back\" Penchuri tu masok kot belakang.\n\nThe verb *dudok* \"to sit, to dwell,\" is frequently shortened to *dok*:\n\n\"Where do you live, sir?\" Tuan dok di-mana?\n\"Pray remain seated. I am going.\" Dok-lah. Saya nak pulang.\n\n*Dok-lah* is a common substitute for our \"good-bye.\"\n\nThe final *h* in the intensifying article *lah* is not pronounced in Penang, the word being enunciated as *la* with a long *a* sound.\n\n*Sudah* \"to finish,\" naturally becomes *dah*:\n\n\"He has gone.\" Dia dah pi.\n\"He has finished doing it.\" Dia buat, dah or dia dah buat.\n\nThe more usual query in Singapore of *m\u011bngapa* \"why,\" or *apa s\u011bbab* \"for what reason,\" is almost invariably expressed in Penang by the one word *awat*, a contraction of *apa buat* \"what's to do\" etc., though *pasal apa* \"for what reason,\" pronounced as *pasai apa*, is also frequently heard.\n\n\"Why were you dismissed?\" Awat hang k\u011bna buang k\u011brja?\n\"Why is the train late?\" Awat k\u011breta api ni lambat?\n\"Why did you not do it?\" Awat ta' buat?\n\"What do you want? What is the matter?\" Awat?\n\nThe usual abbreviations of *ta'* for *tidak*, *nak* for *h\u011bndak* and *ta'andak* for *ta' h\u011bndak* hold good in Penang as elsewhere:\n\n\"I don't want it\" Saya ta mahu or Saya ta'ndak.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" Nak pi mana or ka-mana? Nak ka-mana? is a common greeting to a person met on the road, usually replied to by *ta' pi mana* \"I am not going anywhere in particular;\" or *saja aku b\u011brjalan*, \"just out for a walk,\" or some definite statement of fact as, *nak pi k\u011bdai*, \"am going shopping.\"\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nDak is used for *tidak* as a negation.\n\n\"Did you do it? No.\" *Hang kah-buat? Dak. Oe!*\n\n*Oe* is more or less a meaningless exclamation like Oh! usually denoting grief or pain as in the phrase *Adoi mak oe!*, \"Alas mother oh!\" but in hailing or in reply to a hail merely means \"ahoy\" or \"yes.\"\n\nBoat ahoy! *sampan oe!*\nOh brother Mat! *O, bang Mat!* (answer) *Oe*, \"Yes.\"\n\nIn connection with *dak* is a little phrase *buat dak* meaning \"to do\" i.e. \"to act (as if) nothing (had happened)\"; \"to appear quite unconscious of what\" is afoot (*buat ta' tahu*).\n\n\"When I passed he was gambling at the side of the road but I acted as if I had not noticed anything.\" *Waktu saya lalu dia dok main judi di-t\u00e9pi jalan t\u00e9tapai saya buat dak.*\n\nThe usual abbreviations of the terms for kindred are in use as\n\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| *bang* | *abang* |\n| *kak* | *kakak* |\n| *pak* | *bapa* |\n| *tok* | *datok* |\n| *che'* | *\u00e9nche'* |\n\nand the less common\n\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| *nek* | *nenek* |\n| *dek* | *ad\u00e9k* |\n| *nak* | *anak* |\n\nwhich are used only in certain phrases.\n\n*Bang* is used in conjunction with a name as *bang Tam = abang Itam*. \"brother Itam,\" the brother not being a sign of relationship but of respect.\n\n\"Which one do you want brother Din? This or that?\" *Yang mana bang Din mahu? Yang ini-kah, yang tu?*\n\nIt is also sometimes used in addressing a stranger as\n\n*Bang oe, saya nak tumpang b\u00e9rtanya di-mana rumah si-anu?*\n\n\"Oh! brother might I ask you where is so and so's house?\"\n\nIt should not be forgotten that in Malay, titles of relationship are used to express not only actual relationship but the relative rank of the persons addressed or spoken about as compared with the speaker. So that *kak Jah* does not mean \"my sister Khadijah\" but \"Jah who is of the relative rank of *kakak*\" or elder sister to me.\" Further, *abang, adek, kak* and *tok* are used as polite forms of address to strangers according to their age and sex to avoid using the pronoun \"you\" which is considered rude.\n\nThere are also a few words which are shortened to the extent of a syllable.\n\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| *tuala* | a towel |\n| *kuala* | an estuary |\n| *biasa* | accustomed |\n| *kuasa* | power: authority |\n\n*tola* also *tuala*\n\n*kola* ,, *kuala*\n\n*besa* ,, *biasa*\n\n*kosa* ,, *kuasa*\ns\u0115nnyap \"to be or become silent\" s\u0115ngap\nbiawak \"monitor lizard\" bewak\ns\u0115ntul \"an edible fruit\" s\u0115tul\naniaya \"to do an injustice\" naya\nbuaya \"a crocodile\" boya\nsuara \"a voice\" sora\nsiapa \"who\" sapa\ntiarap \"face downwards\" terap\np\u0115lihara \"to nurture, bring up\" plera\nch\u0115ndana \"sandalwood\" ch\u0115nana\nm\u0115mbachang \"the horse mango\" machang\np\u0115ndar \"phosphorescence\" p\u0115nar\nt\u0115melok \"a boring marine worm\" t\u0115melok\npijat-pijat \"a bug\" p\u0115jat\n\n4. The use of certain peculiar idioms and idiomatic constructions.\n\nOne of the most common idiomatic constructions employed in the sense of \"in the middle of doing something\" is the use of dok a contraction of dudok, \"to sit.\"\n\nElsewhere the word dalam, \"in,\" tengah, \"in the middle of,\" or sedang, \"whilst,\" would be used to emphasise the fact that a person was in the act of doing something; or else the sentence would be introduced by such a word as masa, \"at the time when\"; or the state of action would be understood from the context, or even expressed by ada in the sense of \"was.\"\n\nIn Penang a sentence such as\n\n\"I was in the house at the time,\" would be, K\u0115tika tu saya dok ada di-rumah i.e. K\u0115tika tu \"at the time,\" saya \"I,\" dok ada \"was in the act or state of being,\" di-rumah \"in the house.\"\n\n\"I was (in the middle of) eating when he arrived.\" Bila dia sampai, saya dok makan nasi.\n\n\"The ship is (in the act of) coming.\" Kapai dok mai.\n\n\"As I was (in the act of) going he was coming.\" Saya dok pi dia dok mai.\n\n\"A policeman was standing up at the cross roads.\" Mata-mata dok t\u0115rpachak di-k\u0115pala sempang.\n\n\"I have been ill for a long time.\" Saya dok sakit b\u0115rapa lama:\u2014\ndok sakit \"have been in a state of illness.\"\n\n\"He is always playing.\" Dia dok main siang malam:\u2014\ndok main \"in the midst of play.\"\n\nAnother unusual construction is the use of the prefix p\u0115 to indicate an active sense instead of the more usual suffix kan larikan or m\u0115larikan, \"to run off with,\" becomes in Penang p\u0115lari.\n\nR. A.

Penang Malays bear several names which at once denote the Indian extraction of their bearers. Prominent amongst Jawi Pekan names are such, as Che Em Bi (where Che is not derived from the Malay honorific \u00e9che' but forms part of the proper name); Marikan; Maidin; Pawan, Pa Wan, Pa Wan Chik, Pa Wan Teh; and amongst women Ma Wan; Ma Wan Chik; Ma Wan Bi; Bibi; K\u00e9lsom; K\u00e9lsom Bi; Habibah; Nachor, etc. Arabic names many of which are long and harsh to Malay ears if pronounced orthographically are all shortened to a monosyllable, which is invariably the last syllable of the words, slightly altered in some cases to soften the sound. This custom is prevalent all over the peninsula with but slight variations in different places for some of the abbreviations.

S. Adams.\nMalayan Civil Service.\n\nThis list of words used by the Pangan of the Ulu Nenggiri below Kuala Betis in Kelantan was begun by me when I spent a day with the three chief Pangan and some forty of their followers in 1914. Circumstances prevented my remaining any time among them but I was able to induce one young man with some knowledge of Malay to come down to Kuala Krai in 1916 and during the three weeks in which he lived near my house I collected this vocabulary. I had hoped to check the words through a further visit to the Ulu but ill health prevented it and now it seems to me better to publish it in spite of errors so that someone else, who may have an opportunity of getting to know these people, may use this vocabulary as a foundation for a more thorough one. These words are used by the river Pangan who trade with Malays in jungle produce and whose clearings are on the foothills near the river. Inevitably a certain number of Malay words are in use and I was informed that the Pangan of the higher ranges employed words not in ordinary use among those on the river.\n\nI would thank Dr. Winstedt for preparing my rough manuscripts for publication and for making references to the words collected.\n\nBatu Gajah,\nOctober 18th, 1920.\nPangan Vocabulary\n\nfrom\n\nSungai Nenggiri, Kelantan\n\nNote.

S. Bucknill, M.A.\n\nThe rise in the value of Silver (and, incidentally, of many other metals) was a very noticeable feature during the War.\n\nThere were, no doubt, numerous reasons for its appreciation but it would be outside the scope of this paper to attempt to discuss them in any detail.\n\nIt is sufficient to point out here that there were continuous and serious political disturbances in Mexico which checked greatly the output of silver from that highly argentiferous region: that as is generally the case in the East when any universal feeling of apprehension or trouble is felt, there was much hoarding of coins and a corresponding withdrawal from circulation of a very large quantity of metallic currency: and that huge issues of notes by many of the belligerent States tended to enhance the intrinsic worth of almost every form of coinage.\n\nFor about a year after the commencement of hostilities silver remained steady but in December, 1915 a progressive upward movement commenced which reached its culminating point about the end of 1919: since that date there has been a sharp and continued decline.\n\nThe sub-joined table shows roughly what took place:\n\n| Date    | Value per ounce in London | Date    | Value per ounce in London |\n|---------|--------------------------|---------|--------------------------|\n| 31. 3.14 | 2 2\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)       | 30. 6.17 | 3 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)       |\n| 30. 6.14 | 2 2\\(\\frac{1}{16}\\)      | 30. 9.17 | 4 0\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)      |\n| 30. 9.14 | 2 0                      | 31.12.17 | 3 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)      |\n| 31.12.14 | 1 10\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)     | 31. 3.18 | 3 9\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)     |\n| 31. 3.15 | 1 9\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)      | 30. 6.18 | 4 0\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)      |\n| 30. 6.15 | 1 10\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)     | 30. 9.18 | 4 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)      |\n| 30. 9.15 | 1 11\\(\\frac{1}{16}\\)    | 31.12.18 | 4 0\\(\\frac{7}{16}\\)    |\n| 31.12.15 | 2 2\\(\\frac{3}{16}\\)    | 31. 3.19 | 4 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)    |\n| 31. 3.16 | 2 4\\(\\frac{5}{16}\\)    | 30. 6.19 | 4 5\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)    |\n| 30. 6.16 | 2 7\\(\\frac{7}{10}\\)    | 30. 9.19 | 5 2\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)    |\n| 30. 9.16 | 2 8\\(\\frac{1}{16}\\)    | 31.12.19 | 6 4\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)    |\n| 31.12.16 | 3 0\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)    | 30. 3.20 | 5 11                    |\n| 31. 3.17 | 3 0                      | 21. 9.20 | 4 11\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)    |\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nIt would be necessary to look back very many years to find silver at a value even approaching that which it attained in the year succeeding the War.\n\nIn 1870 the price per ounce was about 5s. 0d.; in 1880, 4s. 4d.; in 1890, 3s. 11d.; in 1900, 2s. 4d.; and in 1910 about 2s. 0d.\n\nThe result of the appreciation was, that, as soon as the silver coins current in British Malaya became, as to their silver contents, worth more than their face value, they were collected by adventurous individuals, sent out of the country and melted down for disposal as bullion; and, as these coins were of high silver fineness, this undertaking became a profitable one directly the price of silver touched about 3s. 0d. per ounce; and, although legislation against both export and hoarding was soon introduced, such measures were not, it is to be feared, of much practical effect. The dollar soon vanished and the 50, 20, 10 and 5 cent pieces became rapidly scarce; in 1917 the shortage began to be very serious whilst the bronze coinage (1, \u00bd and \u00bc cents) commenced also to disappear. The Government was faced with a difficult situation in its endeavours to provide a suitable substitute for the disappearing currency. The proposal to mint coins of intrinsically very low value could not be immediately carried out: the Indian Mints were extremely busy and, though an effort was made to obtain assistance from the Royal Siamese Mint at Bangkok, no aid could be, owing to technical causes, gained from that Institution: indeed it was not until nearly three years later that new coins appeared to replace those which had been removed from circulation.\n\nIn the meantime something had to be done and the first step was the issue of a locally made 10 cent note. These notes were printed on rather thick coarse paper of open texture at the Government Printing Works, Singapore: they tore easily and quickly absorbed dirt and were consequently not very popular.\n\nThey measured about $11\\frac{7}{16} \\times 7\\frac{6}{16}$ mm. and were coloured in yellow, green and black on the front and in red on the back.\n\nThe design was very simple: the face of the note has a yellow background about $8\\frac{7}{16} \\times 5\\frac{9}{16}$ mm. in size and consisting of a narrow border about 16 mm. in width and, within this, the words \u201cTen Cents\u201d repeated in a series of horizontal lines in small letters.\n\nOverprinted on this background, in green, lies a narrow green border 14 mm. in width; within this in green appears a small representation of the Royal Arms at the top in the centre: underneath there runs the phrasing:\u2014\nTHE GOVERNMENT\nOF THE STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.\n\nPromises to pay the bearer on demand at Singapore.\n\nTEN CENTS.\n\nLocal Currency for Value received.\n\nThe above with the exception of the words \"Ten Cents\" (which are in black) is in green.\n\nIn the left hand top corner appears within a black circle \"10 Cents.\" In the left hand bottom corner \"Ten cents\" in Chinese and to the right of that the serial number of the note; below the main inscription and to the right the signature of the Treasurer and the word \"Treasurer\": in the right hand bottom corner \"10 cents\" in Tamil and in the right hand top corner \"Ten cents\" in Malay: all the above is in black.\n\nOn the back of the note is a decorative design of scroll work: in the centre a representation of a ten cent Treasury Revenue embossed stamp cancellation: all in red.\n\nThe first issue was made on October 8th, 1917 and bore the signature of the Hon. Mr. Hayes Marriott then acting Treasurer [Pl. I. figs. 1 and 2.]: later, the issue starting on January 2nd, 1919, the notes bore the signature of the Hon. Mr. A. M. Pountney, C.B.E., the Treasurer of the Straits Settlements. [Pl. II. fig. 3].\n\nVery large numbers of these notes were put into circulation and the value of those issued by September 22nd, 1920 was $1,925,484. 80 cents.\n\nOn April 22nd, 1920 a new Ten Cent note made its appearance: they were on proper India paper and were engraved in London by the well known London firm of Messrs. Thomas de la Rue and Co., Ltd. They measured about 108 x 63 mm. and were of a handsome and artistic design. [Pl. III. figs. 4 and 5].\n\nA pale olive green border, containing the value in white in English, Chinese, Tamil and Malay, surrounded a handsome scroll work background of pale brown over which, in pink, stands a representation of the Royal Arms and the words:\u2014\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nTHE GOVERNMENT\nOF THE STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.\n\nPromises to pay the bearer on demand at Singapore.\n\nTEN 10 CENTS.\n\nLocal Currency for Value received.\n\n(Signature)\n\nTreasurer.\n\nThe serial number appears in black at the two top corners of the note.\n\nOn the back of the note appears the representation of a dragon in white and pale green and the value in English, Chinese, Tamil and Malay in the four corners.\n\nBy September 22nd, 1920 the value of these notes issued was $680,000. The locally manufactured ten cent notes were extensively counterfeited and a great many of these forgeries circulated side by side with the genuine ones.\n\nOn January 21st, 1918 an issue of Twenty-five cent notes commenced. These were prepared at the Government Survey Office at Kuala Lumpur, Federated Malay States. (Pl. IV. figs. 6 and 7). The value of these notes in circulation by September 22nd, 1920 was $39,825. I was recently informed that these twenty-five cent notes were being withdrawn from circulation as occasion permitted.\n\nThe twenty-five cent note was a better looking production than the local ten cent paper currency. They measured about 108 x 75 mm. The material was a fairly thin white paper closely striped with narrow perpendicular pale pink lines. On the face was first printed an elaborate ornamental design (in orange) and outside this (in black) a border of heavy spandrels with the figures \u201c25\u201d in white in a black circle at the top corner and \u201cCts\u201d in similar circles at the bottom corners: midway on the right, and left and at the bottom, in Tamil, Malay and Chinese respectively and in black on white scrolls \u201c25 Cents.\u201d Over the orange pattern and printed in black:\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nTHE GOVERNMENT\nOF THE STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.\n\nPromises to pay the bearer on demand at Singapore.\n\nTWENTY FIVE CENTS.\n\nLocal Currency for Value received.\n\n(H. Marriott)\n\nThe Royal Arms.\n\nAg. Treasurer.\n\n(Serial letters and number.)\n\nOn the back of the note appears in black the representation of a tiger standing amongst long grass super-imposed upon a decorative orange coloured background in the upper corners of which are, in white, the figures \"25\" and in the lower corners also in white \"Cts.\"\n\nThe issue of notes undoubtedly saved the situation but, even so, small change was often a great difficulty and postage stamps and tramway tickets were sometimes offered.\n\nI heard of Chinese Towkays up-country utilizing notes and vouchers or \"good-fors\" of their own, and a number of tokens or tallies, (some of which are described in this Article) made their appearance in different localities.\n\nIn 1919 a large quantity of debased 5, 10, and, I understand, some 20 cent silver pieces were issued for currency in British Malaya from the Indian Mints; in 1919 to the value of $950,000 and in 1920, up to about the middle of March, $950,000 worth. I am informed that during this period no 50 cent or dollar pieces were received from the Indian Mints. Even of this debased coinage I believe a considerable quantity found its way to the China coast being utilized there as currency in place of that of higher intrinsic value which disappeared into the melting pot. I do not describe these, as, except for the fact that they were of very low silver fineness, they appeared to be similar to the former Georgian coins of like denomination.\n\nThe following is a short account of some of the coins and tokens which have come under my notice:\u2014\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nSTRAITS SETTLEMENTS.\n\n1. One cent: minted at the Calcutta Royal Mint: made of bronze: a square shaped coin with rounded corners: size across 21.3 mm.: Plain edge.\n\nObv. Crowned head and bust of King George to left: a dot below: legend on left, above and right \"GEORGE V KING AND EMPEROR OF INDIA.\"\n\nRev. Within an interior beaded circle the figure \"1\" over the word \"CENT\": outside this circle and within another similar circle the legend \"STRAITS SETTLEMENTS (rosace) 1920 (rosace).\" [Pl. II. figs. 8 and 9.] Up to the 22nd September, 1920 there had been received in the Straits Settlements Treasury, cents of this type to the value of $576,650.\n\n2. Five cents: made of nickel: circular diameter 20 mm.: plain edge.\n\nObv. Crowned head and bust of King George to left. Legend around \"GEORGE KING AND EMPEROR OF INDIA.\" [Pl. II. figs. 10 and 11].\n\nRev. Within a beaded interior circle the figure \"5\": around and outside the circle the legend \"STRAITS SETTLEMENTS,\" above; and, below, \"FIVE CENTS 1920.\"\n\nI received specimens of this coin in January, 1921. These coins were struck at both the Calcutta and Bombay Mints: the coins first issued for circulation (and the one above described) emanated from the latter; none having been despatched from the former Mint by January 24th, 1921. I am indebted for this information to the Authorities at His Majesty's Mint, Calcutta.\n\nSINGAPORE.\n\nIn August, 1920, I heard that the Singapore Harbour Board had issued tokens for use within their very extensive premises covering the long line of docks which serve the Port. The result of my enquiries was that the Chairman very kindly gave me specimens of the denominations then in use and in January, 1921, was good enough to let me have examples of a new issue. These may be described thus:\n\nFirst issue.\n\n1. One cent: made of tin: diameter 34 mm.: a circular coin punched on one side only, the other side being plain. [Pl. II. fig. 12].\n\nObv. Within a small central circle the figure \"1\"; outside and within another circle the letters \"S H B.\" These letters are the initial letters of the Singapore Harbour Board.\n\nRev. Plain.\n2. Half-cent: made of tin: diameter 24 mm.; a circular coin punched on one side only, the other side being plain. [Pl. II. fig. 13].\n\nObv. Within a small central circle the figures \"\u00bd\"; outside and within another circle the letters \"S H B.\"\n\nRev. Plain.\n\nSecond issue.\n\n3. One cent: made of tin: diameter 28.5 mm.; a circular coin punched on one side only, the other side being plain. [Pl. III. fig. 14].\n\nObv. Within a garter, the arms of the Singapore Harbour Board consisting of a lion \"passant\" to left standing on a castle, the whole surmounting a diamond shaped lozenge enclosing a three-armed ornament each arm containing a crown. On the left is a large figure \"1\" and on the right the word in small lettering \"cent.\" Around and within the riband of the garter the legend \"THE SINGAPORE HARBOUR BOARD.\"\n\nRev. Plain.\n\n4. Half-cent: similar to the One cent but smaller: diameter 26 mm. The only difference is that the figures \"\u00bd\" replace the figure \"1.\" [Pl. III. fig. 15].\n\n5. Quarter cent: similar to the half-cent but smaller: diameter 22.5 mm. The figures \"\u00bc\" replace the figures \"\u00bd.\" [Pl. III. fig. 16].\n\nI am informed that the punches from which the first issue was struck were made locally at Singapore and the tokens struck locally. They are somewhat rough productions.\n\nFor the second issue, however, the dies or punches were manufactured at the Royal Mint at Bangkok, Siam, and are of a high standard of excellence: the tokens for current use were, I understand, struck locally at Singapore and, whether from the use of insufficient pressure, hasty work or other cause, the impression produced does not bring out all the detail of the design in those which I have examined: for example, the impression of the diamond-shaped lozenge is very faint; whilst of the three armed ornament and the three crowns there is hardly any trace. On the other hand I have seen proofs of No. 3 in copper and in some white metal which, carefully and properly struck, show every detail perfectly. I therefore add these proofs to the list.\n\n6. Proof in copper of No. 3: fine work.\n\n7. Proof in hard white metal of No. 3: fine work.\n\nThese tokens can hardly be regarded as currency even in a restricted area as they are strictly only intended to be used for the purpose of immediate payment to coolies (by way of tallies really) for services such as carrying baskets of coal or parcels of merchandise to and from ships: the tokens are redeemable at dep\u00f4ts on the\n\nJour. Straits Branch\npremises of the Singapore Harbour Board for ordinary coinage or notes current in British Malaya. I was informed that they were not issued under any Government authority.\n\nPULAU BUKOM.\n\nIn August, 1920 I was asked by the world-wide known numismatist Mr. J. P. Moquette if I had heard of an issue of tokens from this place: a small island lying about seven miles from Singapore. It is British territory and there is situated an important oil depot of the Asiatic Petroleum Company.\n\nI made enquiries from the Manager of the Company who very courteously sent me specimens of the tokens which the Company had issued for Island use. I subsequently had the opportunity of seeing several more examples. The following is a description.\n\n1. One cent: made of tin: diameter 29 mm.; a circular coin punched on one side only; the other side being plain. [Pl. V. fig. 17].\n\nObv. Within a small central circle the figure \"1\": outside and within another another circle the letters \"P. Bukom.\" The letter \"P\" stands for the word \"Pulau\" which is Malay for \"Island.\"\n\nRev. Plain.\n\n2. Half cent: made of tin: diameter 19 mm.: a circular coin punched on one side only; the other side being plain. [Pl. V. fig. 18].\n\nObv. Within a small central circle the figures \"\u00bd\": outside and within another circle the letters \"P. Bukom.\"\n\nRev. Plain.\n\nI was informed that these tokens were not issued under any Government authority.\n\nPULAU SAMBOE.\n\nIn the early part of 1920 my attention was drawn to some tokens apparently emanating from this Island which is a Dutch possession situated about ten miles from Singapore. Large oil dep\u00f4ts are maintained at this place. I accordingly wrote in April of that year to the Official in charge of the Island asking for information about the issue. I received an obliging reply the interesting portion of which reads:\n\n\"Owing to the shortage of copper coins, I was compelled to introduce tokens at this place because a lot of work done by coolies here is paid cash on the spot.\n\n\"The token has therefore no value as \"currency\" but a token represents the value of one Straits Settlements cent; and these tokens can only be used on the Island of Pulo Samboe and then only for the Companies' business.\"\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nMr. Moquette kindly informed me in August, 1920 that the Dutch Government had already, by that date, forbidden the further use of these tokens. I had, however, the opportunity of examining about thirty: the following account gives a short description of them.\n\n1. One cent: made of tin: diameter 29 mm.: a circular coin punched on one side only, the other side being plain. [Pl. V. fig. 19].\n\nObv. Within a small central circle the figure \"1\"; outside and within another circle the letters \"P. SAMBOE.\" The letter \"P\" stands for the word \"Pulau\" which is Malay for \"Island.\"\n\nRev. Plain.\n\n2. One cent: similar to No. 1, but the letter \"O\" is stamped \"J\": this is not an uncommon variety and I think was the first issue; the punch being later perfected. [Pl. V. fig. 20].\n\n3. Half cent: made of tin: diameter 22.5 mm.: a circular coin punched on one side only, the other side being plain. [Pl. V. fig. 21].\n\nObv. Within a thick raised circle the letter \"S\" which is the initial letter of \"Samboe.\"\n\nRev. Plain.\n\nTRENGGANU.\n\nThe ordinary issue of \"white\" or pewter cents by the State of Trengganu is well known. In September, 1920, however, a new issue appeared which is of considerable interest. They differ considerably from the earlier issues. The following is a description of the new coin of which, through the kindness of the British Adviser, I have received specimens.\n\n1. One cent: struck at Trengganu: made of pewter: circular: diameter 28.8 mm.: milled edge. [Pl. V. figs. 22 and 23].\n\nObv. Within a diamond-shaped figure, the figure \"1\" flanked by a six-pointed star on each side: the whole within an interior beaded circle: around, and within an exterior beaded circle, a wreath of leaves.\n\nRev. Within an interior beaded circle in Malay \"Kerajaan Trengganu Sanah 1325\" (i.e. \"State of Trengganu Year 1325\"). Outside, and within an exterior circle, in Malay character \"S. Z. A.\" (i.e. the initial letters of Sultan Zenal Abidin) each letter separated from the other by a six-pointed star.\n\nThe points of interest with regard to this coin are:\n\n(a) Sultan Zenal Abidin died in 1918 and was succeeded by a son who abdicated in 1920 and in turn was succeeded by another son of the deceased Sultan. Owing to the great shortage of small currency in the State (where silver and\ncopper coinage of the Straits Settlements are current as well as the local pewter coinage) a new issue of coinage became urgently necessary. There was no time to order a new \"die\" from Europe and the old die (modified slightly on the Obverse) was used.\n\n(b) The modification consists in the addition (cut into the old die) of the diamond shaped figure surrounding and the two stars flanking the figure \"1.\" The old Hegira date 1325 (i.e. 1906-7) is retained though the coins were issued only in 1920: so too are the initials of the Sultan who died in 1918.\n\n(c) The main reason why any modification was really necessary was because owing to the high price of tin these \"white\" or pewter cents were issued as equal to Straits Settlements copper or \"red\" cents whereas 400 of the old Trengganu cents only equalled in value 300 Straits copper cents.\n\n(d) The alloy was prepared by the great Tin Smelting Company of Singapore, the Straits Trading Coy., Ltd. and is noticeably harder than the mixture used for earlier issues. The \"die\" itself is rather worn and the sheath or instrument used for cutting the blanks from the sheet metal is getting blunt and could not be properly repaired by the local Trengganu metal-workers: with the result that the edging of the coin is very poor and the general impression not very clear: though specimens vary.\n\n(e) Ten thousand dollars worth of these coins were to be issued. The issue was authorized by the High Commissioner.\n\nNETHERLANDS INDIES.\n\nMr. Moquette of Weltevreden, Java, informed me in 1920 that in 1914, in consequence of shortage in copper currency, an issue of Tin coins representing values of 5 and 10 cents was contemplated. Dies were prepared at the Opium Factory at Batavia but, as the scarcity of coinage was within a short time made good by a supply from Holland, the projected issue of coins was never made.\n\nThe die for the 10 cent piece was destroyed and the specimens struck from it were, with the exception of one example produced after the die had already been damaged and now in the Batavia Museum, melted down. The die for the 5 cent piece was however preserved and is in the same Museum together with a few specimens struck from it. The following is a short description of these extremely rare proofs:\n\n1. Ten cents: struck at Batavia, Java: made of tin with a little lead: circular: size 27 mm. Plain edge. Description from a plaster cast. [Pl. V. figs. 24 and 25].\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nObv. A Crown surmounting \"10 Ct.\": below, the words \"NEDERLANDSCH INDIE\" in two lines. There are two flaws in the die.\n\nRev. In the centre, within a scroll work border, the date \"1914.\" Above in Javanese character and below in Malay \"One-tenth part of a guilder.\"\n\n2. Five cents: struck at Batavia, Java: made of tin with a little lead: circular: size 26.5 mm. Plain edge: a thick coin of 3 mm. Description from a specimen given to me by Mr. Moquette. [Plate V. figs. 26 and 27].\n\nObv. Within a beaded circle a Crown surmounting \"5 Ct.\" Outside and above, the word \"NEDERLANDSCH\" and below \"INDIE.\" To left the mint-mark of a sea-horse (the conventional mark of the Dutch mint-master Dr. C. Hoitsema); to right a caduceus (the conventional marque d'atelier of Utrecht).\n\nRev. Within a beaded circle in Malay \"One twentieth part of a guilder\": outside and around, the same in Javanese character, and at foot \"1914.\"\nThrough an unknown Corner of Pahang with H. Clifford in 1897.\n\nBy F. W. Douglas.\n\nA portion of the map on the border between the States of Pahang and Trengganu is still blank. It lies in a rough triangle, of which Gunong Irong, the source of the Tekal and Tembeling rivers (both northern branches of the great Pahang river), is the western apex, with Gunong Tapis, the source of the Kuantan River, the south-eastern point, and the mountainous range at the head of the Kemaman River, which flows in an easterly direction through the southern end of Trengganu, as the north-eastern point.\n\nThis area is still a terra incognita. It has occurred to me therefore that the following notes from an old diary may possibly be of interest and perhaps serve to stimulate some member of this Society to explore this region thoroughly. The triangle is marked on the accompanying map.\n\nIn 1897, Hugh Clifford (now Governor of Nigeria), who was then Resident of Pahang wanted to make a bridle-path connecting Kuantan, which lies on the east coast at the mouth of the Kuantan River, with Kuala Lipis, which lies some 200 miles inland up the Pahang River and which had then been selected as the temporary Capital for the State of Pahang. He and I accordingly set out from Kuantan on the 12th April, proceeding up the Kuantan River to its source, across the terra incognita and down the Tekal River and thence on down the great Pahang River to Pekan at the mouth.\n\nWe reached there on the 23rd April. Our journey therefore took 12 days, during which we travelled some 300 miles almost entirely by river. The following notes are taken from a diary kept during the trip.\n\n1st April. Clifford wrote asking me to get guides for the journey, as no one had ever done the trip from the Ulu Pahang side. The only men I could find were not exactly ideal for the purpose. One was an opium-smoking waster, Bakar Tekal by name, who had been in the Ulu Tekal with g\u0113tah-hunting Dayaks, but who had not been down the river; the other was one Komeng Liar, half Sakai, who had been the guide for a party of raiders in 1896 from Kemaman (Trengganu) into Pahang and had helped some of Bahman, the Orang Kaya Semantan\u2019s people, to escape. He was selected for our party simply as a useful man in the jungle.\n8th April. Clifford walked over from Pekan and we started up river, spending Sunday, the 11th, at the Pahang Corporation's mine. The old mill at Jeram Batang was running for the last time prior to being moved to Sungai Lembing, where all the stamps were being concentrated. Derrick, the superintendent, entertained us royally. He took Clifford over Nicholson's & Willink's lodes and down the shaft. (Both these lodes are worked to this day).\n\n12th April. We continued upstream in four dug-outs with 20 men. Slept on the Cheras. Clifford's boat filled during the night and he awoke in the water.\n\n13th April. Stopped at a Sakai village, where we tried to get two men to join our party. Clifford fired off his best Senoi at them but they only bolted. Eventually, after an hour we caught two, named Chong and Bo'uk, whom we bribed with much tobacco to accompany us. These Kuantan Sakai have a peculiar way of making their blow-pipes. They split a piece of wood, bore out the half-sections and then bind the two pieces together with rotan and a covering of gutta-percha. The Patagonians of South America do the same, but I know of no other native tribes in this part of the world who make their blow-pipes in this way. Later they came down to my house and gave a very good exhibition of shooting amongst my cook's fowls, and gave me a blow-pipe which is now in the British Museum.\n\nWe camped at Kuala Lipas that night and distributed the loads preparatory to walking next day. The worst of a rice-eating race is that they eat practically as much as they can carry. We therefore had to arrange to drop some of the men at the end of the second day's walk and most of the remainder as soon as we got far enough down the Tekal, or one of its tributaries, to raft.\n\nClifford was a Spartan in his methods of travelling. He arranged that we should live on curry and rice, tea and biscuits. Four chickens were allowed for curry; when they were finished, salt fish brought for the men was to be the only appetiser for the rice. I smuggled in a small flask of brandy\u2014as my mother had made me promise never to travel without it,\u2014two tins of sardines and two of cocoa and milk. I may add that my Spartan companion was not above sharing these rare delicacies! Perhaps the most trying part, until one grew accustomed to it, was that the rice was cooked overnight, so a meal of cold rice confronted one at 6 a.m. and another at noon. We indulged in a hot meal only at night. However at the end of the trip we were all as fit as the proverbial flea.\n\n14th April. Started walking up the valley of the Senandok, our \"path\" being the bed of the stream. The leeches were frightful. I had torn my breeches above the knee, an accident of which these jungle pests took full advantage; I removed 15 leeches from\nmy legs. After ten o'clock our route took us up a very sharp incline and we had to pull ourselves up by roots. Some hornets (p\u00e9n\u00e9ngat) attacked us and caused a stampede. One found Clifford's nose and in a few minutes it was like a full-blown rose.\n\nAt 11.30 we reached the summit of Bukit Lada, which forms the divide between the Pertang on the Pahang side and the ulu Kemaman of Trengganu. According to the aneroid the altitude was only 700 ft., but judging by our exertions I suggested that some correction was required. We then descended the other side to the Sungai Besar and on lower again to the Sungai Babi, which in turn brought us to the Sungai Pertang, where we camped for the night. It is a fair sized stream; but we were above the bamboo country and so could not make rafts.\n\n15th April. The path became a game track about five feet high through the jungle, following the course of the river down. We crossed and recrossed it no less than twenty-three times; by the afternoon the water was waist high; it was rather chilly work and still more so when it started to rain. We therefore stopped to camp.\n\nTo get the palm leaf (bertan) collected and made into an atap as quickly as possible we had a competition, the Kuantan Malays and the Sakai versus Clifford's servant from Pekan and mine, a Malay from Perak. The latter won easily. (I heard recently that this Perak Malay rose to be a District Officer under the Siamese in Kelantan, where eventually he died). We were cold and wet until Clifford remembered that it was the anniversary of his wedding-day and we sampled the brandy.\n\nWe found bamboos a little way below us, with which we made our rafts. Wan Ismail and all our men except six were then sent home early next morning by the way we had come.\n\n16th April. Rafting down the river was a very pleasant change. The Pertang is a beautiful river with great deep pools, in which shafts of slate protrude, huge ngram trees overhanging the water. Our troubles however soon began. We struck a log-jam consisting of great trees piled twenty feet high and some hundred feet long, brought down by floods. Most of them seemed to have been there some time. The rock in the river here seemed to be granite (possibly Tembiling schist). The rafts had to be dragged over this; many bamboos were split in the process and had to be replaced. Just below we came to the Tekal River and we camped for the night at the junction of the two rivers.\n\n17th April. The Tekal was a fine stream here, made the more imposing by a big rapid known as the \"Jeram Jerami.\" This gave me my first taste of shooting rapids, and an exciting game it is too, when no one with you knows the rapids! This particular rapid ended in a steepish drop, which tilted the rafts almost upon end. However we negotiated it successfully. As we\nfloated on down stream, we passed some *sambhur* (*Rusa*) drinking at the water's edge; they never moved as we went by\u2014a sure sign that no human beings lived anywhere near.\n\nWe shot several rapids without mishap during the morning and were becoming fairly confident of our skill (or luck) in this somewhat thrilling pastime. A bad rapid, known as Jeram Tahan Badak, however, proved our undoing. There appeared to be a kink in this as we could not see the end. Clifford led, each raft following at a few minutes' interval. The rush of water was terrific. As we swept round the corner, we saw Clifford and his raft high up on a rock; he and his party frantically gesticulated to us to keep to the left; S'man my leader, drove his pole in hard in front of my raft, but to no purpose; the raft was on it at once and out he shot; he came out bobbing in front of us, while we swept on towards Clifford. I just managed to haul him up as we crashed on to the rock. We could do nothing to stop the third raft from the same fate. When we took stock we found we could make two whole rafts out of our bamboos, but, worst luck of all, we had lost our only remaining fowl\u2014a white one, which we had carefully kept for the last.\n\n18th April. *(Easter Day).*\u2014Floated on down stream all day. Lost our cooked food at a rapid. The rafts became so knocked about they would scarcely float. There were no bamboos available for mending them, but we managed to patch one with a small *meranti* tree. Slept the night at Kuala Som.\n\n19th April. We started early, getting along fairly well until we came to another bad rapid, Jeram Mena. Here Clifford came to grief. He and his raft upset; he lost everything except his cork mattress; all the rice was spoilt. We managed, however, to put together a small raft out of the wreck, on which we sent on two men to try and find the boat, which Owen, the District Officer at Kuala Tembiling, had undertaken to send up the river to meet us.\n\nThe rest of us spent some time diving to try and recover Clifford's revolver etc., but a wonderful rainbow appeared, with one end touching the place where all the things were sunk; the Malays thereupon ceased their efforts as they said the spooks had taken the things. It rained hard and we remained there cold and miserable.\n\n20th April. Three dug-outs turned up at 8 a.m. and we pushed off on the final stage of our journey, glad to think that the end was in sight, but at the first rapid we all upset. At Kuala Tekal, where the Tekal joins the Tembiling River we found our boat. Further on down, at Kuala Tembiling, Duff and Owen were waiting for us at the house of Panglima Kakap, together with a huge curry. Scent had been sprinkled liberally over plate, spoon and fork, but our hunger made light of such trifles.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nWe left at ten that night following the great Pahang River down to Pekan, the Government station and residence of the Sultan, near the mouth, arriving there at 3 a.m. on the 23rd April.\n\nAll our time and compass survey records were lost and so far as I know, no one has been through that way since; that corner of the map therefore remains blank to this day. We established however the fact that the Tekal and the Tembiling Rivers rise from the same hill, although the latter runs north and then bends west before it finally runs south parallel to the Tekal.\n\nWe were particularly unlucky in finding the water in the Tekal at such a level as to make the rapids most difficult. It was my first real jungle trip. One learnt a great deal from Clifford, under whose guidance one realised what cheery companions Malays can be under such circumstances.\nA Contribution to the Psychology of \"Latah.\"\n\nDavid J. Galloway M.D., F.R.C.P.\n\nThe attraction which attaches to an obscure subject and a long and close association with Malay races must jointly form the reason, if not the excuse, for this paper.\n\nWhatever may be the etymological origin of the word \"latah,\" it is now specialised to mean a peculiar form of nervous manifestation which occurs among many races and is common among Malays.\n\nThis manifestation lends itself to a differentiation into several varieties, all having one symptom in common, a greatly enhanced susceptibility to suggestion from without, whether conveyed through visual, auditory or tactile channels.\n\nReferences to \"latah\" in the literature of Malaya are many and several special papers have been written on the subject in various journals.\n\nI propose to avail myself of some of the published matter, more in the way of illustration than in any other, and to supplement my own cases. For that purpose I have selected those described by the late Mr. O'Brien and which were published in Nos. 11 and 12 of this Journal, chiefly because they are described with a careful minuteness which could be achieved only by one who had had a long and close association, and was in close sympathy with the Malays of the Peninsula, and because with that accuracy of observation which characterised the man, he has portrayed one of each of the three great classes into which \"latah\" is susceptible of division from a psychological standpoint. While availing myself of his description I am unable to adopt his classification.\n\nThere are several preliminary considerations to be dealt with such as the influence of race, age, sex, and heredity, but I shall discuss them very briefly.\n\nRace is an important factor, for, although I have seen instances of \"latah\" among Abyssinians and Portuguese half-castes, it is mostly found among the Malay races. I have not met an instance of true \"latah\" among Chinese, though the mimeses have been many and were usually the outcome of \"la grande simulatrice\" Hysteria.\nThe student of ethnology will meet with some difficulty in assessing the racial limits of \"latah.\" Unfortunately, some writers on the subject have invested it with a semi-religious significance which has led to its being confused with conditions of religious ecstasy or others with the hysteria which seems to be inseparable from religious revivals in civilised countries. The only approach to anything of a \"religious\" nature is the Indian \"fakir\" in whom the state of abstraction, which plays so large a part in the production of \"latah\" has passed beyond physiological limits and become an auto-hypnosis.\n\nIf he excludes all such manifestations, he will still find that \"latah\" is to be found in quite a number of races and that these are all situated within the tropical or sub-tropical belt, and are all more or less in the infancy of civilisation. Reduced to first causes, there would be nothing ridiculous in a theory that \"latah\" was the product of an environment in which constant warmth, absence of hurry, abundant leisure and an unoccupied mind were the components.\n\nSex has also a bearing on the subject, in that two of the types of \"latah\" are more common in women than in men. It is also curious that \"latah\" in men seems to be of greater intensity, and has a greater tendency to pass into action, than in women.\n\nAge also plays its part, as \"latah,\" being of gradual growth, is rarely seen before middle age excepting in one type, that which I describe as the \"obsession of fear,\" which has its origin in childhood.\n\nIt is undoubted that \"latah\" in some mysterious way clings around some families, and this is what has afforded some ground for the statement found in nearly every definition of the term, that \"latah\" is hereditary. One does not realise the difficulty there is in obtaining a clear family history among Malays until it has been tried. It would have been in the highest degree profitable to follow history into the next generation and its collaterals, but this I found impossible because of the rapidity and completeness with which the average Malay family of the common class breaks up, each going his own way.\n\nI append the histories of four families which may throw some light on this aspect of the question.\n\n**Family I Malay:\u2014**\n\nFather, a shiftless individual, genial and effusive but totally unable to follow any continuous occupation\u2014a typical degenerate.\n\nMother, healthy\n\nSon, intensely \"latah\"\n\nDaughter, jumpy and hysterical.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nFamily II Malay:\n\nFather, very \"latah\"\nMother, healthy\nEldest son, a \"paroxysmal\" drunkard, although a Moham-\nmedan.\nEldest daughter, distinctly although as yet slightly \"latah\"\nSecond daughter, epileptic\nOther members of the family too young to decide.\n\nFamily III Malacca Portuguese:\n\nFather, healthy\nMother, \"latah\"\n\nFamily of three daughters and two sons. One of the daugh-\nters is a somnambulist, the eldest son is \"latah,\" the second son\nslightly so, the other members of the family healthy.\n\nFamily IV Malay:\n\nFather, slightly \"latah\"\nFather's sister (living with the family) intensely \"latah\"\nMother, healthy\n\nA very large family of which one son, the eldest of the family,\nshews distinct signs of \"latah,\" one daughter also, while the\n\"Benjamin\" of the family is a congenital idiot.\n\nI therefore do not feel that it is justifiable to say that \"latah\"\nbegets \"latah,\" or, in other words, to dub it as being hereditary.\nWhat is inherited is the impress of a nervous defect, a disequi-\nlibration, which may manifest itself as \"latah\" or some other\nneurosis, the early environmental associations and the unconscious\nmimicry of youth being of at least equal importance as etiological\nfactors.\n\nWhile the Malay cannot justly be called a jungle dweller, in a\ncrowded town he is an exotic. Of an eminently social disposition\nhe never, of his own free will, chooses solitude but prefers the\nvillage life. The bounty of Nature is such that a few hours' work\ndaily suffices to supply his wants and the unvarying and unfailing\nrotation of the seasons relieves him of the necessity of laying up\nany store against the future. There has thus been evolved a con-\ntented, happy, somewhat improvident individual, of abundant\nleisure, on the whole a loveable personality. In the company of\nhis compeers he is a cheery conversationalist or raconteur, in the\nsociety of his superiors he, under a mask of deferential passivity,\nhides an acutely sentient nature, keen to appreciate humour, sen-\nsitive to praise or blame, responsive in a high degree to the moods\nof his visitor, is, in short, in perfect \"rapport\" with him.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nBut when alone, much of his leisure is spent in day-dreaming or abstraction, really a subconscious state. It is difficult to conceive more favourable conditions for such a state than in a quiet village, with its warmth, its stillness and the absence of any disturbing element. So long as these moods of abstraction are intermittent and occasional, they are quite within the normal limit but when they are prolonged, as in the \"fakir,\" they pass that limit and may then be looked on as an auto-hypnosis, or in any case, a hypnoidal state.\n\nThe condition of abstraction is difficult of comprehension by the twentieth century mind which has little opportunity for any but conscious thought, but it is a well recognised state in psychology. It is a temporary dissociation of conscious thought, during which we sink into the subconscious, and most people are aware of such a state, although they probably cannot define it. It is the \"shadowy representation\" of Kant, the \"perceptions insensibles\" of Liebnitz, the \"subconscious\" of Myer, the \"unconscious\" of Freud, the \"subliminal\" of Yung, and it has been defined as \"the sum of all psychical processes which do not reach the level of consciousness.\" To illustrate my meaning is a little difficult. There are a considerable series of thoughts and memories which it is impossible to recall by any effort of volition, but which are readily brought into consciousness when a suitable stimulus, usually in the form of a similar association, presents itself. Thus it is, possibly within the experience of most, that some train of events arises which causes us to remark, \"I have been through all this before, but when or where I do not recollect,\" the fact being that a similar train of events had been experienced and been registered in the subconscious, and it required the stimulus of a similar train to bring the recollection within the grasp of the conscious mind.\n\nThe question arises \"What has this to do with \"latah\"? In the condition of abstraction (i.e. when the subconscious holds sway) so indulged in by the country Malay, the individual is readily influenced by suggestions or stimuli, and suggestions or stimuli which would be rejected by the conscious mind would exert their full influence, and, following the usual rule, their passage would, by repetition, become more rapid and easy. The subconscious, even in the educated, is but little removed from the reflex or automatic, and a further factor in the equation is that we are dealing with a primitive mind, in which many of the processes are reflex or instinctive and have not yet, or only recently, been subjected to the influence of education, the greater part of which consists in the development of the power of inhibition of our primary instincts and their adjustment to the surroundings. So far, I have been dealing with the predisposing factors to the \"latah\" state but the determining factor, the \"X\" in the equation, is the neuropathic inheritance or, what I believe to be of equal potency, early neuropathic association.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nFrom a study of the material at my disposal I have divided \"latah\" into three types, all having one feature in common, a greatly enhanced susceptibility to suggestion from without, but the manner in which a suggestion may radiate differs in each.\n\n**Type I Class I**\u2014A Malay gentleman, 40 years of age, \"latah\" for many years. He is a man of considerable attainments and can discuss any contemporary subject with analytical keenness. I experimented with him by his permission. Suddenly, in the midst of ordinary conversation, I shouted out the word \"Strike,\" accompanying it by a corresponding action. He immediately repeated the word and launched out at the nearest person, who happened to be a visitor like myself. The act of striking was immediately followed by another, a purposive act, as if to grasp and take back the previous action and this was accompanied by an apologetic expression of countenance and also of speech.\n\nAfter a time I repeat, unexpectedly, the order. Again he responds so far as repeating the word, but no action results. A third time I attempt to catch him but this time neither response to word or act is elicited.\n\nAnother instructive example of this type is that of an Abyssinian who is the chief tracker to a well-known big game hunter. In his times of leisure, when it may be reasonably assumed that he is in a more or less abstracted mood, the slightest stimulus, either as a sudden noise or abrupt action, will send him into \"latah\" action, but while he is tracking, an elephant gun may be fired over his head without causing any disturbance of his equanimity.\n\n**Class II**\u2014To this class belongs the well-known \"latah mulut,\" recognised by the Malays themselves as one of the mildest types of \"latah.\" The subject is, almost invariably, a woman at or over middle age. In the early days of the bicycle, while it was still more or less a novelty, it was a common occurrence to witness instances of this class in the street. A bicycle coming up noiselessly from behind would flash past a Malay woman, the subject of \"latah.\" At once she would stand rigidly still and, after a brief pause, begin to pour out a stream of language. The catalepsy, although of brief duration, is complete and she has often to be pulled aside to avert an accident. Soon the catalepsy passes off and she resumes her journey, still talking. But the more usual occurrence, and the more instructive in that it enables the observer to follow the course of events, is on entering a room in which the affected person is. At the moment of entry there is a brief interval of tense silence, the \"latah\" drops whatever she may have been employed on, and the \"language\" begins. After a copious flow of speech, it is interrupted by an apologetic cough for a moment, and then goes on again. Gradually these interruptions become more frequent, their duration longer and the periods of talking correspondingly briefer, until she entirely regains control.\nClass III\u2014As illustrating this class I make use of O\u2019Brien\u2019s description (No. 11 Straits Branch, R. A. S. Journal p. 150).\n\n\u201cA Malay woman of respectable position and exceedingly respectable age was introduced to me some time ago as a strong latah subject. I talked to her for at least ten minutes without perceiving anything abnormal in her conduct or conversation. Suddenly her introducer threw off his coat. To my horror, my venerable guest sprang to her feet and tore off her kabayah. My entreaties came too late to prevent her continuing the same course with the rest of her garments, and in thirty seconds from her seizure, the paroxysm seemed to be over. What struck me most in this unsavoury performance was the woman\u2019s wild rage against the perpetrator of this outrage. She kept on calling him an abandoned pig and imploring me to kill him, all the time she was reducing herself to a state of nudity.\u201d\n\nThere are several points in this type to be elucidated and I shall take the classes in order. Class I is very instructive and it gives the key to the explanation of all this type. Even in a state of expectation in which he undoubtedly was, as he had voluntarily submitted himself in the interests of science, he could be surprised into a \u201clatah\u201d act in its completeness. But note the action which followed. The arm was again rapidly extended with the hand open and the fingers in the prehensile position, as if to grasp and take something back, and this was accompanied by an apologetic expression, the picture of a delayed inhibition which had arrived too late to restrain the impulsion which generated the blow. This attempt established a condition of awareness which, on a second attempt being made, called up the inhibitory act in time to arrest the blow, though not the spoken command, and, on the third attempt, was in time to annul the impulsion altogether.\n\nAs to the \u201clatah mulut,\u201d it is essentially similar. Each of the interruptions to the flow of speech is an attempt at inhibiting it, and it is interesting to watch them becoming more frequent and of longer duration, really to watch the controlling factors of the conscious mind gradually asserting themselves, until they assume dominance of the automatic, reflex or subconscious, accepting those terms as being in this connection synonymous. This also is an instance of delayed inhibition.\n\nThere remains yet to be explained the \u201clanguage.\u201d The Malay term \u201clatah mulut\u201d is really intended to convey the meaning of a lapse of the mouth from reason, in contra-distinction to other types of \u201clatah,\u201d where the lapse from reason is in the acts, and such an interpretation is justified, the language used being of such a nature as to deserve the term obscene, the one applied to it by almost every writer. We have to seek our explanation in the subconscious. The science of Psycho-analysis, based chiefly on the work of Yung and Freud, has shewn us that the subconscious\nis much more than merely a storehouse of memories of things which \"we see but do not perceive.\" One of its many other functions is to receive material repressed from the conscious mind. In the course of our daily life we hear and see much which is utterly at variance with our sense of propriety or even decency but which, in any case, is not adjustable to the present standards of society. Our first and instinctive effort is to escape from the vicinity, but, if that is not possible, there is a second line of defence in that we can shut out from our minds the offending material or, to be strictly accurate, we can relegate it to the subconscious, where it would await an appropriate association or a sufficiently powerful impulse to let it loose. It would not be illogical to argue that the more decorous the individual, the greater the amount of material repressed, and thus the richer the subconscious repertory.\n\nIn the present position of our knowledge of psychical processes there does not seem to be any other explanation of this contradictory complex possible. We have the initial shock which may be visual (the bicycle) or auditory (a command), followed by a momentary catalepsy which may be so brief as to escape notice, but which, being a hypnoidal state, suffices to let loose the subconscious. We see the repeated efforts to regain control gradually gaining power until, at length, the censorship of the conscious mind is re-established and the attack is at an end. Favre's description of this type is particularly apropos\u2014\"elles disent tout ce qui leur vient \u00e0 la bouche.\"\n\nAgain in Class III we must analyse the procedure. She has the \"latah\" susceptibility to suggestion, by way of the senses, greatly exaggerated but her speech is directed, and with point, against the experimenter. The insanity (although I dislike using the term in relation to \"latah\") affects her acts only. A comparison with the cases next to be described will shew that this is not hypnotism and the exact grounds for excluding hypnotism are, that there is no loss of consciousness, there is no illusion of the senses and the return to normal is easy and spontaneous, but there remains, after the event, a humiliating knowledge of the exhibition they have afforded, and a justifiable grudge against the operator. It is an example of the power of inhibiting an impulse being totally lost.\n\nType II\u2014I was introduced to a Malay woman of forty years of age \"more or less,\" the mother of many children, who was stated to be very \"latah.\" She was in a condition of intense nervousness which she was making obvious efforts to suppress, and which I attributed to her condition of expectation. Her pulse was very rapid and there was a fine muscular tremor. No initial stimulus was required, not even a raised tone of voice, and she began at once to repeat every word addressed to her in Malay as well as carrying out the action suggested. Words spoken in English were fairly well repeated but no action resulted unless they were accompanied\nby pantomime. A rolled-up handkerchief was presented to her as an orange, and she at once went through the pantomime of peeling it. A wooden stethoscope was put into her hands as being a bottle, and she drank from the \"bottle\" with evident relish when ordered to do so. Not to be prolix, the response to verbal suggestion was sometimes a little slow, but suggestion by action was instantly responded to. The visual route was evidently much more permeable than the auditory. When it was all over, she was trembling violently, although any suggestion of an exciting nature had been carefully avoided. She remembered nothing of what had passed.\n\nI now avail myself of O'Brien's case (op. cit. p. 149) which he noticed at Kuala Jumpol, when crossing the Malay Peninsula in 1875\u2014\"met a young Malay who was of material assistance to our party in pulling our boat across a narrow watershed into the Thi Sureting.\" His comrades told me the man was latah but I could see nothing in his conduct or conversation which was not perfectly rational. Some twenty-four hours after making his acquaintance, one night we let off a signalling rocket for the amusement of those who had given us assistance (none of those present had ever seen a rocket before). I was preparing to fire a second rocket myself, when the latah pushed me violently aside, snatched the torch from my hand, fired the rocket, and fell down on his face making an unintelligible noise, to all appearance the expression of fear. I was somewhat startled, such rudeness and violence being quite foreign to the Malay character. When I sought an explanation from the bystanders, I was informed laconically \"latah, tuan.\"\n\n\"Next morning, when I met this man, I found him perfectly rational and perfectly respectful. I saw him standing alone on the bank as we put off down stream, and I waved my hand to him. To my surprise he began waving his hand frantically in return, and continued to do so till I lost him at the first bend of the stream. I had began to whistle an air. He also began whistling. His imitative faculty did not quite lead him to a reproduction of the tune, but the fact of an up-country Malay whistling at all is sufficiently remarkable. As I rounded the bend, I saw him still waving and heard him still whistling. The steersman to whom I turned, came out with the stereotyped formula \"dia banyak latah, tuan. I hope my poor friend's exertions ceased when their exciting cause passed out of sight.\"\n\nThe difference between the instances just described and those of Type I must be evident to all, those of Type II being due to hypnotism pure and simple. There is nothing in the case of the woman calling for comment, but a review of O'Brien's case is very instructive. We have the appearance of a white man, of remarkable personality, in a locality where such visits were rare. His every act would be watched by the lad with absorbing interest and thus a condition of expectation aroused. Then comes the loud\nreport of the firing of the rocket (a loud noise or a bright beam of light being a usual way of inducing a hypnosis) and the hypnosis was complete. If any doubt were possible, the whistling episode dispels it, the history of hypnotism being full of such examples (echolalia). There is one omission in O'Brien's narrative, he did not ascertain if the lad remembered anything of what had passed. I imagine he did not remember anything.\n\nThe intense nervousness which preceded the experiment in the case of the woman is present in all and has a threefold causation. First, dread of the coming hypnosis, especially if, in previous hypnoses, suggestions of an exciting nature have been made, secondly, from the hypnosis being made against their will, and thirdly, from the suggestion never having been done away with or determined before waking the patient. Thus the liability to suggestion gains force and eventually this class of \"latah\" becomes \"as clay in the hands of the potter.\"\n\nI pass now to the third type of \"latah\" to which I have given the name of the \"obsession of fear.\" In describing Type I, I mentioned the case of a big game tracker and I used him then to illustrate the marked inhibitory influence which a mental attitude of preparedness had on \"latah\" impulsion. But he was also the subject of the obsession now being described and, if the word for tiger was mentioned, would quietly slip away and lock himself in his room. While out in the jungle, at work, he would spend days and nights in close proximity to the wild beasts mentioned and know no fear.\n\nAgain let me quote O'Brien's description (op. cit. p. 147)\u2014\n\"I have more than once met with river boatmen who, when the word buaya (alligator) was mentioned, even in the course of casual conversation after camping for the night, would drop whatever they might have in their hands and retire cowering to the cover of the nearest kajang. I have enquired into every case of this description which came under my notice, and in no case could I learn that the man had any special reason for his terror in the way of a personal experience. His friends explained that he was latah and that to them explained everything. On one occasion, after a curious exhibition of this description, I shot an alligator on the bank next morning. The latah was, to my surprise, the first to approach the saurian. Against my earnest entreaties he proceeded to pull the creature about, and finally forced its mouth open with a piece of firewood. His persecutors, his fellow-boatmen, stood at a respectful distance. An hour afterwards, as he was poling up the river, one of the crew called out to this man buaya! He at once dropped his pole, gave vent to a most disgusting exclamation, and jumped into the river\u2014an act which shewed that his morbid terror was quite unconnected with what might be supposed to be its exciting cause.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThis type is peculiar in that it is found in early youth and is almost exclusively confined to males. It can, in fact, be traced back to school days. It is a curious fact that the names given by boys to boys hit off with absolute accuracy and brutal frankness some physical quality or mental trait which departs, it may be ever so little, from the norm. The point which I wish to emphasise is that there seems to be almost uncanny intuition in boys which enables them to put their finger on the \"weak spot.\" They are thus not long in finding some one of their number who labours under a neuropathic defect, some particularly ticklish or sensitive boy, and on him is expended their experimentation. As I have repeatedly seen, a favourite method is for the experimenter to begin fondling some object, usually a school bag or piece of rattan or indeed anything, while pointedly bringing it to the notice of his victim, calling it by the name of some loathsome or dreaded animal, gradually working up to a climax, and inducing a condition of extreme terror.\n\nIn two of the instances which came under my notice I was able to ascertain that the boys had an actual percept of the animal named. But this is unusual, and when this illusion does occur, it is only temporary, as, following the rule that repeated stimulation of a particular nervous tract enhances its permeability, causing it to react to weakened stimuli, eventually the mere mention of the name is sufficient to call up this condition of terror. There is no concept of the animal formed but merely the image in the memory of a previous condition of intense fear. As on each occasion of the calling up of this mental state a strenuous effort was made to escape from the imaginary danger, the tendency in this type of \"latah\" is to pass at once into action.\n\nI do not think there can be much doubt that \"latah\" is dying out and in contributing to this, education plays an altogether subordinate part. There is the obvious fact that little or nothing is being done in the way of educating Malay girls, who would form the mass of the sufferers in later life. Not much can be expected from that side of education which provides for the acquisition of knowledge, much more might be got from the disciplinary side of education in that it develops the powers of restraint, teaches the control of reflex or automatic acts, in short, develops the power of inhibition and creates a constant condition of preparedness.\n\nThe chief influence in the extinction of \"latah\" is the gradual hardening of the conditions of life, the increasing struggle for existence from steadily advancing social states, which leaves no leisure for abstraction or introspection and which affects male and female alike. \"Latah\" in town dwellers is unknown and a comparison of the country-bred Malay women and her self-possessed sister of the town shews the extent of the change which may be wrought by a change of environment in an individual or a generation.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nMEDICAL NOTE.\n\nThe examination of a number of persons, the subjects of \"latah,\" did not bring to light any single condition, pathological or otherwise which, by its frequency of occurrence, would entitle it to be ranked as an etiological factor. The cases examined ranged from those who were merely abnormally ticklish to those who responded to every suggestion however conveyed.\n\nIn all there was a great acceleration of the pulse rate at the beginning of the examination. This was undoubtedly due to the condition of \"expectation\" and, after they were satisfied that no experiments were in contemplation, rapidly subsided. There were two exceptions both middle-aged women who were goitrous and shewed the muscular tremors of that disease.\n\nThe reflexes, superficial and deep were in excess and Babinski was normal. A confusing intrusion was the finding the results of a peripheral neuritis shewn by a paraesthesia or anaesthesia of the hands and feet and a corresponding loss of the reflex. This condition was present in three of the women examined. Although the causes of a peripheral neuritis in this part of the world are many it was possible, from the fact that all three women were multiparae and from a careful analysis of their histories, to arrive at the conclusion that the neuritis was probably of puerperal origin, known to natives as \"taipo.\"\n\nThere was a perceptible difference in the rapidity of the responses according to the route chosen to convey the suggestion, the tactile being easily first, the visual next and the auditory last.\n\nStigmata of Syphilis were surprisingly rare.\nNew or Noteworthy Bornean Plants.\n\n(PART I.)\n\nBY ELMER D. MERRILL\n\nDirector, Bureau of Science, Manila.\n\nIn January, 1918, I finished the manuscript of my \"Bibliographic Enumeration of Bornean Plants\" in which nearly 5000 species of flowering plants are recorded from Borneo, and which was recently published by this Society. In the interim comparatively little attention was given to the Bornean flora, merely such material being worked up as was submitted to me for identification by the Conservator of Forests at Sandakan.\n\nPrevious to my departure for the United States in 1920, co-operative arrangements were perfected between the Bureau of Science and the Forestry Service of British North Borneo, whereby it became possible to send Mr. Maximo Ramos, botanical collector of the Bureau of Science, to Sandakan for the purpose of prosecuting field work in botany in British North Borneo. Mr. Ramos devoted approximately three and one-half months to field work in the immediate vicinity of Sandakan, from September to December 1920. In this time he collected 827 numbers of flowering plants and ferns, for the most part with ample duplicate material. On my return to Manila in the early part of 1921, I commenced a study of this material, finding approximately 700 species represented in the collection, of which nearly 100 have been found to represent previously undescribed forms, including three new generic types. In addition to these new species, numerous previously described ones not hitherto known from Borneo are also represented in the collection. Considering the fact that the entire collection was made at low altitudes and in the immediate vicinity of Sandakan, the percentage of novelties is unusually high. It is merely an excellent illustration of how little we know regarding the Bornean flora.\n\nThe present paper is largely based on the material secured by Mr. Ramos in 1920 in British North Borneo, but various species are also described from material secured by other collectors both in British North Borneo and in Sandakan. Small collections made by Major J.C. Moulton in Upper Baram in 1914 and 1920 have yielded interesting novelties. In the present paper 104 species are described.\n\n* Journ. Straits Branch Roy. As.

In flat forests along streams at low altitudes. A very characteristic species belonging in the group with Pandanus stelliger Ridl. and P. discostigma Martelli, for which Martelli has proposed the sectional name Astrostigma. It is most closely allied to the latter species, but differs radically in its longer leaves, larger ellipsoid syncarps, and distinctly toothed stigmas. The species is dedicated to Mr. D. M. Matthews, formerly Conservator of Forests in British North Borneo.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nPandanus obovoideus sp. nov. \u00a7 Acrostigma.\n\nFrutex erectus, circiter 2 m. altus; foliis 2 ad 2.5 m. longis, 3.5 ad 4 cm. latis, coriaceis, abrupte acuminatis, margine denticulatis; syncarpiis 4 vel 5, confertis, obovoideis, 8 ad 10 cm. longis, 7 ad 9 cm. latis; drupis numerosissimis, confertis, 1-loccellatis, circiter 3 cm. longis, usque ad 5 mm. diametro, apice pyramidatis, scaberulis, brunneis, attenuatis; stylis rectis vel curvatis, rigidis, spiniformis, circiter 1 cm. longis.\n\nAn erect shrub about 2 m. high.

This species must be closely allied to Pandanus gibbsianus Martelli, which, however, according to Miss Gibbs, quoted by Martelli, has leaves 10 to 12 cm. wide, while in the present species they do not exceed 4 cm. in width. The obovoid, rather than oblong or globose syncarps, are rather smaller than in Martelli\u2019s species, but there are apparently but slight differences in the drupes.\n\nPandanus pachyphyllus sp. nov. \u00a7 Acrostigma.\n\nCaulis 3 cm. diametro, 10 ad 15 cm. alta, simplex; foliis numerosis, confertis, crasse coriaceis, circiter 3.2 m. longis, 5 ad 6 cm. latis, tenuiter acuminatis, margine acute dentatis, dentibus superioribus parvis confertis, inferioribus majoribus distantibus patulis; syncarpiis erectis, solitariis, globosis, 10 cm. diametro, drupis numerosissimis, confertis, 1-loccellatis, circiter 4 cm. longis, 5 mm. diametro, in dimidio inferiore connatis, in dimidio libero lanceolatis perspicue 5-carinatis acuminatis brunneis 4 ad 5 mm. diametro, rectis vel leviter curvatis, stigmate spiniforme.\n\nStemless or nearly stemless, the leaf-bearing portions of the stems above the surface of the ground 10 to 15 m. high, about 3 cm. in diameter, unbranched.

Syncarps erect, terminal, globose, about 10 cm. in diameter, their peduncles about 8 mm. in diameter, obscurely angled, brown, 10 to 15 cm. long. Drupes very numerous, crowded, 1-celled, including the stylar and stigmatic portions 4 cm. long, the lower 2 cm. entirely united, the individual drupes about 5 cm. in diameter, narrowed below, the pericarp rather thin, the seeds about 1 cm. long, the empty portion above the seeds about 4 mm. in length; free portions lanceolate, often somewhat curved, brown, prominently 5-keeled, acuminate, 4 to 5 mm. in diameter, narrowed upward to the spiniform, somewhat curved stigma, the free portions equalling the drupes proper in length.\n\nBritish North Borneo, Batu Lima, near Sandakan, Ramos 1541. In forests along small streams at low altitudes. A species strongly characterized by being practically acaulescent and unbranched, as well as by its greatly elongated, thickly coriaceous leaves and its solitary, erect, globose syncarps. The free, lanceolate, acuminate, somewhat curved, prominently 5-carinate portions equal the drupe proper in length, the drupes being wholly united. It apparently belongs in the group with Pandanus danckelmannianus K. Schum. of New Guinea.\n\nGRAMINEAE.\n\nThemeda Forskal.\n\n**Themeda frondosa** (R. Br.) Merr. Interpret. Herb. Amb.

A remarkably distinct species well characterized by its sessile or sub-sessile, numerous, oblong, simple, spikelet-like heads and its unusually large, imbricate bracts, the glumes membranaceous and scarcely extending beyond the uppermost bracts. It is the only species of the genus with which I am acquainted, in which the inflorescences are sessile or nearly so, while in this form they are, for the most part, confined to the caudex below the leaves, occurring singly in the axils of decayed leaves from the very base of the caudex.\n\n**Mapania affinis** sp. nov. \u00a7 Halostemma.\n\nCaudex brevis, crassous, circiter 1.5 cm. diametro; foliis numerosis, perspicue 3-nerviis, usque ad 1.7 m. longis 3 vel 3.5 cm. latis, deorsum vix angustatis, apice subabrupte caudato-acuminatis, acuminis serrulatis tenuibus 3 ad 5 cm. longis, margine et costa subtus in partibus superioribus minute serrulatis; scapis paucis, glabris, sub anthesin circiter 5 cm. longis, sub fructu usque ad 14 cm. longis, partibus inferioribus (ca. 5 cm.) bracteis numerosis imbricatis instructis; capitulis sub anthesin circiter 2 cm. longis, bracteis capitulum aquantibus, sub fructu 5 vel 6 cm. diametro; spiculis circiter 18, ovoideis, 2.5 cm. longis, liberis; achenis nigris, osseis, oblongo-ovoideis, 4 mm. longis, breviter acuminatis.\n\nCaudex short, stout, about 1.5 cm. in diameter.

Scapes several, lateral, very slender, terete, 12 to 20 cm. long, scarcely 1 mm. in diameter, subtended at the base by few, oblong, 5 to 15 mm. long bracts, each scape bearing a solitary head about 1 cm. long, the head made up of several spikes which are scarcely distinct; external scales oblong-ovate, about 1 cm. long, brownish, equalling the head in length; fruiting heads ovoid, about 1.5 cm. in diameter and 1 cm. in length. Achenes obovoid, lax, bony, 2.5 mm. long, shortly apiculate.\n\nBritish North Borneo, near Sandakan, Ramos 1855, December, 1920. In damp forests at low altitudes. This species is well characterized by its narrow leaves; its very slender elongated scapes; and its small heads, the latter in anthesis about 1 cm. long, the outer bracts as long as the head. In fruit the heads appear as if they were made of three or more spikes, but these spikes are scarcely distinct from each other. The bony achenes are but 2.5 mm. in length, and are very shortly apiculate. It is probably most closely allied to *Mapania debilis* C. B.

Leaves numerous, pale-grayish when dry, not very rigid, 1-nerved, about 85 cm. long, 2.5 to 3 cm. wide, slightly narrowed below, the basal part about 2 cm. wide, gradually narrowed upward to the long and slenderly caudate-acuminate apex, the margins and the midrib on the lower surface in the upper part serrulate. Scapes few, lateral, from the caudex below the leaves, up to 9 cm. long, 1.5 mm. in diameter, terete, the lower two to three cm. supplied with numerous imbricate bracts, the bracts ovate to oblong-ovate, 1 to 1.5 cm. long. Inflorescences consisting of a single, solitary, spike-like head or sometimes of three separate, fascicled, similar heads, both types occurring on the same plant, the individual heads terete, about 3 cm. long, 8 mm. in diameter, composed of numerous imbricate bracts, the bracts oblong-elliptic about 13 mm. long, 6 mm. wide, obtuse and very shortly apiculate, their margins scariosus. Achenes bony, narrowly oblong-obovoid, terete, grayish, about 5 mm. long, 2 mm. in diameter, slightly narrowed below, the apex acute or very slightly apiculate.\n\nBritish North Borneo, Sandakan, Ramos 1854, December, 1920. In damp forests along small streams at low altitudes. This species is remarkable in the inflorescences. When the scape bears a single head, the head very strongly resembles that of Mapania humilis F.-Vill., but the same plant other scapes occur which bear three fasciculately arranged spikes at their apices. In leaf characters, however, the species is remote from M. humilis. It is probably most closely allied to Mapania longa C. B.

It is at once distinguished from all hitherto described genera in these families by its conspicuously cleft petals, the relatively large lobes being inflexed in bud and spreading at an angle of about 45\u00b0 in flower. In its stamens being alternate with the petals it differs from most representatives of the Olacaceae, while in its erect basal ovules it differs from most or all of the Icacinaceae.

This proposed new genus and species distinctly resembles *Haematocarpus*, but does not appear to be closely allied to that genus and may not belong in the tribe *Triclisieae*. In the absence of female flowers and fruits it is difficult to decide its proper place in the family. Among the known genera of the family the present genus differs in its 3 sepals which are somewhat united below, in its 5 petals and 5 stamens,\u2014in most genera the sepals, petals and stamens being in three\u2019s or in multiples of three\u2019s. This genus is dedicated to Mr. William O. Jupp, for long a resident of Sandakan, in appreciation of his interest in forwarding the field work in botany carried on by the Bureau of Science in co-operation with the Forestry Service of the Government of British North Borneo.\n\n*Tinospora* Miers.\n\n*Tinospora glandulosa* sp. nov.\n\nFrutex scandens, glaber; foliis oblongis, subcoriaceis, nitidis, basi rotundatis vel obtusis, usque ad 12 cm. longis, nervis utrinque 7 vel 8, distinctis, subtus in axillis perspicue glandulosos; infructescentiis e nodis defoliatis, solitariis, anguste paniculatis, pedunculatis, usque ad 24 cm. longis, ramis primariis patulis inferioribus circiter 3 cm. longis; fructibus junioribus subellipsoideis, 5 mm. longis.\n\nA glabrous vine, the older branches apparently fleshy when fresh, when dry dark reddish-brown and smooth except for the scattered conspicuous lenticels, the younger branches slender, grayish brown, lenticellate.

Straits Branch\nclosely than it does *A. wallichii*, it differs in its non-tuberculate follicles which are not at all beaked, shorter inflorescences, and non-arillate seeds.\n\n**Agelaea sarawakensis** sp. nov.\n\nFrutex scandens, inflorescentijs exceptis glaber; foliis 3-foliolatis, foliolis oblongis, coriaceis, 20-30 cm. longis, 6 ad 9 cm. latis, apice obscure obtuseque acuminatis, basi plerumque rotundatis, supra puncticulatis, nervis utrinque 8-10, patulis, perspicuis, anastomosantibus, reticulis perspicuis, densis; cymis axillaribus, fasciculatis, sub fructu 2 cm. longis; folliculis inaequilateralibus, 12-14 mm. longis, rugosis sed haud tuberculatis, brevissime rostratis, dense brunneo-pubescentibus; seminibus oblongo-ellipsoideis, 12 mm. longis, in inferiore parte quarta arillatis.\n\nA woody vine, glabrous except the inflorescences, the branches reddish-brown, terete. Leaves 3-foliolate, their petioles stout, 8 to 11 cm. long; leaflets coriaceous, oblong, 20 to 30 cm. wide, obscurely blunt-acuminate, the base usually rounded, that of the lateral ones slightly asymmetric, the upper surface minutely pitted; lateral nerves 8 to 10 on each side of the midrib, spreading at nearly right angles, curved, strongly anastomosing, prominent on the lower surface, the reticulations rather close, prominent; petiolules 5 to 7 mm. long. Panicles cymose, fasciculed in the upper axils, in fruit 2 cm. long or less, somewhat pubescent. Follicles somewhat rugose, inequilateral, 12 to 14 mm. long, very shortly beaked, not tuberculate, densely pubescent with short brown hairs, when mature strongly recurved. Seeds oblong-ellipsoid, about 12 mm. long, arillate in the lower one-fourth.\n\nSarawak, near Kuching, *Native Collector* 1101, Bur. Sci., received in November, 1912. A species apparently most closely allied to *Agelaea hullettii* King of the Malay Peninsula, but the leaflets are larger, obscurely and obtusely acuminate, not acute, their bases rounded, not cuneate.\n\n**Agelaea woodii** sp. nov.\n\nFrutex scandens, ramulis et inflorescentiis et foliis utrinque ad costam nervosoque ferrugineo-pubescentibus; foliis 3-foliolatis, foliolis oblongo-ellipticis vel elliptico-ovatis, 10-15 cm. longis, basi rotundatis, apice perspicue obtuseque acuminatis, nervis utrinque 4 vel 5, perspicuis; paniculis axilaribus terminalibusque, angustis, 5-10 cm. longis; floribus 4- et 5-meris; sepalis dense pubescentibus, 1.8 mm. longis; staminibus 8 vel 10, filamentis glabris; carpellis 4 vel 5, dense hirsutis, anguste oblongis.\n\nA scandent vine, the larger branches glabrous, purplish-black when dry, the branchlets, inflorescences and petioles rather densely ferruginous-pubescent. Leaves 3-foliolate, their petioles 4 to 5 cm. long; leaflets chartaceous or subcoriaceous, entire, oblong-elliptic to elliptic-ovate, 10 to 15 cm. long, 5 to 8 cm. wide, the\nbase rounded, somewhat 3-nerved, the apex conspicuously acuminate, the acumen stout, about 1 cm. long, blunt, the upper surface brownish-olivaceous, glabrous except for the ferruginous-pubescent midrib and nerves, the lower surface pale-brownish, somewhat pubescent along the midrib and nerves; lateral nerves above the basal pair 4 or 5 on each side of the midrib, prominent, curved, ascending, the primary reticulations also prominent; petiolules ferruginous-pubescent, about 4 mm. long. Panicles narrow, terminal and in the axils of the uppermost leaves, 5 to 10 cm. long, densely pubescent. Flowers 4- and 5-merous, white. Sepals oblong, obtuse, pubescent, 1.8 mm. long.

Carpels 4 or 5, narrowly oblong, 1 mm. long, densely hirsute.\n\nBritish North Borneo, Suan Lamba River near Sandakan, Agama 573, August, 1918. In level forests at low altitudes. The specimens were originally identified as Agelaea borneensis Merr. from which the species is radically distinguished by its slightly pubescent leaflets and by its floral characters. On account of the number of the stamens its alliance seems to be with Agelaea wallichii Hook. f. rather than A. borneensis. From A. agamae it is distinguished by its indumentum and by its inflorescences being terminal and axillary, not cauline.\n\nConnarus Linnaeus.\n\nConnarus euphlebius sp. nov.\n\nFrutex scandens, perspicue ferrugineo-pubescent; foliis usque ad 10 cm. longis, foliolis plerumque 7, oblongo-ellipticis, chartaceis vel subcoriaceis, 10-16 cm. longis, supra glabris, nitidis, subtus ad costam nervosque ferrugineo-pubescentibus, acuminatis, basi rotundatis vel acutis, minute peltatis, nervis utrinque 10-12, supra impressis, subtus valde perspicuis; folliculis inaequilatero-aliter obovoideis, 4.5-5 cm. longis, 3 cm. latis, extus dense rufo-brunneo-pubescentibus, intus simpliciter pubescentibus, apice late rotundatis, inflatis, 2 cm. crassis, deorsum angustatis.\n\nA woody vine, the branchlets, petioles, inflorescences, fruits, and the lower surface of the leaflets on the midrib and lateral nerves densely ferruginous-pubescent, the branches up to 1 cm. in diameter also with similar indumentum. Leaves up to 40 cm. long, rather long-petioled; leaflets usually 7, oblong to oblong-elliptic, chartaceous or subcoriaceous, 10 to 16 cm. long, to 6 cm. wide, the upper surface olivaceous, shining, the lower surface paler, apex shortly and obtusely acuminate, base rounded to obtuse and usually minutely peltate; lateral nerves 10 to 12 on each side of the midrib, impressed on the upper surface, very prominent on the lower surface, somewhat curved and ascending at an angle of about 45\u00b0, the primary reticulations subparallel, distinct. Panicles in fruit about as long as the leaves, the follicles obovoid, inflated, 4.5 to 5 cm. long, about 3 cm.\nwide, the apex broadly rounded, the stigmatic portion broadly acute and laterally situated at about the upper two-thirds, gradually narrowed to the acute or somewhat obtuse base, inflated, about 2 cm. thick, outside very densely pubescent with dark reddish-brown hairs, inside simply pubescent with pale-brownish hairs. Seeds oblong, shining, the aril fleshy, yellowish-brown when dry, about 7 mm. long.\n\nBritish North Borneo, Batu Lima near Sandakan, Ramos 1181, October, 1920. In damp forests and in clearings at low altitudes. A species well characterized by its very prominently nerved leaflets, the nerves being impressed on the upper surface and very prominent on the lower surface. The dark-brown indumentum of the branches, inflorescences, fruits, petioles and on the midrib and nerves on the lower surface of the leaflets, composed of short simple hairs, is characteristic. It apparently belongs in the group with Connarus ferrugineus Jack.\n\n*Cnestis* Jussieu.\n\n*Cnestis palala* (Lour.) comb. nov.\n\n*Thysanus palala* Lour. Fl. Cochinch. (1790) 284, excl. syn.

ROBINSON AND J. C. MOULTON.\n\nWe owe the remarkable discovery of the Bearded Pig in the Malay Peninsula to Dr. W. S. Leicester an enthusiastic sportsman who obtained a single female specimen some years ago in the vicinity of Pekan, Pahang. The occurrence, however, was so remarkable and so at variance with preconceived ideas of geographical distribution that pending further evidence it was not considered advisable to place the occurrence on formal record. Now however that a further specimen has been obtained from the same locality there is no doubt whatever that the species must be regarded as a member of the peninsula fauna, though as noted below we think it not improbable that its presence is really due to some extraordinary change resulting in the landing of a herd from Borneo, the home of the true *Sus barbatus*, or from the Rhio Archipelago where the rather dubious race *S. barbatus oi* is found.\n\nIn answer to queries Dr. W. S. Leicester wrote under date March 19th. 1918, in reference to the original specimen\u2014a fully adult female: \"Yes I am quite certain she was shot in the neighbourhood of Pekan. I remember a herd of this breed appeared in the neighbourhood and I shot this large sow and several half grown ones from time to time but could not get at the big boar which was very cunning and got away every time. They were some time about Pekan but eventually disappeared and I have not come across any since.\"\n\nDr. Leicester very kindly presented this specimen to the F. M. S. Museums.\n\nMr. J. E. Kempe, District Officer, Pekan, has now obtained the skull of a boar, which he has generously presented to the Raffles Museum, Singapore; he writes under date December 6th. 1921: \"It was shot by Towkay Lee Cheow,\u2014an old Pekan character who has hunted and kept a pack these thirty years\u2014about six weeks ago at a place called Sungei Genek, some two miles up river from Pekan town. He gave me the skull and the description and told me that in all his experience extending over thirty-three years, and including the slaughter of thousands of pigs he had never seen such an animal. ............... He told me that the remarkable things about it were its great length and height, but what impressed him most was the fact that it had a thick tuft of hair under each eye about two inches long and a good sized beard.\n\n\"It weighed 180 katis (240 pounds) and was very emaciated. He said he thought, if in condition, it would have scaled 230 katis or more. It was a solitary boar.\"\nThe above statement supports the suggestion that this animal was the last survivor of some herd that had gained access to the Malay Peninsula and which had not been able to maintain itself under exotic conditions. Possibly even, it was the actual boar to which Dr. Leicester refers.\n\nThe description together with an excellent sketch with measurements, at once suggested the interesting possibility of this pig being *Sus barbatus* which was originally described from Borneo and later discovered in Sumatra and the Rhio Archipelago, and described by Miller under the name *Sus oi*.\u00b9\n\nA comparison of the skulls with a topo-type of *Sus oi* from the Indragiri River, S. E. Sumatra, and with specimens from Tanjong Batu, Great Durian Island and Bintang Island, Rhio Archipelago, shows that they cannot be separated with certainty from this form, nor on the other hand can they be distinguished from a considerable series of the true *Sus barbatus* from various parts of Sarawak, Borneo.\n\nThe question then arises, is this pig indigenous in the Malay Peninsula, or is this particular record the result of some fortuitous visit by an adventurous pair\u2014perhaps from Pulo Batam, 10 miles south of the southern extremity of Johore\u2014who established themselves for a brief period in Pahang? Native stories of a giant white pig in Johore undoubtedly refer to this species. On the whole we are inclined to think that it is not indigenous in the Malay Peninsula. Its rarity here\u2014we know of no other examples having been killed or seen authentically\u2014seems to point to the fact of it being only an occasional visitor. If it were a Peninsula species in the strict sense, the geographical distribution would be difficult to explain. On the other hand one should not lose sight of the fact that under favourable circumstances sufficient individuals might reasonably come in from the Malayan Islands near the mainland and establish themselves for a noticeable period.\n\nMr. Boden Kloss\u00b2 has recently dealt with the Malaysian Bearded Pig. He points out the difficulty of distinguishing *Sus barbatus* of Borneo and *Sus oi* of Sumatra and Rhio on the dental characters given by Miller.\u00b3 We agree that they are too variable to be of any use. Kloss however would separate *Sus oi* on the longer muzzle (\"and perhaps a little broader\"); the longer mandibular symphysis; the deeper mandible and the slightly more concave profile of the face. These statements broadly speaking agree with certain notes made by one of us in the early part of 1918 but hitherto unpublished on the topo-type of *Sus oi* in the Raffles Museum, which were as follows:\u2014\n\n---\n\n\u00b9. Miller, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, xii, p. 51 (1902).\n\u00b2. Kloss, Journ. Straits Branch, Roy. Asiat. Soc. No. 83, pp. 147, 150, (1921).\n\u00b3. Miller, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. pp. 737-758 pls. XXXIX-LXIII (1906).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\n\"The specimen is an absolute topo-type of *Sus oi* and in view of certain differences between it and the description and measurements of the type merits more detailed description. The animal is very fully adult but not aged. The naso-frontal suture is still visible but the basi-occipital is completely ossified. The teeth including the posterior molars in both jaws are somewhat worn but not so that the details of the enamel spaces cannot be recognized.\n\n\"Viewed in the basal aspect, the rostrum, anterior to the canines is broader than in similarly aged specimens of *S. barbatus*. The zygomata are more heavily built and more divergent and the tusk sheaths more recurved than in the Bornean animal while the cranial region is more sharply bent upwards from the level of the orbits. The mandibular symphysis is longer and this region of the jaw heavier than in *Sus barbatus* of equal size. Mr. Miller states that out of the specimens examined by him only two, the type and a specimen from Palembang, had the posterior molars in a condition fit for examination. The diagnosis of the race, however, depends on the fact that in *Sus oi* the upper posterior molar has 'its posterior portion much narrowed* the lower tooth lacking the terminal heel but with the third transverse ridge reduced to a terete heel-like remnant.'\"\n\nFurther examination of larger series from Borneo and elsewhere now convinces us that real differences between the Bornean animal and others from Rhio and Sumatra have not yet been demonstrated and that all the alleged characters of skulls from the latter localities can be explained by the varying age and innate variability of the specimens examined.\n\nWe are therefore of the opinion that there is no justification for regarding *Sus oi* as distinct, even subspecifically, from *Sus barbatus* and we therefore retain this last name to cover the Bearded Pig of Borneo, Sumatra, the Rhio Archipelago and Pahang.\n\nThe Giant Pig of South East Borneo and that from portions of Eastern Sumatra may possibly be a distinct race or even species as suggested by Kloss but we have no material on which to base an opinion. The former has been named *Sus gargantua*, Miller, and is based on a single not very old skull in the collection of the Agricultural High School, Berlin, from an unspecified locality in South East Borneo, which is the largest known skull of the genus *Sus* in any collection. The Sumatran form, as yet known from native accounts only, has been inadvertently named *Sus branti* by Kloss (antea) though as the name is accompanied by a description it will, by the laws of nomenclature, stand.\n\nA table of measurements of the Peninsular, Bornean, Sumatran and Rhio Archipelago specimens of *Sus barbatus* is\n\n*This is visible in one young adult male (3rd upper molar fully erupted but hardly worn) from Sarawak.*\n| Sarawak, adult male. | mm. | mm. | mm. | mm. | mm. | mm. |\n|----------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| H.

By its large size, elongated and narrow head and by the great height at the shoulder and narrow dorsal ridge,\n2. By its pale colour compared to the ordinary local form,\n3. By its beard and by the possession between the eye and the nostril on each side of the muzzle of a large warty outgrowth covered with bristles, which is large and conspicuous in males, smaller in females, but always visible even in young animals.\n\nFrom the accounts available it would appear that Sumatran, Rhio Archipelago and Malayan animals are more scantily haired than those from Borneo. This was certainly the case with the Bintang specimen recorded in the table when seen in the flesh.\nThe reported occurrence of Russell\u2019s Viper in Sumatra & the Malay Peninsula.\n\nBy J. C. Moulton.\n\nSome 50 years ago Dr. J. Fayrer compiled statistics to show that the death-rate in India from snake-bite amounted to about 20,000 persons per annum. The snakes responsible for this enormous mortality are the Cobra (Naia naja = tripudians), the Krait (Bungarus candidus), the Hamadryad (Naia bungarus) and Russell\u2019s Viper (Vipera russelli), in that order of importance.\n\nIn Malaysia three species of Krait are known: the Banded Krait (Bungarus fasciatus), the Krait (B. candidus), and the Yellow-headed Krait (B. flaviceps). All are rare in Malaysia. The Cobra and Hamadryad however are by no means rare in the Malay Peninsula and adjoining Islands. Although records of death from snake-bite in these Malay countries are extremely rare it is generally known that these two snakes are the most dangerous and the most to be feared. Other snakes such as the Coral Snakes and Pit-Vipers in Malaysia are poisonous, although an injection of their poison is not necessarily always fatal.\n\nRussell\u2019s Viper, or the Daboia, or Tic Polonga, as it is variously called in India, is particularly deadly, and unfortunately common in many parts of India. Fayrer states that 471 snakes were brought in for record in one day at Amritsar in 1866. Of these over 300 belonged to this one deadly species. E. G. Boulenger states that it is \u201ceven more venomous than the majority of Cobras, its bite killing fowls in from thirty seconds to a few minutes, dogs in from ten minutes to four or five hours, and man in under twenty-four hours.\u201d\n\nThree recognized authorities in herpetology, Drs. G. A. Boulenger, T. Barbour and Nelly de Rouij have excluded Russell\u2019s Viper from the Malay Peninsula or Archipelago. And such I think is the generally accepted opinion. It is therefore somewhat alarming to find the following passage in a book entitled \u201cReptiles of the World\u201d by Raymond L. Ditmars, Curator of Reptiles and Assistant Curator of Mammals in the New York Zoological Park, published in London 1910:\n\n\u201cOne of the commonest and most deadly snakes of India is a species of Vipera. This is Tic Polonga, the Daboia, or Russell\u2019s Viper, V. russellii, a beautifully-coloured reptile reaching a length of five feet.\u201d\n\"The range of this snake, the largest of the Asiatic vipers, embraces India, Ceylon, Burma, Siam and the Malay Peninsula. My friend, Mr. Rudolf Weber, brought several small specimens of typical coloration from Sumatra, showing the species to occur on at least one of the larger islands.\"*\n\nE. G. Boulenger (1914) states that:\u2014\n\n\"Russell's viper, V. russelli, or Tic-polonga, as this large and justly dreaded snake is known in Ceylon, is found in hills, as well as in the plains of India, Ceylon, Burma, Siam, and Sumatra.\"\n\nHe based his record as regards Sumatra on the British Museum Catalogue, but in a letter to me dated 20th June, 1921, Mr. Boulenger agrees now that this may be regarded as a mistake.\n\nIn spite of this very definite assertion by Ditmars I felt that the discovery of Russell's Viper in Sumatra was so remarkable that it was worth while making some inquiries in order to obtain confirmation of this interesting record.\n\nMy friend Dr. T. Barbour of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., at my request interested himself in the matter and ascertained from Mr. Ditmars himself the following particulars about Mr. Weber and his Sumatran collections. Dr. Barbour writes:\u2014\n\n\"It seems that between 1892 to 1898 he (Mr. Rudolf Weber) was employed as an artist to illustrate publications of the Museum of Natural History in New York. During the latter part of this period he went on a scientific mission to Sumatra, but Ditmars informs me that now he thinks of it, that all of Weber's reptiles were dumped into large jars and remained lying about the Museum uncared for many years.\" Dr. Barbour concludes that \"there is absolutely no reason whatever to suppose that Weber did not collect these creatures in India while he was passing through en route to Sumatra.\"\n\nThe specimens are not to be found in the New York Museum now.\n\nIn the British Museum Catalogue of Snakes, the locality for one specimen in that Museum is \"? Sumatra.\" In the British Museum Hand-list of Snakes the distribution is given as \"India, Burma and Siam; Java and Sumatra?\"\n\nIn the light of the above I think one must look with considerable suspicion on the definite assertions by Ditmars and E. G. Boulenger as to its positive occurrence in Sumatra. Dr. Malcolm Smith gives Bangkok as the southernmost locality for it in Siam, and that I think must be regarded, at present, as the nearest point to the Malaysian sub-region, this deadly snake has yet reached.\n\n* The italics are mine. J. C. M.\nA New Method of Writing Trinomials.\n\nBy J. C. Moulton.\n\nIn my \"Hand-List of the Birds of Borneo\" published in this Society's Journal No. 67, 1914 (pp. 125-191) I introduced a slight innovation in the method of writing trinomials.\n\nA trinomial is usually written thus:\n\nChloropsis viridis viriditectus Hartert.\n\nI criticized this method on two grounds:\n\n(i) that the relatively greater importance of the specific name is not emphasised, or, to put it another way, that the sub-specific name is given undue prominence equal to, if not greater than, the specific name.\n\n(ii) that the name of the author of the species is omitted, while that of the author of the less important subspecies is retained.\n\nAs an improvement I therefore wrote:\n\nChloropsis viridis Horsfield viriditectus Hartert\n\nshortened to:\n\nChloropsis viridis Horsf. viriditectus Hart.\n\nIn this way due prominence is given to the specific entity, while the fact that the species is divisible into geographical races of relatively less importance is shewn by placing the subspecific name in less prominent type. The insertion of the author's name after the species obviates ambiguity, and is only a reasonable recognition of that author's work. At the same time it serves to mark off the subspecific name as a form apart.\n\nIt might be argued of course with justice that the name of the author of the genus should also be inserted. But the long-established custom of running generic and specific names together is sufficiently important to over-ride any such further innovation.\n\nI referred the point to the British Association Committee on Zoological Bibliography and Publication, whose opinion thereon was published in the Committee's Report to the Association (Section D) at the Edinburgh meeting in 1921 as follows:\n\n\"The Committee agrees that the alterations introduced by Mr. Moulton tend to increased clearness. If it be ever necessary to give the name of the author of the species, it is no less necessary when the form referred to is one of the subspecies into which the species has been divided, and Mr. Moulton's method of introducing it seems unexceptionable.\"\n\"The Committee does not wish by this expression of opinion to encourage the insertion of authors' names in general writing, except when they are needed to avoid ambiguity. Mr. Moulton's devices are best suited for such systematic lists as those in which he has employed them.\"\n\nThe type to be used is of some importance. In criticism of my method it has been suggested that capitals and small capitals would be better than small capitals and italics, because italics are so generally used to denote a synonym. The disadvantage of this is that capitals are so often required in systematic lists for sub-family names that it is desirable to reserve a less prominent type for the genus and species when written together in this way. Small capitals or clarendon would appear the most suitable for the genus and species with italics for the subspecies.\n\nThe inclusion of authors' names undoubtedly has a cumbersome effect and should only be employed in systematic lists or detailed monographs. In other works it is reasonable to omit them altogether; in fact for general purposes it should often suffice to give only the specific name and omit the subspecific name, unless there is any point in drawing attention to the subspecific distinction of the particular form under discussion.\n\nThe usual method of abbreviation in writing Latin names for well-known genera and species, or for genera which have been discussed already in any particular paper, is to give the initial letter of the genus instead of the name in full; thus *Elephas maximus*, becomes *E. maximus*. This system can be extended with advantage in the case of subspecies; thus, in discussing the subspecies of the Asiatic Elephant, reference would be made to the Sumatran form as *E. m. sumatranus*. In systematic lists, according to the method introduced by me and approved for such purposes by the British Association Committee on Zoological Bibliography and Publication, this would read: *Elephas maximus* Linn. *sumatranus* Temm., but for general purposes the abbreviated form as written above is regarded as more suitable.\nHindu Image from Sarawak.\n\nBy J. C. Moulton.\n\nEarly in 1921 a very interesting discovery was made at Limbang, Sarawak, by workmen removing the top of a hill near the Residency. They unearthed a small stone image, in remarkably good preservation, of Ganesa, the elephant-headed god of Wisdom. Ganesa or Ganapati, as one of the sons of Siva and Parvati, is one of the most revered gods of the Hindus. In the Hindu-Javanese religion he is Sang Yang Gana. He is the god of wisdom, the remover of obstacles. He is invoked at the beginning of a book and of important undertakings. He is a short fat figure, with protuberant belly, four hands, and the head of an elephant with only one tusk. In one hand he holds a shell, in another a discus, in the third a club or goad and in the fourth a water-lily. Sometimes he is depicted riding upon a rat or attended by one. His temples are numerous in the Dekhan. There are many legends accounting for his elephant head.\u00b9\n\nThe Sarawak image (see illustration) shows the god sitting on the usual lotus cushion. The actual height of the image is 24 inches and the rough stone block on which it rests 12 inches. Mr. F. F. Boult, Resident of Limbang, sent it to the Sarawak Museum, Kuching.\n\nProf. Dr. N. J. Krom of Leiden University, to whom I showed photographs, when he was on his way through Singapore, tells me that similar images were found on Gunong Kombeng in South-East Borneo some ten years ago.\u00b2 They included a Ganesa, a Brahma and a Siva. He suggested that the Sarawak image was of more direct Hindu origin and therefore probably older (6th or 7th century) than these discovered in South-East Borneo, which were undoubtedly of Hindu origin. A list of all the Hindu images discovered in Dutch Borneo will be found in the \"Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch-Indie\" (1919) vol. III, p. 198 under Oudheden.\n\nSir John Marshall, Director-General of Archaeology in India, kindly gives me the following interesting note, from which it will be seen that he suggests a later date for this Sarawak image.\n\n\"The image appears to be very similar to the ordinary type of Ganesa in India. The chief distinguishing features of the latter are (a) the elephant's head, (b) three eyes, (c) four arms, the usual symbols in the hands being a bowl of sweets, a rosary, an arc and the detached tusk of Ganesa himself, (d) a corpulent belly, (e) and a snake doing duty as the sacred thread. In the Borneo image we have the same large belly, the elephant's trunk and a snake for the yajnopavita.\"\n\n\u00b9 Vide J. Dowton \"A. Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology.\"\n\u00b2 Oudheid Kundig Verslag 1914, p. 152.\nIndian images of Ganesa are found seated in three different postures: (a) cross-legged, (b) one of the knees upraised and the other lying on the throne; (c) the right foot overhanging from the throne and resting on the ground and the left leg lying on the throne (sukhasana). In Archaeologisch Onderzoek of Java en Madura, Vol. II, Plates 40-42 are reproduced photographs of an image of Ganesa from Singasari in Java (now in the Ethnographical Museum of Leiden) which is seated with the right knee upraised and the left leg lying on the seat (surrounded by skulls). But in the Indian Museum there are two (Ja. 5 and 19) images of Ganesa from Java that are seated with the soles of the two feet joined. Photograph of Ja. 19 is enclosed herewith. This posture is un-Indian and appears to indicate a period of time when the Javanese image-makers had outlived the trammels of Indian tradition. In the photograph of the Borneo image the feet are not clear and probably mutilated. But there cannot be any doubt about the posture being the same as that of the two Javanese images of Ganesha in the Indian Museum, that is to say, seated with the soles of the two feet joined. The trunk (sunda) hangs down in a manner which suggests that, as in the Indian examples, it presumably rested on a bowl of sweets. The head-dress appears to be an elaborate conventional form of the jata, the \"matted locks\" which Siva wears despite the incongruity in the case of Ganesha! If it is a Jata, the image must represent Ganesha in an ascetic aspect, seated in meditation. This would explain the contemplative expression. But ascetic and contemplative Ganeshas are not known in India.\n\nThe Javanese images are assignable to the thirteenth century A.D., the age of the Brahmanic temples of Brambanan and Singasari. The Borneo image, which in its posture seems to disclose Javanese influence, is probably to be assigned to about the same epoch but may be somewhat earlier. The earliest Brahmanic inscriptions found in Borneo (published by Vogel in a Dutch Journal of 1917 or 1918) are assigned to the fifth century A.D. This image of Ganesha shows that Brahmanic culture flourished in Borneo for a long period. For further particulars about the types of Ganesha images reference may be made to H. Krishna Sastri's South-Indian Images, pp. 165-176, and T. A. Gopinath Rao's Elements of Hindu Iconography, Vol. I, Part I, pp. 35-67.\"\n\nThe discovery of this image created great interest in Sarawak. Thousands flocked to the Sarawak Museum to see it. The Museum attendants had the time of their lives seeing that the god disposed of all the offerings made to it.\n\nThe accompanying illustration is from an enlarged photograph by Mrs. F. F. Boult, who tells me that she gave another one to the Sikhs in Kuching, at their request, for their Temple.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nNotes.\n\nThe Malayan Badger.\n\nDr. W. Docters van Leeuwen, Director of the Botanical Gardens, Buitenzorg contributes the following interesting notes on the Malayan Badger in Java:\n\nBuitenzorg, 20th May, 1921.\n\n\"With much interest I have read your article on the occurrence of the Malayan Badger in Borneo (Journ. Str. Br. Roy. Asiat. Soc. No. 83, 1921, pp. 142-146). This animal is very common in Java and I have seen it or smelt it on every mountain which I have visited. The lowest elevation at which I have seen this animal was 1000 feet on Mount Moeria in Java-central. The last time I saw it on Mount Pangerango, near Buitenzorg, was from an elevation of 4000 feet up to the summit, about 11,000 feet. There it is also common and very tame; in the vicinity of my mountain cabin it seeks the earthworms and insects under the thick moss-cover of the old crater valley. In the neighbourhood of our mountain laboratory at Tjibodas it is also very frequent and more than once we were awakened by the stink of this animal walking under our sleeping room.\n\n\"It will interest you perhaps that in this forest there is a kind of fern, which has the same smell as the badger though not so strong, and which is named by the natives the \"pakoe sigoeng\"; its scientific name is Didymochleena lunulata Desv.\n\n\"I have had some accidents meeting this animal but never have I felt any ill effect from the anal fluid though it is far from agreeable to be in contact with it. In some parts of Java, especially in the old sultanates it is said that a very weakened solution of the fluid is used as a perfume.\"\n\nBuitenzorg, 2nd June, 1921.\n\n\"In the neighbourhood of Mount Goentoeer near Garoet I had once built a small bamboo cabin, with walls of dried grass and about every evening a badger came and looked in one of my open rooms and every night as he walked near the cabin we were awakened by the smell. This stench he bears too, when not irritated, in his hairs, and also the path followed by this animal in the forest is recognisable by the stink. In the forest of Mount Pangerango I have seen the badger often in the first hours of the afternoon, but it is really a night-animal.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nSince describing in this Journal the two Bornean skins as a new subspecies, *Mydaus javanensis montanus*, I have examined a third imperfect skin from the Sarawak Museum. It was obtained from the Kalabits of the ulu Baram and almost certainly comes from the same locality as the other two. Unfortunately the Kalabits have made it up as a seat-mat for their own use and consequently cut it down considerably; only the back remains, the head, legs and tail having been cut off. It measures 19 inches by $10\\frac{1}{2}$ at the widest part. A comparison of the whitish dorsal marking shows that it must have been similar in size to the other two. The white streak is 3 inches across at the widest, then narrows abruptly and breaks off completely for 3 inches before continuing as a very thin line for another 4 inches, after which it widens to the extent of 2 inches across the lumbar region.\n\nThe length of the skin from the widest part of the dorsal streak between the shoulders to the root of the tail is $16\\frac{1}{2}$ to $17$ inches in all three skins.\n\nThe skin representing the Type of this new subspecies has been deposited in the British Museum. The second and third skins remain in the Raffles Museum, Singapore, and the Sarawak Museum respectively. No others are as yet known.\n\nJ. C. Moulton.\n\nA Rail New to the Malay Peninsula.\n\nWhile arranging and naming the collection of Bird skins which have accumulated in the Raffles Museum during the last thirty years, an interesting discovery by which another species is added to the list of Birds known to occur in the Malay Peninsula was made by Mrs. Horton, who has already done much valuable work on the bird collections of this Museum. Among the mass of unidentified material stored away was the skin of a Rail bearing the following label: \"Kotta Tinggi, Johore. Dec. 18th 1892. Sex female.\" This skin proved to be that of Elwes' Crake, (*Porzana bicolor* Walden).\n\nThis Crake was first procured by Captain Elwes in the interior of Sikkim at an elevation of 5,000 feet, in September 1870. Godwin-Austen found it in rice-fields about 5,000 feet up in the Khasi Hills in the month of June. Hume says he is sure he saw this species below Hoondoong at a height of 3,500 feet. It was obtained later by Collingwood Ingram in 1906 in the Lichiang Valley, West Yunnan, South China.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.\nThe Ruddy Crake (*Limnobaenus fuscus*) which occurs regularly in the Malay Peninsula, is closely allied to and somewhat similar to Elwes' Crake but the latter may be easily distinguished by the grey colour of the head, neck and breast, the Ruddy Crake being uniformly rufous.\n\nThere is, however, a slight possibility of a mistake having been made in attaching the original label, as a former Curator of the Raffles Museum obtained several specimens of birds and insects from the Eastern Himalayas and the Johore label *may* have been tied in error to one of this collection. There is no evidence to support this theory, and considering the habits of Rails there is nothing at all surprising in the bird having been found in Johore. The Indian records were made in the summer and our specimen may have migrated here for the winter.\n\nIt would, of course, be more satisfactory if this record could be supported by the capture of another specimen in the Malay Peninsula.\n\nJ. C. MOULTON.\n\nA Tiger at Sea.\n\nInstances of Tigers swimming across wide rivers or narrow straits are common enough. Tigers are still found occasionally on the island of Singapore where they have arrived from Johore after a swim of one to two miles across the Straits. The following note however of a much longer swim is perhaps worthy of record.\n\nMr. G. O. Dorrity of Trengganu, to whom I am indebted for the information, obtained the story from an old Malay fisherman in Kelantan some eight years ago. The local fishing fleet was proceeding out to the fishing grounds one night from the coast of Kelantan when a dark object was observed moving about on the surface of the water. The position given was midway between the Perhentian Islands and the mainland, i.e. about five miles from the mainland; the total distance between the mainland and the nearest island of the group is eleven miles. On a closer inspection the object was discovered to be a full grown tiger and evidently in some distress. A *pukat* (seine-net) was thrown over it and the animal, entangled in the mesh, was towed behind a boat until drowned.\n\nIt seems impossible to credit this tiger with the deliberate intention of swimming out ten miles to a small group of islands which he could hardly see from the mainland. Probably he was accidentally swept out to sea when attempting perhaps to cross a river at the mouth.\n\nJ. C. MOULTON.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nMeteorite in Malacca Straits.\n\nOn the morning of September 11th about 6.15 a.m., as I was lying in a berth on S. S. \"Klang\" facing the sea I suddenly saw a large ball of light, of dazzling brightness falling from the sky. Almost simultaneously there was a loud report resembling the firing of a large gun, as the meteorite struck the sea.\n\nIt could not have been more than 300 feet away.\n\nThe master, Captain MacDonald, stated that it would have sunk the ship had it struck her.\n\nThis occurrence took place when we were about one hour out of Port Swettenham on the voyage from Singapore.\n\nA. L. Hoops.\n\n\"Berkluat\"\u2014A Trengganu Custom.\n\nThe offence known is \"Berkluat\" is peculiar to the state of Trengganu alone in British Malaya. Should a man and woman be seen to exchange an affectionate glance, they may thereupon be arrested without warrant, charged with \"Berkluat,\" and sentenced to as much as 3 months imprisonment. The giving of the \"glad eye\" is therefore a matter of some danger in Trengganu.\n\nThe local dignitaries, who are mostly of Arabic extraction are said to be opposed to the abolition of this charge, though it is a fruitful source of blackmail. As most of these magnates possess a plurality of wives, it is rather pedantic on their part to object to a little ogling between couples of humble origin.\n\nPerhaps they have in mind\n\n\"Apa guna pasang pelita\n\"Kalau tiada dengan sumbohnya?\n\"Apa guna bermain mata\n\"Jikalau tiada dengan sunggohnya?\"\n\nA. L. Hoops.\nPoints of the Compass in Brunei Malay.\n\nThe Points of the Compass in Brunei Malay have been discussed by Major J. C. Moulton in this Journal No. 83, 1921, p. 75.\n\nThe Serang of the s. l. Brunei explained the use of the word Utara as meaning N. E. by the fact that Malays fix the points of the compass by the winds; Musim Utara is the general Malay expression for the N. E. monsoon during which they cannot go out fishing, but if the wind shifts a point north they can, so they have a definite name for this: Iraga. And thus avoid confusion with the rightly dreaded Utara.\n\nThe coast of Borneo runs from S. W. to N. E., so a wind from the open sea i.e. Angin Laut would be a N. W. wind and a wind from the west would still be a sea wind Barat Laut i.e. from the western sea. The use of Barat Tepat for south west is probably a confusion of thought as such a wind would come straight (tepat) up the coast.\n\nThe other three winds are not sea winds; Timor the East is always definite; Selatan I don\u2019t think I ever heard used; the meaning given in Wilkinson is the wind from the side of the Straits not S. E.\n\nBarat Daya for south might be explained by the meaning of Daya, treacherous, deceptive, as a wind partly off the shore would be.\n\nF. W. Douglas.\n\nKuala Lumpur 16/7/21.\n\nA Note on the Tagals of Sarawak.\n\nThe Tagals of whom a few hundred have wandered down into Sarawak territory from British Borneo are a stockily built tribe whose looks and ornaments, tattooing and headress are very similar to some Dayak tribes. They are renowned amongst surrounding Muruts and others as experts in the art of poisoning. On one occasion I took from a small cloth which was round the neck of a Tagal chief a small piece of wood bound round with rotan and showed it to a Murut chief who asked me as he examined it from whom I had taken it. A native officer standing by mentioned the name of the Tagal chief whereupon the Murut dropped it like a piece of hot coal and nothing would induce him to touch it again. According to several Muruts this small piece of wood was quite sufficient to give a man violent fever.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe Tagals in Sarawak have a very curious form of amusement called \"Ungakang.\" In the middle of their long house verandahs there is a hole about 15 feet by 20 feet let down into the floor with loose spring boards at the bottom into which the young men jump. Then they gradually work up a higher speed, jumping up and down, singing \"sembila kun mahor\" meaning in Malay \"Baik baik kita jalan.\" When there are sufficient men on the boards and the singing has been going on a while the women dressed in their best jump on and with their hands on each others shoulders slowly lock-step round the jumping men whilst the swaying boards throw them up and down with every other step. This is kept up for hours on end and is a survival of a head dance.\n\nThey are very artistic; most of their doors are ornamented with drawings as also are their bamboo pipes, combs etc. Singing is a special forte and some of their chorus songs are very fine and tuneful, quite unlike those of surrounding tribes. They are tatooed they say to act as lights when their eyes are closed in death.\n\nSome Tagals have a story that the origin of Man was from Monkeys and that at one time the people of the world were all male monkeys. Others say that originally the Sun laid three eggs, one white which was a Murut, one green, a Tagal and one Red.\n\nThe first man on earth according to many Tagals was set to work making the holes for the rivers to run down. He had seven children, the youngest of whom was drowned in the Runi which was the first river made. Before the holes were made for the rivers, when it rained the water came right up and drove the people on to the top of Mt. Mulok and it was once whilst all the animals and people were up there for a long time that they ran short of food. The other animals talked together and decided to eat the dogs, who, understanding what they said, were very angry and rushed in and bit them and that is why to this day the dog hunts other animals.\n\nWhen a man dies they put in his mouth a string of beads. The idea is that when he reaches the top of the world and entrance to the dead man's country, he finds it guarded by a snake who demands that a man shall look for its excrement and eat it before he can pass. When therefore the man reached this he bites the beads which make a noise and the snake is hoodwinked and allows them through.\n\nLike other Bornean natives they believe in birds (omens) but many of them only for the first two days of a journey or of work. They blame women for the beginning of head-hunting and blood feuds and like certain other tribes many of the women will not eat deer's flesh as they believe it to be the reincarnation of dead men. Their houses are very strongly built and much more carefully erected than those of the surrounding Muruts. The most favored earring holes are series pierced right round the ears both for men and women.\n\nE. V. Andreini.\nSome Notes on Oriental Dragonflies:\nthe Genus Macromia.\n\nBy F. F. Laidlaw, M.A. (Cantab.)\n\nThe following account is the result of a study of examples of some twelve of the Oriental species of the genus, that I am fortunate enough to have before me, apparently a greater number of species than was available to Martin in preparing the Selysian Catalogue of the Corduliinae. Species of the genus are rather scarce in collections, and being at first sight often somewhat uniform in colouring and build, their discrimination is a little difficult.\n\nDr. Ris, who has the gift of illuminating the dark places of systematic Odonatology, has not very long ago defined a small group of species belonging to the genus (Suppl. Entomol. No. 5. pp. 65-70, 1916) using characters that are easily determined and of due importance. He has thereby paved the way for a further grouping of the Oriental, and especially of the Malayan species, such as I attempt here.\n\nEmploying characters similar to those made use of by Dr. Ris I arrange the Malayan species in groups, one of which is of course the group already defined by Dr. Ris. This grouping, unfortunately dependant in part on sexual characters, is I think tolerably natural, and should, with the aid of figures given, facilitate the determination of species. It is impossible to provide a satisfactory dichotomic table or key. I therefore give definitions of the groups, and under the heading of each group is added a short but I hope sufficient account of each of the species referred to that group. Fuller notes on the new species and remarks on some of the others, with text-figures, are appended.\n\nThe characters relied on for the defining of the three groups of species I note below have already been employed by Dr. Ris in his paper, and suggested by Martin in the Monograph as useful. These characters are: firstly the colouring of the post-clypeus, which may be yellow, or may agree with that of the rest of the front of the head in being reddish brown or dark-brown. Secondly the presence or absence of a humeral stripe on the synthorax; note that a lateral oblique stripe of yellow is present in all Oriental species of the genus. Thirdly the presence or absence of a flattened, pointed, triangular process on the dorsum of the tenth segment of the abdomen of the male.\n\nSpecific characters are: the colour pattern of the abdominal segments, the occurrence of metallic lustre on some of the more basal of those segments, the colouring of the costal nerve, (? occasionally variable), the number of ante- and post-nodal nerves.\n(shown by the \"nodal indicator\"); size, and lastly the shape of the anal appendages and of the genital structures of the second abdominal segment of the male.\n\nProbably also the shape of the margin of the hind-wing of the male, between the membranule and the anal angle, is of some specific value.\n\nAs will be seen from the sequel, the total number of species of *Macromia* from the Orient is not less than eighteen; it will probably be increased considerably in the future. The *Macromias* are handsome, strong-flying insects that will repay careful study in the field, and the difficulty of capturing some of the species at any rate raises their pursuit almost to the dignity of a sport.

No humeral stripe. Lateral stripe, covering the stigma pale, buff-yellow. The brown ground colour deepens to black immediately on either side of this stripe, and is here more richly metallic. There is also a small lateral ventral mark of buff-yellow on the metepimeron not quite terminal.\n\nAbdomen dorsally black, or brownish-black; dark brown ventrally and on the sides of the first and second segment. The second segment has transverse band of a creamy yellow colour running across the dorsum from one auricle to the other not touching the base or apex of the segment.\n\nThe third segment has a dorsal spot of the same colour immediately in front of the transverse carina, divided into two by the longitudinal median carina. Below it is creamy-white.\n\nSegments 4-5 have small paired lunules similarly placed but of a darker yellow, whilst 6 is entirely black.\n\nThe seventh segment has a small basal yellow mark on the dorsum occupying only about one-eighth of the length of the segment. The remaining segments entirely black.\n\nAnal appendages very dark brown, exactly corresponding to de Selys' description.\n\nThe genital lobe of the second segment is small. The hamules are slender, boldly recurved apically so as to be hook-like.\n\nThe tenth segment of the abdomen has a sharply pointed dorsal prominence.\n\nI believe that *M. borneensis* Kruger and *M. pyramidalis* Martin, are probably members of this group. I have not seen examples of either.\n\nAs a special feature (possibly found in all the males of this group, as I have seen it in *cincta* and in no other Oriental groups) I would call attention to a curious thickening of a small part of\nthe ventral margin of the tergite, close to the anterior end of the segment. This thickening of the margin is about a millimetre in length and is beset with a few very stiff short hairs. It is quite a definite structural feature and possibly serves some purpose in connection with the genital structures of the segment.\n\n*Cincta* and its allies seem to form a distinct group of rather large species, characterized not only by peculiarities of coloration but also by the relative large size of the pterostigma, and by certain secondary sexual characters. The group appears to be confined to Malaya and Indo-China.\n\n**Macromia corycia** n. sp. (Fig. 5.)\n\n1\u2642. Ulu Baram, Sarawak, Borneo 3. xi. 20., coll. J. C. Moulton.

A. Soc., No. 85, 1922.*\nKruger's account of his species *gerstaeckeri* is sufficiently definite in this respect. He says of the tenth segment of the abdomen that it is \"vorn abgeschr\u00e4gt und zeimlich tief gefurcht, der R\u00fcchen erhebt sich nach hinten zu einem stumpfen H\u00f6cker.\"\n\nIt is certain that this description cannot apply to *M. callisto*, and as I believe the character to be of importance I feel justified, after having had an opportunity of making a fresh study of my specimen, in giving it a name. It differs also a little in size being distinctly smaller than *gerstaeckeri*; it is in fact the smallest of the Oriental species of the genus. Other differences are noted below.\n\n\u2642 (specimen rather immature) wings slightly and evenly tinged with brown. Pterostigma 1.75 mm. brown. Costal nerve black.

The number of post-nodals in the hind-wings is smaller relatively to the number of antenodals than in the case of any of the other species I have examined. The anal angle is not very acute, and the anal margin of the wing, between the grey membranule and the anal angle, is straight.

Agrees fairly well with Martin's description so far as colouring goes, but not with his coloured figure, which again is not altogether in agreement with his account of the species. Further the anal appendages are unlike those figured in certain respects. But as his figure here also does not altogether fit his description, I think it wise to refer the specimen here provisionally, noting further a wide difference in habitat. *Fraenata* is recorded from Tonkin and Corea, but I cannot help thinking the latter locality unlikely.\n\nWings slightly tinged with yellow brown at the extreme bases.

(Here the specimen resembles Martin\u2019s coloured figure but differs from his description). Segment 7 with a basal yellowish-brown ring, covering almost the basal third of the segment, prolonged mid-dorsally to a point at about the middle of the segment.

Both males are in good condition, and appear fully mature.\n\nThe female is distinctly larger. The post-clypeus is of a dull yellow colour, except immediately above the ante-clypeus, where it is narrowly lined with black. The synthorax resembles that of the male but the yellow colouring is duller than in the other sex. The abdomen is marked as in the male, but the sixth segment (like the fourth and fifth) has a pair of lunules in front of the transverse carina. In this case they are very small.

L. Collenette.\n\nAmong the subfamilies composing the Lycaenidae, commonly called the \"blues,\" there are several which show a conspicuous eye-spot on the margin of the underside of the hind wing, coupled with a pair of tails, or often two pairs of tails, of varying length and thickness.\n\nWhen the butterfly is at rest with wings closed, the tails are in many cases crossed the one over the other and kept in motion by an irregular rotatory movement of the hind wings. In other species the tails are long and fragile and are stirred by any breeze which is blowing. Again in other species the tails are short or absent but the eye-spots conspicuous. The wings are in some cases slightly separated, which throws a shadow between, giving an appearance of breadth when viewed from behind.\n\nThis device has been generally attributed to an imitation, perfected by natural selection, of the head or in many cases the head and antennae, the enemy being led to attack the brittle hind wings, which break and allow the butterfly to escape. This has been noted by many writers and is usually referred to as being a protection against insectivorous birds, although other enemies are frequently mentioned. It would appear, however, that in Malaya the device is directed not so much against birds as against wingless foes, chief among these being lizards.\n\nThe device of eye-spots and tails is not shown in many families of Malayan butterflies, and in no other is it brought to such a state of perfection.\n\nMany species of Lycaenids, in contradistinction to the majority of butterflies, pass their lives close to the ground rather than at the tops of the trees. When disturbed, they rely on a short flight of a few yards and a \"disappearance\" by alighting suddenly on a leaf, when their closed wings render them inconspicuous. On a number of occasions I have followed up some of the commoner Lycaenids, putting them to flight and watching their actions, and on no single occasion has the butterfly alighted out of reach of my net, the usual height being 4 ft. to 6 ft. It therefore follows that enemies against which these insects must protect themselves hunt in bushes as well as in trees.\n\nBirds are not common in the lower depths of the jungle, and Lycaenids inhabiting paths shut in by trees would be largely free from their attentions. Lizards, however, would appear to be quite as common at low elevations as among the tree tops.\n\nThe majority of lizards appear to catch their prey by the use of sight only. They approach, often from a considerable distance, at a fairly rapid rate, ending with a cautious \"one foot at a time\" advance, and a final swift grab at the insect.\nA lizard would in most instances approach the insect from a branch, eventually climbing out from the base of the leaf on which it had settled. A bird would either catch a butterfly in flight, (unlikely in the case of the Lycaenids), or would make a quick peck at one which settled near to its perch. It does not appear possible that a bird could make a sufficiently quiet approach to stalk a Lycaenid successfully.\n\nAs the result of a number of observations, I find that some species of Lycaenids show a certain amount of discrimination in settling. They choose an exposed position rather than one among the leaves and usually the upper side of the leaf. The position is generally near the centre of the leaf, and the head of the butterfly in perhaps 90% of cases is lower than the tail. The point of the average leaf being lower than the fixed end, it follows that the butterfly presents its protective apparatus to the end of the leaf which is attached to the branch. This appears to indicate that the dangers to be avoided come from the bush rather than from the air.\n\nI have never seen a jungle lizard in the act of catching a butterfly. However, the common Chi-chah of the houses (*Hemidactylus frenatus*), although principally a night feeder, offers an opportunity for experiment. I have on several occasions liberated Lycaenids in a room at night, but on account of the jolting received on the way home or perhaps the absence of daylight, the butterfly generally flutters to a wall and remains absolutely still, without any rotation of the wings. Chi-chahs as a rule take no interest in an insect which they do not see in motion, and if the butterfly is disturbed with a stick, the Chi-chahs usually take fright and refuse to feed.\n\nIn Penang, in January 1921, I liberated 17 Lycaenids. There were several other insects in the room, attracted by the light and the Chi-chahs had already dined and were not very active. Three of the butterflies were attacked. One was taken by the head and eaten. Two were attacked from the tail, but in both cases the snap missed the butterfly entirely and it escaped. It is difficult to make this experiment in Singapore, as suitable butterflies are not very common.\n\nThe proportion of Lycaenids showing this protective device, which are deficient of part of the hind wings, is relatively large, and in worn specimens which have been flying for some days, might be put as high as 10%. The broken portion generally resembles the rounded shape of a lizard's mouth rather than the sharp bill of a bird, and it can be demonstrated with forceps that the wings will fracture where gripped, and not naturally with a rounded shape.\n\nIt appears to me that the Lycaenids showing this device are protecting themselves against lizards rather than against birds, and it would be interesting if observations on the subject could be collected.\n\nR.

This is an authoritative text of the Malay Laws of Malacca, of which an abstract is given in Newbold\u2019s history of Malacca (Vol. II pp. 231 et seq). It is particularly valuable because Malay \u201cCodes\u201d deserve more comparative study than they have hitherto received and especially comparison with such Indian \u201cCodes\u201d as are to be found, for example in the *Ain-i Akhbar* and *Tarikh-i Tahiri*.\n\n*Maleisch Woordenboek* (*Maleisch-Nederlandsch and Nederlandsch-Maleisch*) by Dr. Ph.

The book will be of incalculable service to all serious students of Malay.\n\n*Wir Menschen der indonesischen Erde* by Renward Brandstetter (Luzern). This comparison of the \u201csouls\u201d of two peoples, the Indonesian and the Indogermanic is a sequel to the author\u2019s valuable studies of Indonesian philology, familiar to English readers from Mr. C. O. Blagden\u2019s translations of several of the best known.\n\n*Pantoen M\u00e9lajoe* issued by the *Balai Poestaka* (Weltevreden, 1920). This is a fine collection of Malay quatrains, the Dutch counterpart of the book published by Messrs Wilkinson and Winstedt, now out of print. The collection will be of value for comparative purposes, especially for comparison with the Peninsular collection just mentioned.\n\n*Kitab Loghat Melayu* by R. O. Winstedt D. Litt. and Ibrahim bin Dato\u2019 Muda, Linggi (Singapore, 1921). A dictionary in Malay for Malays, the first that has appeared in the Peninsula\nsince the old *Kamus Mahmudiah*, long since out of date. It is one of the series of Dr. Winstedt\u2019s works, prepared for the use of vernacular schools and colleges. It has been favorably reviewed by Mr. C. O. Blagden in our parent Journal.\n\n*Kitab Tawarikh Melayu*, third edition by R. O. Winstedt D. Litt. (Singapore 1921). This is a revised edition of a Malay history for Malays, which has excited much interest in the vernacular press.\n\n*Dictionary of Colloquial Malay (Malay-English and English-Malay)* by R. O. Winstedt (Singapore 1920). This is the first concise colloquial dictionary of Malay by an English scholar and is companion to the author\u2019s \u201cColloquial Malay,\u201d of which a new edition appeared in 1920. Mr. Blagden has reviewed it in our parent Journal (October, 1921).\n\n*An Abridged Malay-English Dictionary* (Romanised) by R. J. Wilkinson c.m.g., (Singapore 1919). A second and revised edition of a book which has been in the hands of all English students of the language since 1908.

Winstedt (Singapore 1919). Vol. 15 of the Malay Literature Series, published by the Methodist Publishing House. It is an 18th century history of Perak and it is surprising that no text of such an interesting Malay historical work has hitherto appeared. Not only does it throw light on Malay life of the period but also on Perak\u2019s relations with the Dutch. Dr. Winstedt\u2019s text is based on three MSS. and there is another at the Hague.\n\n*Hikayat Bayan Budiman atau Ch\u00ebrita Khojah Maimun* edited with introduction and notes by R. O. Winstedt, D. Litt, Oxon. (Singapore 1920). This is vol. 16 of the Malay Literature Series and is the first complete text of the Malay version of the Persian *Tutinameh*, known in England as \u201cTales of a Parrot.\u201d Dr. Winstedt\u2019s text is based primarily on two MSS. of the tale in Raffles Library, Singapore. He also prints the oldest MS. of the Malay version, the fragment now in the Bodleian Library, which belonged formerly to Edward Pococke and dates from about 1600 A.D. This volume should interest many Oriental scholars.\n\n*A History of the Peninsular Malays with chapters on Perak and Selangor* by R. J. Wilkinson c.m.g., (Singapore 1920). This is a revised and enlarged edition of \u201cHistory, Part I,\u201d printed in 1908 in \u201cPapers on Malay Subjects.\u201d \u201cResearch has added to our knowledge of early Malay history and the last four chapters embody hitherto unpublished results of original study.\u201d Especially interesting is the chapter on the murder of Mr. J. W. Birch and the events leading to the Perak war. Mr. C. O. Blagden\nhas drawn attention to some inaccuracies and criticising the author's failure to give references in our parent Journal (J. R. A. S. October 1921).\n\n*Johol, Inas, Ulu Muar, Jempul, Gunong Pasir and Terachi: their History and Constitution* by J. E. Nathan and R. O. Winstedt (1920). This is the last but one of the second series of \"Papers on Malay Subjects,\" which owed their inspiration to Mr. Wilkinson originally. This volume gives the latest theory as to which States composed the ancient Negri Sembilan. It also gives much information invaluable to government officers stationed in Negri Sembilan to-day. This book also Mr. Blagden has reviewed.\n\n*Perak Malay* by C. C. Brown (Calcutta 1921, published for the Committee for Malay Studies, Kuala Lumpur). This is the latest volume in the Second Series of \"Papers on Malay Subjects.\" It is without question the most valuable and scholarly study of any Peninsular dialect that has yet appeared. It is to be hoped that there may be found students to write similar brochures, say, on the dialects of Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu and Negri Sembilan. One of the dialogues was written by H. H. the Sultan of Perak, and the Raja di-Hilir (Raja Chulan) assisted the author to read the proofs. The 29 dialogues in the Perak River vernacular are prefaced by a scholarly introduction. \"To Lambok (p. 68) is referred to, if my memory serves me, in \"Notes and Queries\" of this Society: he was a not very remote Kinta chief and will be found in Dr. Winstedt's \"Perak Pedigrees.\"\nLIST OF MALAY WORKS SOLD BY THE STRAITS BRANCH\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nPrice $2.50 each.\n\nHt.

S. Willbourn,\n\nAssistant Geologist, Federated Malay States.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThis account is a digest of the writings of many geologists. It would occupy too much space for me to detail all of them, but most of my information was derived from the following:\u2014 La Touche on the Northern Shan States, Middlemiss on the Southern Shan States and Karenni, Coggin Brown on Burma and Yunnan, R\u00e9sultats de la mission g\u00e9ologique et mini\u00e8re du Yunnan m\u00e9ridional, Sept. 1903\u2014Jan. 1904, Situation de l'Indo-Chine de 1902-1907, Scrivenor on the Malay Peninsula, Molengraaf on Borneo, Van Cappelle on the West Coast of Sumatra, Wing Easton on West Borneo, Verbeek on the Moluccas, Amboyna, Banka, and Billiton, and various authors in the Jaarboek van het Mijnwezen in Nederlandsch Oost-Indi\u00eb.\n\nThe area dealt with includes Burma, the Shan States, Yunnan, Siam, Indo-China, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the intermediate islands. Unfortunately, the most satisfactory method of presenting a general idea of the geology, namely to prepare a geological map and to base the discussion on it, is not available, because the geological structure of most of the countries has not been mapped. In spite of this, enough is known, even in the least known regions, such as Yunnan, and parts of Indo-China, to compare the rock formations of any particular period in the different countries, and from the present features it is possible to trace the effects of certain wide-spread earth-movements which have affected all the countries in the area, and to compare them with the effects on neighbouring lands.\n\nLarge gaps occur in our knowledge of the area, so blanks must exist in our comparison of the structure of the different countries. It must be admitted, however, that these gaps are not always the result of imperfect knowledge of the countries in question, for, in more than one case, geologists are at a loss to account for phenomena in countries where the structure is\nknown in considerable detail. For example, no explanation has yet been given of the recently extinct volcanoes which occur in a belt of Tertiary beds in Burma, between the Irrawaddy and the Shan States. If they were situated near the great fault-plane which passes from north to south many miles to the east, their presence could easily be explained, but their occurrence in Tertiary beds, so far from this great fault, is a mystery.\n\n**Earth Movements.**\n\nThe geographical and geological features of the area were established as the result of folding-movements of at least three different periods, but the earth-movement in the late Mesozoic period (Hercynian), and the Tertiary earth-movement, which affected Europe, North Africa, and the other parts of Asia, have had a more widespread effect on our area than the earliest one. Folding movements before the Mesozoic period took place on a large scale only in the northern part of the area, Indo China and probably Yunnan, although the presence of fragments of granite in volcanic ashes and tufts in Singapore, probably older than the Mesozoic granite of the Malay Peninsula, and the Palaeozoic granite, older than Permian, alluded to by Verbeek in describing the geology of Amboyna, are indications that this earth-movement took place to some extent also in the Malay Peninsula and East Indies.\n\nThe influence of the later movements is very marked in all of the countries under consideration, and successive parallel mountain folds, arranged roughly *en \u00e9chelon*, can be traced through the area, beginning in the northwest, near Tibet, at the eastern end of the huge Himalayan mountain range. To these folds Suess gave the name \"Coulisses,\" and, talking of our area, he says, \"Then, in the Shan States of Burma, several of the coulisses which approach from the north and northeast disappear beneath a karst-like plateau of Palaeozoic limestone, which is folded and owes its tabular form to denudation. Fresh coulisses make their appearance in the south and form the Malay Peninsula.......\" In this way the mighty swell of the Altaides in Thibet subsides and is dispersed. The whole continent becomes lower. Many coulisses disappear. Only a few long branches are continued 'on the east into the cordillera of Annam; on the west, always giving rise to fresh coulisses, through the Malay Peninsula, and still further, to Java and beyond.\"\n\nThe most prominent coulisse in the western part of the area is the Naga-Arakan-Andaman-Nicobar-Barissan fold, with its axis extending from Upper Burma in the northwest, running south through the Andaman Islands, and the Nicobar Islands, and turning east through Sumatra and Java. Another important coulisse can be traced as the Main Range in the Malay Peninsula, through Singkep and Banka, and the result of the earth-movement which caused this particular fold was the intrusion of the Mesozoic granite, accompanied by the mineralisation from which originated the\nworld's richest tin deposits. A coulisse between these two begins in Siam, and runs in a direction slightly west of south into Upper Perak whence it extends as a granite mountain range passing near Taiping to the Dindings, and, according to a Dutch geologist, along the east coast of Sumatra, masked by more recent beds, passing through Billiton in an easterly direction, and turning northeast through the centre of Borneo, and up through the Philippines out of our area. Another important fold or coulisse is represented by the Annam cordillera, perhaps continued south into either the Anamba Islands or the Natuna Islands, and thence into Borneo.\n\nThe Mesozoic folding was more intense, in the greater part of the area, than that which affected the Tertiary rocks, and this is shown by the fact that the Tertiary rocks often have gentle undulating folds, whereas the Palaeozoic rocks, upon which they unconformably rest, are vertical or highly inclined. However, the Tertiary beds were subjected to intense earth-movements in some districts, as, for example, in Eastern Yunnan, and after folds had been denuded away, great faults cut across the region, at about the end of the Pliocene, probably giving rise to the lakes in which the late Tertiary fresh-water beds were laid down.\n\nIn Western Yunnan there were strong folding movements after the Permo-Carboniferous and before the upper Permian period.\n\n**Stratigraphical Sequence.**\n\nThe mountain folds which were described above have been eroded, with the result that there are now exposed strata of all ages, since the period before the dawn of life on the earth. All the countries of our area, south of Burma, formed part of the Palaeozoic continent of Gondwanaland, which remained as a permanent land surface from pre-Cambrian times until Devonian or Carboniferous, and no fossiliferous rocks of pre-Carboniferous age are known, except in the north. Earth-movements and aerial denudation of the later rocks, in Yunnan and the Shan States of Burma, have brought these old rocks to the surface.\n\n**Pre-Cambrian.**\n\nMany Dutch geologists have expressed the opinion that the \"oudeschiefer\" (old schist or old slate) formation of the East Indies is, in part, pre-Cambrian, though they admit that where it is not overlain by Carboniferous limestone it may be of Mesozoic age. Some of these geologists have correlated the \"oudeschiefer\" with the schist series of the Malay Peninsula, the greater part, and perhaps the whole, of which is of Rhaetic age and later, so it appears that there are good grounds for not yet accepting any part of the \"oudeschiefer\" as pre-Cambrian. In this account we will postpone a description of this \"old schist\" formation until we are describing the younger Palaeozoic and the Mesozoic formations.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nIn Yunnan the succession of pre-Cambrian rocks is as shewn below.\n\n* * * * Unconformity * * * *\n\n2. Kao Liang system. Phyllites, quartzites, slates, and an occasional calcareous horizon. In part pre-Cambrian and part Cambrian.\n\n* * * * Unconformity * * * *\n\n1. A basal mass of gneisses and schists underlying all recognised groups.\n\nThe basal gneisses and schists are so metamorphosed that it is impossible to determine their original character, except that a small proportion are recognised as metamorphosed sediments. They are intruded by granites which are relatively young, though some of them may be pre-Cambrian.\n\nIn the Northern Shan States there is a large development of Archaean gneisses resembling those of South Western Yunnan in that they possess a similar N.E.\u2014S.W. strike. The general mass are of intermediate chemical composition, and they consist of biotite gneisses, which are often remarkably rich in garnets, and which are interfoliated with more acid rocks, including pegmatites and graphic granites. The orthoclase of these last rocks is not infrequently converted into moonstone; often it is more completely altered into epidote, muscovite, and kaolin. In Nyunggou district these acid rocks contain pink and blue tourmaline (rubellite and indicolite), and it is probably from rocks of this class that the fine gem rubellites are derived.\n\nWith the gneisses there occur certain subordinate rocks of basic and sometimes ultra-basic composition, including pyroxene gneisses and pyroxene granulites, and with these rocks, and particularly with the ultra-basic types, certain remarkable crystalline limestones, containing rubies and spinels, are most intimately associated.\n\nA series of mica schists occurs to the south of the ruby mines area, and they seem to pass upwards into the Chaung Magyi series, so being either pre-Cambrian or Cambrian.\n\nThe Kao Liang system in Yunnan is certainly in part pre-Cambrian, and partly Cambrian. It occurs as bands, running from north to south, which widen somewhat as they are traced to the south. In the Northern Shan States, south of Yunnan, the pre-Cambrian is represented by the Chaung Magyi system of phyllites and quartzites, and here it differs from that of Yunnan in containing no calcareous bands. La Touche thinks, on lithological grounds, that the Chaung Magyi series may be Cambrian, for it shows only slight signs of alteration, but a careful search of many outcrops revealed no traces of fossils, and as the rocks had been deposited, consolidated, thrown into folds and dislocated, and final-\nly subjected to denudation, before the accumulation upon them of strata containing Ordovician fossils, the stratigraphical evidence points to pre-Cambrian age.\n\nThe Bawdwin volcanic rocks, a series of tuffs and ashes interstratified with layers of true rhyolites, occurs in some localities between the Chaung Magyi rocks and the lowest of the fossiliferous series (Ordovician). At Bawdwin the tuffs and ashes have been worked for silver for hundreds of years, and very large quantities of silver-bearing lead ores have been extracted. The mineralisation of the rocks occurred as a result of a great overthrust, in the neighbourhood of which they are intensely crushed and shattered.\n\n**Ordovician.**\n\nFossiliferous beds of this age are known in three localities, in Western Yunnan, at Pu-piao, where they consist of sandy shales or mudstones with bands of impure, hard, nodular limestone, at Shih-tien, earthy limestones and slates, and at La-m\u00f4ng, calcareous slates and mudstones. The fossils show a marked resemblance to those of the Northern Shan States of Burma, as is to be expected from the geographical proximity of the areas. In the Northern Shan States the lowest beds of the Ordovician (lower Naung-kangvis), on the west side of the Plateau, consist largely of limestones, while to the east of the river Nam-Tu they are represented by a soft sandy marl. The next highest beds (the upper Naung-kangvis) are represented, in the west, by intensely crushed shales in which all traces of the original bedding planes have been lost, and east of the Gokteik gorge, (river Nam-Tu), by bright purple clay stones. These strata, after the Plateau Limestone to be described later, are the most important formation occurring in the Shan States.\n\nThe Ordovician faunas of Eastern Yunnan and Tongking are of a different type from those of Western Yunnan and the Shan States.\n\n**Silurian.**\n\nIn Western Yunnan fossiliferous slates of Silurian age occur on Shih-tien Hill and a few miles further to the south, and in East Yunnan Silurian shales pass conformably into the lower Devonian. In some parts of Tongking, the Silurian and Devonian are more or less non-fossiliferous owing to metamorphism.\n\nIn the Northern Shan States there are thin bands of graptolitic shales containing the only fossils of undoubtedly Llandovery age that have yet been found in the East. They are overlain by sandstones and conglomerates, followed conformably by sandy marls with layers of a very hard and compact limestone. The fauna is similar to that of a corresponding age in Northern and Western Europe, and absolutely distinct from the Himalayan fauna of the same period, as has been the case for all the underlying formations. With the close of the Silurian epoch, the barrier which separated\nthe Burmese and Himalayan life-provinces in Ordovician times was removed, changes in the distribution of land and sea brought a true middle Devonian fauna into Burma, and later a widespread transgression of the Permo-Carboniferous ocean took place over those tracts of Asia lying to the north of Gondwanaland. These changes are heralded by a series of limestones and shales, perhaps passing conformably upwards into the Plateau Limestone of Devonian age, and containing upper Silurian fossils characteristic of the Bohemian or Hercynian type, whereas, as described above, the rock formations before this contained fossils allied to Northern and Western European types.\n\n**Devonian.**\n\nThe shallow-water beds of the upper Silurian period near the northern coast of Gondwanaland, now known in the Northern Shan States, and the deeper-water graptolitic shales of Yunnan further from the shore, were succeeded by a uniform thick deposit of dolomitic limestone, which forms a great area of plateau land, extending from Yunnan into the Southern Shan States, and probably continuous with the limestones in which the guano caves of Moulmein are situated. It extends an unknown distance in an easterly direction, covering a wide area in China. On the west, in the Northern Shan States, it extends to the edge of the Irrawaddy alluvium, but to the north and south of this it is separated from the alluvium by a strip of Archaean rocks. In several places its thickness can be shown to be over 5000 ft. It is remarkably homogeneous, and it is sandy to the touch and granular, although it is very pure, and not at all siliceous in reality. It has a brecciated and intensely crushed appearance, perhaps due to the great earth-movements at the close of the Mesozoic, and perhaps to sinking of the rock into solution-cavities. It is non-fossiliferous, except at one place in the Northern Shan States, called Padaukpin, not more than one hundred square yards in area, where a rich middle Devonian fauna was found, with predominating Western European types, and at one or two places in the south and north of Yunnan, where there is a close resemblance to the Padaukpin type. It is unexpected to find this type of fauna, because, as mentioned above, the life in the north of our area changed in upper Silurian times from the Western European type to that of America and Bohemia. However, the fossils cannot be regarded as necessarily typical of the Plateau limestones, on account of their extremely local occurrence.\n\nIn Yunnan and China the Devonian limestones are more bituminous and shaley than in the Shan States and Malay Peninsula. In East Yunnan pure limestones are the exception, and in Indo-China the pre-Carboniferous beds are all sandy, suggesting that the sea of that period was more shallow and less open towards the north and northeast, and the fact that the Carboniferous lime-\nstone of Yunnan, Indo China, and China resembles the limestone of the Shan States suggests that, with the close of the Devonian period, the submergence advanced northwards.\n\n**Carboniferous and Permian.**\n\nIn Indo-China and Cochin-China there was an unconformity between the shallow-water Devonian rocks and the succeeding Carboniferous limestones. The lower horizons of the middle Carboniferous limestones of Eastern Yunnan are sandy, and of a shallow-water type, which passes upwards into a sandy coal-bearing series with subordinate limestones, and then, in the western part of East Yunnan, into deep-water limestones. In the eastern area earthmovements took place, resulting in folds running in a northeast-southwest direction, and the denudation of these folds resulted in sandy sediments during the middle Carboniferous period, while the limestones interbedded with basic lavas were laid down during local periods of stability.\n\nThen slow submergence took place, and enormous thicknesses (about 5000 ft.) of massive limestones now cover the area. In the eastern area there is a distinct break in the stratigraphical sequence, between the lower part of the middle Carboniferous and the upper Carboniferous limestones, owing to the folding movements just described, but the conditions during the greater part of the upper Carboniferous period were uniform deep water, resulting in an uninterrupted series of limestones, which are responsible for the unusual scenery of Eastern Yunnan at the present day. In the case of the folded series of middle Carboniferous sands and interbedded limestones the sandy beds have been denuded away easily, leaving the limestone standing out as prominent scarps, but the upper Carboniferous series of limestones, without sandy bands, has given rise to the Karst type of scenery, so called from the Karst district in Austria, dry, and almost waterless, with pot-holes and underground streams.\n\nThese Carboniferous limestones are of a very widespread nature, occurring in practically the whole of Indo-China, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and in the islands of Rotti and Timor in the Archipelago, where they pass conformably up into the Permian. Permo-Carboniferous limestones are not very strongly developed in the Northern Shan States, for they have been greatly denuded there, and merely form a band lying on the Plateau Limestone. They differ from the latter in not being so intensely crushed.\n\nIn the Malay Peninsula they form very prominent groups of hills, with vertical cliffs up to 2000 ft., separated by intervening expanses of flat land with an irregular surface of pinnacles and solution-hollows, covered and smoothed over with alluvium. The type of scenery here displayed is quite different from the karstic type of Yunnan and the Shan States, although the limestone in the Peninsula too is very uniformly free from sandy bands. The difference is due to the fact that, in the Peninsula, the limestone\nhas been converted into coarsely crystalline marble, by pressure and heat consequent on the intrusion of the Main Range granite in Mesozoic times, and, except for occasional fissures, the limestone mass is impervious to water. Caves, characteristic also of the Permo-Carboniferous limestone (and not of the Plateau Limestone) of Yunnan and the Shan States, are common in the Peninsula, and here they frequently contain phosphate deposits derived either from bats' guano, or from a concentration of the phosphatic minerals originally contained in the limestone now dissolved to form the caves. Guano deposits are known also in the limestone caves of Moulmein in Lower Burma. The wide depressions in the plateau country of the Shan States, due to subsidence after solution of the underlying limestone, and to the crushed limestone being unable to sustain its own weight, are not met with in the Malay Peninsula, but there was one well-known case of a village sinking several feet owing to the water being pumped from an underground cave.\n\nThe series has been subjected to intense folding, although this is not evident from an examination of the numerous cliff-exposures, except in certain occasional instances, for, in nearly all cases, the structure has been completely obliterated by the deposition of surface stalactitic deposits. One exception is Gunong Ginting, near Ipoh, where several distinct overfolds are seen, only a few hundred yards apart, with the axes of folding dipping in quite different directions, and numerous readings taken in limestone pinnacles, where the cover of alluvium has been removed in mining operations, also give very different dips. These folds were accompanied by faults, as would be expected in such a massive rock, and, in addition, a series of vertical faults was formed when the Main Range granite was intruded, independent of the folding, but due to the unequal subsidence or raising of different blocks of limestone and overlying Triassic and Jurassic rocks in the molten magma. Some of these vertical faults must have been of great magnitude, for schists, almost certainly of Triassic or Jurassic age, are found faulted down against the foot of a cliff, hundreds of feet high, of Permo-Carboniferous limestone.\n\nThe above description applies particularly to the limestone of the western States of the Malay Peninsula; the calcareous series of Raub rocks east of the Main Range is similar, except that here a shaley facies is strongly developed. It is probable that the absence of shales in the west is due in part to the intense metamorphism which the series has undergone, and that certain black streaks and bands which penetrate the limestone represent their remains. There is no evidence to show that the limestone hills in the east have been formed by faulting.\n\nThe fossils of the Shan States are similar types to those of the Salt Range of India, and they resemble a few fossils from the islands of Rotti and Timor in the Malay Archipelago. The fossils of the Malay Peninsula are found only in a few localities, as, in\nmost places, all traces of organism have been destroyed by the recrystallisation of the limestone, and specimens of homotaxial value have been found only in Pahang, east of the Main Range, and in Patalung, Siam. The Pahang fossils yield types ranging from lower Carboniferous to Permian, whereas the Siamese fossils have been described by one author as lower Carboniferous and by another as Permo-Carboniferous. South of a line drawn east and west through Kajang in South Selangor, the limestones and shales seem to pass into an unfossiliferous shaley series, devoid of sandy beds, and non-calcareous, except for calcareous shales and shaley limestones occurring in the Muar Valley.\n\nIn Sumatra Carboniferous limestones occur, forming mountains nearly 2000 feet high, crystalline and containing black nodular chert. There are also other Palaeozoic limestones with very scanty fossils whose age has not yet been determined. Probably they too are Carboniferous to Permian.\n\nIn the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago the Carboniferous and Permo-Carboniferous limestones just described are the oldest rocks known, with the following exceptions, (i) a granite in Amboyna is said to be Palaeozoic, and the granite fragments in volcanic ash near Singapore may be of the same age, (ii) a series of shales and fine-grained quartzites underlying limestone in the Langkawi Islands, perhaps corresponding with the Mergui series of shales and arenaceous rocks in Burma, underlying the Moulmein Limestone. The Oudeschiefer formation of the Archipelago is believed to be of Permian to Jurassic age, in spite of the fact that many geologists in the past have considered it to be Palaeozoic or even pre-Cambrian.\n\nFolding movements, which took place towards the close of the period of formation of this very widespread series of limestones, were heralded and accompanied by a big show of volcanic activity, not, however, displayed in all parts of the area. It is evident in Western Yunnan, where the greater part of the Permo-Carboniferous series is often made up of tuff and ash beds, intercalated with thick andesitic, doleritic, and basaltic lava flows; in Eastern Yunnan, where basic lavas are found interbedded with the upper part of the middle Carboniferous limestone; in the Malay Peninsula, particularly in Pahang, east of the Main Range, where it is represented by acid, intermediate, and occasionally basic, lavas, dykes, and tuffs; near Singapore; in South Sumatra, where a series similar to that in the Malay Peninsula occurs; and in Borneo.\n\nIn Pahang, volcanic activity began probably in the Carboniferous period and continued intermittently through the greater part of the Triassic, although, as land conditions followed the deposition of the limestone, a good deal of the series has been denuded away. Evidence of the persistence of volcanic activity, during the shallow-water and land conditions, is furnished by a remarkable deposit of boulders of volcanic rocks, dyke rocks lavas and tuffs, embedded\nin volcanic tuff. It is supposed to be a beach deposit formed of boulders of volcanic rocks which were exposed along the shore line, and cemented by volcanic ashes which were all the time being ejected by neighbouring volcanoes. Tuffs and lavas are interbedded with the succeeding shallow-water series of quartzites, shales, and schists, of Triassic age, both in Pahang, and, on the western flanks of the Main Range, in South Selangor.\n\nIn Central Borneo volcanic rocks of an andesitic type are interbedded with rocks which are probably of Jurassic age, and certain amphibolites there are variously held to be pre-Cambrian crystalline slates, or eruptive rocks, belonging to this Jurassic period, which have been uralitised and altered by mountain-pressure.\n\nPermo-Carboniferous and Mesozoic volcanic rocks, including serpentine and andesite, with corresponding tuffs and breccias, and occasionally dolerites, are very widespread throughout the smaller islands of the Archipelago, though only in a few of the places, such as at Letti, where volcanic breccias are overlain by fossiliferous Permian limestone, is it possible to be sure whether they are pre-Permian or Mesozoic. In Java there are volcanic rocks known to be pre-Eocene, but nothing more definite can be stated as to their age.\n\n**Triassic and Rhaetic.**\n\nTowards the middle of the Permian period the emergence of the land from the sea began in Eastern Yunnan, and the Permo-Carboniferous limestone masses were attacked by denudation, so much so, that, in some places, they were completely removed. The shore line retreated back far to the south and west. The thick Red Beds of upper Permian and perhaps lower Triassic age, were then deposited in Yunnan, the lower part of the series in East Yunnan consisting of conglomerates, and passing up into sandstones and shales, often containing salt and gypsum. Widespread basaltic and andesitic eruptions occurred at the close of the Permian. Triassic beds are preserved in East Yunnan only where they were faulted down, and so preserved from the severe erosion to which the country was subjected at the close of the Pliocene period. The beds are alternations of marine and land deposits, passing into deep-sea deposits at the top. After the deposition of the Red beds, no more marine sediments were formed, and Yunnan has been a land surface from the upper Triassic period to the present day.\n\nThe Shan States were dry land during the greater part of the Permian and the whole of the Triassic period, and no deposition took place, except for beach deposits derived from the denudation of the Plateau limestone and the underlying rocks. In the Malay Peninsula there was probably a land-period after the formation of the Permo-Carboniferous limestone, followed by shallow-water conditions, during which the sea was dotted with lagoons, probably formed by coral-reefs, enclosing clear water suitable for the growth\nof radiolaria, the silica necessary for their growth being supplied by submarine volcanic emanations. Periodical slight changes in the sea level took place, which admitted detrital matter from the neighbouring land. These conditions produced the series of radiolarian cherts, interbedded with quartzites, sandstones, and grits, which cover a large area in Kedah, South Selangor, Negri Sembilan, and Pahang, in the Malay Peninsula, and in the island of Billiton. Radiolarian rocks probably of this period are common also in Borneo, Sumatra, Celebes, Timor, Rotti, and many other islands. In the Malay Peninsula the series, in some places, is built up of deposits of chert perhaps hundreds of feet in thickness, and thicker deposits of sandy beds, while in other places the series consists of alternating bands of chert and grit or quartzite, varying from several feet to only one inch in thickness. All the beds are contorted into sharp folds, and the rocks, particularly the shales and shaley grits, have been metamorphosed by earth-movements. In Perak this series occurs only in the extreme north, where it is a continuation of the extensive development in Kedah. Further south it probably corresponds roughly with a series of shallow-water quartzites and shales, which covers the greater part of the area for thirty miles north of Taiping, and which disappears, west of the Semanggol range, under Recent alluvium. The Triassic fossil *Estheriella* was found in these shales at Semanggol.\n\nCertain boulder clays in the Kinta Valley, which are older than the Mesozoic granite, have been provisionally allotted to the Permo-Triassic period. They are very interesting because they are the source of the greatest part of the tin deposits of the Kinta Valley. For a long time they were spoken of as alluvial deposits, until geological investigation showed that they are undoubtedly older than the granite. It is possible that they have suffered considerable alteration since the granite was intruded, and one geologist holds that they were derived from quartzites and shales which had been mineralised by the Mesozoic granite. He says that the underlying rock, known in many cases to be limestone, has been partially dissolved by underground water, and that the quartzites and shales were let down into the resulting cavity, with a consequent destruction of the bedding. The result is a clay containing a large proportion of quartz sand with varying amounts of tin-ore. That the clays are older than the granite is seen by the following facts.\n\n1. Near the granite the clays are often rich in tourmaline streaks and patches, and in quartz, whereas further from the junction the tourmaline and quartz are less evident.\n\n2. The clays near the granite are often richer in tin than those further away.\n\nThe tourmaline patches and quartz are derived from veins of quartz and tourmaline which traversed the clays before they became jumbled up by the solution of the underlying limestone.\nThe chert series of South Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Pahang is overlain by grits, quartzites, and shales, the lower portion of which includes beds of conglomerate, in which the pebbles consist in the main of quartz, quartzite, radiolarian chert, and rocks of the Pahang Volcanic series. It is probable that this quartzite and shale series is separated by a considerable unconformity from the underlying cherts and quartzites, and that strong folding movements, which affected the latter, had ceased when the shallow-water conditions of the Rhaetic and Jurassic periods had set in.\n\nIn Yunnan and parts of Indo-China there were land conditions from the upper Triassic to the present day, but the Shan sea basin, described below, extended into Yunnan, so some Rhaetic beds were formed resembling the Napeng beds of the Shan States. The Napeng beds are fossiliferous clays, sometimes calcareous, laid down on the irregular surface of the Plateau Limestone. The fossils they contain are sometimes ill-developed, owing to the fact that they lived in cups in the limestone not in free communication with the open sea, while in other places the fossils are well grown. The number of new species shows that great changes in the distribution of sea and land had taken place between the deposition of the Permo-Carboniferous and the Napeng beds, and the basin of the Shan sea was isolated from the main ocean. It extended into Yunnan, as mentioned above, and into the Malay Peninsula, where characteristic Rhaetic fossils have been found in three or four places east of the Main Range, possibly also in Singapore Island, and certainly on the west coast of Sumatra. In French Indo-China the Rhaetic period was represented by shallow-water beds also, including the coal beds of Tien Yen Lang Then.\n\nJurassic.\n\nAs already mentioned, there is an extensive series of shallow-water and estuarine shales and quartzites, of Jurassic age, in the Malay Peninsula. The shales have usually been converted into phyllites by the earth-movements which took place at the time of the intrusion of the Mesozoic granite masses, and they show sharp folds and faults. The shales are locally carbonaceous, and certain intrusions are known, consisting of about forty or fifty per cent carbon and the remainder siliceous material, which probably represent coal seams which were altered by the granite.\n\nIn Burma, the Mergui series of slates, argillites, clay-schists, and silicified tuffs, with subordinate quartzites and conglomerates, have been regarded as corresponding with the shallow-water Jurassic series of quartzites and shales further south in the Peninsula. However, as the Officiating Director of the Geological Survey of India in his General Report for 1920 (page 26), describes the series as underlying the Moulmein Limestone formation, it now appears that the rocks are of Carboniferous or pre-Carboniferous age, and that they correspond with the similar series\nunderlying the Carboniferous or Permo-Carboniferous limestone of the Langkawi Islands.\n\nIn the Dutch East Indies the pre-Cretaceous beds younger than the Permo-Carboniferous limestone are thought to be represented by the \"old schist formation,\" already mentioned in the description of the pre-Cambrian rocks. As stated in that description, many authors have relegated it, largely on the ground of the lack of fossils, to the pre-Cambrian, and others to the Palaeozoic period, but it bears a strong resemblance to the altered shales and quartzites of the Malay Peninsula, and it was probably deposited at the same time. If this is so, the radiolarian chert beds and the Rhaetic of the Archipelago are part of the \"old schist formation,\" or the \"Malayan Series\" as it was called by Volz.\n\nIn Sarawak a limestone containing middle Oolite fossils is known.\n\nIn the Northern Shan States of Burma, the Napeng beds of Rhaetic age pass conformably into the succeeding Namyau series, which consists of basal conglomerates, overlain by sandstones, shales, and clays, with very subordinate carbonaceous layers. In the greater part of the north of our area, continental conditions were prevailing (as in the Rhaetic period), and the old land surface to the northeast was gradually rising, with a consequent advance southwards of the shore line, so that the sandy sediment from it was deposited as the Namyau series. This series of beds once covered a wide area, but denudation has entirely removed it from the western portion of the Shan Plateau, and the portions still remaining only owe their preservation to the fact that they were faulted down, and so protected from the severe erosion in post-Jurassic times. The rocks are thrown into regular folds striking from N.N.E. to S.S.W.\n\n**Cretaceous.**\n\nIt was probably during the Cretaceous period that the granite which runs from the Southern Shan States, through Tavoy and Mergui to the Malav States, to Singapore, and the islands of Banka and Billiton, was intruded, bringing with it tin and tungsten minerals. Dutch authors think that the granites and hornblende-granites of the Archipelago were intruded at different periods, and the granite of Amboyna is held to be older than the Permian. It may be of the same age as the granite from which the fragments in the Pahang Volcanic series ash of Singapore were derived.\n\nGranitic rocks in Eastern Yunnan contain cassiterite, and the tin deposits of Ko-chin have been derived from them. Two French geologists agree in assigning to them a Palaeozoic age, and, if they are right, this is very interesting, as showing that the tin deposits of the area which we are considering were not all brought by granite of one period. Many of the coulisses, mentioned in the earlier part of this account, came into being as a result of the intrusion of the Mesozoic granite.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nIn Sumatra the granite is mostly syenitic, and whether it was intruded in Palaeozoic or Mesozoic times is not yet known. In the Malay Peninsula there are two distinct facies, a tin-bearing granite, and a hornblende-granite with associated syenite, the latter being found in the Benom Range. This hornblende-granite agrees with the hornblende-granites found in Sumatra, and elsewhere in the Archipelago, and there is no evidence of it being younger or older than the tin-bearing granite.\n\nSedimentary strata of Cretaceous age are known in Borneo, Java, Sumatra, and smaller islands of the Dutch East Indies, but all of the northern part of the area was a land surface subject to erosion, and no deposition was taking place there.\n\nIn Borneo certain strongly folded shallow-water sandstones and marls contain foraminifera, of which one species *Orbitolina*, makes it certain that the deposits are Cretaceous (Cenomanian). In Java there is a series of serpentinous, mica-, chloritic, and clay-schists containing limestone bands, which, in one place, contained *Orbitolina*, the fossil characteristic of the Cretaceous beds in Borneo. These limestones are nearly always granular and crystalline, without fossils. The schists are traversed by thin quartz-veins, and they are penetrated also by dykes of quartz-porphyry, gabbro and dolerite.\n\nCretaceous rocks are found in the Arakan Yoma of Burma, and along the same line of strike, to the south, in the Andaman Islands. Marine limetones occur at the base, while the upper part of the series consists of shallow-water and estuarine deposits. Besides the granite intrusion, masses of serpentines of Cretaceous age are known, and these are penetrated by veins of the semi-precious mineral jadeite.\n\n**Tertiary.**\n\nIn our area, as in Europe, there is a blank between the upper Cretaceous and the overlying Eocene deposits, which is marked by an abrupt change in the nature of the fauna, rather than by a sharply marked stratigraphical break. The igneous activity in Cretaceous times was the forerunner of earth-movements which continued during Tertiary times, affecting both the lower and upper Tertiary, although they were much stronger in the north, and in the Andaman Islands, than in the Malay Peninsula and in the East Indies.\n\nIn the Northern Shan States there is no trace of the marine Tertiary rocks which are so well developed in the plains of Lower and Upper Burma, so it is clear that, when the Tertiary sea extended over what is now the valley of the Irrawaddy, the Shan Plateau had already been raised above its waters.\n\n**Tertiary of Burma.**\n\nIn Burma the Tertiary beds are represented by the following series:\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nUpper Tertiary   Irrawaddy system of fresh-water beds.\nMiddle Tertiary (lower Miocene and Oligocene) Pegu system of marine beds.\n\n* * * * Unconformity * * * *\n\nLower Tertiary (Eocene) consisting of nummulitic limestones underlain by a shaley series containing interbedded seams of coal.\n\n* * * * Unconformity * * * *\n\nCretaceous beds passing down into the Triassic.\n\nThe Tertiary coals of Burma are nearly all confined to the lower Tertiary or Eocene, being almost invariably associated with characteristic beds of nummulitic limestone. The series is about 1200 feet in thickness. Usually the coals are bright and non-laminated and they contain a large proportion of volatile matter. They are extremely friable and quickly break up under exposure. They do not cake, and they contain only a small proportion of ash.\n\nIn Tennasserim there are several localities where the coal has been reported on, and, in some cases, the seams have been shown to be of no practical value, because the seams are too small, or because of the poor quality of the coal. In Henzada district an attempt was made to exploit the coal, but the rocks are highly disturbed, (the general dip is about 60\u00b0), and transport and labour difficulties prevented operations. At Thayetmyo a mine was opened many years ago, in spite of the fact that the beds were nearly vertical, so making mining very difficult, but the two original seams gradually merged into one, and then died out, after only a little coal had been taken out, so operations were abandoned.\n\nIn Arakan district similar coal seams are found, which, on account of their highly disturbed nature, are not likely to provide large supplies, even for local use. In Shwebo district a company opened up extensive mines at Letkobin which worked for thirteen years with an annual output of 10,000 to 15,000 tons until the year 1904, when the workable coal became exhausted.\n\nNear the Upper Chindwin River, coal seams are quite strongly developed, and, in the Nantahin-Peluswa area, of twenty five square miles, it is calculated that there are 210 million tons of workable coal. Near Pinlebu, a village twenty five miles north-west of Wuntho, there are promising coal seams of Miocene age, dipping at a low angle.\n\nThe Pegu system attains a thickness of 12,000 feet. It is important as containing the petrolierous beds which yield all the petroleum of Burma. It is marine throughout.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nKama clays { Fossiliferous blue clays and sandy beds. The main oil-bearing formation of Burma.\n\nPegu system\n\nUpper Prome series { Fossiliferous sandstones, clays, and shales.\n\nLower Prome series\n\nSitsayan shales { Unfossiliferous shales, resting unconformably on Eocene nummulitic limestone.\n\nThe outcrop of Kama clays extends along the Irrawaddy Basin, and on it are situated the oil fields of Yenangyaung, Singu, Yenangyat, Minbu, and various smaller fields. The Petroleum, being lighter than water, has been imprisoned along the axes of the anticlines, wherever a layer of impermeable rock has formed a roof to prevent it from escaping, and bores are put down along the crests of the folds to tap it. Gases have also collected, and the mud volcanoes of the Arakan coast and at Minbu owe their origin to the escape of such gases along fissures.\n\nThe Kama clays are overlain by the Irrawaddy system of fluviatile deposits, attaining a thickness of 20,000 feet, which were once known as the \"fossil-wood group\" owing to the abundance of drift-wood contained in them. Emergence of the land took place in the north of our area sooner than in the south, and the retreat of the shore line from north to south began at the end of the Pegu period. In the north the Irrawaddy rocks are all freshwater beds, whereas in the south, as in western Prome, the lower part of the Irrawaddy system includes some marine beds. Detailed work by oil geologists shows that in some districts there is considerable unconformity between the two series.\n\nIn the plain of Irrawaddy beds, east of the Irrawaddy River and in the southwest of Yunnan, strong volcanic activity took place, building up the great volcanoes of Popa and Hawshuenshan. As already mentioned, these eruptions are many miles to the west of the boundary-fault between the Tertiary rocks of the Irrawaddy Plain and the older rocks of the Shan Plateau. Popa is fifty miles northeast of the Yenangyaung oil field.\n\nThe basalt dyke at Loi Ling, in the Northern Shan States, is a Tertiary volcano, but here there was a much smaller display than in the Irrawaddy Plain and in Southwest Yunnan.\n\nThe fresh-water Tertiary beds of the Northern Shan States are silts and soft sandy rocks with seams of brown lignitic coal, filling lake basins. These basins in the older rocks are the result of faults which occurred towards the close of the Tertiary period, and the lacustrine beds in them are either of late Tertiary or Pleistocene age. They have been found in six places, the most\nimportant being at Namma, where the area is fifteen miles long and three and a half miles wide. The coal seams are confined to the lower portion of the series. The dip averages $20^\\circ$, but it varies considerably locally, perhaps due to underground solution of the limestone floor. The inferiority of the coal, and the distance of the field from the railway, make it doubtful if it is worth while to start mining operations.\n\nSimilar lacustrine deposits occur in different parts of Indo-China.\n\n**Tertiary of Malay Peninsula.**\n\nIn the Malay Peninsula Tertiary beds with interbedded coal seams are known in three localities, at Rantau Panjang (in Selangor), at Enggor (in Perak), and in Perlis.\n\nAt Rantau Panjang, the coal seams are being profitably worked, the fuel finding a ready sale, for use in the tin mines and railways of the Peninsula. The thickness of the beds is not known with certainty. It appears that coal seams, interbedded with sands and shales, form the lower portion of the series, and that they are overlain by several hundred feet of shales which contain a little oil, not enough to pay for distillation. According to the usual procedure, this coal should be classed as a lignite. Its percentage of fixed carbon is less, and its percentage of moisture is higher, than that of some cheap Indian coals, and these are unfavourable properties, but its low percentage of ash, and the fact that it does not clinker, are properties in its favour.\n\nThe percentage of moisture in the Rantau Panjang coal (about 20%) indicates an upper Miocene age. The dips in these Miocene beds range from $10^\\circ$ to $12^\\circ$.\n\nWhen this occurrence was the only Tertiary deposit that had been prospected in the Peninsula, it was thought to be a lake or swamp deposit, similar to those in the Northern Shan States, although it was then also held to be probable that its present small area, (which amounts to only a few square miles), does not represent the whole of the original area of deposition, but that much of it has been removed by denudation. However, the discovery of over 90 feet of calcareous shale, at Enggor, lying under Tertiary sands, shales, (some of which are themselves calcareous), and interbedded coal seams, suggests that the Enggor deposits, at any rate, are probably not lacustrine deposits, but marine, and that the deposits might have been comparable in extent with those of Sumatra and Burma if the Peninsula had not been subjected to severe erosion in post-Miocene times.\n\nIn Perlis the area and thickness of the coal bearing beds is unproved. A bore was made to a depth of 205 feet and was then stopped in June 1921, owing to lack of casing. Sands, clays and\nsandy clays were first encountered, followed by running sands with traces of coal from 125 feet to 205 feet below the surface. The coal at Enggor and at Perlis is similar in composition to that at Rantau Panjang, and is probably of the same age.\n\nThere are still considerable areas in the Peninsula, east of the Main Range, as yet unexplored, and it is possible that in these areas there may be extensive tracts of country covered with marine and fresh-water beds, equivalent to those of the Irrawaddy plains. Such tracts provide the only possibility of mineral oil being found in payable quantities in the Malay Peninsula. Unfortunately there is no evidence that any such beds exist.\n\nTertiary of Sumatra.\n\nIn Sumatra there is a considerable area of Tertiary beds, both near the coast and in subsided areas inland. Near the east coast they are concealed by Pleistocene deposits. There is very little fossil evidence to go by, but the percentage of water in the interbedded brown coals gives information as to the age of the beds. The Ombilin coal field near Padang, which has been worked by the Government for many years, is of Eocene age, judging by the low percentage of moisture, and more Eocene coals occur at Gunong Tusam in North Sumatra. The younger Tertiaries in North Sumatra usually contain no coal at all, but the commonest coal occurrences in the south are in the upper Miocene beds (younger Tertiary), as at Palembang. In the Boeit Asam Field, where the estimated amount of workable coal is forty million tons, the seams are 6 to 7, 3 to 6, and 5 to 6 metres thick. This upper Miocene series with coal seams is recognised also in Djambi though the seams are diminishing in number and thickness, so it appears that the Djambi Province forms a transition from Palembang to Deli and Atjeh in the north.\n\nNo unconformity has been found in the coastal regions affecting the later Tertiaries, except that between Tertiary and very young Pleistocene strata. In the Andaman Islands, on the other hand, the Eocene is highly folded, and the Miocene, unconformable on the Eocene, is only slightly folded, showing that the main younger folding was pre-Miocene. A similar unconformity exists between the Eocene and Miocene inland in Sumatra. No information about this system of folding can be obtained from the small exposures of Tertiary (Miocene) rocks in the Malay Peninsula, except that the small dips indicate that no intense folding has occurred after Miocene times. In the Mesozoic granite there are sheared areas which are probably the result of Tertiary movements.\n\nIn the Tertiary-Quaternary period in Sumatra, there was considerable volcanic activity, generally of an andesitic type, accompanied by subordinate intrusions of quartz-porphyry, porphyrite, gabbro, picrite, basalt and diorite. The upper Miocene lignite beds of Palembang have been subjected to the heat developed by the intrusion of such rocks, and their economic value has thereby been increased.\nTertiary of Java.\n\nThe greater part of Java is covered with Tertiary, Quaternary, and Recent deposits, and all the divisions of the Tertiary seem to be represented in some part, or other, of the island. The Eocene beds include compact clays, marls, and the widespread nummulitic limestones common to this period all over the world. In west Java, at Bantam, dolerites and diorites are intercalated with them and at Nanggoulan, besides basalts and olivine dolerites, lignite beds are found interbedded with the sediments.\n\nThe lower Miocene are often very much folded, and may be even vertical. Some of the beds were laid down under water, and the andesitic lava flows of this period were sometimes laid down under the sea, and sometimes on dry land.\n\nThe middle Miocene beds are less strongly developed than the lower, and they are typically marly rocks. Pyroxene-andesites are interbedded with the series in Bantam and in Preanger, but not in east or central Java. The upper Miocene beds are essentially calcareous, sometimes consisting of hard, crystalline limestone, and sometimes being soft and marly. They are markedly dolomitic. No volcanic rocks are found in this part of the Miocene series. The middle and upper Miocene beds are often folded, but usually less strongly so than the lower Miocene.\n\nThere have been reports of rich gold deposits being present in Java, but there is no foundation for them. A little gold is present in the pyrites of certain Miocene clays which have been altered by andesitic flows in the Residency of Krawang, but the commercial value of the deposit is negligible.\n\nEocene deposits in Bantam contain a good coal, but they are so folded, and the position of the one metre seam is made so irregular by these foldings, that it would not pay to work. There are about two million tons of fuel available here. Lignites of upper Tertiary age are known in Nanggoulan and in Bantam. Oil is obtained from Miocene beds in many localities, perhaps formed from the foraminiferal remains which they contain.\n\nTertiary of Borneo.\n\nIn Borneo, in the west, no Tertiary strata are found, this period being represented only by andesitic lava flows, whereas, in the southern, northern, and central parts of the island, Tertiary deposits are well developed. In Central Borneo boulders of Eocene age containing nummulites are contained in valley gravels, but these nummulitic Eocene beds are not met with in situ. A sandstone formation of estuarine origin, with interbedded coal seams in Central Borneo, is placed in the older Tertiary series. Generally the strata are horizontal, or only slightly tilted, but locally they are tilted and strongly disturbed and sometimes even vertical. Two seams of coal, two metres thick are being worked in Eocene beds on the island of Poeloe La\u00f6et, off the southeast coast of Borneo. The field is estimated to contain eighty million tons of workable coal.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nRecent Deposits.\n\nThey include many deposits of great economic value, such as the ruby gravels of the Mogok Valley, and the alluvial tin-deposits of Burma, the Malay Peninsula, and the islands of Banka and Billiton. Where they are devoid of minerals they usually provide very good agricultural land, and the clay beds which they contain are used for brick-making. In Borneo the old gravelly river-deposits generally contain gold, especially in west Borneo, but although they are worked by the Chinese in certain rich spots, it has not yet been proved that they are worth working on a large scale. In the Malay Peninsula it is fairly certain that the amount of gold in similar deposits does not pay to work by European methods.\n\nIn the Malay Peninsula and in Sumatra there is evidence that the sea had a level, in recent times, higher than it has at present. In Sumatra it is indicated by raised sea-beaches, some more than 300 feet above sea-level, and also by high gravel terraces in river-basins close to the present sea shore. On the Peninsula, in Perlis, marine shells were found in a cave nearly 300 feet above sea-level, but they may have been carried there by human agency. However, biological and geological evidence combined indicate that the Peninsula was in Recent times connected to the Archipelago, so that Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the Peninsula were united to form a continent. The sea level then rose until the Peninsula was a group of islands, and subsequent recession of the sea took place later which is believed to be still in progress at the present day. Molengraaf does not agree that Borneo has been affected by this cycle.\n\nUnder the heading of Recent deposits should be classed the deposits now being laid down by the active volcanoes in Sumatra, Java, and various islands. Barren Island, east of the Andamans, was last observed to be in eruption in 1789, and since then it has been dormant. In Borneo the Muller Mountains are built up of rhyolitic rocks, perhaps of Tertiary or of sub-Recent times, though it is also possible that they may be so old as the Cretaceous period.\n\nIt is interesting to observe that there is a close connection between the position of volcanoes, both active and recently extinct, and the lines of folding.\nThe Early History\n\nOF\n\nSingapore, Johore & Malacca;\n\nAN OUTLINE OF A PAPER BY G. P. ROUFFAER.\n\nBY R. O. WINSTEKT, D. LITT. (OXON.)\n\nIn the *Bijdragen tot de Taal- Land- en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indie* (Deel 77), 1921, G. P. Rouffaer, who first identified tanah Melayu as the basin of the Jambi, has published a startling paper on the geography of the Malaya Peninsula. It is probable that his surmises as to the situation of Langkasuka and several other theories will not be accepted, but his paper should be in the hands of every serious student of Peninsular history.\n\nRouffaer brushes aside G. Ferrand\u2019s recent theory (*Journal Asiatique*, 1918) that Malacca existed, as the unreliable Gaspar Correa wrote, for 700 years before the coming of the Portuguese, under the name Malayu, Marco Polo\u2019s Malayur. Malayur is only a Tamil form of Malayu, the original home of the Malays in Jambi. Would Fra Odorigo van Pordenone and Ibn Batutah have been silent over the existence of such an early Malacca? Would the *Nagarakretagama* (1365 A.D.), recording the conquests of Hayam Wuruk, the famous ruler of Majapahit, have then referred to the Peninsula simply as Pahang?\n\nOn the other hand it is hardly likely that in 1403 Malacca \u201cbelonged to Siam,\u201d as the Ming annals say; from 1405-1413 was a Hindu state under Permaisura and becoming Muslim under Gujerati influence in 1414 suddenly won trade and empire. The *Pararaton* mentions two Malay princesses captured at the fall of Jambi and one Tuhan Wuruju (= Bongsu), a dewa-putera (i.e. son of a Ksatriya dewa) of Pamelekahan or \u201cMalacca lands,\u201d a captive in Majapahit in 1328 A.D. Again Gerini tells how Siamese laws enacted in 1360 A.D. cite as tributary to Siam \u201cUjong Tanah, Malaka, Malayu, Worawari\u201d (*Researches*, 1909, pp. 531-2). Probably Barros (1553 A.D.) and the *Sejarah Melayu* are right in saying that Malacca existed as early as the middle of the XIIIth century A.D. and became a commercial centre about 1400 A.D. owing to immigration of Malays from Singapore or Tumasik, the \u201csea-country.\u201d\n\nBarros (1553), the most reliable of Portuguese chroniclers, relates how one Sangesinga (? Sangyang Singha) ruler of Singapore was murdered by his guest Permaisura, who was a fugitive from East Java owing to disturbances on the death of Pararisa (= O. J. Bhra Wicesa, who ascended the throne of Majapahit in\n1389 A.D. and ruled some 40 years). The king of Siam attacked the usurper who fled to Pago on the Muar. His whilom followers, the Cellates (= Orang Laut) opened Bertam near Malacca.\n\nD\u2019Albuquerque (1557) relates how, when Malacca was founded, a Bhatara ruled Tumapel in Java and the Permaisura fled to Singapore, murdered its chief and ruled it for five years, until the ruler of Patani, brother of the murdered chief, drove him to Muar, whence he went to Bintao (Bertam) and founded Malacca. The reference to Tumapel is valuable.\n\nThe Sejarah Melayu (Chapters 5 and 10) give the Malay tradition of Singapore\u2019s relationship with Java. The end of chapter 10 refers to its destruction by Hayam Wuruk after 1338 A.D. when according to the Pararaton Gajadmada took his famous oath not to eat palupa until 10 countries including Palembang Pahang and Tumasik had been subjected to Majapahit and before 1365 A.D. when the Nagarakretagama tells how all the islands and states in the east and west of the Malay Archipelago had been subdued. The lettering on the fragment of the Singapore monolith, now in Raffles\u2019 Museum, is said by Dr. Krom to resemble Majapahit characters and to antedate somewhat 1360 A.D. Dr. Krom is studying a cast of the fragment.\n\nHow old is Singapore? I\u2019Tsing mentions in 690 A.D. a state \u201cMo-ho-hsin\u201d at the south of the Peninsula = Mahasin \u201cthe great Salt state,\u201d which Rouffaer identifies with a Malay land \u201cHasin\u201d recorded in a Majapahit inscription of 1034 A.D. to have been conquered by Erlangga, a prince in East Java (born 991 A.D.\u2014reigned 1019-1042 A.D.). Probably it is Ibn Khordadybeh\u2019s \u201cSchalahit\u201d (Selat). According to Rouffaer it was Tasik = Temasik (of the 14th century) = old Samudra = Singapura (of the 15th cent.), while on the mainland was Wura-wari (old Jav. = \u201cclear water\u201d) from the 10th to 11th centuries = Ganggayu i.e. Gangga ayu (O. J. = \u201cfresh water\u201d) before 1450 but still known at the time of the Sejarah Melayu (1612 A.D.) = Johor of the XVIth century. An inscription of 1006 A.D. in Sanskrit and old Javanese, in the Calcutta Museum, tells how Wurawari had brought disaster to Java, and the Siamese laws of 1360 A.D. count it among places subject to Siam. In the Tanjore inscription of Rajendracola I (1030 A.D.), Kadaram = Kedah, Srivijayam = Palembang, Malayur = Jambi, and Rouffaer suggests Mayirudingam = Great Yirudingam = Chao Ju Kua\u2019s Great Ji-lo-t\u2019ing = Mahasin = Singapore; Ilangacogam = Langkasuka = Ganggayu = Wurawari; Ma-Ppappalam = ? Pahang or Penang, and Mevilimbangam \u201cthe walled\u201d may be the Dindings or Klang. Langkasuka = Chao Ju Kua\u2019s Ling-ya-ssi-kia (1225 A.D.) = the Negara-kretagama\u2019s Langkasuka (1365) = I-Tsing\u2019s Lang-ka-su (692) = Langgasu or Langga of the Chinese annals of the Liang dynasty (502-556) = ? the Lanka of the Ramayana. The Calcutta inscription speaks of Luaram (= lwah O. J. \u201criver, water\u201d and ram Skt. = rama \u201csweet, charming\u201d) as its capital.\nAn inscription of 924 A.D. of prince Sri Wijayaloka of East Java speaks of Ujong Galoh = Ujong Putri = Jong Galoh or the Hujung Galoh of Erlangga\u2019s inscription. *Galoh* \u2018jewel\u2019 = *jauhar* (Arabic) = Johore, and the name fits the honorific Ratna-parayana of the old Javanese *Ramayana* and the \u201cGolden Chersonese\u201d of Ptolemy, whose Sabana will correspond with the XVIth century Straits of Sabang and be the Karimuns, Hasin or Galoh. Was it from the Biduanda Kallang of Kallang river that the mysterious Kalangs, prisoners of war mentioned in old Javanese romance, came? Among the Solo regalia (*upachara*) are a Snake (*Arda-walike*) and a Roc (*Garuda*); among the Jokja regalia only the Snake. These must be symbols of the victory of Erlangga\u2019s as Vishnu\u2019s Garuda over the \u2018Snake\u2019 princes of Wurawari, Hasin, Langka, just as of the other regalia an Elephant symbolizes Patih Gajahmada, a Cock Hayam Wuruk and a Buffalo-Calf Java\u2019s victory over Menangke(r)bau and so on. To this day a Garuda is the symbol of Hindu Bali (first conquered by Java in Erlangga\u2019s time), while the Muslim mosques and art of Java took a Snake as the symbol of Islam\u2019s victory over Hinduism.\n\nApparently about 1135 A.D. Daha brought Galoh nearly to ruin. A Pauji tale (Bij. Kon. Inst. 2, VII, 1863) speaks of a Klana Tunjong-Seta, prince of the island Kenchana, (= \u201cgold\u201d and ? the \u201cGolden Chersonese\u201d), who desiring to win a Daha princess, Dewi Angreni, (or Raden Galoh), attacked Java and failed, slain by Pangeran Klana Jayang Sari, alias Raden Panji Kuda Wanengpati, a prince of Jenggala in the service of the ruler of Kediri. The people of Kenchana and three princes were carried captive to Java. Perhaps the *S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu* (chapters 14 and 19) show that Middle Java and Ujong Tanah once came to grips and that Malacca, or really Galoh, had to do with Daha in the Panji period.\n\nThough the early Portuguese knew nothing of Galoh, Ganggayu or Langka, the *S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu* (chapter 1) connects Ganggayu with Johore and interprets the word to mean \u201ca treasure-house of jewels,\u201d which fits both *galoh* and *jauhar*.\n\nBetween 1275 when Kertanagara of Tumapel sent his ill-fated expedition against Palembang and Marco Polo\u2019s visit in 1292, apparently Kertanagara had destroyed Mahasin i.e. old Singapore (*S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu*, chapter 5). But Marco Polo mentions \u201cPentam\u201d or Bintan, whither perhaps one band of fugitives had fled, and the *S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu* records how the founders of the new town Tumasik came from Bintan. The Javanese name, Tumasik, may have been given by men of Tumapel, who, after Majapahit triumphed over their country in 1293 owing to the absence of Tumapel\u2019s forces in Palembang, stayed in Sumatra and the Malay islands. Probably Kertanagara\u2019s attack on Hasin drove sea Malays (*wong asin*) not only to Bintan but to Muar and \u201cMalacca lands,\u201d opposite which were the \u201cFive Islands\u201d that in early Chinese charts take the place of Malacca. Majapahit\u2019s attack about 1360\nA.D. must have sent yet a further band in the same direction. From 1328 down to the death of Hayam Wuruk, the great Majapahit conqueror, in 1389, the Malacca Straits would be under Javanese influence and only later under the Siamese suzerainty of which Chinese annals and Siamese laws speak.\n\nSuch in briefest outline is Rouffaer's paper, which fills 174 pages and is to be continued further.\n\nThough it has no direct bearing on this paper, it is interesting to note that Raffles' Museum has not only a neolithic celt from Singapore but also several from Kota Tinggi in Johore: all made from local stone.\n\nBurong olok-olok (jester-bird) is the Brown Gannet.\n\nBy A. W. Hamilton.\n\nBurong olok-olok is mentioned in Wilkinson's Dictionary as an unidentified bird; but in reality the bird is not such a jest as its Malayan name would seem to imply, and it has been identified for me kindly by Mr. H. C. Robinson, as the Brown Gannet or *Sula-sula* (Linn.).\n\nThe brown gannet or olok-olok as it is called in Kedah is a dark plumaged sea bird with webbed feet, solitary specimens of which are usually met with at sea off the coast of Kedah in company with a flock of gulls.\nA Malay Pantheist Charm.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt, D. Litt. (Oxon.)\n\nAccording to the Shi'ites Ali, the baginda 'Ali of Malay charms, was the repository of Islamic mystical knowledge. And there is a story how a great prince, who had been defeated by a mightier, asked him: \"Teach me the charms which the Apostle of God taught you.\" It is certain that this was a request which the first Malay converts to Islam were always making to the early Indian missionaries. And the charms the missionaries taught them were held to be esoteric, like the mantra of the Brahmins and the secrets of Sufism. The Shi'ite heresies and the pantheism, orthodox and heterodox, to be detected in many Malay charms await closer study at any rate by English scholars. \"The utterances put into the mouths of the eight or nine principal saints of Java betoken a rash mystic pantheism,\" says Snouck Hurgronje. \"This same heretical mysticism found some opponents and many strong supporters in Acheen in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The book of the \"Perfect Man,\" al-Jili's Insanu'l-Kamil, was much studied in early days in Java and left its mark on the bizarre contents of numerous native tracts. Allah is the one, indivisible Being, exalted above time and space. Multiplicity is appearance. Only God exists.\" A full description of al-Jili's book can be read in Nicholson's \"Studies in Islamic Mysticism\" (Cambridge, 1921) or in Shaikh Muhammad Iqbal's \"The Development of Metaphysics in Persia\" (London, 1908). \"Such mysticism\" continues Snouck Hurgronje, \"is found also in Arabian lands but only in small circles of the initiated, as half secret doctrines of the Sufis, cautiously concealed on account of the hunt of official theologians for heresy and of the suspicious fanaticism of the vulgar. In the East Indies, however, it formed woof and warp not only of learned speculation but of popular belief. Tracts with drawings and tables were used in the endeavour to realize the idea of the Absolute. The four elements, the four winds, the four righteous Khalifs, the four founders of the schools of law, the four sorts of attributes of God in dogma, the four grades of progress in mysticism, the four extremities of the human body and many other sets of four were for popular mysticism revelations of the one indivisible self of man; through the names of Muhammad and Allah, each in Arabic spelt with four letters, were symbolized the One Being. 'Who knows himself, knows his Lord and he who knows his Lord has knowledge of himself,' said these mystics.\" (\"Arabie en Oost-Indie,\" Leiden, 1907). A pawang's charm to call back to memory the medium in Kelantan's main puteri, for example, invokes\n'Balang Abubakar,'balang Umar,\n'Balang Uthman,'balang Ali!\nJaga sa-kali!\nAngin shari'at, roma dengen kulit!\nAngin 'itikad, daging dengen darah!\nAngin tarikat, urat dengen tulang!\nAngin ma'rifat, nyawa dengen b\u0113neh!\nAngin empat di-dalam, empat di-luar,\nEmpat di-kanan, empat di-kiri,\nEmpat di-bawah, empat di-atas,\nJaga keluar.\nDi-pintu sir, pintu 'itikad, pintu chinta, pintu rasa.\n\nDr. Gimlette has collected and is printing the full charm in a new edition of his \"Malay Poisons.\" I quote the extract to illustrate the pawang's use of the mystic four.\n\nSnouck Hurgronje's book on \"The Acehinese,\" D. A. Rinkes' \"Abdoerraoef van Singkel\" (Friesland, 1909), B. J. O. Schrieke's \"Het Boek van Bonang\" and H. Kraemer's \"Een Javaansche pr\u0131mbon uit de zestiende eeuw\" (Leiden, 1921) should all be in the hands of the student of Malayan pantheism.\n\nThe Malay magician has a strange pedigree: first, animist, then Hindu and lastly, as Sufi mystic, the unconscious inheritor of Gnostic and Neo-Platonic doctrines. Brahminical mantra, to which even the Gods are subject, perhaps prepared his mind for the audacities of the Sufi. I will take one instance from Skeat's \"Malay Magic\" (pp. 587-588):\n\n\"Jibrail, Mikail, Israfil, 'Azrail;\nYe are four but with me five!\nI sit on the seat of God!\nI lean against the pillar of God's throne.\"\n\nIs this a misconception or wilful corruption of al-Jili's description of the Perfect Man:\u2014\"he furnishes from himself an antitype to everything in existence\u2014his heart stands over against the Pen, his soul over against the Guarded Tablet, his nature over against the elements. He stands over against the angels with his good thoughts.\" Another of Skeat's pawang (p. 581) speaks of \"a white learned Shaikh who leans against the pillar of the Throne, who knows the Guarded Tablet, who writes down the Creed,\" (and, I suppose, of Muhammad in the phrase \"the Sovereign Jewel who dwells above the Throne, controlling all the children of Adam.\")\n\nIn this paper I translate a charm obtained in an East coast State of the Malay Peninsula: a promise to its possessor forbids me to divulge its home exactly. It was copied by me from a begrimed book probably a century old and transcribed according to the colophon from a still older manuscript:\n\n\"A chapter to explain the charm called the Fortress of the Unity of God, practised by Maklab Setam. Whosoever would practise it should recite the fatihah first and give a present to its owner.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n\"A beginning should be made on Thursday night and the charm should be continued until the night of the following Thursday.\n\n\"It should be recited four times a night with a sincere vowing of the heart to unity with Allah and the vision of Him implanted in one's heart, until His Being permeates one and one has faith: 'I am lost in the universal and absolute Essence of God;' and one is lost to self and one's self becomes absolute and universal too:\n\n\"In the name of God the Merciful the Compassionate. Oh God! grant peace to our lord Muhammad and the household of Muhammad who watcheth over my self and my friends and all my children and all the contents of my house and my property and the possessions of my hands with a sevenfold fortress from the fortress of God Most High; its roof\u2014'There is no God but God,' and my wall 'Muhammad the Apostle of God,' and my key 'the might of God,' which may not be opened for ever save with His permission. Muhammad is like man and unlike man; he is like a chrysolite among stones.\n\n\"Now the import of the term 'fortress' is that we know that we come from not-being and to not-being shall return. For there is nothing evidently save the Being of God. And of a surety the Being of God never parts from His absolute essence, which carries out all His will, according to His word: 'His desire is accomplished by Himself and goes forth to no other than Himself save to not-being.'\n\n\"The intention of the term self is 'spirit,' one of the attributes of the knowledge of God Most High, which parts not from His essence and it becomes an objectified idea and is called man. Now the spirit is distinct and determined. Always the spirit yearns towards God.\n\n\"The intention of 'the house' is the body. The body is the place of the spirit and so the veritable place that reveals the Real God according to the saying of the Prophet, on whom be the peace of God: 'Whosever knows himself, knows his Lord.' The house was built of itself and though it will pass away, yet He whose house it is is the Reality who with His absolute essence is eternal.\n\n\"The intention of our 'property' is the liver and heart and lungs and gall and all that God Most High has created: according to His word:\u2014'There is no strength in any one save the strength of Allah, lord of all the worlds both as regards things revealed and things hidden.'\n\n\"The intention of our 'possessions' is the ten senses, firstly the outward and secondly the inner. The outward are five: the sight of the eyes, the hearing of the ears, the taste of the tongue, the smelling of the nose and the touch of the hand. The inner also are five: consciousness, faith, insight, perception and judgment.\n\n\"The intention of the sevenfold 'fortress' is the creation by God Most High of man with seven attributes: life, knowledge,\npower, will, hearing, sight and speech. And seven parts of the body must be bowed to God in prayer: the forehead, the palms of the hands, the knees and the toes of the feet.\n\n\"The intention of the 'key' is because we have utter trust and union by surrendering ourselves to God Most High, according to His word: 'Hold yourselves fast to the cord of God which breaks not neither is there concealment of His will from mystical knowledge;' as said the Prophet on whom be God's peace:\u2014'Nothing at all moves save by permission of Allah.' For we cannot behold aught if the cord break and it cannot break save by the will of God Most High, and there is no other can break it.\n\n\"And the intention of the 'key' is Muhammad Apostle of God for God is utterly hidden; none other save himself knoweth Him, for He cherisheth His glory. And the Reality of God Most High was revealed to the spirit of Muhammad our Prophet and from that Spirit God Most High created all this universe, and all the attributes of His secret wisdom were revealed: and so it is that Muhammad is called the 'key,' because he opened the treasure-house that was hidden, according to His word:\u2014'I opened that which was closed.'\n\n\"And the intention of the protection of God is according to His word: 'God Most High is with thee wheresoever thou art,' according to His word: 'God is nearer to thee than the muscles of thy neck.'\n\n\"And the intention of 'roof' is the power of God to cover any of His servants with mercy according to His will, so that he be locked away from all enemies and danger in this world and the next, neither shall the lock be opened by genie or man save with the permission of God Most High.\"\n\nWas it some such charm as this that Sultan Ahmad of old Malacca was expecting to learn from the Makhdum, whom he took on his elephant into battle against the Portuguese and who cried clutching the howdah with both hands, \"Sultan! This is no place to study the Unity of God. Let us return.\" (S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu. Chapter 34). In chapter 20 of the S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu we have a reference to a Meccan, Maulana Abu Ishak a mystic (fahan pada ilmu tasawwuf) practising austerities, the author of a work the Dar al-mathlum, who despatched a pupil Abu Bakar to Malacca to teach the doctrine of Essence and Attributes and Works contained in his book. Sultan Mansur Shah got a Pasai pundit to translate it. All the notabilities of Malacca became pupils of the Meccan and even the Kathi sat at his feet after he had seen the newcomer with a halo of light about him. Then Sultan Mansur Shah offered a present of gold and two female slaves to any Pasai theologian who could solve the problems whether those in heaven and those in hell remain in their respective places for ever. A Pasai pundit replied openly that they did, quoting the authority of the Koran. But the Sultan of Pasai summoned him, hinted that an embassy could not\nhave come from Malacca in quest of such an obvious answer and suggested giving in private a deeper esoteric meaning communicable, like all Sufi mysteries, only to the elect. The pundit took the hint and won the prize offered by Malacca. His esoteric solution is not recorded but al-Jili has given apposite Sufi answers:\u2014\"The powers of endurance of the sufferers in hell continues to grow\u2014God never takes back his gifts and these powers come from God\u2014until there appears in them a Divine power which extinguishes the fire, because no one is doomed to misery after the Divine attributes become manifest in him,\" or again \"You may say, if you like, that Hell-fire remains as it was, but that the torment of the damned is changed to pleasure.\" (Nicholson, op. cit., pp. 136-7).\n\nThere is a record of one flagrant example of heterodox pantheism from Perak 30 years ago. Its exponent was sentenced to gaol. The creed he taught found God in man: \"There is no God but God. I am God.\" (La iloha illa'llah! Aku Allah! Allah ia aku! Allahu aku! Allah ta'alai itu tiada m\u00e9lainkan diri ini Allah.) The creed, alms, the pilgrimage, the turban, the sixteen pillars of a mosque, the steps of its pulpit, the holding of a staff by the preacher, the kissing of the Black Stone at Mecca were all ascribed to disgusting sexual analogies. Not 44 but 40 members are required for the congregation of a mosque because man and woman together have 40 fingers and toes. Hell is anger and heaven sexual love. The Angel of Death is a man's eyes; the seven furnaces of Hell his knees; the bridge across the Fire his back-bone. One's right eye is Kiramun and one's left Katibin. And so on, a rigmarole of nonsense and an obscene travesty at an immeasurable distance of the Divine Love celebrated by the mystics of Persia.\n\nThe Malay Charm.\n\n\"Fasal pada menyatakan 'ilmu kota tauhid yang di-amalkan oleh Tuan Maklab Setam (\u0645\u0643\u0645\u0644 \u0633\u062a).

Tamat.\nNotes on the Enemies of Butterflies.\n\nBy C. L. Collenette.\n\nOn 24th January, 1922 while collecting larvae and pupae of the common Skipper (*Hidari irava*) which can be found plentifully in Singapore in rolled up sections of the banana leaf, I noticed that three or four butterflies of the species were flying round the flowers of a neighbouring Papaya tree. After watching them at close quarters for a minute or two, I espied one which appeared to have deformed wings, at rest on a flower. Looking more closely, I found that it was in the clutches of a Praying Mantis, (*Rhombodera basalis*). The Mantis held the butterfly in its fore legs and occasionally brought it up to its mouth to suck the juices, holding it away again while it considered them. After watching this for a few minutes I took the Skipper away, the Mantis holding on until it was nearly pulled from the tree and with no apparent fear of my fingers.\n\nThe Mantis was stationed on a small bunch of the Papaya flower buds, with an open flower half an inch in front of its doubled fore legs. Skippers were flying from flower to flower, and I waited in the hope that one would fly within its reach. A foolish individual finally blundered right on to its back and then settled on the very flower which it guarded. The Mantis flinched a little at the touch, drew its front legs close to its body and then made what I considered a rather clumsy grab at the insect. The Skipper flew away none the worse.\n\nOther Skippers visited flowers three or four inches away, being followed by the Mantis with a turn of the head.\n\nThen, as dusk came on, a Hawk Moth with pink in its wings, probably *Hippotion boerhaviae*, paused in space opposite the special flower, but apparently saw the preliminary inward swing of the Mantis' fore legs, and darted off.\n\nShortly afterwards, the same Hawk Moth, or another of the same species, hovered in front of the flower and put its proboscis down the long tube. The Mantis made the same grab as before, but again missed its quarry. Darkness and mosquitoes prevented further observations.\n\nAnother Mantis had been sitting all this time on the under-side of a leaf, but beyond turning its head when a butterfly passed, with the very smallest chance of being able to make a capture, it did not move.\nDuring the following three weeks I visited the Papaya tree on several occasions and always found the same two Mantids. They were the same shade of light green as their background and it needed the closest scrutiny to detect them. On each visit they were either at rest under leaves or walking about on the leaf stems, although butterflies and other insects were often present on the flowers.\n\nI do not think that these Mantids were capable of reasoning out that insects were to be caught on the flowers. Although they were plainly interested in anything moving within six inches of them, they would remain just out of reach of a promising spot without attempting to go nearer to it.\n\nIn the Botanic Gardens, at midday on 5th February 1923, I was watching four or five \"brown\" butterflies (*Ypthima*) settled on a single head of flowers on a shrub. A patch of yellow and blue higher up the branch caught my eye, and revealed a large \"Chameleon\" (*Calotes cristatellus*). It was some six inches from the butterflies, with its head turned towards them in a position of attention. I went quietly back to a distance and watched for twenty minutes, but the lizard did not stir in the slightest, possibly because I had alarmed it. From a distance at which the butterflies could easily be seen, it was most difficult to pick it out from the surrounding leaves. At subsequent visits I did not see it, although the flower-head continued to attract butterflies for some time.\n\nAnother danger to butterflies is the spider. In the Changi jungle, on 29th January, 1922, I found an *Euthalia merta*, a powerful butterfly with a strong flight, completely helpless but undamaged in a web spun across a path. The spider could not be found.\n\nInstances of butterflies being preyed upon by their enemies are not easy to observe, but the dangers which they are exposed to, such as those indicated in these notes, are very many.\nThe Irregularity of a Spider's Feeding.\n\nBy I. H. Burkill.\n\nOne afternoon in 1908 my attention was drawn to an iridescent green hunting spider upon the wall of my house in Calcutta. There were many mosquitoes about at the time; and I asked myself if this spider fed upon them, and accordingly caught it for the purpose of observation. The source of the mosquitoes was quickly found in the servants' quarters, the brood of larvae appropriated, and by means of a glass funnel over the vessel containing the larvae and pupae, the flies as they emerged were forced to enter a glass fronted box which became a cage for the spider. A small vessel of water was placed in the cage so that the air was constantly moist. The temperature went uncontrolled, and as it was the hot weather ran to maxima above 100\u00b0 F. The cage was not moved from the room where the spider had been caught. The spider was now supplied with fresh mosquitoes daily and the \"kills\" counted over 63 days, i.e. from May 25th. to July 26th. On July 26th. as I was proceeding on tour, the observations were discontinued, and the spider, a female, weighed: she weighed .075 grammes. The spider put into spirit, was posted to a specialist in spiders, for determination, but the parcel miscarried, and the name of the species is not known.\n\nThe spider in the 63 days over which the observations were extended, killed and devoured 355 mosquitoes; but most irregularly. When caught she was hunting; on the next day she laid eggs, and then fasted on and off over a week: for two days after this she fed ravenously, killing 17 on the first of the two and 10 on the second; then followed a fast day, a day when 2 were killed, and another fast day; after this on five days she fed considerably, killing in all 58 mosquitoes; then came a three days complete fast; three days of moderate feeding, a day's fast, and so on. Once in July she fasted completely for seven days. Her maximum was 17; and this she reached on three occasions.\n\nNewly a copy of the Transactions of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters, vol. XIX. has come into my hands, wherein at p. 524 is an account by Miss Catherine Elizabeth Nebel of the feeding of seven individuals of the spider, Aranea sericata, which she watched for periods up to fifteen weeks, feeding them upon the fruit fly.\u2014Drosophila ampelophila. Her spiders fasted and fed as irregularly as mine: but she noted that if the temperature of her laboratory were raised to 100\u00b0 F. the spiders responded by an increased feeding upon the second day.\n\nIt should be noted that these were voluntary fasts, not involuntary which spiders are well known to endure for very long periods.\n\nMy spider was never seen to take any notice of a mosquito which did not move. What an advantage rest by day would seem to confer on the mosquito!\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nNotes on Dipterocarps.\n\nNo 6. On the genus Pachynocarpus.\n\nBy I. H. Burkill and F. W. Foxworthy.\n\nPachynocarpus is a small genus of the natural order Dipterocarpaceae, with its nearest affinity to the somewhat polymorphic genus Vatica. If Vatica be divided into two or more genera, then Pachynocarpus is abundantly distinct; but if, as several botanists think, Vatica in its variety is still rightly considered a single genus, then it is a debateable point whether Pachynocarpus should be kept apart from it. It was defined in 1860 by Sir Joseph Hooker (Trans. Linn. Soc. XXXIII., p. 159) upon material collected by James Motley in Borneo and sent by Mr. E. S. Barber* of the Eastern Archipelago Company to Sir William Hooker at Kew from Labuan. Vatica had been defined long before,\u2014first in 1771 by Linnaeus (Mantissa II, p. 152) upon a specimen from Ceylon (mislabeled China); then it had been recognized as appearing in the Philippine Islands in a second species (Blanco, Fl. Filip., ed. 1, 1837, p. 401) and in the islands of Borneo and Sumatra in two more species (Blume, Mus. Bot., 1852, p. 31). To these have been added other species up to the number of 55,\n\nFigs. 1 and 2, the shells of two fruits of Vatica Wallichii gathered from under the same tree in the Tasek Gelugor Forest Reserve, Province Wellesley, showing extremes in the development of the calyx (shaded): 3, a fruit of Vatica ridleyana in vertical section: 4, shell of the fruit of Pachynocarpus umbonatus in vertical section. All reduced to one-half and in all the calyx shaded. The cotyledons are indicated in 3.\n\n* The Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, kindly informs us that Edmund Scott Barber was Resident Director of the Eastern Archipelago Company at Labuan at the time of the murder of Motley (see Jour. Straits Branch, Roy. Asiatic Soc. No. 79, 1918, p. 37) and purchased at the sale of Motley\u2019s effects, the latter\u2019s herbarium. Under the date Nov. 16th, 1859, he wrote to Sir William Hooker at Kew, telling him this and that he would forward the herbarium; and explained that Motley when alive had intended to do so. He also offered a collection of mosses. In a second letter he stated that Motley\u2019s herbarium consisted of about 400 specimens, and advised the sending to Kew of numerous small packets of mosses and \u201ca remnant of Motley\u2019s herbarium not arranged.\u201d\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nwith a distribution from Ceylon to New Guinea, and northwards as far as the eastern extremity of the Himalaya. More or less in the middle of the area occupied by Vaticas occurs *Pachynocarpus*.\n\nFrom the species of *Vatica* nearest to it, the first described *Pachynocarpus*,\u2014*P. umbonatus*,\u2014differs in the degree of adnation of the calyx, as the diagrams above indicate.\n\nUpon this adnation Hooker defined the genus; and in 1862 in the *Genera Plantarum* (i., p. 192), he remarked succinctly that *Pachynocarpus* differs in no other way from *Vatica*, of which genus but seven species were known to him. Alphonse de Candolle in 1868 (*Prodromus*, XVI, part 2, p. 605) retained *Pachynocarpus*, altering the definition by pointing out that the stamens may be 15 in number, instead of 10, as had been stated. Burck, nineteen years later (*Ann. Jard. Bot. Buitenz.* VI, 1887, p. 233), sunk the genus to the position of a section of *Vatica*, at the same time describing as a new species *Vatica verrucosa*. Heim followed (*Recherches sur les Dipt\u00e9rocarpac\u00e9es*, Paris, 1892, p. 107) with the restoration of *Pachynocarpus*, and with a subdivision of *Vatica*. Sir George King (*Journ. As. Soc. Beng.*, LXII, 1893, p. 136) took Heim's view; and at the same time he transferred *Vatica Wallichii*, Dyer, and *Vatica ruminata*, Burck, to *Pachynocarpus*, in a way which we find wrong, and he added a new species, \u2014*P. Stapfianus*. Sir Dietrich Brandis, the last comprehensive writer upon the order, followed suit (*Journ. Linn. Soc. Bot.* XXXI, 1895, p. 136): he placed the species as King had done, except that he did not reduce *Vatica ruminata*, but called it *Pachynocarpus ruminatus*. He had described a *Vatica Ridleyana* (*Hooker's Icones* t. 2401), which, from its obviously close relationship to *Vatica Wallichii*, Dyer, Ridley in the Singapore herbarium, and as a follower King, transferred to the genus *Pachynocarpus*; and this transference appeared in Mr. James Anderson's \"*Index of Plants, Botanic Gardens, Singapore*\" as *P. Ridleyana*, but wrongly ascribed to Brandis. The result of all these writings is that we have six names under *Pachynocarpus*:\n\n- *P. umbonatus*, Hook. f.;\n- *P. verrucosus*, Heim, transferred from the genus *Vatica*, where it stood as *V. verrucosa*, Burck;\n- *P. Wallichii*, King, including *Vatica Wallichii*, Dyer;\n- *P. Stapfianus*, King;\n- *P. ruminatus*, Brandis, submerged from *V. ruminata*, Burck, by King into *P. Wallichii*, but restored to *Pachynocarpus* by Brandis; and\n- *P. Ridleyanus*, J. W. Anderson, transferred from *Vatica Ridleyana*, Brandis.\n\nBurck had described a *Vatica obtusa* (l.c., p. 228) placing it next to *V. ruminata* with the remark \"anne rectius *V. ruminatae* varietas.\" If so near *V. ruminata* as that and if *V. ruminata* is a species of *Pachynocarpus*, then so also must this species be; and therefore we may have seven to deal with.\n\n*Jour. Straits Branch*\nFor our work we have borrowed the specimens left in the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Calcutta, by Sir George King, and examined them carefully, along with the material which we have been able to accumulate ourselves from within the Malay Peninsula. The result is a great reduction and a return towards older views. While reserving an opinion upon the advisability of retaining Vatica as it stands, we cut out of Pachynocarpus most of the species added to it. We consider P. verrucosus, Heim, unlikely to differ from one of the other species of the genus; P. Wallichii, King, to consist of Vatica Wallichii, Dyer, and a Pachynocarpus confused; P. Stapfianus not to differ from the second part of King\u2019s P. Wallichii: ruminatus to be the same as Vatica Wallichii: and P. Ridleyanus to be a Vatica likewise. Moreover we find at present no reason to keep up the two species Vatica obtusifolia, Ridley, and V. Kelsalli, Ridley, described in the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, No. 34, 1910, pp. 26-27: both appear to be Vatica Wallichii, Dyer.\n\nIn the Calcutta herbarium are two sheets of Pachynocarpus umbonatus from the \u201cHerbarium Hookerianum\u201d with flowers; and in a capsule upon one of them is a detached fruit. It is clear that they were part of the material upon which the species was described. Attached to one of the sheets is a fragment of Chinese paper bearing this note:\u2014\u201c160, Dipterocarpeae\u2014? Vatica. A tree 1 to 1\u00bd feet diameter; wood very hard close and lasting, when cut yellowish brown, turning nearly black on drying; bark smooth, light coloured; yields a yellow transparent copal-like resin. The gum called in Europe \u2018dutch copal.\u2019 Rassak bunga\u2014flowering rassak; blooms cream-coloured, said to be very showy; tinged with pink when in blossom; very sweet scented. Loobook dana.\u201d In the Transactions of the Linnean Society the wood of Pachynocarpus was described by Sir Joseph Hooker, not as in this note, but as soft and white, and the wood of Cotylelobium melanoxyton Hook. f. which is also called \u201crassak\u201d \u00a7 was described as yellow, when seasoned turning black. Both species are said by him to have been got upon the north coast of Labuan, but Mr. T. H. Eley now Resident at Labuan, is unable to ascertain for us that there is a bay or stream-bend there, known at Lubok dana: and we are not confident that Lubok dana cannot be for instance on the Sungei Banyu Irang in Banjermasin. The note quoted appears to have been Motley\u2019s. It is to be asked not only if Sir Joseph Hooker wrongly assumed Lubok dana to be in Labuan, but why the discrepancy in the description of the wood, or if the note has been placed upon a wrong sheet, and belongs to Cotylelobium melanoxyton: but then the number 160 Hooker gives to the other. Sir George King had these specimens before him when he wrote his account of Pachynocarpus. It is to be observed that he held his material of Pachynocarpus from the Malay Peninsula to differ from\n\n\u00a7 \u201cRapak,\u201d the name quoted by Hooker is an error\u2014a misreading of the word \u201crassak\u201d written by Motley with the first s long.\nthem; and his opinion always deserves consideration: but beyond that he went wrong in not seeing that the peninsular material was different from the really unlike *Vatica Wallichii*.\n\nIn considering whether King was right to keep apart that Malayan material from the Bornean type, and right also to distinguish specifically *P. Stapfianus*, we have met with much difficulty. We have ended in keeping the peninsular and the Bornean material apart, more from caution than from conviction, and find the Pachynocarpus-portion of King\u2019s *P. Wallichii* not separable specifically from his *P. Stapfianus*. If however, there is a confusion in Motley\u2019s specimens, and it can be of a *Vatica* in flower mixed with a *Pachynocarpus* in fruit (flowers and fruit were probably gathered months apart), then the flowering specimen is likely to be a flowering *Vatica* and perhaps *V. Wallichii*, while the fruiting specimen (which is *P. umbonatus*) may not differ from *P. Stapfianus*. More study in Borneo is needed to decide this both near Labuan, and because Motley\u2019s last years were at Banjermassin in the south east.\n\nAt flowering time there is no sure mark in a herbarium specimen by which *Pachynocarpus* can be distinguished from *Vatica Wallichii*. That led to King\u2019s mistake of identifying the two; and a fair measure of variability in the calyx caused him to think that the adhesion which is not visible in the flower, came quite late in fruit-development, whereas it commences from the fall of the petals. The diagrams printed above indicate some of the variation in the calyx. We have had good opportunities of studying *Vatica Wallichii* alive, because it is a tree cultivated in the Economic Garden, Singapore, and because also it is by no means uncommon round the coasts of the Malay Peninsula. It has been planted on dry ground in the Economic Garden and has grown well; but its natural habitat is upon ground liable to flooding. Herbarium specimens prove its occurrence down the west coast of the Peninsula, certainly from Province Wellesley, and possibly from Trang in Lower Siam, to Singapore; and down the east coast from Kuantan to Singapore. It, by being identified with Burck\u2019s *Vatica ruminata*, is known also from Bangka. It is possible that Dr. Haviland\u2019s flowering specimens, Nos. 1907 and 1908, from near Kuching, Sarawak, may be it; but fruits are necessary for making this sure.\n\nTo Malays it is one of the several trees called Resak. Resak paya (swamp resak) is a name for it in Pahang and so are Resak pasir (pasir may mean sand, sea beach, or a certain quality in a wood which causes it to take the edge off cutting tools) and Resak laru,* which last belongs also to *Pachynocarpus Stapfianus*. Goodenough, Ridley\u2019s collector, called it Damar Mata Kuching on specimens collected in Singapore island and in Malacca. Derry in Malacca called it Kayu Merbatu Pasir.\n\n---\n\n* Laru is a substance used in making sugar. In this particular case, it is said that punctures or cuts are made in the bark; the resin which exudes is collected and placed into syrup which is being boiled, causing it to harden into sugar with a yellow colour.\nThe wood of *Vatica* and *Pachynocarpus* seems to be very much alike. The sapwood of *Vatica Wallichii* is white or pale yellow and the heartwood is brownish yellow, becoming much darker after exposure to the air. There is less of resin in the wood than is usually found in most members of the order.\n\nA pale damar runs out of injuries and glazes over the stem.\n\nThe tree attains no great height, reaching say 60 feet and the spread of its branches is narrow, say 10 feet from the trunk. If grown in the open it keeps its lower branches and is then leafy nearly to the ground; but in high forest its trunk is straight and branchless to 30 feet or more. A tree 50 feet high may possess a diameter at breast height of 20-30 inches. The bark is light grey and smooth.\n\nIts times of flowering in Singapore are uncertain doubtless in response to the uncertainty of the weather. All trees flower together. Flowering however in the Peninsula seems to be most common in April or May.\n\nIndividual trees differ from each other in small points. The leaves of some dry darker than the leaves of others. The flowers vary from a pale cream to milk-white; in some there is a touch of red upon the outside of the bud; examined at sun-down the petals may be bent just to a right angle on their claw, in others more. These variations characterise whole trees. It may be that the trees whose flowers are most pigmented, are the trees whose leaves dry darkest; but this has not been proved. A flower whose petals are bent through a right angle is figured below. The small eye is noteworthy.\n\nFig. 5 on the left, a flower of *Vatica Wallichii* in face view: Fig. 6 on the right, a flower of *Vatica Ridleyana*, also in face view. Both nat. size. Below each is the stigma and style enlarged.\n\nThe flowers have a strong and pleasant scent. By their multitude they make the tree conspicuous at flowering. They open about dawn, and fall about the next dawn. The stamens number 15;\u2014if 10 in such plants as that upon which *Vatica Kelsalli* was founded, then so by reduction, accidental probably. The flowers face downwards and outwards chiefly. Three or four distinct patches of glandular tissue occur in a row upon the underside of the leaves where the lateral veins break into loops. These leaves last for about 3 years. Six months pass before the fruit is ripe. The fruit is dry and water-distributed chiefly by means of floods. We have seen this process in operation in the Tasek Gelugor Forest Reserve in Province Wellesley, where heavy rain had flooded the\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nlow and level ground, and the fruits were stranded in lines at the limit of the flooding. The duration of the floating was tested and described in a note by one of us (Journ. Straits Branch Roy. As. Soc. 81, 1920, p. 75) where the wrong generic name *Pachynocarpus* was used for it. The average duration of floating in that experiment was found to be 22 days. The germination was described in the same place. The capsule is ruptured along three lines predetermined by weaknesses in the walls. These three lines are more clearly shown in the capsule of the related *Vatica Zollingeriana*, A.DC., which is figured here, because it is instructive in regard to the nature of the less clearly marked lines of rupture in *Vatica Wallichii*.\n\n![Fig. 7. Shell of the fruit of *Vatica Zollingeriana*, A.DC., in vertical section showing the sepals (s), and the wall cut on one side down one of the lines of rupture, and on the other through the thick swollen mid-part between. Doubtless *V. Zollingeriana* is water-distributed, for the swollen part is such as would keep it floating.]\n\nThe fruiting calyx of *V. Wallichii* is developed to a somewhat variable extent: sometimes it is humped as in the first figure above; sometimes it is rather flat, as in the second. The two figures were from fruits picked from the ground of the Tasek Gelugor Forest Reserve at the same spot, and appeared to be the product of a tree immediately above them.\n\nOur material of *Vatica Wallichii* is as follows:\n\n**Province Wellesley.** In the Tasek Gelugor Forest Reserve, with fruit, in September 1921, Burkill 6599!\n\n**Penang.** Without precise locality, Wallich Cat. 9018!\n\n**Perak.** Ulu Sapetang, with young fruit in Feb. 1909, M.

It may be that a specimen in the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Calcutta, collected on Bukit Timah in Singapore island, is also Vatica Ridleyana, but as it is without\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nthe characteristic fruits it is impossible to make sure of this: it was collected in 1894: in 1892 Mr. Ridley got the species on Bukit Mandai (No. 8943) and also at Changi (Nos. 4447! and 4448!), since which dates clearing has been extensive; and the tree has not been recognised in recent years outside the Botanic Gardens. In the Gardens there are several individuals. The tallest is in area N, tree No. 795: the second tree No. 815 in area V, and others are in area U and V. It is not a tree of lowlying ground; and its large fruits sink at once in water. Such distribution as they get must be by being rolled along the floor of the forest or (and this is the usual distribution of many forest trees of the second rank) by transport through small distances by animals seeking food.\n\nTree No. 795 in the Botanic Gardens is about 100 feet high. Its trunk is 62 in. in circumference at breast height: the bark is medium grey. The spread of the branches is about 30 feet from the trunk, the lower 60 feet of which are straight smooth and branchless.\n\nThe flower drawn above was produced by tree 815 in January 1921; and fruits were not ripe until the following November. They fell very deliberately through three months or more.\n\nFig. 8. A half ripe fruit of *Vatica moluccana*, Burck, showing the development of the reflexed calyx. The fruit is figured to illustrate a stage in the series of species connecting *Vatica Wallichii* with Vaticas of the section Retinodendron.\n\nThe fruit of *Vatica Ridleyana*, if elongated, is always turned to one side as drawn; but tree No. 815 produces longer fruits by 3/4 in. than tree No. 795, in which the apex is nearly straight. The leaves have glandular patches just as those of *Vatica Wallichii*.\n\nThese glands are slightly concave, and carry brown hairs.\n\nThe spongy parenchyma of the lower surface of the leaf gives place over their area to something denser. No excretion has been observed to occur on them; but probably there is one.\n\n*Pachynocarpus umbonatus*, by the view taken here, is the tree of Borneo sent by Barber to Sir William Hooker at Kew,\u2014certainly the fruiting part of the specimens, but not quite so certainly the flowering part. These flowering branches show thinner leaves with less prominent veins than any peninsular specimen which we ascribe to the genus. And as leaves so thin seem to be within the range of variation of the leaves of *Vatica Wallichii*; and as\ndried flowers offer no character by which the two can be distinguished, it is well not to state dogmatically yet that *P. umbonatus* and *P. Stapfianus* are distinct species.\n\n*Pachynocarpus verrucosus*, (Burck) Heim, described upon a specimen from Sungei Landak in Borneo, north east of Pontianak, collected by Teysmann, will probably be united with one of the other species when fully studied.\n\n*Pachynocarpus Stapfianus* is like *Valica Ridleyana* a tree of rising land. The result is that flowering herbarium specimens unauthenticated by fruits, if from the interior of the Peninsula, are more likely to be it than the similar *Valica Wallichii*. We know it to occur in the Siamese Malay States, Penang, Perak, Selangor, and Pahang. King's Collector records it as 80-100 ft. high, with a girth up to 3 ft. As it occurs at Bangi, Selangor, it is a tree 38 ft. 2 in. high, and 3 ft. 1 in. in girth at breast height. The height to the first branch is 6 ft. 4 in., and the girth just below the first branch 2 ft. 11 in. The spread of the crown is 26 ft. 4 in.\n\nWe have not measurements of any other trees. Its leaves in most cases dry dark as in some specimens of *Valica Wallichii*, so that by their colour there is no means of separating the two when dry. Of the flower in life we are not able to give a figure. We have records of flowering in July and October in different places and different years; and of fruiting in January, February, April and July.\n\nThe fruit when half ripe is acute to blunt; and when fully ripe by the rounding of the fertile loculus becomes globose and generally loses the minute apiculus representing the style. It has not the dimensions ascribed to it by Sir George King in any of the type specimens but is about one inch long. The calyx is adherent through $\\frac{1}{2}$-$\\frac{2}{3}$ of the length of the fruit. It and the exposed surface of the carpellary wall above it are lenticellate, sometimes little, sometimes much. The tip of the sepals persists and is free until the fruit is half ripe, then it generally falls off. The months when fruit is most likely to be found are March, April and May.\n\nThe embryo is quite unlike that of *Valica Wallichii*. The outer cotyledon is half-wrapped half-folded round the placentar cotyledon; and both reach the apex of the fruit cavity:\n\nFigs. 9 and 10, the embryo of *Pachynocarpus stapfianus* $\\frac{1}{2}$ nat. size.\n\nOur material of *Pachynocarpus Stapfianus* is as follows:\u2014\n\nLower Siam.

Resak laru is a name from Kuantan and also from Penang.\n\nOur conclusion is that Pachynocarpus stands with two or possibly three species, i.e. P. umbonatus, Hook. f., possibly P. verrucosus, Burck, and P. Stapfianus, King; but that P. umbonatus must be collected again to remove some doubt as to the correct identification of the flowering specimens with the fruit. The rest of the species put by various authors into the genus go to Vatica.\nNotes on Dipterocarps.\n\nNo. 7. On the fruit and germination of Isoptera borneensis.\n\nBy I. H. Burkill.\n\nIsoptera borneensis, Scheff., is a tree which yields much of the Tangkawang fat produced in Malaya. Borneo, where its extension is through the island, is the centre of its distribution: eastwards it reaches Mindanao and westwards the Malay Peninsula, Bangka and south Sumatra. It is a large, but apparently not a very large tree. Its habitat is the margins of rivers of moderate size. Into their waters it drops its fruits, and they are distributed by them.\n\nThe following is a figure of the fruit in the position in which it floats, the buoyant sepals upwards.\n\nFig. 1. A seed of Isoptera borneensis, in the position in which it floats. \u00bd nat. size.\n\nDeprived of the corky sepals, the fruits within 60 hours, sink however dry at the starting of the experiment.\n\nIn Note no. + of this series (Journ. Straits branch Roy. As. Soc. no. 81, 1920, p. 5) an account was given of the floating fruit of Valica Wallichii, Dyer (Pachynocarpus Wallichii, King) wherein the buoyant tissue is the fruit-wall, i.e. the same end is attained but by different means.\n\nIt is not possible to regard water-distribution as in any way ancestral in the order; but it appears in Vatica as an ultimate modification at the end of a series which has lost the advantage of height and thereby lost the wind that does not reach a small tree deep in high forest: and it would seem to be connected with fruiting before the tree is of any great height in Isoptera borneensis; for the tree commences to fruit at the early age of six years (fide van Romburgh and Ridley). But though Vatica Wallichii and Isoptera borneensis use water as a means for the distributing of their seeds they have little else in common, being wide apart in their order.\n\nThe embryo of Isoptera borneensis is very like that of some Shoreas, say of S. costata, in being grooved down the sides and in end-view, as figured here; but both its cotyledons reach the apex of the fruit-cavity, though the outer is so much the larger that it possesses anything from 240 to 280 degrees of the circumference at the equator of the seed.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nFig. 2. Embryo of *Isoptera borneensis* seen from the end showing the outer cotyledon folded over the placentar cotyledon. \u00bd nat. size.\n\nThe vitality of the seed is not great. The fruit floats and germinates floating if the purpose of floating has not been achieved by a stranding in some new spot. Probably the end of germinated floating fruits arrives very quickly and the seedling perishes: it is heavier than water, and falling from the fruit sinks.\n\nIn germination the fruit-wall ruptures at no constant place, but in response to the pressure of the variable young plant within and not at any weak lines in the wall. Here are four diagrams\n\nFigs. 3\u20146. Diagrams of the position of the cracking of the fruit-wall in the germination of the seed of *Isoptera borneensis*. No. 3 is the most usual way. No. 4 is not uncommon being No. 3 as it were incomplete; No. 5 is No. 4 oblique; No. 6 is the reverse of No. 3.\n\nshowing the cotyledons in transverse section: the outer cotyledon in germination has a tendency to flatten itself, which tendency pushes chiefly right and left, and is fortified by a similar tendency in the inner or placentar cotyledon; this results further in a second direction of pressure,\u2014towards the part of the wall where the placenta is, i.e. upwards in the diagrams. Under these pressures the wall gives way, first as a rule on the right and on the left, and either later near the placenta, or (diagram 4) not at all. The commonest form of splitting is that in diagram 3, the third, last and often not extensive, crack being close against one side of the attachment of the placenta to the wall.\n\nIn diagram 5 is a case where the lobes of the placentar cotyledon were unequal and the splitting unusually oblique.\n\nIf the fruit is split into two, as in diagram 4, the two parts are nearly halves. Here are approximate measurement in degrees of a circle of six fruits split into two:\n\n173\u00b0 placenta attached about the middle of the smaller part.\n\n187\u00b0 placenta attached about the middle of one of the parts.\n\n189\u00b0 placenta attached about the middle of the larger part.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n201\u00b0 placenta attached about the middle of the larger part.\n\n187\u00b0 do.\n\n173\u00b0\n\n180\u00b0 placenta attached at 45\u00b0 from the centre of one half.\n\n180\u00b0\n\nWhen the fruit wall is split into three parts after the manner of diagram 3, ascertained measurements were\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n120\u00b0 & \\quad 136\u00b0 \\\\\n84\u00b0 & \\quad 124\u00b0 \\\\\n124\u00b0 & \\quad 112\u00b0 \\\\\n125\u00b0 & \\quad 110\u00b0 \\\\\n138\u00b0 & \\quad 84\u00b0 \\\\\n162\u00b0 & \\quad 93\u00b0 \\\\\n131\u00b0 & \\quad 120\u00b0 \\\\\n138\u00b0 & \\quad 105\u00b0 \\\\\n109\u00b0 &\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIt is easy to understand what happens in these seeds from these few measurements. Take the diagrams, which have purposely been oriented for the sake of this explanation; the pressure of the embryo is greater transversely than in any other direction and results in the giving way of the fruit-wall at either side: if the giving way occurs at points more or less diametrically opposite, the pressure needs no further cracking: but if the first cracks appear rather to the lower side of the diagrams, then the embryo continuing to grow produces a new crack more or less mid way upon the larger part, that is generally in the neighbourhood of the attachment of the placenta. If as in diagram 6 the crack is too much to the upper side then a third crack must appear upon the lower or larger part to allow of the germination proceeding. I measured only two fruits of this type and I found them:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n106 & \\quad 97 \\\\\n127Y & \\quad 127 \\\\\n146Y & \\quad 117\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThis method of fruit-splitting, easy to demonstrate in *Isotoma borneensis*, is characteristic of the greater part of the order. It is not dehiscence, for the product of fertilisation in the order never ceases growing from the moment of fertilisation to the time when the produced plant dies: the embryo grows into the seed and devours its albumen, which done it is normally cast from the parent tree, not quiescent as so many seeds are, but still growing, and in the course of its growth it ruptures the fruit-wall as described. Under abnormal conditions it may not be cast from the parent tree, and then germinates suspended (van Romburgh).\n\nIf only we knew the workings of the process by which the tree cuts off nutriment from its offspring, we should know the strength of the barrier preventing vivipary from being anything but a phenomenon exhibited by few and peculiar Phanerogams.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nAs far as is known, it is universal for the Dipterocarps to possess in the ovary three chambers and six ovules, two in each: one ovule only in all normal cases matures. One flower only, shall we say, in 10,000 matures fruit. It is remarkable then, that the production of the six ovules to each flower should be so constant, and it suggests an ancestry which had not winged fruits as so many modern Dipterocarps have, because six seeds carried away together on the wind would be too heavy a load for efficient wind-distribution and, settled together, would compete unprofitably. Wind-distribution appears, therefore, a less ancient phenomenon than their six ovules, but yet it is so general as to be characteristic of the order. It is easiest to consider it as co-aeval in the order with its separation from something more ancient, and to consider the absence of it to be subsequent or secondary. *Isotoma* has lost it.\u2014has taken to water-distribution as an alternative. *Vatica Wallichii* has done the same. Some species of *Shorea* such as *S. Thiseltoni*, some of *Dryobalanops*, some of *Vatica*, the species of *Balanocarpus*, and the species of *Pachynocarpus* hold their own producing fruits very heavy for wind to lift them, and are distributed through small distances by being rolled or carried along the floor of the forest. They too have lost their wings. If we think of the evolution of the order as suggested it is of the greatest importance to understand that the splitting of the fruit-wall is not along definite lines, that is to say there is in it no sign of a pre-Dipterocarp dehiscent condition when six seeds might mature and need for the sake of efficiency that they be scattered singly.\n\nAgainst this line of argument it has to be admitted that some species of the genus *Vatica* possess weak lines in the walls of their fruits where rupture occurs. The lines seem tertiary however, and are being studied.\n\nThe cotyledons of *Isotoma borneensis* contain chlorophyll in abundance before germination, and on germination are exposed to the light and held, like the cotyledons of most species of *Shorea*, upon short petioles.\nNotes on Dipterocarps.\n\nNo. 8. On some large-fruited species, and in particular upon the effects of the pressure of the embryo against the interior of the fruit-wall.\n\nBy I. H. Burkill.\n\nDipterocarps with large fruits that are not wind-distributed occur in the genera *Dryobalanops*, *Shorea*, *Balanocarpus*, *Vatica*, *Pachynocarpus* and *Vateria*. By the kindness of Dr. F. W. Foxworthy, I have had material of some of them for study, and one *Balanocarpus maximus*, King, was the subject of Note no. 5 of this series (Jour. Str. Br. Roy. As. Soc. no. 81, 1920, p. 3); I am adding in this note observations upon *Shorea Thiseltoni*, King, and *Vatica Ridleyana*, Brandis, and also a few remarks upon a *Dryobalanops* which has the Malay name of \u201cKoladan.\u201d\n\nThe weight of a fruit of *Shorea Thiseltoni* from the Weld Hill Forest Reserve, Kuala Kumpur, is found to be about 5.5 grammes; that of *Vatica Ridleyana* from tree no. 815 in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, about 12.5 grammes. Neither is wind-distributed; but falls to the floor of the forest where it may be carried through small distances by rolling or by animals.\n\n![Figs. 1, 2, and 3](image)\n\nFig. 1, a fruit of *Shorea Thiseltoni*; figs. 2 and 3, fruits of *Vatica Ridleyana*. All \u00bd nat. size.\n\n*Shorea Thiseltoni* is one of a small number of species in the genus whose seeds contain oil as well as starch. That having been noticed, an analysis was requested from the Department of Agriculture, Federated Malay States and Straits Settlements, and kindly made through the good offices of Mr. L. Lewton-Brain by Mr. R. O. Bishop. The following is his report on seeds submitted to him from the Weld Hill Forest Reserve. \u201cA certain number of the kernels were found to be mouldy and were excluded: the remainder were sampled and dried. The dry kernels were extracted for oil-content. The residue from oil extraction was examined for albuminoids and ash. Results:\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nKernel.

The fat was found to have a very low acid value, the actual figure being 0.83.\"\n\nThe embryo has its cotyledons slightly unequal as in the following drawings where two are seen from the placentar side: the outer cotyledon is seen to be by a little the larger and alone to reach the very apex of the fruit-cavity. Great irregularity was found in the embryo: for instance in figure 4 one lobe of the placentar cotyledon is crossed partially to the wrong side of the dissepiment, and in figure 9 the two cotyledons are seen to be uneven. Normal expanded cotyledons are as in figures 6 and 7: in outline they are quite typical of the genus Shorea. Figures 8 and 9 represent the seedling, figure 8 a normal individual,\u2014but\n\nFigures 4 and 5. Two embryos of Shorea Thiseltoni removed from the seed coats.

All \u00bd nat. size.\nfigure 9 one in which a lobe of the outer cotyledon has suffered injury (the arrow indicates the place), and its arrested growth has given the other lobe and the lobe of the placentar cotyledon in contact an opportunity for expansion beyond the normal. That this should happen is indicative of the pressure set up within the fruit,\u2014the pressure which continued is also the cause of the rupture of the fruit-wall in germination, however at that period with a small amount of altered tension, due to the outer layer of the fruit wall contracting in drying somewhat more than the inner.\n\nIn my study of germinating Dipterocarps I have found no exactly similar case of a tendency in the ruptured fruit to gape and therefore it must be described in detail. The lines of rupture are variable in place, as in Isotoma (vide this Journal above) and are quite clearly brought about by the pressure of the growing embryo; but when they have been produced, the drying of the outer layer of the fruit-wall continues the tearing and causes the split wall to assume the appearance which is represented in figures 12, 13 and 14. This is not a hygroscopic action; and therefore no soaking of the seed brings the edges of the gaping crack together. Obviously it greatly facilitates the escape of the young plant from the imprisoning fruit-wall.\n\nFigures 10 and 11, sections through the fruit of Shorea Thiseltoni, showing the packing of the cotyledon-lobes, and the places where in these cases the fruit-wall was split.\n\nThe fruit of Shorea Thiseltoni germinates without resting, and in germination the lines of splitting commence at the apex of the fruit, and extend downwards. The most usual course of events is for there to be three splits, and for two of them to extend to the base, whereon a panel of the fruit-wall is free and forced out. This panel is usually rather less than one third of the circumference: but there is great variability. The variability is accompanied by a great variability in the relative size of the lobes of the two cotyledons; and may be considered as a consequence of it, as has been suggested in the note upon Isotoma borneensis; and the most unusual forms of splitting were found to occur with unusual twisting or unequal development in the cotyledons.\n\nThe fruits sink in water, and may germinate submerged;* doubtless if such should happen in nature germination would be\n\n---\n\n* Lewkowitsch, (Chemical technology and analysis of Oils, Fats and Waxes, ii, London, 1914, p. 601) has a statement that submersion of the fruits of Dipterocarps is resorted to in Borneo in the preparation of Tang-kawang oil because it prevents germination. This reason appears wholly incorrect: but submersion by killing the caterpillars and grubs which so freely devour the embryo within the fruits may prevent loss in manufacture.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nfollowed very quickly by death. An experiment was made with six fruits in order to see if submergence inhibited the splitting of the fruit wall; apparently it did not; for all the six germinated in six days under water. The splitting is the work of the germinating young plant pushing itself free.\n\nFigures 12, 13 and 14. Three empty fruits showing various degrees of gaping.\n\nThe petioles of the cotyledons elongate in germination so much as to attain 2-7 cm. pushing the radicle out to the soil before they free themselves from the fruit-wall. They possess abundant chlorophyll.\n\nLeaving Shorea Thiseltoni, attention will now be directed to Vatica Ridleyana, Brandis.\n\nThis species grows wild in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore. It flowered in January, 1921, and bore ripe fruits from near the end of the year into the first quarter of 1922;\u2014flowering had lasted a couple of weeks, but fruit-fall lasted three months. The considerable weight of the fruits has already been remarked: it remains to call attention to the circumstance that their growth from flowering to maturity takes twice as long as that of the smaller and closely allied V. Wallichii.\n\nFigure 15. A seedling of Vatica Ridleyana in germination, the stalks of the cotyledons pushing the plantlet into the soil. The outer cotyledon is towards the observer; above it a little of the placentar cotyledon is visible. Figure 16, the placentar cotyledon from the surface in contact with the outer cotyledon. Figure 17, the outer cotyledon from outside. All \u00bd nat. size.\n\nThe placentar cotyledon is the larger and fills the lower part of the fruit-cavity to the exclusion of the outer cotyledon; but it shares equally the upper part of the cavity. The result is that its bulk is nearly twice that of the outer cotyledon. In Balanocar-\n\nJour. Straits Branch\npus maximus the placentar cotyledon occupies the basal part of the cavity of the fruit and the outer cotyledon the apical; and they are of nearly equal bulk: in Vatica Wallichii, they are also of nearly equal bulk and they share the fruit-cavity equally, but side by side instead of as in Balanocarpus the one above the other: but in Vatica Ridleyana with inequality, the placentar cotyledon occupies the basal and shares the apical part.\n\nThere is enwrapping neither in Vatica Ridleyana nor in Vatica Wallichii; and the cells in both are gorged with starch. The young plant after emergence is singularly similar in the two, the leaves are exactly alike, even to the 6-8 large glands upon the lower surface at the looping of the veins, surrounded by the richest green of chlorophyll. Unlike the fruits of Vatica Wallichii, the fruits of Vatica Ridleyana do not float in water, not even if dried.\n\nIn germination the fibrous fruit-wall splits from the apex downwards along pre-determined lines, possibly along one line to its base and for a short way only along others: the radicle is thrust out by the elongation of the petioles of the cotyledons, as in Vatica Wallichii, Shorea robusta, the genus Dipterocarpus. The blades of the cotyledons never leave the fruit-cavity, but develop a little,\u2014very little\u2014chlorophyll where they become exposed to the light.\n\nThe lines where the fruit-wall is split in germination, can be seen beforehand upon the outer side of the fruit, as they are depressed and free from the elsewhere abundant lenticels. The fruit-wall is thinner at them and the cell-structure differs.\n\nThese lines are usually three, but may be four and may be five in number. In studying the flower when it was available in January, 1921, (see this Journal p. 276), five-locular ovaries were not observed; but as their presence was not suspected, no search was made for them: it was only when, twelve months later, the fruit was ripe that their existence was suggested by finding five lines of splitting in a small percentage of the fruits.\n\nOut of 263 fruits, 201 had three lines, 57 had four lines, and 5 had five lines.\n\nIt is most interesting that when the fruit shows four depressed lines upon the outside, three only as a rule are burst open, so that out of 17 fruits with four lines, set to germinate together, 15 were split along three and 2 only along four lines. Of the first fifteen in 13 the line which was not split was that close to the placenta.\n\nFour fruits with five depressed lines, set to germinate at the same time likewise became split along three only of the lines, and again a line not split was that closest to the placenta.\n\nThat these lines are the places where the carpels are connate into the ovary admits of doubt because in fruits with four lines, the placenta is rarely central upon any one of the valves. The development must be followed out to demonstrate that it is as one would expect. The fruit-wall is composed of brown parenchymatous cells, white sclerenchyma fibres and a margin of cork with numerous powdery lenticels.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nThe sclerenchyma fibres are in bundles of 8-30 and anastomose; but not across the lines where the fruit-wall is ruptured. In their absence at these spots lies the weakness which associated with a slightly lesser thickness, locates the rupture of the dead tissues under the pressure of the growing seedling within.\n\nA comparative study of the distribution of these sclerenchyma fibres in the fruit-wall of the Dipterocarps, and above all of their relationship to the way in which the young plant makes its way out, seems to be most desirable; but it will be a long time before sufficient material for it can be got together.\n\nBefore the fruit-wall gives way, the growing embryo has endured a period of compression: and if the distribution of the pressure is made abnormal, it stows itself in a modified way. Insect-punctures and other forms of injury to the fruit-wall change this pressure: and a slightly greater resistance to being pushed against the wall in the placentae of the tree S15 appears to be the force which leads to so many of that tree\u2019s fruits curving as in figure 2 above. In these curved fruits the placenta is along the less convex side, and the dorsal cotyledon almost always just excludes the placentar from the apex of the fruit cavity. In a more or less straight fruit the embryo in side view is thus:\n\nboth cotyledons reaching the apex, but the placentar alone the base. But with the pressure abnormal and particularly if the injury has passed through the fruit wall reaching the embryo as for instance a Hemipteron\u2019s tongue is generally meant to do, various changes affecting sometimes one side, sometimes another side of the embryo, appear; the embryo may then be unilateral or the dorsal cotyledon may have lost position or the placentar cotyledon as in the two further diagrams here following. In the one the placentar cotyledon seems to have sustained a set back; and in the other the dorsal, the results of which have been in the one to produce an embryo closely similar to that of *Vatica Wallichii* (see Jour. Str. Br. Roy. As. Soc. no. 81, p. 76, figures 209-212), and in the other an embryo suggesting somewhat that of *Balanocarpus maximus* (see p. 4 of the same).\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe lesson to which these observations seems to point, is that the embryo of Dipterocarps possesses a considerable amount of plasticity.\n\nThis note closes with a few remarks upon the Malayan *Dryobalanops* known as \"Koladan,\"* a member of its genus which uses the wind in no way for the transport of its fruits. They are as here drawn, and in germination the wall is split along three lines\n\n![Figure 18](image)\n\n**Figure 18.** A fruit of Koladan, showing an obliquity by no means uncommon, the placentar side being smaller than the other. Figure 19 the same seen from the end showing which of the cracks usually it forced open the most: the placenta is uppermost.\n\nin exactly the same way as in *Dryobalanops aromatica*. The embryo is further as in that species (vide No. 4, Jour. Straits Branch Roy. As. Soc., No. 81, 1920, p. 56) and so also is the young seedling. It was not remarked of that species; but may now be remarked after studing *Koladan* somewhat, that the seedling has a great tendency to force rupture along two lines and to come to the light by pushing aside a panel of the wall which is diametrically opposite to the placenta.\n\n![Figure 20](image)\n\n**Figure 20.** A seedling of \"Koladan\" in the position in which is throws off its seedcoats and the fruit wall.\n\n**Figure 21** shows the fruit wall in broken dotted lines imposed over an outline of a seedling in germination to indicate where the greatest pressure appears to occur.\n\n---\n\n*R.

Ridley.\n\nThe forest of the Malay Peninsula still continues to supply to the botanist many new and interesting species; and it will doubtless be many years before it becomes difficult to add to the list of our flora. The following additions continue the series published in the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. Some of them are of plants collected by myself in Selangor, and in a short but productive excursion to Bukit Tangga in Negri Sembilan in December 1920, and to the Semangkok Pass in January 1921. Others were collected by Mr. H. C. Robinson, C. B. Kloss and Mr. Seimund in various parts of the Peninsula.\n\nThe Bukit Tangga locality is 14 miles from Seremban where there is a small rest house situated at the top of the pass to Jelebu. The hill behind the bungalow rises to about 2,400 feet elevation and is densely afforested to the top. Although generally speaking this area has a flora closely resembling that of the Selangor hills, it contained quite a number of novelties which are certainly absent from Selangor. Many years ago Mr. Cantley had a collector in this district and it was probably near here that he obtained a number of plants never since collected.\n\nPOLYGALACEAE.\n\nPolygala (Chamaebuxus) pulchra, Hassk. Flor. XXV. .142.\n\nBeibl. 32.\n\nA slender woody shrub about 4 feet tall. Leaves membranous thin, oblong-lanceolate; nerves slender, 9 pairs; 8 in. long, 3 in. wide; petiole .25 in. long. Racemes short, about 1 in. long, pendulous. Sepals 2, outer ones short, one saccate ovate acute, the other smaller ovate, green petaloid. Sepals ovate round,.25 in. long. Petals 2, short, oblong blunt; keel 4-lobed, fleshy, not crested. All white tinted yellow. Capsule obovoid orbicular, deeply retuse, not winged except at the tip, green tipped purple or nearly all purple violet,.2 in. long,.3 in. wide. Seed subglobose, aril scarlet.\n\nHab. In hill woods, Negri Sembilan, Bukit Tangga, Ridley. Selangor, Ginting Bidai, Ridley. Also in Java and Sumatra.\n\nThis species is quite distinct, especially in life, from P. venenosa in its slender woody stem, its thinner leaves, short racemes not elongating to 5 inches long or more, the smaller flowers with small obovate rounded petaloid sepals and the smaller capsule not winged along the sides. It is not so striking a plant as the great succulent P. venenosa so common and conspicuous in our forests, nor are the flowers so brightly coloured in spite of its name.\nMELIACEAE.\n\nTurraea breviflora Ridley, n. sp.\n\nA glabrous shrub. Leaves thin membranous, alternate, lanceolate acuminate cuspidate, narrowed and cuneate at the base, nerves about 10 pairs distinct beneath; 6.5 in. long, 2 in. wide; petiole .3 in. long. Flowers 3 or 4 on a very short .1 in. long axillary pubescent raceme, green; pedicels very short. Bracts minute ovate. Sepals connate at base with 5 short acute points. Petals 5, linear blunt, .25 in. long. Stamen-tube stout cylindric, shorter than petals with rather long filaments alternating with the anthers from the top of the tube; anthers elliptic 10, sessile with a long terminal process. Disc short and thin, lining the base of the tube. Style rather stout, hairy. Stigma capitate. Ovary conic hairy.\n\nHab. In woods; not common. Singapore, Serangoon, Ridley 9114; Selangor, Ulu Selangor, Goodenough 10612; Kanching, on limestone rocks, Ridley.\n\nThis species is very unlike the others of the genus in its very short green flowers, but there are a few in Africa which resemble it to some extent. The fruit has not been collected and till it is known it would be better to leave this plant in the genus Turroea to which at least it is nearest.\n\nRHAMNACEAE.\n\nZizyphus pernettyoides Ridley, n. sp.\n\nA spiny creeper with slender stems covered with scattered brown hairs. Leaves ovate acuminate, base round obscurely crenulate, coriaceous sparsely hairy on the edge, nerves 3, prominent and reticulations conspicuous when dry; .5 in. long, .25 in wide; petiole very short hairy, spines straight slender .25 in. long. Flowers .1 in. wide, greenish yellow in axillary fascicles of three in upper axils; pedicels very short .1 in. long. Sepals 5, triangular ovate with a few long hairs at the tips. Petals 5, half as long, spoon-shaped, clawed with an elliptic blunt limb. Stamens 5, very slender wrapped in the petals. Disc fleshy filling the tube. Ovary sunk in the disc with 2 short stigmas.\n\nHab. Lankawi, Dayang Bunting, Robinson 6193. Creeper; flowers greenish yellow, December 7, 1916.\n\nA remarkable little plant with the smallest leaves of any Zizyphus known to me.\n\nMYRTACEAE.\n\nEugenia alata Ridley, n. sp.\n\nTree, glabrous; branches 4-angled and winged in the upper part with 4 low wings along the angles. Leaves thinly stiff cori-\naceous, elliptic acuminate cuspidate; nerves 14 pairs prominent beneath, secondaries nearly as prominent, intramarginal nerve .1 in. from the edge, midrib prominent beneath; 6 to 8 in. long, 2.5 to 5 in. wide; petiole thick, grooved, above. Corymb compound, cymes 4 in. long and wide. Flowers numerous, congested at the branch ends; branches flattened, 4-angled. Calyx and pedicel club-shaped .2 in. long. Corolla small calyptrate. Stamens short and rather few.\n\nHab. Selangor, Semangkok Pass, track to Bukit Tegala, Ridley.\n\nThe flowers were in young condition and may perhaps when fully developed be larger. In one tree the inflorescence bore numerous bodies like round flattened lobed fruits; these proved to be flowers aborted by a number of galls in the ovary. The petals appear to be completely joined together so that it belongs to the calyptrate section, the curiously angled and winged branches and inflorescence branches is different from any other species I have seen.\n\nARALIACEAE.\n\nTrevesia rufo-setosa Ridley n. sp.\n\nA shrub with the habit of Trevesia sundaica Miq. Leaf palmate of seven lobes, base cordate, lobes more or less elliptic shortly cuspidate, edges undulate with short upcurved thorns, above glabrous except the nerves, and centre red-hairy and covered with small raised dots apparently hair bases; nerves 9, two on the lowest lobes, whole about 12 inches long and wide, the lobes cut down for 9 inches, and 3 to 4 inches wide, the lowest pair dilate on the lower edge at the base; petiole stout at the base and narrower upwards, 2 feet long, densely covered with red brown bristly hairs nearly .3 in. long. Inflorescence 8 in. long, flexuous, stout with a few short branches densely covered with similar hairs. Flowers unisexual on the same inflorescence .25 in. across with pedicels .4 in. long in umbels subsessile on the branches. Bracts linear acuminate caudate, very narrow .5 in. long. Calyx obconic densely red hairy; limb very short and obscure, lobed. Corolla stellate, spreading, lobes 5, triangular hairy beneath, coriaceous. Stamens 5, glabrous; filaments thick at base as long as the corolla; anthers large ovate cordate. Style in female flowers rather tall cylindric; stigma bifid with two short lobed oblong arms recurved. Ovary 5-celled.\n\nHab. Hill forests. Selangor, Semangkok Pass at 2500 feet alt., Ridley.\n\nNearest to T. Beccarii Boerlage, of Sumatra; but the dense indumentum of red brown hairs flattened at the base and acuminate covering the petiole and the whole of the inflorescence except the inner face of the petals, stamens, style and disc, is very distinct. The few stamens, 5 only, is also unusual.\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nRUBIACEAE.\n\nTarenna calcarea Ridley, n. sp.\n\nA shrub with white shining branches. Leaves membranous ovate cuspidate with a long point drying black; base cuneate; nerves 4 to 5 pairs; 4 to 5 in. long, 2 to 3 inches wide; petiole 1 in. long, slender. Stipules short, broad, triangular with short points. Cymes 1.5 inches long, terminal, lax, few-flowered; peduncles .25 inches long. Bracts short lanceolate acute. Calyx very small under .05 in. long, cup-shaped with 5 short acute points. Corolla-tube cylindric, rather thick, .12 inches long, lobes oblong, blunt nearly as long; anthers acuminate nearly as long as the sepals. A little white hair at the base of the corolla-lobes.\n\nHab. Limestone rocks. Perak, Ipoh, Ridley.\n\nIts set of Tarennas are somewhat closely allied and this is nearest to T. adangensis Ridley, but the leaves are larger and thinner and the corolla rather small, the throat being only sparsely white hairy. Nearly all of the set are inhabitants of limestone rocks and each area of limestone seems to have a distinct species or variety.\n\nPavetta indica Linn.\n\nThis species was based mainly on a drawing of Rheede\u2019s Hortus Malabaricus v. p. 19, t. 20. and in the Flora of British India, nearly all the Pavettas with large corymbs are put underneath Pavetta indica as the species intended by Linnaeus or as varieties of it. It seems to me however, that there are a good many distinct species included in Pavetta indica Hook. fil., Flora of British India iii. p. 150.\n\nI make out the following species.\n\nPavetta indica var. canescens.

Wallich had a specimen from Finlayson in flower, No. 6178, and one from Penang in fruit 6186, and did not recognise them as the same thing. The plant varies chiefly in the size of the leaves. A plant obtained by me in Kelantan has leaves nearly 12 in. long, and 3.75 in. wide, and the pedicels are much shorter than in the type.\nP. pauciflora Ridley, n. sp.\n\nA small glabrous tree. Leaves thin, elliptic lanceolate, long acuminate, acute, long narrowed to the base; nerves 6 pairs inarching; 4 to 6 in. long, .5 to 1.5 in. wide; petiole slender, .5 in. long.

America and two Asiatic ones of which one, Spermacoce hispida, occurs in our area, but lately this latter with a number of other Asiatic species has been separated from the American ones under the name of Borreria, while the Spermacoce sarmentosa Bl. is separated under the name of Diodia sarmentosa Sw. It is not rare in the Malay Peninsula, and occurs also in Banca, Java and Sumatra, and also in S. America whence it has probably been introduced into Asia. Diodia differs from Borreria in the cocci of the fruit, not dehiscing on the inner face. Of Borreria we have the following species in the Malay Peninsula.\n\n1. Borreria latifolia K. Schum. in Mart. Fl. Brazil., vi, 63.\n\nThis was the plant described by me by error as Diodia sarmentosa in Journ. Roy. As. Soc. S. Br. 73, p. 145. It first appeared in Singapore in 1915, and curiously no specimens have been seen from any other part of the Old World. It is a native of S. America.\n\n2. B. hispida K. Schum. in Engl. Pflanzenfam. iv, 4, p. 144.\n\nSpermacoce hispida Linn. Sp. Pl. 102.\n\nThis is common all over the Peninsula and occurs in India and the Malay islands. It does not appear to have been met with in S. America and is the only species with pink flowers.\n\n3. B. laevicaulis Ridley. Bigelovia laevicaulis Miq., Fl. Ind. Bat. ii. 335. Spermacoce stricta King, in Journ. As. Soc. Beng. p. 90, 189, not of Linnaeus.\n\nCommon in the Malay Peninsula and occurring in Bombay and Java.\n\n4. B. setidens Ridley. Bigelovia setidens Miq., Fl. Ind.

The fruits of the present species, not quite mature, are ellipsoid, when fresh 30 cm. long and 18 cm. in diameter, when dry about 20 cm. long and 10 to 12 cm. in diameter. The leaves attain a length of 50 cm. and a breadth of 25 cm. It may represent a distinct species, but more and complete material of both *Neesia synandra* Mast., and *N. altissima* Blume will be necessary to determine this point.\n\n*Boschia Korthals.*\n\n*Boschia griffithii* Mast. in Jour.

Dalenia, up to the present, has been represented by a single known species, D. pulchra Korth., of Borneo. The present species differs from the type of the genus, not only in its pubescence, the type being almost glabrous, but also in its floral characters. In fact, the staminal characters are so different in the present species from those of the type of the genus that D. pubescens might, with considerable propriety, be made the type of a distinct genus. In D. speciosa the stamens, while dissimilar, are all fertile, the larger ones bisetose anteriorly and calcarate posteriorly, the connectives of the smaller anthers bituberculate anteriorly and very shortly calcarate exteriorly. In the present species, the fertile stamens are merely supplied with 2 membranaceous, ovate scales anteriorly, and a single similar one exteriorly, while the sterile anthers are supplied dorsally with a very short scale, and ventrally by two lateral and one central thin, elongated appendages. In the size and shape of its leaves, in its habit, that is, the stems producing\nroots along the internodes, and in its calyptrate calyx, it is very similar to Korthals's species. The floral characters of the present have been worked out from nearly mature buds; they may be subject to slight modifications when open flowers are available.\n\n**Dissochaeta Blume.**\n\n**Dissochaeta ramosii** sp. nov. \u00a7 Diplostemones.\n\nFrutex scandens, partibus junioribus et inflorescentiis et subtus foliis ferrugineo-stellato-pubescentibus; foliis oppositis, ellipticis vel elliptico-ovatis, chartaceis, 9\u201412 cm. longis, supra glabris, nitidis, basi rotundatis, 5-nerviis, nervis marginalibus tenuibus, apice acuminatis; inflorescentiis axillaribus terminalibusque, cymosis, bracteis lineari-lanceolatis, 3 mm. longis; calyce 1.5 cm. longo, 1 cm. diametro, basi cuneato, lobis 4, brevibus, latissimis, rotundatis; petalis circiter 2 cm. longis; staminibus 8, filamentis 1.6 cm. longis, antheris majoribus 2.5 cm. longis, utrinque longe angustatis, setiformibus, 9 mm. longis, antheris appendiculatis minoribus sigmoideis.\n\nA scandent shrub, the branchlets, petioles, inflorescences, and the lower surface of the leaves rather densely ferruginous-stellate-pubescent.

Baboneau,\nWith an Introductory Note\nBy G. C. Woolley.\n\nThe following Murut Vocabulary was compiled by the late Mr. N. B. Baboneau, an Officer in the British North Borneo Service from February 1910 to December 1921, and was found amongst his papers after his death. The original is carefully typewritten, and has been revised, as there are numerous pencil additions and corrections in the text. I do not know, however, whether Mr. Baboneau considered that it was now as complete as he intended it to be. Probably not, for further research would doubtless reveal many native terms in place of the Malay or semi-Malay forms here given.\n\nThe only 'introduction' is a pencil note on the fly-leaf \"A Murut Vocabulary compiled with the help of various Keningau Muruts, intelligent and otherwise, between the years 1911 and 1914. N. B. B. Rundum 1914.\"\n\nThe name 'Murut' though now generally adopted and understood, was not originally used by the people themselves, but was given by Brunei Malay and other Coast people to the inhabitants of the hills and Interior of this part of the country. The 'Murut' districts are Keningau, Tenom and the greater part of Pensjangan or Rundum Districts of the Interior, the lower Padas and Bukau rivers in Beaufort District, and the greater part of Province Clarke, which includes the Lakutan and Mengabong rivers and head waters of the Padas.\n\nSo far as I am aware, no ethnologist has yet classified the various tribes in this area, but we can perhaps distinguish four main tribes, though the number of petty subdivisions, with small variations of dialect, is very large. A Murut, if asked his race, would probably not state to which main tribe he belonged, but would give his local subdivision, generally a geographical description, according to the river on which he or his people lived, e.g. that he was a Tomani or Siliu man, i.e. that he lived on the Tomani or Siliu river or that he was a 'Keningau Murut.'\n\nAs the country has got more peaceful under European Government, raiding has died out and intercourse has become more free, tribal boundaries have tended to become obscured, and probably dialectical variations of language have become less accentuated, but a general distribution of tribes can still be given.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nIn the Western hills of Keningau District are the Kwijaus, a semi-Dusun, semi-Murut tribe. On Keningau plain are the \u2018Dabai\u2019: in the East, in the upper Sook, are the Bokan tribes (probably closely related to Peluan).\n\nPeluan tribes are found in the Dalit and Mesopo and Karamatoi districts and the head-waters of the Telankai and Penawan rivers i.e. the S. E. part of Keningau and the N. of Pensiangan, with a sub-tribe called Belarun (\u201cBladun country\u201d on small maps) and from there across Tenom district to the Mengalong and Lakutan rivers of Province Clarke and the River Bukau of Beaufort. Timugun tribes are found in the northern part of Tenom plain, on the Pegalan river, and there are also few in Beaufort.\n\nThe Semambus are a more important branch, and stretch from the S. E. part of Pensiangan, (when they meet with the \u2018Sakais\u2019 of Dutch Borneo, related to the Tidongs of Bulongan) through the Tagul, Siliu, Rundum, Selalir, Telecosan and Tomani rivers, across the Padas to Bole; and perhaps to Lawas in Sarawak. At Bole, the people call themselves \u2018Tagals\u2019 and when I was District Officer Province Clarke I do not recollect hearing them use the name Semambu of themselves: their dialect however is similar, and a Policeman who has learnt \u2018Murut\u2019 at Bole is soon quite at home amongst Pensiangan people.\n\nBesides these, in Province Clarke, there were some settlements of people who called themselves \u2018Kolor\u2019 \u2018Okolor\u2019 \u2018Unkolor\u2019 and said they came from Dutch rivers south of the Selalir, and, in the extreme ulu Padas the \u2018Undaio\u2019 or \u2018Lundaio\u2019 (? = Ulun Daio, \u2018Dyak men\u2019) who were closely related to the \u2018Muruts\u2019 of the upper Limbang and Trusan rivers of Sarawak, and appeared to be very distinct in type and language, from either the \u2018Tagals\u2019 or \u2018Kolor.\u2019\n\nFor practical purposes therefore, I omit Kuijaus, as not being a pure race and the Lundaio, as being of Dyak kin, and classify our \u2018Muruts\u2019 as Dabai and Timugun on the plains, with Peluan and Semambu as Hill tribes.\n\nIn conclusion, it may be of interest to give a few illustrations of dialect variations. Several letters appear to be commonly interchanged, and these differences in pronunciation and spelling offer a considerable obstacle to any attempt to make a satisfactory or concise Murut-English Vocabulary. A Native, if questioned whether e.g. \u2018baguh\u2019 or \u2018waguh\u2019 is correct, will often say \u2018either will do.\u2019 though whether he means that each form is in use in one or other of the dialects or that your hearer would catch your meaning and excuse your ignorance of his language, is open to doubt.\n\nThe Keningau dialect, as given in this vocabulary, seems very fond of initial \u2018m\u2019 which is often absent in the ulu Padas (Semambu).\n(K = Keningau. T = Timugan. S = Semambu).\n\ne.g. cold K. 'mesimoh': S. asimoh.\nafraid K. 'mal\u00e2h': S. al\u00e2.\nbefore K. 'garing': T. galing.

Some common words are quite different, e.g. 'quickly' K. keribok, S. kapasiun: angry K. mangit, S. ambok: cloud K. dutoh or gaun, S. laput or gaun: Indian corn K. budit, S. sangun or dalai: long ago K. nakalaid, S. alair or awhoi: pig K. bawih, S. biag: skin K. kulit, S. kongkong.\n\nThe final 'K' in this vocabulary is nearly mute.\n\n(sd.)

Dayak tajok.\nThe Akuan or Spirit-Friends\n\nBy Zainul-Abidin bin Ahmad.\n\nThere are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\nThan are dreamt of in our philosophy.\n\nShakespeare's Hamlet.\n\nAkuan is the term generally in use among Negri Sembilan Malays to designate the Spirit-friends which certain individuals among them are believed to have from among the inhabitants of the spirit-world. Other terms are used in other parts of the Peninsula, and the belief varies with different states in matter of details. In this paper I am speaking of it as it obtains in the \"Nine States,\" particularly those portions of it inhabited by the descendants of the old M\u00e9nangkabau tribes. The persons credited with the possession of the spirit-friends are usually those having some pretension to the knowledge of a pawang, a diviner, or a medicine-man. They may be men or women, \"wizards\" or \"witches,\" but in either case they are almost always past middle-age. The word akuan is derived from aku, to own or to claim as one's own; while the thing owned is supposed to be a spirit which may either remain in its natural airy state\u2014a sort of Ariel to the Malay Prospero\u2014or may take the shape of the body of some animal, ordinarily a tiger, for its permanent residence. The \"owner\" may possess one or both of these two types. But if he is master of the first type, he is as a rule master also of the second. As for the first type, their \"owners\" are mostly men, and the number of akuan belonging to each owner is always more than one, ranging from three or four to a dozen or more. They may be male or female, but more often the latter if the owners are men. Their relationship to the owner is, without exception, that of old acquaintances rather than of intimate friends or of servants and master. Hence, they are less under control and never so devoted to the owner as the animal type. Some far-off locality is assigned to each of them as dwelling place\u2014such and such a mountain, rapid, kempas tree (Cumpassia malaccensis), ravine, plain or forest. The names by which they are mentioned are not proper names, but merely epithets descriptive of their sex and dwelling. They do not come unless ceremonially conjured in a solemn s\u00e9ance-like fashion. This is only done when their aid is imperatively needed on the occasion of very urgent sickness which has taxed all the wit and skill of the medicine-men to cure. Otherwise it is considered improper or even sacrilegious to mention them.\nThe method of conjuring them, which is more or less the same in main details for every \"owner,\" may probably be of some special interest to students of modern Spiritualism. A general description of it like the following which has been gathered from a number of villagers who have themselves seen the proceeding independently of each other at different places and times, may be obtained almost anywhere among the rustic population of Ulu Jempul, Kuala Jempul, Batu Kikir, Juasseh, Sungai Dua, S\u00e9ri M\u00e9nanti, Rembau, Jel\u00e9bu, Lengging, Beranang and other places. The ceremony is called B\u00e9r\u00e9jin (from Jinn, genii or demon) or B\u00e9rhantu, literally to call up spirits or to have spirit-meetings. It is always performed during the first part of the night at the patient's house, and occupies some three hours, say from 8 to 11 p.m. The function being one not often met with, the people within one mile and a half around regard it with great interest and come to attend in crowds.\n\nThe \"owner\" of the akuan plays the part of a medium, and someone, usually his wife or one of his closest lady-friends or pupils, takes up the r\u00f4le of an interpreter, as the medium will talk in some language unknown to the uninitiated audience. Before the meeting begins the preparations for it have to be got ready. This consists of b\u00e9rteh (toasted wet rice-in-the-husk), three or five or seven pots (p\u00e9r\u00e9ni or buyong) of water, betel-leaves and all their accompaniments arranged in the most ceremonial manner in a richly ornamented bujam, or p\u00e9rminangan. To all these are added new, rich little mats, spread specially for the expected spirit-guests, so that the scene presented \"is just like one when there is going to be a marriage ceremony\" (macham orang na' nikah). All the relatives and friends of the patient are informed and asked to be present, as the occasion will finally settle whether the sickness is curable or fatal. As the expected hour comes, the actor of the evening arrives. All is now solemn and silent. He takes his seat on the rich mat reserved for him near the other articles of preparation. He veils his face, and then recites some strange songs of invocation in a weird appealing tune, and in a language partly unintelligible. He begins to be unconscious as the trance state of mind gradually overmasters and takes possession of him. He shivers terribly while the smell and smoke of the burning incense (k\u00e9m\u00e9nyan) becomes suffocatingly diffused in the air. He may dash his hands and feet against the floor and his body against the wall. He may even rise, walk about the room, throw off his veil, disclose his flashing blood-shot eyes, sit upon the earthenware pots, snatch some of the red-hot cinders from the incense-urn (p\u00e9rasapan, p\u00e9baran or t\u00e9mpat bara) and chew them in his mouth\u2014all these without causing himself the least injury. The house shakes and the spectators are full of awe. As the medium grows more and more frantic in his movements and recitations, the spirits invoked come one by one. Sometimes only one of them turns up, the others excusing inability. If they are Moslems their greeting on arrival would be \"Assal\u00e1mu 'alai-kum\" communicated through the me-\ndium by the interpreter. Those of them who are not Moslems employ some other polite formula. At each arrival the interpreter introduces the guest to the audience\u2014as Dato\u2019 of this mountain or that mountain, etc. They are, of course, not visible but to the unconscious medium who, through the interpreter, most politely motions them each to their reserved seat. When all have arrived and seated themselves, one of them asks: \u201cWhat is it that you all want, friends, that you call us? We shall always be pleased to do you any little service that we can.\u201d These words are spoken by the medium to the interpreter in a strange language. On their being interpreted, the relative sitting closest to the patient speaks out, describing the patient\u2019s sickness, the length of the time he or she has suffered, the powerlessness of the medicine-men to cope with it, and asking for an explanation of the cause, the possibility of cure, and the treatment for such a cure. The interpreter communicates this to the medium who, as the embodiment of all the spirit-guests for the time being, replies after a few minutes\u2019 real or pretended meditation. The reply will be that the sickness was caused by such and such evil influence (k\u0113t\u0113guran or badi); malicious persons (di-buatkan orang) or whatever it may be, at such and such place and on such and such occasion: that such and such is the treatment for its cure. Or he might say: \u201cThis so-and-so\u2019s sickness is incurable. There is no hope. Be resigned.\u201d If many of the spirits are present, they all agree in the decision given. This done, they all leave; and after some half-an-hour\u2019s more exertion, the medium comes back to his senses, extremely exhausted. He will immediately quit the house without a word, and go home accompanied, it is alleged, by \u201chis\u201d mysterious tiger.\n\nOn the other hand, if the akuan is one that permanently assumes the form of an animal, it is to all appearance sexless. Even if it belongs to any particular sex, the distinction is regarded indifferently. As for number, never or very seldom more than one of such animal-akuan belong to any one master. But that one acts towards him more like a faithful attendant than a far-off friend. The animal is not known by any special name. Its dwelling place depends upon the nature of the animal whose form is adopted by the spirit. Mostly the form adopted is that of a tiger, and so it lives in the forest over which it is supposed to wander like all ordinary tigers. Its assistance is not invoked, as it is always ready to help when the need arises, provided such emergency occurs, so to speak, within its \u201csphere of influence,\u201d that is to say, where it can make its appearance consistently with its natural form. A tiger, for instance, cannot live in the water, but in the jungle or in the dark it can render services to the \u201cowner\u201d in many ways. When he loses his way in the forest, the tiger would come and lead him out by distinct marks and scratches on the ground. He has no cause to fear anything, as the spirit-beast is always close by, assuring him of assistance and protection by making familiar\nnoises. Those in the company of the \"owner\" at such times may feel justly frightened. The more courageous of them may be inclined to use their weapons. But the master of the akuan will keep on urging: \"Be reverent and silent. It is nothing. It is our protector. It need not cause any alarm, nor should any harm be done. There is no danger.\" And so on and so forth. What he says always turns out true, and never a mishap has been heard of, though the monster really does keep pace with them not many yards away. Besides these the tiger would do the master other services also. Such little courtesies as scaring away thieves and mischief-makers from his house are common-place examples. Popular belief goes even so far as to say that, in extraordinary cases, the \"owner\" even rides on the tiger when he goes out at night.\n\nI knew an old woman at Bukit Kerdas (Jempul) who died three years ago and who, besides having a reputation as a fairly successful medicine-woman, was believed to have akuan of both descriptions. The spirit type were seven in number, scattered all over the country, and the animal type was in the form of a tiger. Her husband from whom, it is said, she inherited these akuan as well as her art of medicine, had died many years previously. Many people believed that the husband turned into a tiger after his death (see \"The Tiger-Breed Families\" Journal 85, pp. 36-39) and that the tiger-akuan was no other than himself. The spirit-akuan were conjured many times. Once the old woman herself was seriously ill. In her illness she herself invoked their assistance, and she got better. But during her last illness nothing came, and she died. The tiger-akuan, on the other hand, used to accompany her when she went into the forest, or was going out at night. Besides, the animal always came to the rescue whenever she or any member of her family happened to fall into circumstances which made them wish for companionship and protection. Many curious incidents occurred as evidence of the animal's attention. One, quite romantic, was as follows: The old woman had a pretty daughter (who is still alive). As is usual with love-sick Malay swains, those who entertain a fancy for a girl, delight to go stealthily to the house of their lady-love at night to be able to steal fuller glimpses (mengintai) of her face and doings than they could ever do anywhere during the day. Now, in the present case, two lads were specially enamoured of the young lady. One night the two arranged to go to mengintai to the house. Many friends had warned them that the house was always guarded by the old woman's tiger. But partly impelled by the desire to test the report and more especially by mad love, they decided to act against the warning. When they reached the house and each had taken up a position to command the view through the chinks in the bamboo walls and floor, they succeeded in enjoying the coveted sight only for a few moments. On one of them turning round to relieve his strained neck and eyes, he found himself, to his unspeakable horror, face to face with a tiger, sitting about two yards from him and watching\napparently with great interest what he and his companion were doing. He pulled back his companion and the two had to beat a retreat as stealthily as they had come, and make the best of their way home, resolved never to try the experiment again in future.\n\nAnother one: On one occasion the old woman was spending a night at a friend's house about half-a-mile away, leaving only her daughters and grand-daughters at home. As they were sitting with their mat-plaiting and basket-work and chatting light-heartedly they heard the silent panting of an animal like a cow under the house. On turning their torches upon it to see what it was, they found it to be a tiger. So terrified were they that they put up wild screams for help till people came, and the tiger sneaked away into the darkness. (I can vouch for so much of the story as a fact, for I was one of those neighbours who heard the screams and went to help). The old lady came home and told them that the beast was only keeping them company and protecting the house. If they had harmed him, she told them, some terrible catastrophe would certainly befall the family. On another occasion, the old lady with three of her granddaughters went out menimba (i.e. fishing by baling dry the water of a shrinking pool and then catching the fish\u2014a favourite pastime in the village during the hottest part of the year) at a certain pool close by the road-side. When they had baled the pool dry and were beginning to secure the fish, one of the party saw two tigers crossing the road in their direction from the thick jungle on the other side. The grand-mother's attention was instantly called, and she, realising the danger, had no other alternative but to tell them to be quiet and calm. Suddenly from beneath the scrub, a few yards away between them and the two tigers, rose a third and bigger tiger. Without seeming to notice the panic-stricken youngsters, the beast walked right towards the advancing pair, and after persuading them, as it seemed, to turn to another direction, he marched away from the scene. The two followed suit. But the young girls could not regain control of their nerves, and their grand-mother had to hurry them home, taking only whatever fish they had caught and leaving the remainder without further search.\n\nIt may be added as a digression that the grave of the old lady's husband used to be regarded by many as an object of pious reverence. The chempaka trees (Michelia champaca) planted over it were overhung with strips of white cloth (panji-panji) as emblems of sanctity, and indications of the number of \"vows\" (niat) that had been paid there. I daresay they still continue to be so overhung at the present time. Credulous people have for long been attracted to \"make their vow\" by the grave. Incidentally, this practice may be described here in a few words: A person, for the fulfilment of some great prayer, \"makes a vow\" saying: \"If I recover from this illness\" or \"If a male baby be born to me\" (or whatever that desire is) \"I will cut two goats at so-and-so's grave and call people to eat there.\" If the prayer is granted he\ngoes there to execute his promise. He cuts (semb\u00e8leh) the promised goats or whatever it may be; cooks some saffroned-rice (nasi kunyit), invites people to eat, has prayers of thanksgiving (do'a selamat) read for him by some l\u00e8bai, (cf. Skeat, Malay Magic, p. 42), and fires some big crackers as expression of peace and joy. Thus he \"pays his vow,\" discharging himself of the binding promise he made to the spirit of the grave. If he fails to do so the spirit will appear to him in a dream demanding fulfilment, and in case of further default some untoward event is certain to follow.\n\nOne more story about the tiger-akuan will finish the matter. A man living in M\u00ebmpanas, an outlying corner of Kuala Pilah, on the right bank of the Muar River, told me that he once had a long illness. No effort of the medicine-men was spared to restore him to health, and yet he did not recover. But he had a tiger-akuan which, by the way, he is believed to have even now. During his delirium the animal appeared to him and told him that his affection had become chronic and that his only chance of life would be in having his body licked by it. On coming to himself, he told this to his people and asked to be exposed the following night in the open verandah without any light. This was done. The door was bolted and the people kept themselves inside breathlessly watching what was to happen. The tiger came, stripped him naked and began to lick all over his body, so that the \"lip-lap\" sound of its tongue was clearly heard. Then it went away leaving him drenched with its salivary fluid. Two days after, he was completely cured.\n\nThe akuan in the shape of any other animals than tiger is probably very rare. I have heard only of one single case, occurring in Juasseh, where a certain man is reported to have a crocodile-akuan, living in the river opposite his house. He feeds it, treats it kindly and at his call the animal comes up to the surface. He is even said to ride upon the animal's back when necessary. Nobody but he dares to bathe in that part of the river. The crocodile is always there. According to his own story, the spirit came to him in a dream asking to be \"owned\" and protected (b\u00e8la) in return for which it would look after the water-supply of his paddy-fields, bring him luck and protect him and his family from evil spirits. He accepted the offer and was told that he could always find the new friend in the shape of a crocodile in the river opposite his house. The next day he found this to be true, and thenceforward he has been the \"owner\" of the crocodile. The terms of agreement seem to have been faithfully adhered to by both. The man gathers in a good harvest every year,\u2014quite above the average,\u2014is always at ease and contented, and never gets ill, neither any member of his household. One striking fact about this case is that the \"owner\" is no medicine-man. The animal is not to be harmed, or all the benefits accruing from its friendship will be withdrawn, and some disaster threatened to the unfaithful \"owner.\" Before the animal came to this man it had offered it-\nself to a woman-neighbour of his. But on its commencing to stay in the river in front of her house, the woman's people disturbed it with sticks and fish-spears (tirok) so that the animal could not rest in peace. When it was leaving the place, the woman had a dream in which the spirit said to her, \"I (awak) desired to act to your profit, but it seems you do not care to have my service. You disturbed me. Now I don't want to have anything more to do with you. If you want my friendship again you must sacrifice one of your children to me.\" I do not know if any similar case occurs anywhere in the Peninsula.\n\nTo sum up; such are among the alleged phenomena purported to lend support to the numerous spirit-beliefs of the Malay peasantry. An upholder of the doctrine of Transmigration of Souls may possibly be tempted to suspect some connection between this akuan-belief and the doctrine. But apart from mere suspicion, there is nothing in the popular conception of it to show that its believers have even the barest idea of that theory. The \"owners\" themselves never have any such idea. But that the akuan may pass down as a legacy from parents to children or from a dead husband to a surviving wife appears to be a generally accepted possibility. With the introduction of modern ideas and surroundings the belief in akuan is gradually dying out among the younger generation of Malays. But among their old-fashioned elders of the purely conservative type, whose contact with this new influence has not gone to any extent beneath the surface, the grip of the belief and other kindred superstitions is still very strongly in evidence. However, it is remarkable that in matters of this kind, investigators can hardly have much data to go upon owing to the scarcity of \"actual cases.\" One must also allow for the Malay habit of exaggeration and their fondness for the marvellous and mysterious. The same applies to the wide-spread belief in polong, pontianak, penanggalan, pel\u00e9sit, etc., etc., which is now confined only to the most superstitious. The difference between the polong, pontianak, etc., and the akuan is that the former are malignant spirits, kept for inhuman purposes, (cf. Skeat, Malay Magic, pp. 327-331) while the latter are good and serviceable auxiliaries.\n\nThe Muhammadan religion, it is true, discountenances all such belief in the powers of the devils. Any recognition of a power, other than God, as a being superior to man is repugnant to it. But ignorance is as much a power as knowledge: where it exists the impossible becomes possible. The most opposite beliefs and doctrines can subsist side by side in two water-tight compartments in any raw and uncultivated mind. And so it is with the majority of the Malays. With all these they \"are among the most orthodox of Muhammadans.\"\nPoints of the Compass in Kedah.\n\nBy A. W. Hamilton.\n\nAmongst the inland Malays of Kedah more especially in those districts where the Siamese language is still prevalent the usual Malay terms for expressing the points of the compass (utara, s\u0113latan, timor, barat), are not in use except as designations for the direction of the wind and the seasons dependant on them (i.e. angin barat a west wind or musim timor the N. E. monsoon).\n\nThe current terms in use in daily life to express the relative positions of objects or the direction of a road, etc. are as under:\n\nNorth. Kaki tidor.\nSouth. K\u0113pala tidor.\nEast. Mata hari naik.\nWest. Mata hari jatoh.\n\nA man will thus describe his house as being sab\u0113lah k\u0113pala tidor or South of somebody else\u2019s abode; and if asked where he was sitting with reference to another person might reply \u201cdia dudok di sini, dan saya dudok di sab\u0113lah kaki tidor nya\u201d i.e. he was sitting here and I was sitting on the north side of him.\n\nThe expressions mata hari naik and mata hari jatoh are of course common to the whole peninsula and the sentence dia sudah p\u0113rgi seb\u0113lah mata hari naik. He has gone East would be understood anywhere.\n\nThe curious local expressions k\u0113pala tidor and kaki tidor appear to have arisen from the invariable orientation of Siamese houses which are built with their axis East and West, the entrance facing the rising sun.\n\nThe occupants when lying down for the night in their rather narrow dwellings are thus constrained to lie across the house with heads to the wall and feet to the centre so that all the heads in a village will be pointing one way, k\u0113pala tidor or South, and all the feet another, kaki tidor or North.\nThe Grave-Stone of Sultan Mansur Shah of Malacca.\n\nBy Zainul-Abidin bin Ahmad.\n\nThe following suggestions with reference to Mr. J. P. Moquette's scholarly paper on the above subject translated by Dr. Winstedt in J. R. A. S., S. B. No. 85 may not be out of place here:\n\n(a) That the word \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0648\u0645 which comes after \u0645\u0638\u0641\u0631\u0634\u0627\u0647 in Mr. Moquette's reading of Plate I be placed immediately before \u0645\u0638\u0641\u0631\u0634\u0627\u0647; firstly because that is the usual order (i.e. al-marh\u00e1m first and the name of the deceased following) when the expression is used, especially by the Malays; and secondly, seeing that the word \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 which lies directly above the word \u0645\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0631, (see third line in Plate I) is read before \u0645\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0631, it follows that the word \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0648\u0645 which lies also directly above the name \u0645\u0638\u0641\u0631\u0634\u0627\u0647 can also be read first. As far as I can judge from the plate, nothing seems to be there that makes it particularly necessary to violate usage and read \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0648\u0645 last.\n\n(b) That the reading of \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0644 (d\u00e1ri-'l-ma'al) be substituted in place of \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0644 (d\u00e1ri \u00e1m\u00e1l). For this I have several reasons:\n\n(1) \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0622\u0645\u0627\u0644 is not compatible, as far as rhythmic flow is concerned, with \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0644 with which it ought to correspond; because the latter (i.e. \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0644) has the article \u0622\u0644 and the former has not. From a grammatical stand-point there does not appear to be reason enough that \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0644 should have the article and \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0622\u0645\u0627\u0644\nshould not. But if, to avoid all this, we use \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652 and say \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0645\u0627\u0644\u060c\nthe clear-cut shape of the word in the inscription does not justify our doing so.\n\n(2) \u0622\u0645\u0627\u0644 is the plural of \u0623\u0645\u0644\u060c and the word \"hope\" which is given for the translation can only be suitable if the Arabic is in the singular form. Besides, \u0622\u0645\u0627\u0644 is pronounced with a long vowel on the first syllable, and thus spoil again any rhythmic agreement with \u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 of which the first syllable is short.\n\n(3) If the form \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0622\u0645\u0627\u0644 is substituted, the agreement in rhythm with \u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 is readily established, for the two would then be of the same form (noun of place) derived from roots of the same measure. The combination makes a perfect little rhymed-prose, with apparently punning sound\u2014a feature so commonly prominent in short Arabic maxims and pithy sayings\u2014such as would become any epitaph.\n\n(4) The meaning of \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0622\u0645\u0627\u0644 which is \"the abode of return\" or \"The Final Abode\" would just suit \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0622\u0645\u0627\u0644 which is the \"abode of change\" or \"The Transient Abode\".\n\n(5) In an inscription where, as in any monogram, the letters and different parts of the words are highly interwoven, it is not uncommon to find that one and the same stroke serves the double purpose of representing two letters of like appearance, or that two or more letters of more or less the same form become blended into one, or even die away in the meshes of loops and flourishes. In this light I think we are quite justified to assume that in the inscription the first \"l\" of the word \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0622\u0645\u0627\u0644 is partially blended in the final \"l\" of the same word. (See the first line of Plate II).\n\nNo doubt the changes suggested here are not of much consequence. Still I hope they make for some improvement on the reading so far deciphered.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nIt might be well also to call attention to the little misprints in spelling, which might be overlooked and might later lead to real mistakes:\n\n(a) The first \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 (as-sultan) in the reading of Plate I should be written \u0644\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 (lis-sultan) as we find it correctly written in the Romanised reading; and the word \u0645\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0628 should read \u0645\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0628.\n\n(b) The words \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0627\u0621 on page 3 should, I think, read \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0627\u0621.\n\n(c) The words \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0627 (lais a\u2019d-dunia.) in the reading of Plate III should read \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0627 (laisa li\u2019d-dunia).\n\nThat the \u201cn\u201d of \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 and the \u201cr\u201d of Mansur cannot be traced may indeed be due to the mistakes of the mason. So also may the absence of any dots or diacritical points (titek) from the inscription be accounted for. But it is quite possible also that both have their explanation in (b) above, or may have been worn out because of their smallness.\n\nOn any other matter regarding this subject, I am not able to form any independent idea; nor have any strong view to express beyond that, in my opinion, the reconstructions are really very ingenious, and the reading certainly much more acceptable than the one which used to be accepted before it.\nThe old Kedah-Patani Trade-route.\n\nBy A. W. Hamilton.\n\nA glance at the map will shew that the whole length of the boundary between Kedah and Siam from the Perak border to the Perlis frontier consists of irregular masses and chains of hills rising in places to a height of more than 3,000 feet.\n\nThe actual boundary is an imaginary line between certain fixed points on the crests of these hills following the watersheds so that all streams flowing westwards are within Kedah territory and those flowing to the east within the dominions of Siam.\n\nThe whole of this frontier region is covered with a thick forest growth which renders it almost impassable except in certain naturally favoured regions to the passage of human beings.\n\nIn the course of time man in his journeyings has discovered the easiest passages through this chain of hills and has gradually confined himself to certain definite tracks which usually follow the beds of streams until some suitable vantage point is reached for crossing the divide.\n\nFrom very early times it must have been known that the easiest and most direct trade route between the thriving Malay States of Patani and Kedah was through the defile known as Genting Pahat. The chiselled-out pass (Boundary Stone No. 34), and until the completion of the railway from Patani to Senggora and its continuation thence to Kedah this route was still in vogue for the droving of cattle and the passage of Patani field labourers to Kedah territory for the rice harvest.\n\nAs this route in its latter stages has seldom been traversed by Europeans and as the rapid development of road communication in Kedah may at any time bring it into prominence again a short description of the route as it was in June of this year may not be without interest.\n\nLeaving Alor Star in a motor car a short hour's run along a new and good road brings the traveller to Kuala Nerang twenty miles distant where the road ends on a bluff a hundred feet above the river and some two hundred yards below the confluence of the Padang Terap and Pedu streams. Kuala Nerang is a growing village and the headquarters of the whole district of Padang Terap which stretches as far as the Siamese frontier.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nCrossing the river at this point the route follows the right bank of the Padang T\u0113rap stream sometimes approaching within a stone\u2019s throw of the river and at others diverging from it to a depth of half a mile or more owing to the sinuous nature of its course. The country is open and roughly cultivated by Malays who have planted sporadic groves of coconut durian and other trees whilst themselves living near the banks of the main river and planting rice wherever the configuration of the ground admits.\n\nThe first kampong of any importance is B\u0113limbing after which at about the third mile a range of low hills called Bukit K\u0113pah is encountered which have to be skirted before emerging on the plain of Padang T\u0113rap which used to be the site of the headquarters of the district until they were moved to Kuala N\u0113rang some eight years ago.\n\nThe path now crosses the Sungei Sari a small shallow stream which descends from the region of the mines at Pintu Wang and touching the outskirts of the villages of Padang Ch\u0113n\u0113rai, Poka and P\u0113ring leads to the kampong of Padang Sanai where there is a Police Station on the banks of the river.\n\nThe distance from Kuala N\u0113rang to Padang Sanai is roughly ten miles and the traveller who wishes to do so may return from here to Kuala N\u0113rang by perahu being poled down stream in twice the time which it takes to walk.\n\nLeaving Padang Sanai the way at the end of a mile passes through the village of P\u0113ngkalan Pa Tanai where there is a Siamese wat of bamboo construction and then fording the main stream which is by now only a very clear burn running swiftly over a bed of shining black boulders and pebbles strikes for Kuala S\u0113raya where there is a moribund Quarantine Station with a solitary Malay in charge and an already defunct Police Station.\n\nThe distance of 3 miles between Padang Sanai and Kuala S\u0113raya consists of a stretch of flat open and almost park like land dotted with young trees of no great height, but after this the country becomes more thickly wooded and its surface is broken into ridges whilst the path follows the parent stream more closely and every now and then descends into it and emerges on the further bank only to cross the sector of a bend and dip into the stream again.\n\nAt Kuala S\u0113raya the stream divides the left hand branch proceeding N. W. to Kampong S\u0113raya 3 miles distant which is a large village of some sixty Malay houses, whilst the main stream continues on to Kampong Durian Burong which is at a like distance from Kuala S\u0113raya.\n\nBetween the Quarantine Station at Kuala S\u0113raya and the village of Durian Burong which is a Malay village of 20 houses standing pleasantly in rice fields and groves of coconut and betelnut\npalms there are no human habitations, and the country remains untouched except where it has been cleared at various times in patches for the cultivation of hill padi or maize.\n\nThe hills now begin to close in on either hand and form a rough wedge into the heart of which the traveller proceeds. Two miles after leaving the village of Durian Burong the path debouches into a little glade in the hills dotted with fruit trees which have run wild and having all the appearance of a deserted village.\n\nThis is indeed the case and the only name by which it survives in local memory is Kampong To Naidam Mok after an old Siamese of that name who last held the position of Naidam or official in charge of cattle quarantine and dues at that spot.\n\nThe track here branches into two that on the right leading through the Siamese district of Tiba to Patani whilst that on the left entering the jungle follows the rough course of what may still be termed the main stream for some two miles further to its source at Batu K\u00eblikir (Boundary Stone 31) where there is an imperceptible gravelly watershed leading into the Siamese district of Ch\u00ebnak whence there is an easy descent to the village of Ban P\u00ebk\u00f2p some two miles distant from the frontier and inhabited by Malays.\n\nThe path on the right winds round the shoulder of a hill for a mile and then enters the little village of P\u00ebrduan Sungkai situated near the banks of the Sungei Timun another small rivulet which comes down from the frontier and joins the stream from Batu K\u00eblikir a short distance below.\n\nThis little village of less than ten houses is the last outpost of Kedah territory in this region and is inhabited solely by Siamese who do not speak Malay and live by a little general cultivation of maize and hill rice though they also possess a series of diminutive rice fields.\n\nThe way now lies through the heart of the forest covered hills and follows the winding course of a boulder strewn stream the Sungai G\u00ebnting Pahat which mounts gradually.\n\nIn places the path actually follows the bed of the stream but generally a way has been found along the shoulders of the impending hills which hem it in when not too steep and consequently owing to the easy gradient and the absence of any stiff climbs the walking is comparatively simple.\n\nAt the end of two miles the stream continues its course along the hillside to the right whilst the path takes a sharp turn to the left and enters a narrow defile or cutting on the very crest of the hill through which can be seen the bright sky on the further side. It merges into the slopes of the hill on either hand.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\nThis cutting which is the actual Genting Pahat is some fifty yards long by ten feet deep and though only 3 feet broad at the bottom widens gradually from the height of a man's shoulders until it merges into the slopes of the hill on either hand; it is probably due to the action of two small streams rising on different sides of the watershed eating back gradually until their valleys have coalesced.\n\nThe walls of the cutting are composed of reddish earth plentifully mixed with small black pebbles and may have been shaped as the name appears to imply or merely be due to the wearing effects of traffic. In the centre of the cut is the boundary stone (No. 34) which divides Kedah from Siam and at the end of it in Siamese territory is the prostrate trunk of a giant Merbau which has defied decay for many a year and is regarded as a keramat whereon the suppliant or thankful passer by lays a stone of propitiation. The nearest village in Siamese territory on the further side of the border is Senaok some two miles distant whence the way is open to Patani.\nSome rhyming Sayings in Malay.\n\nBy A. W. Hamilton.\n\nFrom time to time the diligent listener and gleaner of unconsidered trifles will during his intercourse with Malays happen upon little scraps of proverbial lore or the rhyming equivalents for such which are part of the common stock in trade of conversation but are not to be found in any printed work on the language.\n\nOf such are the following which have been collected no further afield than in Singapore and Penang and in the localities where they are current it is only necessary to quote the first line to convey the meaning contained in the second.\n\n1.

Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 86 1922.\n5. Tua tua k\u0113ladi;\n   Makin tua makin jadi.\n   Old as an aroid tuber ages;\n   The older, the more there is of you (i.e. the worse you become) or\n   Tua tua l\u0113ngkuas;\n   Makin tua makin buas.\n   To age as a l\u0113ngkuas ages:\n   The older you are the wilder.\n\nA scathing remark sometimes addressed to a man who on account of his years ought to know better than to indulge in the frolics and pursuits of youth.\n\n6.

F. Hose.\n\nSince the last Journal passed into the press the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society has lost its senior member, the Right Reverend George Frederick Hose, who died at Normandy near Guildford, Surrey, on March the 26th. Born on September 3rd, 1838, he became Chaplain of Malacca in 1868, Archdeacon of Singapore in 1874, and Bishop of Singapore, Labuan and Sarawak in 1881. He retired in 1908. While Archdeacon of Singapore our Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society was founded by his efforts; and he was our first President. An account of his work in the East will be found in the 54th part of the Journal.\n\nHe was one of those who chose the Branch's name: but before his death he had given approval to the change whereby we become the Malayan Branch;\u2014a change which will take place with the first of next year, so that this Journal is the last that will appear under the familiar title. The series which it concludes may be dedicated appropriately to his memory.\n\nR. A.
