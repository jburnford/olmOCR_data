The supply of interesting material for the Journal has increased considerably during the last year as has the number of contributors. Some important Malay manuscripts have been obtained by Mr. Maxwell, and Mr. Laidlaw has been assiduously collecting Folk-lore tales of Malaya. Mr. Shelford's illustrated catalogue of Dyak personal ornaments formed volume 43 of the Journal. We have additional Folk tales of Borneo from Mr. Gomes, and papers on Malay lace making and basket making by Mrs. Bland, on the Perak Sakais by Mr. Cerruti, and other Ethnographical papers are being printed, Natural History papers have been furnished by Mr. Shelford, Cameron, Kloss, Hewitt, Robinson and Ridley. Illustrations from photographs supplied by the authors have been prepared by the firm of Carl Henschel and are a great improvement to the Journal. One of the old numbers (No. 25) being quite out of print was reprinted.\n\nDuring the year His Excellency Sir John Anderson kindly consented to become Patron of the Society and the following new members were elected,\n\nMRS.

GEORGE MAXWELL.\n\n\"The book of mantras* used in connexion with elephants; taken from the mantras of Tunku Mantri Ibrahim bin Jaffar, which are in the possession of Che Pandak Abdullah and committed to writing by Toh Sarif Aman; mantras which have come down from the Datohs Sri Adika Raja of Ulu Perak, Toh Kalaung and Toh Kalalang, to Toh Muda Abdulrauf and from him to the present day.\"\n\nWith these words ends a small Malay manuscript in my possession of which I have made the translation that follows.\n\nOf the persons mentioned I have not been able to discover much that throws any light on the original source of the mantras. Tunku Mantri Ibrahim is the well-known Mantri of Larut, who was banished to the Seychelles after the Perak War and who, in the days of his greatness, owned a large number of elephants. The present Tunku Mantri Muhammad Isa, the Magistrate in charge of Selama, is his son. Orang Kaya Kaya Sri Adika Raja is the title of the principal chief of the district lying in the upper reaches of the Perak river on the northern boundary between the Malay States under Siamese protection and Perak.\n\nTo the present Datoh Sri Adika Raja, Wan Muhammad Salleh, i.s.o., I am indebted for much assistance in the enquiries which I have made regarding these mantras.\n\nThe first glance at the mantras shows that, while a few are purely Malay, the majority of them are in a language which is not Malay, and that some are partly in one language and partly in the other. The two languages appear even to have\n\n---\n\n* The Malays have borrowed the Sanskrit word mantra, which denotes a charm or magical formula. I must apologise for its constant use in this article, but it is a word which cannot be adequately translated.\n\nJour. S. B. R. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nbeen mixed, or fused, for in some of the mantras which would appear to be non-Malay a great proportion of the words have Malay meanings. Of this, section nineteen contains an example. But this, as will be suggested below, is most probably only the result of the corruption of the sound of non-Malay words in the mouth of a Malay. In order to emphasize the difference between the non-Malay and the Malay words, the former are printed in capitals, and the latter in italics. [In the manuscript, which is in the Malay character, the writer has made use of the Arabic vowel marks in writing the non-Malay words.] Where there are any signs of corruption I have, wherever I have considered it useful, given the meaning of the Malay words. Each of the purely Malay mantras is followed by a translation.\n\nA perusal of this collection of mantras shows that not only is there a mixture of languages but that there is an extraordinary jumble of religions. Rama appears both in the Malay and the non-Malay mantras and is generally placed in antithesis to the Great Sages either of Hinduism or of Buddhism. The purely Malay mantras, which are only three in number, and confined to sections 4 and 5, are of general import only, with no particular reference to elephants. Of these mantras the second begins with Bi'smi-'llahi'r-rahmani'r-rahimi and the third ends with la-ilaha illa-lahMuhammad rasul Allah.\n\nThe Azazil, who is described in the first Malay mantra as a \"headman of the forests,\" is perhaps the Azazel of the sixteenth chapter of Leviticus, who is supposed to have been either a pre-Mosaic Devil or else a spirit of the deserts and wildernesses.*\n\n*\u201cThe scapegoat\u201d is the translation of the Revised Version of the Bible, but a marginal note states that the Hebrew word is Azazel. Substituting the word Azazel for the word scapegoat the passage is as follows.\n\n\"And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats, one lot for the Lord and the other for Azazel. And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the Lord\u2019s lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering. But the goat upon which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n\"The Samil of the first mantra is probably Samhail, of whom D'Herbelot has the following account:\n\n\"Samhail, nom d'un Ange qui gouverne le sixi\u00e8me ciel, selon les r\u00eaveries des Musulmans.\n\nThe last mantra calls on Betara Guru and Betara Kala who are identified with Vishnu and Shiva respectively * (The derivation of Betara being the Sanskrit avatara \"descent,\" according to Crawfurd, or according to Favre the Sanskrit battara, \"respectable\" \u00a7)\n\nIn so short a space it would be difficult to find more variety and confusion.\n\nAll the elephant owners and elephant drivers to whom I have spoken in Perak on the subject of the non-Malay mantras were more or less\u2014as they knew more or less of the elmu gajah\u2014\"the science of elephants\"\u2014familiar with the words of the mantras and with the medicines prescribed in the book, and one of them who was extremely interested in my enquiries into the asal elmu\u2014\"the source of the science,\"\u2014has recently presented me with another manuscript containing similar mantras.\n\nAll my informants admitted their entire ignorance of the meaning of the non-Malay words, and not one of them made the slightest attempt to suggest any interpretation\u2014They all agreed however in ascribing a Siamese origin to the mantras,\n\n* before the Lord to make atonement with him, and to let him go to Azazel in the wilderness \"\n\nD'Herbelot gives a different account of Azazel in his Biblioth\u00e8que Orientale. He writes as follows:\n\n\"Azazil, anges qui sont les plus proches du tr\u00f4ne de Dieu. On les joint ordinairement avec les Afrasils qui sont les Seraphins, et avec les Kerubiin ou Ch\u00e9rubins. Saadi fait mention des Azazil dans la pr\u00e9face de son Bostan : cependant il les comprend tous collectivement sous un nom singulier ; car il dit que lorsque Dieu distribue ses graces, Azazil dit, avec une profonde humilit\u00e9 : c'est de vous seul, Seigneur, que tout notre bonheur d\u00e9pend.\"\n\n* Crawfurd Malay Grammar p. excviii, and Skeat Malay Magic p. 85.\n\n\u00a7 Favre Dictionary II p. 255.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nand they unanimously attributed the whole of their knowledge of the capture, training and treatment of elephants to the Siamese.\n\nThat the Malays are correct in admitting their indebtedness to the Siamese for their knowledge of elephants is not however admitted by some authorities.\n\nCrawfurd was of opinion that the Malays obtained their knowledge from India. He writes \"the popular name for the 'elephant everywhere is the Sanskrit one, gajah * but as the 'animal is a denizen of the forests of the Peninsula and Sumatra, 'the probability is that this has arisen from the Hindus having 'instructed the natives in the art of taming it, a supposition 'corroborated by the fact that all the gear and trappings of the 'elephant with the name of the conductor are also Sanskrit.\" \u2020\n\nIn Maxwell's Manual of the Malay language, the rash concluding statement is considerably modified as follows.\n\n\"The elephant is most generally known over the Archipelago by its Sanskrit name gajah. Sanskrit terms are also used to signify the driver of an elephant and several articles used in connexion with the animal.\"\n\nThe following list\u2021 is given.\n\n| English          | Malay   | Sanskrit       |\n|------------------|---------|----------------|\n| Elephant         | Gajah   | gaja.          |\n| Elephant driver  | Gambala | gopala (herdsman). |\n| Goad             | Kosa    | anku\u00e7a.        |\n| Foot chain       | anduwan | andu (chain).  |\n| Front part of the head | Gomba | Kumbha.        |\n| Unbroken, vicious, musth | meta | mada.          |\n| Hobbles          | sengkela | \u00e7rinkhala (chain). |\n\n* Biram is used in many hikaiats instead of gajah. Its derivation is not given in any Malay dictionary in my possession.\n\n\u2020 Crawfurd Malay Grammar p. clxxviii. The italics are mine.\n\n\u2021 Another word might be added. Mengkuna, the Malay word for a tuskless male is obviously the Indian word Muckna.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n\"From these circumstances we may probably conclude, \"with Crawfurd, that the art of training and domesticating ele-\nphants was first learned by the Malays from natives of India.\n\"The words of command used by elephant-drivers in the Malay\nPeninsula appear, however, to be adapted mainly from the Sia-\nmese, and it is from this people that the Malays of the continent\nhave acquired much of their modern knowledge of the art of\ncapturing, subduing and training the elephant.\"*\n\nWith all the deference that is due to these two authorities,\nI suggest that the truth is possibly contained in a legend which\nis preserved in the thirteenth cherita of the Sejarah Malaya.\nThe story is as follows. \"The headman in charge of the ele-\nphants of Sultan Mansur, King of Malacca, was Sri Rama, a\nKshatriya by birth (asalnia shatria). [Incidentally we are told\nthat he was a drinker (peminum), and that always, when he\npresented himself before the (Muhammadan) King, arrack was\ngiven him to drink]. One day Kanchanchi, the elephant that\nthe king himself always mounted, escaped into the forest, and\nall Sri Rama's efforts to retake it were unavailing. Then Sri\nRama said \"there are, too, people in this country, who know\n(about elephants)\" (ada juga orang yang tahu didalam negri\nini),\u2020 and he reported the whole matter to the king. There-\nupon the king ordered enquiries to be made through Malacca\nto discover if by chance there was any one who knew the\nscience of elephants (elmu gajah). Now at this time the king\nof Malacca had as prisoner Maharaja Dewa Sura, the king of\nPahang, a country abounding in elephants, and it was reported\nto the king of Malacca that Maharaja Dewa Sura was deeply\nversed in the science of elephants (terlalu tahu elmu gajah). A\nmessage was sent to Maharaja Dewa Sura who undertook to\nrecapture the elephant on the condition that he was set free\nfrom the prison in which he was confined. He was accordingly\n\n* Maxwell. Manual of the Malay Language, p. 18.\n\n\u2020 With all due deference, I submit that Dr. Leyden by translating these words in the Malay Annals as \"there are people who are acquainted with the interior of this country\" has missed the whole point of the story:\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nreleased, and forthwith caught the elephant. Thereafter the king of Malacca ordered all the young men at his court to learn the science from Maharaja Dewa Sura; for it was the king's custom, whenever any person was very skilful regarding elephants or horses or in the use of weapons, to have the youth of his court taught by that person at the king's own personal expense.\n\nThe salient points in the story are that the headman of a Malay king's elephants was a Hindu of the warrior caste (who, at the present day, would perhaps have been known as Rama-sami); that he was aware of the existence in the country of a knowledge of the art of catching elephants, whereas apparently the Malay king was not aware of it; that in the king of a country on the east coast of the peninsula, far removed from the influence of India or Sumatra, was found a skilful exponent of the art; and finally that his art differed from that of the Hindu.\n\nIt is suggested that it is possible that the deductions which may be made from a purely legendary story may have some foundation in fact; that is to say, that, when the invasion of the Peninsula from Sumatra took place, the invading Malays brought with them a knowledge of the training of elephants derived from India, but that at the time of the invasion the inhabitants (whoever they may have been) had already a knowledge of the management of elephants.\n\nMy efforts to discover any Malay tradition regarding the early history of the art of elephant training were not successful. In answer to my questions, my Malay elephant driver friends were able to state regarding these mantras very little more than they were katurunan deripada siam \"descended from Siam.\" For as many generations as they could count they were convinced that the mantras had been in the hands of their Malay ancestors. They knew no tradition of siam elephant catchers or elephant trainers being in the country. They had no idea why the siam came into the country nor why they imparted their knowledge to the Malays. How, why or when they acquired their present knowledge they could not say, but of one thing they were certain and that was that it was katurunan deripada siam.\n\nJour, Straits Branch\nIt is well known that the Malays have the same tradition regarding the old mining shafts that are to be found in various localities throughout the Peninsula. Everywhere they are called *lumbong siam*. \"Siamese mines.\" In the gold area of Ulu Pahang I have even heard the word used as a verb with reference to land that had been so extensively pitted as to be practically worthless. *Tanah itu sudah siam* a Malay will say, meaning that the land has been worked out by a long-past generation of \"Siamese\".\n\nIt is, I believe, a generally accepted theory among scientists that these shafts are not really Siamese, but are the work either of the Indonesian race whose tools were the *batu lintar*, or else of the Mon-Khmer race who populated the southern part of Indo-China before the invasion of the Lao, or Thai, from the north. (As members of the society will remember, the affinity of the Mon-Khmer language with the dialects of the \"aboriginal\" tribes of the Malay Peninsula was pointed out by J. R. Logan* and elaborated by C. O. Blagden \u00a7) I was therefore anxious to learn whether the Malays ascribed the mantras and the mining shafts to the same period or to the same race of *orang siam*. But this connexion of ideas appeared to be new to them, and they could say nothing more definite than \"perhaps.\"\n\nAn examination of the mantras shows that they consist of more or less corrupt Siamese words, the uncouth sounds of the words probably having been considerably altered in the mouths of the Malays during the generations that the mantras have been in use. It is probable that though the mantras are now preserved in manuscripts their commitment to writing is only of recent date. For instance, the manuscript now translated is only twenty-six years old, and there is nothing to show whether it is a copy of an older manuscript or a collection of mantras committed to writing for the first time. Of what Colonel Yule termed Hobson Jobson words we probably have two excellent examples in sections 9\n\n---\n\n*Journal of the Indian Archipelago vol. IV. p. 345.\n\n\u2020 J. S. B. R. A. S.

Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nand 10. *Si Kambing Hutan* means in Malay \"the goat-antelope of the forest\" (the serow, naemorhaedus sumatranus). *Kumbang* is the generic Malay term for a beetle, and no particular species is known, so far as I am aware, as *Si Kumbang Hutan*, the forest beetle. And neither goat-antelope nor beetle can have any possible connexion with either mantra.\n\nA Siamese to whom I read over the mantras recognized the Siamese sounds and words in them, but every now and then a mantra or part of it would puzzle him and after trying various sounds and tones he would say that that was not Siamese.\n\nIf this is really the case, the question is whether the words are merely so corrupt as to be unintelligible, or whether they are in another language.\n\nThe text shows that the principal object of the mantras is to avert misfortune: they are defensive rather than aggressive. The terms used to denote the various kinds and degrees of misfortune require a word or two of comment. The general term is *pilak*, which, though it is not to be found in Malay dictionaries, is a fairly common, and, I believe, a purely Malay word.\n\n*Bahdi*, *genaling* and *jinggi* are practically synonymous terms for evil influences which the Malays believe to be brought into play by the death or capture of a wild animal. (An account of the Malay ideas on this subject, with a collection of mantras and a description of the driving out of the *bahdi* will be found in an article by the present writer in Blackwood's Magazine for October 1903). For *bahdi* a Sanskrit origin from *vadha*, killing, has been claimed.*\n\n*Genaling*, though now a Malay word in ordinary use, appears, with an antithetical form *gunaling* in the non-Malay mantras, and has perhaps a non-Malay origin. If its origin is Siamese, it must have become somewhat corrupted as there is no \"g\" in Siamese.\n\n*Rengab*, a word which appears frequently in the mantras and in the text, where the compound from *pe-ren gab* is more\n\n---\n\n* Maxwell. Manual of the Malay language p. 34.\ncommon, and which is used by Malay pawangs to denote a charm which extinguishes an enemy's power of inflicting an injury, is the Siamese word ra-ngab, an antidote.\n\nChang is the Siamese for an elephant and the meaning of the frequent expression Om rengab maha rengab chang rengab is therefore obvious.\n\nChengrai which also appears both in the text and in the mantras is used in Malay to mean any mishap or mischance, (with a curious special application to the rite of circumcision) is the Siamese word chang-rai, ill fortune or ill omen. (Both rengab and chengrai will be found in Wilkinson's Malay dictionary as Malay words.)\n\nChemahang is described in section 83 of the mantras as being in a language that is not Malay, and it is translated for the benefit of the reader. (Chemahang arti-nia bhasa malayu kena pilak gajah atau kena pilak kayu atau kena chengrai atau kena bahdi yang besar). I cannot find the word in my Siamese dictionary, but suggest that the Malay word jembalang, an evil influence, is a corruption of it or connected with it.\n\nThe first thing that is desired is a translation of the non-Malay mantras. It is not within my power to attempt such a translation. All that I have been able to do is to provide a literal translation of the Malay text and Malay mantras. Apart from the translation of the non-Malay mantras, we are confronted by many questions which demand answers.\n\nAre similar mantras in use among the Siamese?\n\nDo these mantras contain any element that is not Siamese?\n\nIf so, what is it, and is it possible that the Siamese lore is superimposed upon an older system?\n\nApart from the mantras, an examination and comparison of the Malay and Siamese systems of elephant catching and training may assist us in our enquiry, and for this purpose I have given in an appendix a brief account of the Malay system with a list of some of the technical terms used in connexion with the training-stocks and a list of the words of command. The first list was compiled by me in Perak and the second is copied\nfrom the one supplied by my father in the second number of the Notes and Queries of this society. It will be seen that the words of commend used in Perak differ from those in Kedah, and that they certainly are not Malay words.\n\nLastly, is there any similarity between the Malay and the Siamese system of the medical treatment of elephants? In an appendix I give a list of the plants mentioned in the Malay text, and Mr. H. N. Ridley has been kind enough to supply their scientific names with a brief description.\n\nIt will be noticed that many of the remedies are symbolical. The use of three or five limes, that grow on a single stem, mixed with the love grass, that clings to everything, is given in section 47 as a devise to make a wild male elephant remain with a herd of females. The medicine to prevent an elephant from swinging its tail is the rubbish that collects round posts that stand in a stream and shake to and fro with the force of the current. (section 57). To make an elephant return to its master's house of its own accord from the forest the remedy is to take the cooking place, ladder and threshold beam of an abandoned house and to give fragments of them to the elephant with its food (section 80). To make an elephant fat one remedy must be given during the full moon and while the elephant is standing in water above the swelling of its belly, and another remedy must be given when the moon is rising. (section 78).\n\nThe remedies include such extraordinary articles of diet for a herbivorous animal, as rhinoceros' navel (section 78), fish (78) prawns (75) and oxhide.\n\nThe use of arrack (section 62) is hardly orthodox perhaps among Muhammadans even as a medicament for an elephant, but the prescription in section 83 of water from a pig's wallow is most extraordinary, for it would be difficult to imagine anything more abhorrent to the average Malay.\n\nMany of the plants mentioned such as kunyit trus, lengkhas, jenjuang, galenggang, gandarusa, from part of the ordinary pharmacopeia of the Malays, but it will be interesting to know to what extent the remedies have been borrowed from, or are common to, Siam.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nA LITERAL TRANSLATION OF THE MANTRA GAJAH.\n\n(Note. In the mantras Malay words are printed in Italics, Non-Malay words in Capitals).\n\nThis is written to set forth the mantras used in connexion with elephants. If we intend to build an enclosure in which to catch elephants, or if we wish to look for a suitable site for such an enclosure, or to select the best place for the gate of the enclosure, or if we desire to snare an elephant either when confined in the enclosure or at large in the great forest, in all these cases it is necessary that we should know the teaching of learned men and the auguries and signs, and then perchance God Almighty may grant a safe and prosperous issue to our undertaking.\n\n1. If, when we inspect the proposed site for an elephant enclosure, we find many ant-hills in it or much earth that has been undermined by ants, that place is not a suitable one and much sickness will result if it is used. If there are two trees growing there so close together as to resemble stocks, or if two trees grow there interlocked, or if dead stump is there, the place is not a good one. It is not a good place if in it there are roots or jungle creepers twisted into inextricable knots, whether it be on the ground or above it. And it is a bad place if there is in it a hard wood tree of which part is dead and part alive.\n\n2. This deals with the selection of the site for the gate of the enclosure. If there are jungle creepers growing one on top of the other the place is not good, nor is it good if a white ants\u2019 hill or any large ant-hill is found in front of the gate or within the enclosure. It is not good if there is low lying flat ground in front of the gate or within the enclosure. If in front of the gate two branches of trees have joined and grown together or if the gate is overhung by interwoven creepers, the place is not good one for the purpose.\n\n3. This deals with the lore in connexion with cutting the wood for the post of the gate to the enclosure. When the first chip falls from the axe to the ground we look carefully to see whether the bark his uppermost or not. If it fall with the bark\nunderneath the wood will not do for the gate post, but if the bark be uppermost the wood is well suited.\n\n4. Now when we burn the candle in front of the smaller enclosure to learn the augury whether the elephants will be early or late to enter the enclosure we should look at the wick of the candle: if the wick bends in our direction, that is a sign of the guarantee of the success of our enterprise, and if it bends away from us it is a sign to the contrary. If the wick bends to the right it is a sign that we should take the task in hand further to the right, whether our intention be to make an elephant enclosure, to select a clearing for hill padi or to build a house. If the wick bends to the left, we should go to the left. But if the wick bends over in a ring so that the end meets the stem, we must not utilize the ground for any purpose; nor is it good if the wick burns with a double flame like the twin gravestones over a tomb. Nor is it good if the wick in burning becomes twisted. But if the wick burns upright and the flame rises straight, then the place is good one both for an elephant enclosure and for a dwelling place: and by the blessing of God our enterprise will be protected. And we shall obtain an advantage and freedom from danger if we repeat this charm when we light the candle.\n\n'HEI JEI SIK PAK KALAK JEISAK PREI SHARAPAN CHANGRAI SAHA MAIHIN KAKA NILU AH AH AH.'\n\nor we may use this charm.\n\nAs-salam aleikom\nHei sri chahia.\nJanganlah angkau berdusta.\nDan janganlah berbuat bohong kapada ku.\nAkulah bersipat dengan sipat tuan.\nAngkau bersipat dengan sipat hamba.\nTunjuklah alamat yang sabenarnia kapada ku.\nAku jadi deripada nur Allah\nAngkau jadi deripada thelmak Allah\nAku menanggong amanat Allah\nAngkau menanggong khianat Allah\nAkulah bersipat hu berkat Ilallahu\n\nJour.

I have the attribute of the blessed saying \"Allah is God.\"\n\n5. This deals with the opening up of forest that has never before been put to any use by man. It may be that we intend to make an elephant enclosure, or to dig a ditch, or to cut a water course for a mine, or to dig a hole for the posts of a house, or to dig a hole for the gate posts of an elephant enclosure, or to put up its fence: in all these and similar cases we must avail ourselves of all the auguries and lore in connexion with the matter and then perchance the blessing of God may attend our enterprise and give it a successful issue.\n\nWe first apply to the penghulus [headmen] who hold sway over the forest, and this is our petition.\n\nBi'smi-'llahi'r-rahmani'r-rahimi.\nHei Azazil dan Samil Akbar.\nAngkau hukomkan seklian anak chuchu chichit mu.\nJangan angkau bri mengaru-ngaru menyakiti MARANA JANAI aku,\nDan anak buah aku,\nDan anak istri-ku,\nDan rumah tangga-ku,\nDan segala tanaman-ku,\nDan segala kahidopan-ku,\nDan segala kerja buat-ku,\nDan segala kampong laman-ku\nAku berdiri dengan firman Allah Takla.\nAku berkata kahandak Allah Taala.\nBerkat ya hu hak.\n\n[In the name of Allah the merciful and compassionate.

I stand here with the command of Allah Taala, I speak the will of Allah Taala. By the blessing of Ya Hu Hak.]\n\nAnd when we have said the above we say the following words.\n\nHei Betara Guru, Betara Kala,\nAngkau hukomkan segala raiat mu,\nJin dan bota, segala iblis,\nSegala jemalang dan segala pilak dan bahdi,\nSegala hantu sheitan dan segala iblis,\nAku minta hukomkan kepada mu,\nJangan angkau bri mengaru-ngaru menyakit-nyakitiku,\nDan anak istri-ku,\nDan segala hamba sahaia-ku,\nDan segala kakidopan-ku,\nSeklian SAKI BEGAI ku.\nJangan angkau bri segala raiat mu mengaru-ngaru dan merenchanaai.\nAku pun saorang hamba Allah,\nAngkau pun saorang hamba Allah,\nMari-luh kita bersahabat.\nDan ber kasihkasihan dengan-ku.\nDan aku duduk didalam afaatillah,\nAngkau duduk didalam murka Allah,\nBerkat lailahailallah,\nMuhammad rasul Allah.\nYa Hu Hak.\n\n[Oh Betara Guru, Betara Kala, do ye order all your servants, the jins, the bhuts, all the devils all the powers of mischief all the spirits of Satan and all his devils.

I dwell in the handiwork of Allah: you dwell in the wrath of\nAllah. By the blessing of the saying \"there is no God but Allah, Muhammad is the prophet of Allah.\" Ya Hu Hak.\n\n6. This deals with the driving away of forest spirits. We can either drive them away or order them to stand aloof. Whenever we enter upon any enterprise in the great forest or begin to build the larger or smaller elephant enclosure we must repeat the following mantra.\n\nOm Kilai Maiyut Kachari Kachari Kilai Dak\nKilai dan terbang Kachang ka kalan sah pindah\nturun Ka Wai Hantu Kamat Kamaia Nyamisan Changrai\nMaiyu Katuawai [Fly to the right: without fail leave your place and descend].*\n\n7. This deals with the forest spirits. We either order them away or command them to stand aloof when we are driving the elephants into either the larger or the smaller enclosure. We first repeat the mantra; then we blow with our mouths to right and to left, and then we set off to drive the elephants. This is the mantra.\n\nOm Barah Barai Patari Panarai Pata Buna Raamiatin soh pindah ku turun Lawi Maraatangon Kamai\nKamayal. [Without fail leave your place and descend].\n\n8. This is the mantra to use when we invade the forest, and it can be used over the kunyit trus \u00a7 that we give to the men as they enter the forest to drive the elephants or it can be used when we ourselves enter the forest.\n\nOm Bik Bik Bang Bangtu Bangru Bangti Pada Bang\nKumai Maya Om Rengab Sarapa Rengab.\n\nIt is used for the big elephants as a perengab. \u2020 Another mantra that has the same effect is the following.\n\n* As is already explained, the words in brackets are a translation of the Malay words only of the mantra.\n\n\u2020 A perengab, or rengab charm is one which extinguishes an enemy's power of inflicting an injury.\n\n\u00a7 For kunyit trus, and other plants see the appendix.\n\nR.A.Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nMANTRA GAJAH.\n\nOm kanching kandai ron pitai naka nara ru pipat chamdi rom ti' paman dapun sarapa rengab.\n\n9. The name of this mantra is Si Kambing Hutan, and we use it when we are about to enter the great forest, or to clear the boundary lines for either the larger or the smaller enclosure.\n\nIt is as follows.\n\nOm bangchong bangdi bangru bang tipat bang kamud kamaya om sarp bang sidikan guru ambub ati-yah.\n\n10. The use of this mantra is to drive away the spirits when we are about to enter the forest, and the name of it is Si Kumbang Hutan.\n\nOm bik bangtu bangdi bangui pada bang kamut maya om rengab sarapa rengab puah kakiri puah kakanaan [turn aside to right and to left.]\n\n11. This is a perabun* charm for elephants. We repeat it when about to enter the forest, whatever be our work, and no misfortune will befal us.\n\nOn genaling pachanaru pachanari serbang kom bangkak taka banting laipat puchupai bang kom bang kumaya.\n\nturun kau pindah kahutan yang pana puah karab turun kapadang yang mahalua karimba yang maha besar salah ka kanan ku salah ka kiri ku puah.\n\n[Descend, move away to the boundless forest, in silence descend to the wide plain, to the vast forest; you are wrong if you turn to right or to left. Avaunt].\n\n12. This is a perabun charm which we use when we are seeking a solitary elephant, or when we enter the forest to drive a herd into an enclosure, or when we wish to drive away the forest spirits. It keeps us from all misfortune and mischievous influences in every enterprise in the forest.\n\n*A perabun charm is one which dulls the senses of an opponent and makes him unaware of our presence.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nMANTRA GAJAH.\n\nOm genaling panchanarai serbangkom bangkak taka banting laipat pachupai bankom bangti komling kumaya turun kau pindah kahutan yang pana puah karab turun kapadang yang maha luas karimba yang maha besar (practically the same as No. 11).\n\n13. This is the mantra we use when about to drive the herd either into the large or the smaller enclosure. We repeat it over the kunyit trus which we then sprinkle in the direction taken by the herd; and then with our mouths we blow in the direction of the gate of the enclosure.\n\nOm kundang ding kundang sai talaung teguling di pantai rambut tegulong di hadapan ku tiba kanan tibalun kiri ku sikab piah nitik mu hei chang.\n\nAku tahu asal mu menjadi,\nDeripada markubulikam mulia.\nKau turut kata ku,\nJikalau kau ta'turut kata ku,\nMati di bunoh Sri Rama,\nJikalau kau turut kata ku,\nDi hidopi maha Rishi.\nKaluh!

If you do not obey, you will be killed by Sri Rama; if you obey, you will be kept alive by the Maha Rishi.\n\nKaluh! Kaluh! Kaluh!]\n\n14. This is a perabun charm for elephants, and we repeat it whenever we enter the great forest or any virgin forest that has never been trodden by man. It is an invocation to drive the forest spirits away from the elephants.\n\nOm genaling pachanarai serbang kom bangkak taka banting laipat pachupai bankom bangkumaya turun kau pindah kahutan yang pana puah karab turun kapadang yang mahalua karimba yang mahabesar.\n\n(practically the same as in No. 11).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\n15. This mantra is called the King of the Elephants.\n\nWe go to some high land and make a hole in the ground by turning round on our heel, and we take the earth which we have thus worked out of the hole and over it we repeat the mantra three times in a single breath. We next put the piece of earth upon the crown of our head; then we put it down on the ground in front of us, and again we put our heel upon it, and turn round on it three times repeating the same mantra three times again in a single breath.\n\nThe use of it is to stop the herd and to prevent it from going far.\n\nOM PAWPANG MAHA PANG PIT OM TAW SAHOM SITIKON TANA SAHOM.\n\n16. This is to keep the herd fixed in one place and to prevent it from going far. The meaning of it is \"in chains.\"\n\nOM BANG CHANG BANGDI BANGTU BANGRU BANGTI PADA KAMU KAMAYA OM BANG SARAPA BANG AH AH AH.\n\n17. This mantra will restrain the elephants, and prevent them from going far. We break a stick into eight pieces, or we break it into many pieces, as we walk round the place where the herd is feeding or resting; and as we thus surround the herd we repeat the mantra.\n\nPANTANG POK CHAKAI TAMANG POK CHAKAI SANGKANG PAK CHAKAI.\n\n18. This mantra is used when the elephants have entered either the larger or the smaller enclosure. It is repeated over the kunyit trus, which the bomo* then either himself sprinkles all round the enclosure or gives to the men to sprinkle. While this sprinkling is being performed one must not cross the enclosure.\n\nIKRIMIN PUNI CHI CHANARAK.\n\n* The bomo is the man in charge of the operations. He is selected for his knowledge of the mantras and of the rites, and for his experience. He generally has some pupils under him who are known as the lesser bemos.\n19. This is the mantra we use when we arrange the noose to prevent it from afterwards slipping from an elephant's foreleg.\n\nOm Kaw Kata Changramai Ku Ikat Pekarang Ku Serta Pegang Kau Perang Lengan Tangan Kita Serta Kanchubkan Kaki Kita.*\n\n20. When we are about to noose a big elephant, and are putting the noose in position, and spreading it out, we pay our respect to Nabi Noh, \u2020 and ask for permission to use the tree to tether a raial of Nabi Sleman. When the noose is spread we sprinkle it with kunyit trus, and then draw the slip knot, and after that has been done we repeat this mantra. It is a rengab.\n\nOm Bat Ku Chabat Diradai Bawbangkat Chang PaJa Nak Karai Om Maha Risi Bu Katarak Tan Para Kamtu.\n\nAnd again we sprinkle the kunyit trus.\n\n21. This is a perabun which we use when about to snare an elephant in the enclosure, or about to snare a very cunning elephant in the forest.\n\nWe repeat it when we have spead the noose, or we may repeat it over the kunyit trus which we may then sprinkle upon the noose.\n\nOm Genaling Bating Tamdit Batkaling Salik Santom Om Kamin Palai Rang Ha Tamku Limapaina Karku Lasantom.\n\nThis is an alternative form.\n\nOm Chaw Taw Palai Rangka Tamku Limapaina Kailim Parak NAK Tawta Wanta.\n\n* Many of the words of this mantra are Malay, though they do not form a sentence. Their general sense is \"tie, hold our hand (or foreleg) and fasten up our leg.\"\n\n\u2020 Nabi Noh (the patriarch Noah) is supposed by the Malays to be in charge of all trees and plants. All animals are under Nabi Sleman (King Solomon).\n\nR.A.Soc., No. 45, 1906.\n22. This is the mantra to use when we are about to snare an elephant in the forest or in the enclosure. We use it because we are letting loose the forest spirits, and we repeat it when we set the noose.\n\nOM KANCHING KANDAI KAI PITAI LAKAROM KAU CHAKAN TANGLAK KON LANGKA PARBU MUHA PURSIDI KAU GURU AMBU YATI.\n\n23. This is a mantra which the lesser bemos use when they intend to noose an elephant inside the enclosure. If the chief bomo is present he repeats it and the lesser bemos say it after him; if he is not present they repeat it without him. It sets them free from all powers that bring misfortune and mischief.\n\nOM GENALING CHAP CHAP GUNALING RENGAB GUNALING OM CHAP GUNALING SAH SUHAI.\n\n24. This is a perabun for a cunning elephant that is suspicious of the noose that we have set for it, and that refuses to go near it. We repeat the mantra over some dainty such as sugar cane or plantain which we put in a place where he will see it and eat it.\n\nPARDOM BANGKOM SUHAI.\n\n25. In order to set a big elephant* free from all evil influences when we take it out of the smaller enclosure we repeat this mantra over some kunyit trus, which we sprinkle over the elephant from in front.\n\nOM GUNALING PARIH PAMPARIT PAI PANA BARASIN MARONG SALIK SAMSATOM SARPATOM PARPAI TATBON TINGTAI PAT KAUCHAT PI HAI HAKATITOM BANGTOM turunlah pindah kau kahutan pana puah karimba turun kau kapadang yang mahalunas karimba yang maha besar puah rengab. (practically the same as in No. 11.)\n\n26. This is what happens when the chief bomo makes a feast. We make every kind of sweetmeat and sweet thing,\n\n* The bigger the elephant the stronger its attendant influences of misfortune and mischief.\nand gather together all the men who are working in the enclosure, and we all eat together at the gate of the enclosure. We make a prayer that all harm may be averted from us, after that we repeat this mantra three times at the gate of the enclosure.\n\nPAWBOB YABOB KINDI JUDI TANGPCNG NGAI MALAB MIA JI CHANAK PASTA TARU CHAIKOL CHAKUKAING.\n\nThis is an alternative form:\n\nOM PUAN OM NYAMIDAK MIDANG MIDAK TIKALANG SATAYANG CHADIN KARAI PAROK PANGALOK TAWMU CHAK KAUCHAK TOM.\n\n27. This is what happens either when the chief bomo or the subordinate bomas make a feast. The feast can be made either at the gate of the enclosure or in the middle of the enclosure. We invite our friends and feast; and we supply the following materials bras kunyit (uncooked rice dyed with turmeric) and bras basah (washed uncooked rice) and nasi pulut (cooked rice of a glutinous kind, *oryza sativa*), every kind of sweetmeat, a fish, a little gold and a white cloth. We place these things either at the gate of the enclosure or in the middle of the enclosure, and we breathe (*jampi*) over them the following mantra.\n\nPARPOM CHANTI RANG TURUN DISITU KARONG PALI PARPAI CHAUPANANG BINGKALA KIN LIYURAK SAMA-HALAB MAHACHAI KAIKU ISON RAKAI TANGNAU SUKUN LYU KAULAB KAU KHAN KAIKU KAIKU KAIKU AH AH AH.\n\n28. This is the mantra we use to ask the spirits for the elephant when we are about to put it in the stocks, where it is kept while being taught the words of command.\n\nOM BAWK KAU NAK KAU NAI RENGAB PATSUWAT PATSUWAT PATSUWAT.\n\nThen straightway we strike the elephant three times with the goad, and the elephant will scream when we do it. Thereupon the elephant will cease to be disobedient, and will obey us.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\n29. This is a mantra to expel the spirits of the renat [the flooring of the stocks]. When the flooring has been made, and we are ready to put the elephant in the stocks, we sprinkle the flooring with kunyit trus and sweep it with the leaves of chandarwal and salanchang.\n\nOM BARANG BARAT PIKAT PIKAU CHANG RAMBIN PARAI sah pindah kuu turun lari hantu rimba puah rengab. [move from hence, flee away down, spirits of the forest.]\n\n30. This is the chief of all the mantras used for elephants. We use it in all undertakings and it is the first that we repeat. We can especially use it when we are ready to put an elephant in the stocks, or wish to take the goad to an elephant that has been taken out of the stocks. In the latter case, sitting on the elephant's neck we strike it with the goad, and then throw the goad away behind the elephant. Another man picks it up, and takes it and shows it to the elephant. This is done three times, and each time we repeat the mantra.\n\nOM GENALING GENALI GENALING NUKTING GENALING NUKTAI KOT KOT TAKONG KALA GUMLUT KOT GENALING TAKONG KALA OM SINGKU PASING CHANGRAI OM SAH KUPASAH CHANGRAI ARAH ARAH TARONG PRATINJAU BALI TURUN BERTANTI SALAH DIBATANG TUBOH KU WI MITARAU KAUMILUH SIDIKAN GURU BATIA PARAKAU HEI GALUH AH AH AH.\n\n31. The name of this mantra is the King of the Bomos. We use for an elephant with a sore head or fever or pain in its stomach. The signs of fever in an elephant are firstly that a quantity of steam rises from its head after we have bathed it, and secondly that its head is very hot.\n\nWe may also use the mantra when we take an elephant out from the smaller enclosure: in that case, we sprinkle some water on the elephant's head after repeating it.\n\nOM PATA BURA MAISAN KAU CHA NGAU ANGKAT MATANG PIN PINDAH AU KAU KOKLAK MATA CHANGRAI CHANGRAI KACHAT PI TOKPAMIN KUMI PAILU SARAPA CHANGRAI CHANGRAI KAU MIMAN TARA\n\nJour.

If an elephant is sick or has fever this is the mantra which we repeat over the water with which we wash it. We may also repeat it over kunyit trus which we squirt from our mouths over the elephant. We do this for three or four mornings or evenings.\n\nOM PAPARU PAPARAI PANARI PANARAI MAHASA MAHASA KUNTA PARAH SRI RAMA PARIT TARANG SITIKAN U MAHA RASI RASI YAKTAMA RAHI PARAI AURAB AWAI DAI MUONG SARAPA ANGKAU PERONGKAN SAKANG SAKOM SARAPA RENGAB SITIKAN GURU MU BATIA.\n\nThis is another mantra.\n\nOM GENALING GENALING PARAH POM PARAPAI TATBAN YANG KOI PAT KACHAT AI CHAKAT TOM BANGTOM.\n\nturun kau pindah kau kahutan pana puah turun kau kapadang yang maha luas karimba yang mahabesar.\n\n[practically the same as in No. 11.]\n\n33. This mantra is used with unfailing effect to expel all evil influences from a big elephant. It is repeated over kunyit trus which is then sprinkled over the elephant.\n\nOM GENALING TING CHANDAPA GENALING ANTING KEMALUT BITI BITI GENALING YAKUT YANATA YAPA PAROM PARNANG GENALING WAI SITIKAN GURU MU BATIA OM RENGAB.\n\n34. To drive away the forest spirits from the little baby elephants we use this mantra.\n\nOM PANIRANG PANARAK maka jauh angkau pindah kahutan pana puah karimba yang maha besar turun kau kapadang\nyang mahaluas. [practically the same as in No. 11.]\n\nSIDIKAN GURU KAU OM BAK BATIA.\n\nThis is another.\n\nOm chawi chawat chawi chameat mada choh kau pindah kahutan pana puah karimba bahana turun kapa-\njang yang mahaluas turun karimba yang mahabesar.\n[practically the same as in No: 11] KAMAI MAIA.\n\n35. This is a perengab charm for a big elephant. We may either repeat it over kunyit trus which we sprinkle over the animal or over chandarwal leaves with which we then brush it. If the evil influences are strong we sweep the elephant with a black cloth instead of with the leaves.\n\nOm rengab maharengab chang rengab undai reng-\nab pitii piat yakarom rengab rakanglang karahai\nrengab padapai man pong om rengab maharengab.\n\n36.

When an elephant has been in the stocks for three days and we take it out for the first time and bring it down to the water to drink and bathe, we should repeat this mantra.\n\nOm genaling tang chandap genaling ating kama-\nlut genaling yakot yanata bana parom paranang\nwai sidikan guru mu batia rengab.\n\nJour.

This is a mantra to ward off evil influences from an elephant when we are taking it back to the stocks after bathing it.\n\nOm Yang Chang Bangdi Bangtu Bangru Bangti Pada Bang Kamu Kumaia Om Bang Sarapa Bang Om Rengab Chang Rengab Dai Rengab Pitai Yakar Om Rengab Rakanglang Karami Rengab Pada Paiaman Pong Om Rengab Maha Rengab.\n\n39. This is a mantra which we repeat when we mount the elephant.\n\nOm Pang Pahamlok Palai Pechah Galong Om Dik Maman.\n\n40. This sets forth our powers when we are about to entice a solitary wild elephant into a noose by making it follow our tame elephants. If the wild elephant will not follow our animals, we repeat this mantra and then hurl some clods of earth at him.\n\nMatapu Chumkan Midon Yoh Kayu Umbi Kawan Chamkan Lamang Manu Ra Ambi Kayu Ambi Kawan Tangwan Tangwan Pirak Dut Pirak Situn Duraja Chamkan Lantangun Ra Ambi Kawan Tangwan Tangwan.\n\n41. This is the mantra we use when we beckon onwards a solitary wild elephant that will not follow our decoy elephant. We take some *chamar* leaves and repeat the mantra over them.\n\nMatapu Chumkan Lion Nakchong Abia Kasi' An Amia Kon Chomkan Lion Tangkon Parik Dos Parik Siton Dunang Makaru Tangkon.\n\nAnother way is to repeat the mantra over three lumps of earth which we then throw at the elephant.\n\n42. This is the *perabun* charm that we use when we wish to catch a herd of tame loose elephants in the forest and find that a male wild elephant is with them. We walk round the herd either once or three times repeating the mantra.\n\nOm Pau Pang Maha Pang Pit Om Tau Tau Siti Kar-Tana Sahom Om Sauhom.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nAs we finish these words we close our eyes.\n\n43. If we go in amongst a herd of tame loose elephants and find a male wild elephant among them we repeat this mantra.\n\n\\[\n\\text{OM WI CHIT TRAWI KAM BARA AU LA SIPOH SUHOM DAI BANG BENG KOMBANG TIPADA SAM KOM AH AH AH.}\n\\]\n\n44. This mantra will forcibly detain a rogue elephant that is chasing us: we repeat it three times in one breath.\n\n\\[\n\\text{TOT PARTOT KANCHANG KANDAI KON PITAI TOT HAI.}\n\\]\n\n45. This is a \\textit{perabun} charm which we use when we decoy a solitary wild elephant; with closed eyes we repeat it three times over a leaf and then thrust the leaf behind our left ear.\n\n\\[\n\\text{OM NAK KAMBANG BUKAMBANG THALABYU CHANG HAI PAI.}\n\\]\n\nAnother general form of \\textit{perabun} charm for elephants is this. We repeat it over two leaves or over three leaves and then thrust the leaves behind our left ear.\n\n\\[\n\\text{OM NANG KAMBANG BUKAMBANG THALABYU CHANG HAI PAI}\n\\]\n\n46. When we wish to mount an elephant in a herd of tame elephants we repeat this mantra whether there is male wild elephant among the herd or not.\n\n\\[\n\\text{OM PANG PAHAMLAK PALAI PACHAH KALONG DIK MIMA.}\n\\]\n\n47. When a solitary wild elephant has joined our herd of decoy female elephants we use a mantra to prevent him from afterwards leaving them. We take three limes that grow on a single stem or better still five limes growing one single stem (if these cannot be obtained, two limes growing on a single stem will do), and we pick out the love-grass that has caught in our sarongs. We mix the two together and rub them over our female elephants. We also sprinkle betel-leaf and betel nut over their foreheads. Over the various ingredients mentioned we repeat this charm.\n\n\\[\n\\text{OM MA BANAK NIK MAKU AW MAK TIK MAK MAKARAN MANINGKAL KAK KAN TIK.}\n\\]\n48. This is a mantra to prevent a solitary wild elephant from fidgetting and disturbing a herd of tame elephants. We repeat it as we walk round the herd, which we do either once or three times.\n\n\\[\n\\text{OM KASAK KUA TARAK HAK CHAN JINSA NAK SILAK SATAHA TIHAK WI SARA WIKAK WI TRAWA PUTAI YA ATI YAN NIK MAKURI NACHUNG TANGU KAPURUNTA SARA MAMA WI SARA WIKAKH WIPARU PURAK BINAT SIAN TIK bulan naik jangan butan turun ikut turut kata Sri Rama.}\n\\]\n\n[let the moon rise, let it not set: obey the word of Sri Rama.]\n\n49. This is a mantra to make a solitary wild elephant, or a herd of wild elephants, stay in one place.\n\n\\[\n\\text{TOT SAPAR TOT CHANGLIUM CHANGKAN CHANG SAMA KU DHANGTANG PARPIT SITI KAN GURU BATIK PARAHAII KALU AH TOT.}\n\\]\n\n50. This is a mantra to beckon onward a solitary wild elephant. We repeat it over a \\textit{chamar} leaf and then beckon to the elephant with the leaf three times. As we beckon we must not look behind us.\n\n\\[\n\\text{MATAPU CHOM KAN LION TANGKUAN PARAK DUN-ANG MAKARU TANGKUAN TANGKUAN TANGKUAN.}\n\\]\n\n51. When an elephant has been caught in our noose, this is a mantra to make it stupid, and to prevent it from inserting its tusks into the slip knot and working the noose open.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hei tunggal terkatup tertutup terkanching angkau disuroh Sri Rama. Ah! Ah! Ah! [Hei! solitary one! thou art closed up, shut up, bolted up, and this by the order of Sri Rama. Ah! Ah! Ah!]}\n\\]\n\n52. To make a wild elephant amorous of our tame female elephants, we pick some of the weed \\textit{tutup bumi} that grows in the middle of the highroads and take it root and all. We chew it with betel leaf and betel nut, and then spit it out on the elephants' forehead and brows and both ears and both\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905,\ncheeks. We must avoid passing in front of the elephants when we release them and their goads must be kept at home with the goads of our other elephants.\n\n53. This is the medicine for a stubborn elephant that will not learn our schooling. We take some of the nasi-nasi plant that grows reflected in the water, and rub it over its chest by its heart and over both shoulders. We do this for three consecutive evenings.\n\n54. This is the medicine to soften the heart of an elephant and make it docile. We take the smaller kind of gelenggang plant known as gelenggang saior and rub it over the elephant's chest for three consecutive evenings. The plant must be gathered at evening time. Another way of softening an elephant's heart is to repeat the following charm over its food (sugarcane or plantain) for three mornings or three evenings.\n\nOm darang mukania\nDarang langli mukania langli\nTelunjuk ku akan kosu mu\nHati ku akan chucha mu\nTunduk tedurong kaliri ku\nTunduk tedurong kakanan ku\nKalau angkau ta'tunduk tedurong kapada aku\nAngkau di sumpah-i Sri Rama\nTunduk jinak kapada aku\nKalau angkau ta'tunduk jinak kapada aku\nAngkau di sumpah-i maha Rishi\n\nOm rengab.\n\n[My fore finger on your goad: my wish to subdue your wish. Bow down your head to the left. Bow down your head to the right. If you do not bow down your head to me, you will be cursed by Sri Rama. Bow down tamely to me. If you do not bow down tamely to me, you will be cursed by the Great Sages.]\n\n55. To take away an elephant's ticklishness we take as medicine the great hairy caterpillars of the red kind and rub them over the elephant's thighs.\n56. To cure an elephant of the trick of shaking itself free from its load, this is the medicine: we take the roots of the *galenggang* plant, the roots of the *trong asam* and the roots of the sensitive plant*; we chew them with betel leaf and betel nut and spit part of the mixture over the forehead of the elephant and then spit part over its testicles, and after this spit part over both cheeks and both thighs. We do this for two or three days.\n\nAnother cure is the following: we take the roots of the sensitive plant and some moss from a stone that has been standing in water, and burn them to ashes, which we then mix with oil, and rub over the elephant's cheeks and thighs.\n\nYet another way is to take the root of the large species of *galenggang* plant, and chew it with betel leaf and betel nut, and then spit over the elephant's cheeks and thighs for three consecutive days. The plant must be gathered at evening time.\n\n57. This is a medicine to prevent an elephant from swinging its tail from side to side. We take the rubbish that collects about sticks in the water and about the posts which stand in the stream and shake to and fro with the force of the current. We burn this to ashes and mix the ashes with oil which we rub on the elephant's tail for three consecutive evenings.\n\n58. To make an elephant subservient to the goad we take a handful of *kait kait* leaves and rub them over the elephant for three consecutive mornings or evenings; or else when we bathe the elephant. This is another way; if we put gold and silver in a bowl of water, and then bathe the elephant's head with the water, the elephant will without fail obey the goad with alacrity.\n\nAnd this is yet another way; we take gold, silver, copper and the iron of which cannons are made, and place them in a bowl of water. With this water we then bathe the elephant's head, and at the same time we lay the goad upon its head. We do this for three consecutive days.\n\n*Mimosa pudica*\n\nB. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\n59. This is the medicine for an elephant that will not kneel at the word of command. We take the root of the male kanchi plant that has never flowered, and chew it up with betel leaf and betel nut and squirt over all the elephant\u2019s joints. We do this for two three or four days. Another way is to take the root of the gourd plant that creeps over abandoned houses and to chew this with betel nut and betel leaf and to squirt it over the elephant\u2019s thighs for two or three consecutive evenings. If an elephant will not kneel or refuses to kneel down in water, we take the moss off the stump of a tree that has been felled to make a boat. We burn the moss to ashes and mix it with oil and rub it on the elephant\u2019s forehead and on its thighs.\n\n60. If an elephant refuses, or is afraid, to swim, we take the root of the kiambang plant and burn it to ashes which we mix with oil and rub on the elephant\u2019s forehead or on its thighs.\n\n61. This is a list of the diseases, of elephants.\nMersud: a swelling of the tip of the trunk.\nMerchuan: a swelling of the part under the chin.\nTasab: a swelling of the forehead.\nMerkabat: a swelling of the eyes.\nKeruan: a swelling of the ear.\nMerpuan: a swelling in the stomach.\nMertemulam: a swelling of the genitals.\nMernor: a swelling of one leg.\nMertalam: a swelling of both legs.\nMerchap: a swelling of the anus.\nMerkabun: a swelling of the rectum.\nMerpahat: a swelling of the end of the tail.\nKeradan: a swelling of the tip of the trunk.\n\nFor this last disease the medicine is to take the leaves of langkandi, prai, labu ayer and katang-katang tahi lembu with some whitewash and some salt. We shred these ingredients, or grind them to paste and apply the mixture as a poultice to the swollen part.\n\nJour, Straits Branch\nThe medicines for *tasab*, the swelling of the forehead, is to take the bark of the *ramanggi* and *dedap*, some *kunyit trus*, *lampuyang*, *lengkuas padang* and limes. We place these ingredients in a pot and boil them to shreds, and then apply the medicine to the elephant\u2019s forehead, and without fail the disease will be cured.\n\n62. This is the medicine for *merkabat*, the swelling of the eyes. We take some oxhide and burn it to ashes; then add some oil, the leaves and roots of the *pria* and of the creeping gourd plant. We pound these ingredients to a pulp and mix some arrack with it. The whole compost is applied to the swollen part. It is a certain cure.\n\n63. For the swelling of the ears we use this medicine. We take the fruit of the tamarind with limes of the varieties known as *limau mata kerbau*, *limau purut*, *limau krat lentang* and common limes and oranges; of all these we take the leaves and roots as well as the fruit; we chop them fine, and pound them well and then boil them in a pot. With the water we wash the swollen part, and apply the sediment as a poultice.\n\nNow this is a medicine, which we should know, for all ailments of elephants. We take the roots of the *trong prat*, the bark leaves and fruit of some tamarind, the bark of the *kintongan*, common limes, the limes of the varieties known as *limau krat lentang*, *limau mata kerbau*, *limau purut*, *limau raia*; we take from a betel nut tree that has never fruited the young aerial roots that have not yet reached the ground; we also take *kunyit trus* of the white and black varieties, *lengkuas padang*, *lengkuas benar*, *temu lawak*, *halia udang* of the red kind, *juang juang* leaves of the red kind and *teberau*.\n\nAll these we pound to powder, and place in water for a night. With this water we wash the elephant all over for two or three days; the sediment we give it to eat in small quantities with its food. After this we should avoid letting the elephant feel the heat of the sun for a few days.\n\n64. We now tell of all the medicines for the diseases of elephants. First of all there is this one which is handed down from\nthe *bomos* of old. We take the roots and leaves of the *pasamiu*, plantains of the variety known as *pisang miu* with the leaves and root of the plant; we add the roots of *chemandrai hitam*, *rotan tawar*, *tutup bumi*, *kenchar*, *pianggu*, *pulai hitam*, *rotan dini*, *panggil-panggil*, *jerun*, *kuchai*, *galenggang*, *kaduduk*, *paku*, *tambun tahi*, *temu padang*, and *temu kunchi*; we also take limes of the varieties known as *limau purut* and *limau padang*, and the bark of the *kintong*. We mix all these ingredients thoroughly and then pound them to a pulp. The juice is given to the elephant to drink for three days, or is sprinkled all over its body for three consecutive evenings.\n\n65. If an elephant has sore eyes so that it does not allow us to touch it and carries its head low, we sprinkle black pepper over its eyes for two or three consecutive evenings. If its eyes run with water, we blow at them through a tube either some lime juice or the clear water in which ashes have been standing; we do this for two or three consecutive evenings.\n\n66. This is a medicine for a running discharge in an elephant's eyes. We take the fruit of the *mataiang* and burn it to ashes, which we then mix with water; we strain the water and add some lime juice; we then put this in the elephant's eyes for about three days, and of a certainty the discharge will stop.\n\n67. This is the medicine for a disease of the trunk: we take from some well the vessel which men use to lower into the well to raise water; we take it rope and all, and burn it to ashes, which we mix with a little oil and rub on the end of the trunk. For this remedy to have effect the vessel must have been stolen from its owner.\n\n68. This is a remedy for the disease known as *kesar api*. We take some *lenjuang merah*, the cabbage heart of the *teberau*, limes, *meswi*, red onions, turmeric and white pepper; after chewing these ingredients with betel nut and betel leaf, we squirt the mixture from our mouth over the elephant's body three times on three morning or three evenings. Another way\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nto pound these articles to powder, to which we add a little water and then sprinkle all over the elephant's body for about three consecutive days.\n\nAnother remedy is to take the root of the red bunga raja, and the root of the jarang songsang; we chew them with betel nut and betel leaf and squirt the mixture from our mouth upon the elephant for three consecutive days or evenings.\n\nThis is the medicine for an elephant which has the diseases known as kesar ayer or kesar angin.\n\nWe take about a gantang measure of rembiga leaves, pound them to pulp and rub them over the elephant's body; or, adding water, apply them as a wash\u2014we do this for four or five days.\n\nAnother medicine for kesar ayer is as follows: of the lenjuang puteh we take the roots, the leaves, and the cabbage heart; we take leaves of the sensitive plant, the bark of the bongli, kunyit trus of both the black and white varieties meswi, red onions and white pepper. All these ingredients, we chew with betel nut and betel leaf and squirt from our mouth over the elephant's body; we do this for two or three days.\n\nThis is a cooling lotion. We take the fruit of the kubong, the leaves of the bungkal and the cabbage-heart of the teberau; we pound them to pulp and soak them in an earthenware pot, and then apply for about three consecutive days or evenings.\n\nAs we apply it we repeat these words.\n\nOm kak tiu tiu sak.\n\nYet another remedy for kesar is this: we take leaves of the sentang hantu, mataiang, and betel-nut tree; pound them to pulp and add a little whitewash, and rub the compound over the elephant's body for four or five days.\n\nAnd yet another remedy: we take the red fruit that grows on sand banks, and any kind of fruit of trees whose early leaves are red, and give them to the elephant to eat with a little Siamese salt. Of this medicine we give, in small quantities, as much as the elephant will eat.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\n69. This is the remedy for fever; we take *gandarusa* and chop it up fine, and soak it with cooked rice. Having done this, we put it out in the dew that night, and afterwards sprinkle it over the elephant's head for about three days.\n\nWe must be careful not to expose the elephant to the sun during this time.\n\n70. This is the remedy for pains in the elephant's stomach: we take the bark and fruit of the tamarind and the bark of the *kintong*, the bark of *jambu kapal* and of the *sena*, the fruit of the *tevus rangkinang* and the *rangkir ang kayu*, with its fruit and bark; we pound all these things to a pulp which we give the elephant to eat together with Siamese salt; we may also sprinkle it over the affected part.\n\n71. This medicine kills all the diseases in an elephant's stomach: we take some ripe *trong prat*, *lengkuas padang*, Siamese salt, bark of the *malaka* that has been brought from foreign parts; we split the *trong* and the *lengkuas* into strips, and then pound the mixture to a pulp; then we soak it in vinegar, and after three days we give the liquid to the elephant to drink, and the sediment we mix with the elephant's food, or with a plantain or some sugar cane. We do this for three or four days.\n\n72. This is the medicine for an elephant that is troubled with intestinal worms: we take the white and black varieties of *kunyit trus*, some black valley earth, the cabbage-heart of *teberau*, *meswi*, red onions, and white pepper; we stuff a sugar cane with these ingredients or we mix them little by little with the elephant's food for two or three days repeating this mantra.\n\n**OM KAK TUI TUI SAK.**\n\nThe following medicine will kill all the intestinal worms whose presence in an elephant's stomach prevents it from becoming fat and healthy: we take some saltpetre and carraway seed, and give as much of them as it will eat to the elephant. When we have done this for three or four consecutive days all the worms will be dead.\n\n73. This is medicine for an elephant this is suffering from chill: we take the roots of *trong asam*, and of *rotan dimi*,\nthe pith and roots of the chekor, jerangau, lenjung merah and kunyit trus; adding a little white pepper, we chew this with betel leaf and betel nut and squirt the mixture from our mouths over the part of the elephant's body that is affected.\n\nIf the elephant's body is hot, we take satawar hutan, balongan, satawar benar, anyor, tebu betong, lenjuang puteh, teberau, chapa and rotan tawar; we shred all these very fine or pound them to pulp, and cook them with betel leaf and betel nut. We then squirt the mixture from our mouths, or sprinkle it over the elephant's body for two or three consecutive days.\n\nThe elephant must not be exposed to the sun during this treatment.\n\n74. This is the remedy for a swollen foot, leg or shoulder: we take the inner part of some ginger, kunyit trus, turmeric, and lampuyang; we grind or pound them to pulp and adding a little salt, warm it on the fire; we then apply to the mixture the affected part for three or four days.\n\nIf an elephant's ear or leg is swollen we repeat this charm over it.\n\nOM CHIKAN CHI CHAU SIMAN PALAI AITU RATI DUCHANGU BAYI DUCHANG SAN BISAYI TAB.\n\n75. This is the medicine for a sprain in an elephant: we take leaves of the galenggang ramanggi which people use as a vegetable, nasi-nasi, the juice of the tebu salah, the stem of the kladi hitam and a prawn of the variety known as udang galah; we bake all these until they are burnt and then put them in some flour which we warm and apply as a poultice to the affected part for three or four days.\n\n76. This is a medicine to cure an elephant of eating earth: we take some earthworms and some black valley earth; we bake the worms until they are burnt and then mix them with the earth which we give to the elephant to eat for three or four days.\n\n77. This is a medicine for an elephant that will not eat heartily: we take some lengkuas padang and lengkuas benar\n\nR. A. Soe., No. 45, 1905.\nand the root of the *pisang-pisang*, and pound them to a pulp which we mix with the elephant's food for three or four consecutive days or evenings.\n\n78. This is medicine to make an elephant fat: we take some *tembakul* fish, and Siamese salt and give them to the elephant to eat. This must be done on the 13th to the 15th days of the month. When we administer this medicine the elephant must be standing in water that covers the swelling of its belly.\n\nThis is another remedy: we take *pataivali* and the roots of the *trong prat*, *trong pipit*, *trong asam* and *mataiang*; we chop them very fine and soak them in some large vessel, adding a little vinegar and Siamese salt; then we give it to the elephant to eat, or we rub it over its body. This must be done the moon is rising.\n\nThis is another remedy: we take the roots and leaves of the *lenjuang benar*, *lenjuang puteh*, the aerial roots of the betel nut tree, the roots of *rambiga* and *mataiang* and some Siamese salt. We give this medicine to the elephant to eat with some plantains, Indian corn or sugar cane, either when it is standing in water as before, or when the moon is rising.\n\nThis is another remedy: we take the skin of a rhinoceros' navel and soak it in water with some Siamese salt and some honey. Then we give the elephant the skin to eat with its food: we pour the liquid over the elephant and give it some to drink. We do this for three or four consecutive days.\n\nYet another remedy is to soak *pedindang* fruit and Siamese salt in honey. We then give the elephant the skin of the fruit to eat; the liquid we either pour over it or give it to drink for three or four consecutive days.\n\n79. This is the charm we use when for the first time we put the pannier upon a new elephant that has never been used before. We first sprinkle the elephant with *tepong tawar* [ceremonial flour] which we address as follows.\n\n*Hei Tepong tawar, tepong jahi, tepong tawar*\n*Seklian changrai dan bahdi*\n*Turun changrai, turun bahdi, turun pilak*\n*Turun kadalam laut Pauh Janggi.*\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n[Hail, Tepong tawar, pure flour! Hail, all the mischievous and evil influences! Let all the mischievous and evil influences and all misfortunes descend into the sea of Pauh Janggi.]\n\nWe then put the pannier on the elephant\u2019s back, and sprinkle the water of a young green cocoanut, one over its head and another over the base of its tail. We then throw the cocoanuts at the elephant, the one at its head and the other at its back, and take an augury from the manner of their falling: if they fall on the part that has been opened it is a bad sign, but it is a good sign if they fall with the open part uppermost. While doing this we repeat this mantra.\n\nOm pat mahapat chaila kupat karu hei chang-rai mayu tawi sah.\n\nAs soon as we have repeated this mantra we get up into the pannier.\n\n80. This medicine will make our elephant come back to our house of its own accord from the forest.\n\nFrom an abandoned house we take the cooking place, the ladder that leads up to the house and the threshold beam. We break them up and give fragments of them to the elephant to eat with plantains or Indian corn, and do this for three consecutive days or evenings.\n\n81. This will make an elephant brave in fighting. We take a considerable quantity the roots of the ketub-ketub and panggil-panggil and pound them into pulp, and give them to the elephant in his food for three consecutive mornings or evenings. This is certain to make the elephant courageous.\n\n82. This will make an elephant sagacious. We take the back of the ramanggi, the bark and ripe fruit of the tamarind juice of the ordinary lime and of the variety of sugarcane, known as tebu betong and add them to the elephant\u2019s food for three consecutive days.

This is the remedy to use when a person has been affected by *chemahang*, which means in the Malay language the evil influences attendant on elephants or trees, or when a person is affected by *changrai* or by strong *bahdi*. We take the resin that exudes from the *merbau* tree and *chamara petri* and *empelas* leaves, and water from the joints of trees and water from a pig\u2019s wallow and ripe fallen limes; we knead them to a pulp with which we besmear the sufferer. And, if God wills, he will recover.\n\n84. This chapter deals with the methods of telling a good elephant from a bad one.\n\nWe have to look at the elephant\u2019s shape, its stride, its ears, its skin, and at any individual peculiarities or markings that it may have.\n\nEars so broad that they will meet, a long lobe to the ear, a low forehead, a very long trunk, a tail that reaches to the ground and sweeps its dust, a broad flank, a head that wags to right and left as the animal walks, and tusks that reach down to the ground; if one finds all these points in one animal, it is, according to the *homos* of old, a very bad sign, and such an elephant will bring poverty upon its owner.\n\nIt is very good to find in one animal long ear lobes that lie close to the cheek, a long tip to the trunk and a high fore-\nhead; and an elephant like this will bring wealth and comfort to its master.\n\nAn elephant with a short lobe to the ear, the fold of the ear turning outwards and the ear itself being short; that rocks itself to and fro when standing, that swings its trunk and its tail, and wags its head as it walks; an elephant like this is not good and will eventually bring loss upon its owner and its own life will be short.\n\nAn elephant is a good one if it has the following points, the lower lip close to the upper lip, the lobe to the ear close to the cheek, and the folds of the ear and the tip of the ear turning inwards.\n\nAn elephant with twenty white and closely set toes, a long under lip and large testicles is a very good and lucky one.\n\nIf the protuberances on the elephant's head are twelve in number, or if it has fourteen toes, or fifteen toes, or if the hairs of its tail grow in two different ways, or if the tip of its tongue is black or its eyes red, the snimalis an evil brute that will bring ill health and sickness upon any one that keeps it.\n\nAn elephant with protuberances on its tail, and under its chin and with all its toes black is no good, neither is one with protuberances on its ears especially if they be black or red like blood.\n\nAn elephant with a black roof to its mouth or with black at the base of its tongue is no good.\n\nIt is a good sign in an elephant if after eating it carefully places in front of it all the food that is left over. It is a bad sign if it scatters its superfluous food right and left.\n\nIt is a very bad thing for an elephant to have its tusks streaked with black or red, or to have tusks that cross one another or that curve outwards.\n\nThis is the end of the book of mantras used in connexion with elephants, finished on the 27th day of Rajab 1296; taken from the mantras of Tunku Mantri Ibrahim bin Jafar, which are in the possession of Che Pandak Abdullah and committed to writing by Toh Sarif Aman; mantras which have come down\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nfrom the Datohs Sri Adika Raja of Ulu Perak, Toh Kalaung and Toh Kalalang, to Toh Muda Abdulrauf and from him to the present day.\n\nAPPENDIX I.\n\nThe Malay system of Elephant Catching and Training.\n\nThe method of taking a herd of elephants is probably common to all countries: in a place frequently visited by a herd the Malays build an enclosure either of timber, (when it is called a kubu) or strengthened by earth work (when it is called a pendiat). It is protected by a deep and wide ditch. Long wings of fallen logs lead the way into the gate of the enclosure, which is known as the \"smaller enclosure.\" All round an area of some miles of the forest in front of this enclosure a line is cleared, and in it little erections of a few branches and palm leaves are built in the trees at regular intervals. As soon as the herd has entered the circumscribed area, which is known as the \"larger enclosure\" men are stationed day and night in these trees with fires burning, to prevent the elephants from moving out again before all the hundreds of men who are necessary for a drive can be collected. When the elephants have been driven into the \"smaller enclosure,\" a great suspended door is dropped, and all exit prevented.\n\nA solitary elephant is made a victim to female influence. He is induced to join the society of three or four tame cow elephants which are let loose in the forest, and when he has become accustomed to them, the Malays arrange on the ground, in some convenient place between two trees, a rotan noose with the ordinary running knot.\n\nComing up to the elephant and his harem then on other tame elephants they gently urge the herd towards this noose. A female elephant that is new to him then attracts the atten-\ntion of the male, and he moves forward to caress her. Urged by the surrounding elephants she moves slowly towards the noose and steps into, and out of, it in safety. The male follows in her footsteps, and as he plants his foot a Malay pulls the knot and he is caught. Of course he rushes away at once, but at the end of the line attached to the noose is a heavy mass of branches which act as an effectual drag upon his progress. Fatigue soon makes him go slower, and then the elephants close upon him again and while two great cows press upon him on either side, a Malay slips a noose upon another leg. Soon each leg is noosed, and then in some convenient place the ends of all four nooses are made fast to trees, and the elephant is a prisoner.\n\nAn elephant, whether caught with a herd or in a noose, is kept tied up until it has been thoroughly subdued and quiet, and will submit to being washed and handled. Hobbles are then put on it, and then, tied to another elephant, it is taken down to the river to bathe. From this stage its domestication is gradual.\n\nThen comes its tuition. Under the Malay system every elephant, even one born in captivity and brought up from its birth in the village, has to be taught the words of command in the barbarous cruelty of the chelong or stocks. Here it is confined in such a position that it cannot move an inch in any direction while it learns its lessons.\n\nIn seven to ten days a clever village reared elephant will have learnt enough to earn its release from the stocks. A wild elephant will require forty to a hundred days.\n\nAfter this a forest-caught animal is taken about tied to a tame elephant, and gradually the rotans that join them are lengthened, until at last the elephant can be trusted to be let loose. It drags long rotans after it for some time however so that if it attempts to escape it can be easily seized again.\n\nA year should be allowed to elapse between the date of an elephant\u2019s being taken out of the stocks and of its being put to use as a beast of burden. During this time it is being perfected in the lessons learnt in the stocks.\n\nR. A.

Here the trainer receives his friends and visitors.\n\nTiang Guru\u2014A stout post in the middle of the balei chelong. It is used as a table, and on it are kept all the paraphernalia used in connexion with the elephant's training. It is sprinkled with tepong taucar before the training begins, and may not be touched by any one but the trainer.\n\nGalang renat\u2014Stout beams laid on the ground, upon which planks (termed kayu renat) are laid. The flooring of the stocks is thus above the level of the ground, and the place is easily drained.\n\nAnak Chelong\u2014The two great posts between which the elephant's neck is firmly held.\n\nGalang rusok\u2014The two beams which are fastened at one end to the anak chelong, and, running along the elephant's ribs, prevent it from moving its body to right or left.\n\nGalang dada\u2014A stout beam, supported on forked sticks, which passes under the elephant's chest, and thus prevents it from lying down.\n\nSengkala\u2014Hobbles which bind the forelegs together, and the hind legs together.\n\nChanang\u2014A small piece of wood fastened between the two anak chelong to prevent the elephant from pushing a fore foot between the posts.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nTali Teronching\u2014A broad rattan band round the elephant's hind legs. From it a twisted rattan rope ties the hind legs to any convenient tree or post.\n\nTali Pul\u2014A rattan which ties each fore leg to the anak chelong. [Thus the elephant is in this helpless condition\u2014it's neck is firmly nipped and held in by two posts, its sides are wedged between beams, and a beam runs under its chest; its fore legs are not only tied together but also tied to the posts that hold its neck, while as an additional precaution the chanang prevents any possible movement; the hind legs are tied together, and also attached to convenient posts.\n\nWhen one understands what this means, and realizes that a forest caught elephant undergoes from forty to a hundred days of this treatment (the hundred days, let it be understood, being the limit not of the elephant's refusal to submit to training but of its tenacity of life) it is not difficult to believe that the epitaph of great percentage of forest caught elephants is \"mati dalam chelong\"\u2014it died in the stocks.]\n\nTali Tegun\u2014When the elephant is first taken out of the stocks down to the water to bathe, it bears a skeleton frame work of rattans, in the form of the harness of the panniers (rengka) that it is to be taught to wear. The rattans are fitted on to its neck, round its belly, under its tail in exactly the same way as the rengka harness. This frame work, which is termed tali tegun, serves the double purpose making the animal accustomed to the feel of the harness and of allowing the trainer a safe hold for his scrambles up to, over, and down from, his charge.\n\nSaluar\u2014When an elephant first leaves the chelong it wears, suspended from the tali tegun, a loose rattan round each leg. These are known as saluar (trousers) and by means of them to animal if it becomes obstreperous can easily be tied up.\nTali Taham\u2014A rattan collar round the elephant\u2019s neck, by means of which a rattan rope (tali chawak) firmly binds a half trained elephant up to a trained animal. It is used when a half trained elephant is first allowed out of the stocks. When the elephants are tied closely together, the term is Chawak Imba. When the elephant is getting broken in, a little distance is allowed between it and the other animal, and the term is Chawak Puchong. Last of all, when the elephant is quite tame the animals are separated by a considerable length of rattan which is considered as little more than a more precaution. This is known as Chawak Wai.\n\nSedang\u2014The technical term for the progress of an elephant\u2019s instruction.\n\nPancharuan\u2014A short stick tipped with a sharp piece of iron.\n\nIt is only used to \u201cremind\u201d the elephant. A longer stick tipped in the same way with iron is called a tanjak, and is used to hurt the animal. Both pancharuan and tanjak are unlike the goad (kosa) with which the trained elephant is driven.\n\nPulang Pohun\u2014\u201cThe return of the season.\u201d The term for the twelvemonth which should elapse between an elephant\u2019s being put in the chelong and its first having a rengka (pannier) put on it.\n\nBarak\u2014During this twelvemonth, the elephant is known as Gajah Barak. At the end of the period, when the new rengka has been put on the animal with all due ceremonies, the gambala takes the animal from house to house calling out \u201cbarak,\u201d \u201cbarak,\u201d and everyone gives him something, a little rice, some fruit or a fowl.\n\nAt the end of the day, the elephant driver gives a feast to his friends.\n\nPatih Kosa\u2014The technical expression for an animal that is perfectly obedient to the goad.\n\nJour.

Full grown boar.\nThe New Sumatran Pig.\n\n*Sus oi* in the Rio-Linga Archipelago.\n\nBy C. Boden Kloss, F.Z.S.\n\nIn September 1901 a single specimen of a peculiar pig was obtained up the Indragiri River, E. Sumatra by Dr. W. L. Abbott who presented it to the U. S. National Museum. According to the natives of the locality, the \"nang-oi,\" as they call it\u2014thus differentiating it from the common pig\u2014is abundant in the forest and sago plantations along the banks of the river and its foot-prints may always be distinguished from those of *Sus vittatus* by their much greater size.\n\nFrom this one specimen a new species, *Sus oi* was described and it was, until recently, the only one on record, but lately other examples of what appears to be the same animal have been obtained by Mr. J. E. Romenij and others on Pulo Battam. As most of the islands of the Rio-Lingga Archipelago possess their own forms of monkeys, rodents, mouse-deer, etc., it is possible that these pigs may eventually be found to differ sufficiently from the animal of the Sumatran mainland to form an insular race although less probably than is the case with the others, for pigs do not seem liable to as great variation. At present, however, they appear to be the typical *Sus oi*.\n\nMr. Romenij communicates the following with regard to them.\n\n\"These pigs were hunted in the way customary here, viz., with a number of Kling trackers and beaters and a pack of wild dogs, mostly pariahs. During the few weeks that I had at my disposal to go out shooting I went regularly to Pulo Battam and got to know the places where these pigs were to be found, with the result that we bagged several of them and amongst these some fine big boars. The largest one that was shot there was unfortunately lost on the way back, as the sampan, in\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nwhich the carcase was towed behind the launch, got upset in a rough sea. The photograph of a very fine boar shot by another party shows the abnormal size of the head in comparison with the body and funny light coloured bumps on the head which the ordinary wild pigs don't show. This was a very old chap. My boars seem to me to be in a better condition and more in proportion with long and heavy bodies and standing high on their legs.\n\n\"I think I have told you before that I and others have frequently been to the same island in former years but never came across this kind of pig, and I can only conclude that it is the pineapple plantations now opened up near the coast, which have drawn them lately from the more interior parts of the island.\n\n\"In Java, I am told by old sportsmen, there exists a kind of wild boar which also has the hairy warts on the nose but no beard or whiskers* same as the Pulo Battam boar has. Some North Borneo planters who have seen my head, say that the N. Borneo boar\u2020 is more yellowish and that an old sow there has even far heavier whiskers and hairy warts than any boar: there is therefore a good deal of difference between these and the Pulo Battam pigs.\n\n\"The same kind of pig is said to be found on Pulo Bintang (Rio).\"\n\nBelow is the description of the type specimen:\n\n**Sus oi sp. nov.**\n\n*MILLER. Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash. Vol. XV. 1902*\n\n\"Type.\u2014Adult male (skin and skull) No. 113,150 United States National Museum. Collected on banks of the Indragiri River (about 30 miles above mouth) eastern Sumatra, September 20, 1901, by Dr. W. L. Abbott. Original number 1319.\n\nCharacters.\u2014Externally most like *Sus barbatus*, but with body even more scantily haired (there is no mane and the skin\n\n* Sus barbatus.\n\u2020 Sus verrucosus.\nSus oi. Head of boar.\nis nowhere concealed by the bristles except on the face), and two well-developed warty protuberances on muzzle. Skull essentially as in *Sus longirostris*. Teeth smaller than in *Sus longirostris* or *S. barbatus*, the posterior lower molar greatly reduced in size, much as in *Sus celebensis*.\n\n**External features.**\u2014The body and neck are sparsely and uniformly sprinkled with black bristles which nowhere conceal the yellowish white skin. On sides and belly they are very stiff, closely appressed and directed backward, about 20 mm. in length and nearly .5 mm. in diameter. On legs they are less coarse in texture and sufficiently numerous to produce a distinct dark shade. Along middle of neck and back they increase in length to about 50 mm., the diameter at the same time decreasing to .3 mm. The hairs form no mane, but throughout the region where it occurs in other hogs the hairs are less scattered and appressed than elsewhere. They are black, tipped with yellowish brown. Head as in *Sus barbatus,* except that about midway between eye and muzzle there are two well-developed protuberances 30 mm. in length and 20 mm. in breadth densely covered with stiff antrorse bristles. These bristles as well as those of the upper part of the face are uniformly yellowish brown. On cheeks they are strongly intermixed with black. Tail scantily covered with stiff black hairs about 25 mm. in length. They nowhere conceal the skin, but on terminal third are sufficiently close-set along sides to form a distinct flattened brush.\n\n**Skull.**\u2014The skull so closely resembles that of an adult male *Sus longirostris* from Borneo that it might readily be supposed to belong to an individual of the same species.\n\n**Teeth.**\u2014The teeth, with the exception of the canines, are uniformly smaller and narrower than those of *Sus longirostris*. Upper incisors wide apart, the second separated from both first and third by a space of 15 mm. (in *S. longirostris* the distance between second and first is 5 mm., that between second and third only 2 mm.). Posterior upper molar with last tubercle less than half as large as in the corresponding tooth of *S.*\n\n---\n\n*See plate xxx, of Verhandel. over de Natuurlijke Geschiedenis der Nederl. overzeesche bezittingen.*\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nlongirostris. Third lower molar consisting of only two cross ridges and a terminal heel, the entire length of the tooth much less than that of the tooth preceding teeth combined. In form it closely resembles Nehring's figure of the same tooth in *Sus celebensis* and is very different from that of *Sus longirostris* and *Sus cristatus*.\n\nMeasurements.\u2014External measurements of type: total length, 1870; head and body, 1575; tail, 295; height at shoulder, 850; height at rump, 800; ear from meatus, 88; ear from crown, 97; width of ear, 75. Weight 113 kg. Cranial measurements of type: greatest length, 480 (465); basal length, 405 (390); basilar length (to tip of premaxillary), 410 (397); palatal length to tip of premaxillary, 330 (\u2014); width of palate at pm., 50 (45); zygomatic breadth, 162 (148); least interorbital breadth 80 (76); length of nasals, 240 (230); greatest breadth of both nasals together, 38 (38); occipital depth (to lower rim of foramen magnum), 140 (140).\u201d\n\nI have recently had the opportunity of examining the skull and freshly flayed skin of a Battam boar presented to the Raffles Museum, Singapore, by Mr. Romenij and have been struck by certain details in which it differs from the above characters, but as this is merely a comparison of one isolated individual until the description of another it is unsafe to draw any conclusions.\n\nOn roughly comparing the partially cleaned skull, however, with those of three *longirostris*? boars in the Raffles Museum from the Baram R., Sarawak, the greater facial angle and breadth of palate and lower jaw were immediately noticeable.\n\nA space of 10 m.m. only separates the upper incisors from each other.\n\n*Abhandl. u. Berichte des K. zoologisch. u. anthrop.-ethnol. Mul. zu Dresden, 1888\u20131889, pl. ii, fig. 8.*\n\n\u2020In *Sus barbatus*, this tooth is, according to Nehring, of the usual form, that is with three cross ridges and a terminal heel.\n\n\u2021Measurements in parenthesis are these of an adult male *Sus longirostris*.\n\nJour, Straits Branch\nThe colouring too is somewhat different. The scantily haired skin is generally covered with an equal mixture of pale yellowish and black hairs, the former darkened and the latter bleached for two to three millimetres at the tip, but this parti-colouring is only remarked on close examination. The growth, however, is so slight as not to detract from the dirty yellowish appearance of the body which is thus contrasted with the outer sides of the forelegs that are almost entirely black, as are the lower hind-legs also, but to a less extent; while the short bristles between the bare snout and the warts are grizzled black and whitish. The fore-head and inter-orbital region are freely sprinkled with short, pure white hairs very slightly yellowish at the tips.\n\nThe spatulate-like growth of coarse black bristles on the distal third of the tail is very noticeable and forms a marked point of difference from *Sus barbatus* and *longirostris* in which the tails are covered with bristles throughout in all the examples I have seen.\n\nThe warts on the nose are elliptical in shape, the greatest diameter being about 50 m.m. and they rise some 40 m.m. above the skin surface from which they spring: they are entirely cartilaginous and in no way connected with the skull.\n\nBetween the eye and ear and at the angle of the lower jaw the skin forms almost a distended pocket and it is from the ridge of this excrescence that the curled whiskers, which show such a remarkable development in some specimens, take their rise.\n\nThe animal is practically maneless except for a slight lengthening of hair above the neck and shoulders but this is only visible when closely looked for. The specimen under discussion stood 39 inches (990 m.m.) high at the shoulder and the length from tip of snout to tail\u2014unfortunately taken along the curves of the body instead of in a straight line\u2014was $73\\frac{1}{2}$ inches (1866 m.m.)\n\nThe teeth show it to be fully adult and while the skin of a *cristatus* or *vittatus* boar of the same age would have shoulder shields little less than an inch in thickness this *Sus oi* skin not\nonly shows no thickening at all in that region but is remarkable for its exceeding thinness throughout.\n\nIn a note on *Sus oi* in the \"Field\" of August 13th, 1904, Mr. R. Lyddeker (apparently basing his opinion merely on two photographs of Mr. Romenij's specimens) is inclined to doubt whether it can be separated from *Sus barbatus* and also repeatedly claims it as an addition to the fauna of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nWithout going into the question of the validity of *Sus oi* as a species\u2014save to remark that it is doubtful whether there is at present in Europe sufficient material with which to refute Mr. Miller's opinion of its distinctness\u2014I cannot refrain from pointing out that it is impossible to claim this pig for the Malay Peninsula on the strength of its occurrence in Pulo Bat-tam since the affinity of the fauna of the islands of the Rio-Linga Archipelago\u2014although strongly specifically differentiated in many respects\u2014is entirely with that of Sumatra.\n\nOnly one species of wild pig is at present known to occur in the Malay Peninsula and that is the animal regarded as identical with *Sus cristatus* of India, and I see no more reason for now claiming *Sus oi* for the Mainland than there would have been for including in the past *Sus vittatus*, *Presbytes maurus* and other animals that occur in the above islands, amongst the fauna of the Malay Peninsula.\n\n(The plates illustrating this paper are from photographs lent by Mr. Romenij).\nSome Mouse-deer Tales.\n\nBy R. V. Winsedtt.\n\nThese tales of Si Kunchil or Si Plandok were copied down by me almost word for word from the narrative of a Malacca Malay, whom I met casually in Perak. He was a man some thirty years old and he told me he had heard the tales as a boy from a Javanese settler in Malacca, who translated them for the pleasure of his Malay acquaintances from a thick Javanese book; he added that the book was in manuscript and looked old. His recital was racy and colloquial and had none of the artifice and literary graces of the professional rhapsodists. He said, he could only remember a few tales. These are they: tales of the Mouse-deer, his wit and the carking cunning \"which keeps his body so thin and his eyes so large and bright.\"\n\nI once narrated the first of my tales to some Kuala Kangsar boatmen on the Perak River, and they capped it with a story of identical moral, where however it is a man who releases a tiger from a trap and the tiger in return threatens to devour the man, and a river-bank is called upon and attests the ingratitude of men and beasts; till at last the mouse-deer lures the tiger into the trap again, to see how the man can release him! These same boatmen substituted the phrase \"Nabi Sleyman's belt, tali pinggang\" for \"Nabi Sleyman's turban\" in the story of the mouse-deer with the snake and the tiger. Apparently, many Mouse-deer tales are told, of the same gist but with slightly different dress: and this is only to be expected, when they are circulated merely from lip to lip. I have not got the book by me and my memory may play me pranks: but, so far as I can remember, the tale of the mouse-deer enticing the lion into a well to fight his own shadow, which appears in the Hikaiat Gelila Demina, appears in a slightly different shape in Mr. Skeat's little book of folk-lore tales.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nMr. George Maxwell and others have reminded me, that one of these tales of mine bears an extraordinary resemblance to that of Brer Rabbit and the Tar Baby.\n\nThe only story which I have abbreviated and altered verbally in translation, is the rather indelicate anecdote of how Si Plandok behaved, when he leapt right into the tiger's maw.\n\nOnce upon a time, a tall tree by a river-bank fell suddenly and pinned down a crocodile by the tail. It happened, that some buffaloes came down to drink hard by and the crocodile besought them to lift the fallen tree and release him. One of the buffaloes answered, \"But how can we release you? how can we lift the tree? We have neither fingers nor paws, wherewith to grasp its trunk.\" \"No, my friends,\" said the crocodile, \"but you have strong horns and foreheads: of your mercy, place them under the trunk and heave all together.\" Then, three buffaloes pushed their horns under the tree and heaved all together and raised the trunk. And, the crocodile slipped out, like an eel that has had his tail nipped, quick as lightning; and forthwith siezed the hindleg of the biggest buffalo in his jaws. The buffalo cried out with pain and anger. \"What is this? Have I not helped you that you serve me thus? Why do you requite evil for good? But, the crocodile only bit the harder. Now, Mr. Mouse-deer had come up, while this was going on, and jumping upon the tree-trunk said to the buffalo. \"Why, do you ask such stupid questions? It is the nature of beasts and men to be ungrateful. See, here is an old sleeping-mat drifting down-stream. I will ask it about the matter.\" Therewith, he called out, \"Ho, sleeping-mat, is it the custom of the world to requite good with evil or with gratitude?\" \"With evil,\" answered the mat: \"I was once clean and new, soft to lie upon and comporting to my master, but see, now I am old and worn, he has flung me adrift in the river.\" \"Hear that,\" quoth the Mouse-deer: \"but I will enquire, also, of this dish-cover I see floating down.\" And he called out, \"Ho, dish-cover, is it the custom of the world to requite good with evil or with gratitude?\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n\"With evil,\" answered the dish-cover: \"I was once bright and new, fine with silk and gold thread, the pride of my mistress, but see, now that I am torn and tarnished, she has cast me away on the river.\" \"Hear that?\" quoth the Mouse-deer. \"Don't ask stupid questions, you silly buffalo. But, as for these creatures lifting that tree-trunk and setting you free, Mr. Crocodile, I don't believe a word of it, and I won't, till I have seen it with my own eyes. Let go that old bull's leg: it is very tough: and keeping your eye on yonder baby buffalo, who cannot run far and is very tender eating, just tell these beasts to lift up this trunk, as you want me to believe they lifted it just now, and then only will I accept your story.\" So; the crocodile was nettled, and did as the Mouse-deer asked, let go the bull's leg and approached the trunk to instruct the buffaloes how to raise it, once more. Then the buffaloes strained and strained and lifted it a little. \"See,\" said the crocodile, peering and pushing right under the trunk to watch the work, \"see, up it goes.\" \"And down it goes,\" yelled the Mouse-deer: \"down with it, you buffaloes, quick, quick, on top of the rogue.\" The buffaloes dropped the tree, and there was the crocodile pinned fast beneath it and sore wounded, \"As long as there is a crocodile in the world,\" said the dying beast, \"he shall be your foe and the enemy of all your tribe, you accursed mouse-deer.\" \"Well, well,\" answered Si Plandok. \"as long I am in the world, my wits shall be my friends, I hope.\"\n\nThen the Mouse-deer went on his way up hill and down dale, through jungle and plain; till he was faint and thirsty. At last, he came to a stream and went down to drink. \"There are no crocodiles here,\" he thought to himself, and he drank from a brook, his back turned to the big river. But a crocodile crept up and seized one of his hindlegs. \"Ho,\" said he, nearly screaming with pain, \"I was mistaken. What is to be done now? Mr. Crocodile, sir, why are you biting a dead branch?\" \"Call your leg a dead branch?\" laughed the crocodile. \"That's not my leg,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"taste it carefully: don't bite or you'll miss the flavour: does it not\ntaste like dead wood?\" \"Indeed, it does\", replied the crocodile, letting go. \"But it was my leg, all the same,\" said the Mouse-deer, as he leapt up the bank.\n\nThen the Mouse-deer bethought him how he should get across that great river and escape his enemies the crocodiles. After a while, he drew near to the bank and cried out, \"Hi\u2014 all ye crocodiles, rise, float, I command you.\" \"Pray, who is this that commands us?\" asked a crocodile, lifting his head, \"I am the messenger of Nabi Sleyman. Rise, ye crocodiles rise, all of you, float on the surface of this river, all ye that are in this river; for it is the will of the prophet Sleyman that I count all you his slaves: in the name of Nabi Sleyman I conjure you rise and float.\" Then all the crocodiles floated on the top of the water. \"Come, all of you, herd together,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"or I cannot count you truly.\" And all the crocodiles crowded together, till they stretched from one bank of the river to the other. \"I will count you one by one,\" said the Mouse-deer; \"so that there shall be no mistake in my reckoning.\" \"One,\" said he, as he leapt from the bank on to the back of the nearest beast: \"two\" and he leapt on to the back of the next; \"three,\" and he was on the back of a third: \"four,\" \"five,\" \"six,\" \"seven,\" \"eight,\" \"nine,\"\u2014\"ten,\" said he, as he jumped to the opposite bank and \"done\" said he: \"I reckoned truly and now my reckoning has brought me across, you may sink, you foolish crocodiles.\"\n\nThen, the Mouse-deer continued his journey up hill and down dale, through jungle and plain, till he was tired and hungry. And he saw the red-shooted shrub (? lamah-lamah) which Mouse-deer love, and ate the shoots and went on his way, his mouth streaming red slaver. By and by, a sambur-doe met him and asked, why is your mouth red like that?\" \"Ah,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"some kind jungle folk in yonder Kampong gave me betel to eat: they invite all comers; you had better go, too.\" Now, sambur deer love betel. \"Show me the way,\" said the doe. \"Straight ahead,\" answered the Mouse-deer, \"and tell the folk I told you to go.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Mouse-deer,\" said the doe and off she ran as fast as she\n\nJour. Straits Branch\ncould to get betel. But the folk there had set a snare to catch any beast that came to their gardens and the sambur doe was caught fast. Then, those folk came out to kill her. \"Alas!\" she protested, \"it was a mouse-deer told me, I should be welcome,\" \"Welcome indeed,\" said the folk, \"for you are the rascal that has destroyed all our betel.\" So they killed the sambur-doe.\n\nBut as Mr. Mouse-deer went on his way, a young sambur-deer met him and asked him, \"where is my mother?\" Then, the Mouse-deer answered: \"how should I know?\" \"You lie,\" answered the sambur and rushed at him to kill him; \"she is dead and it is your doing.\" But the Mouse-deer leapt aside into a deep pit, where his enemy dare not follow. So, the sambur went away and Si Plandok was left alone, to reflect how he should get clear of a pit which was too deep for him to leap up and out. At last he called so that all the beasts of the forest came and asked him what he did there. \"Ware sky,\" cried the Mouse-deer, pointing to the drifting clouds, \"I'm down here, because the sky is about to fall, and if you care for your lives you'll all of you jump down as quick as you can, before it falls and kills you.\" Thereupon, all the beasts began to tumble in, one on the top of the other. \"Don't crush me in this narrow space,\" quoth the Mouse-deer, leaping on the buffalo's back: \"don't crush me,\" and he jumped higher on to the tiger's back, and thence on to a deer's, so out and on to the bank and away. Then, the Mouse-deer wandered on till he met a huge tiger. \"I shall eat you,\" said the tiger. \"Don't,\" prayed the Mouse-deer, \"I entreat you, spare me.\" \"I shan't: I'm very hungry,\" said the tiger. \"Well open your mouth wide agape and I'll jump in,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"that will save you trouble.\" \"All right,\" said the tiger and did as Si Plandok asked him. The Mouse-deer leapt hard and straight for the tiger's gullet and tore his way right through the tiger's body; then, popping out his head, shouted to a goat grazing near to be off, before he should be caught and killed. \"I must stop this back-door treachery,\" said the tiger and spying a pointed stick began to thrust and\npress himself against it, but slipping down smartly let the stick pierce right into his body so that he died. But Si Plandok leapt out and escaped.\n\nThen, Mr. Mouse-deer took counsel with himself. \"I have many enemies, the crocodile, the deer, the tiger and all the beasts I lured into that pit. What shift is there for me to save myself alive?\" And he came to a wild wasps' nest. \"Good,\" said he, \"I will bide by this nest.\" Presently, a tiger found him and asked him his business. \"I guard Nabi Sleyman's gong,\" said the Mouse-deer, pointing to the nest. \"May I strike it?\" asked the tiger. \"Of all things, I should like to strike it: and, if you let me do so, I will not eat you.\" \"You may,\" answered the Mouse-deer, \"but, with your leave, I will go a long way off first or Nabi Sleyman will be angry. \"All right,\" replied the tiger. Then the Mouse-deer went a long way off till he came to a clump of bamboos: and there he waited. Then, the tiger smote Nabi Sleyman's gong and all the wasps came swarming out and stung him till his face was swollen. So, he bounded away in a rage and went to where the Mouse-deer stood. \"Knave, villain,\" said he, \"see my face all swollen. Now I will kill you. But what is this bamboo you are watching?\" \"It is Nabi Sleyman's viol,\" said the Mouse-deer, pointing to a slit stem, in which the wind sounded. \"How do you play it?,\" asked the tiger. \"Lick it here with your tongue,\" said Si Plandok, pointing to the slit. \"May I?,\" asked the tiger. \"Yes,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"but with your leave, I will go a long way off first or Nabi Sleyman will be angry. \"All right\" said the tiger. Then Mouse-deer went a long way off and stood by some filth. Then the tiger licked the bamboo; and a gust blew and closed the fissure, so that the end of the tiger's tongue was pinched off: and that is why tigers are short-tongued to this day. So, he bounded away in a rage and went to where the Mouse-deer watched over the filth. \"See the hurt you have done me, accursed one,\" said the tiger, showing his tongue: \"now, of a truth, I will slay and eat you. But, first, what is this filth that you guard it?\" \"It is Nabi Sleyman's nasi Kunyet,\" said the Mouse-deer. \"May I\n\nJour. Straits Branch\neat it?,\" said the tiger. \"Of all things, I should like to eat it; and if you let me do so, I will not kill you.\" \"You may,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"and perhaps it will cure your tongue: but first, let me go a long way off or Nabi Sleyman may be angry with me.\" \"All right,\" said the tiger. And Mr. Mouse-deer went a long way off and stood by a coiled snake. Then the tiger tasted the filth. \"Why is it so bitter?\", said he: \"beast, this is not rice but filth only.\" And he rushed in a rage to where the Mouse-deer waited. \"Now, indeed your hour has come,\" said the tiger: \"make ready to die. But, first, what is this you are guarding,\" and he looked at the coiled snake. \"This is Nabi Sleyman's turban,\" said the Mouse-deer. \"May I wear it?\", asked the tiger: \"of all things I should like to put it on: and if you let me do so, perhaps I may spare your life.\" \"You may put it on,\" said the Mouse-deer \"but first let me go a long way off or Nabi Sleyman may be angry with me.\" \"All right,\" said the tiger. Then the Mouse-deer went a long way off and, looked on gleefully. So, the tiger began to unwind the coils but the snake awoke, his tongue darting like flame, and fought with the tiger and overcame him and killed him. \"Ha! ha!\", laughed the Mouse-deer and went on his way, up hill and down dale, by jungle and by plain, till he was hungry. Then he came to a cucumber garden and nibbled all the cucumbers. So, the gardener was angry and took paint, dry cocoanut husks and old clouts and made a scarecrow and smeared it with the gutta of the jack-fruit tree. \"What is this?\" said the Mouse-deer, returning to his feeding ground: \"a man, or a doll? Only a doll, I declare.\" And he poked it with his foreleg. But his leg struck fast in the gutta. \"It's alive, after all, and it wants to fight. I'll kick it hard.\" Another leg stuck fast. \"Oh! it's only a wretched doll but it has strong glue.\" And he kicked with his hind legs also, till all four legs were stuck fast. Then the Mouse-deer wept and called for help. And the bird Ketopok flew down and offered to release him but warned him it would be a dirty job. \"Never mind that,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"so long as I get free.\" So, the Ketopok covered him all over with bird-lime. By and bye,\nthe gardener came up. \"Ha!\" said he, \"here is the thief caught fast. We'll take him home and kill him.\" Now the Mouse-deer kept still and held his breath. \"Don't take him home, father,\" said the gardener's son, looking at him, \"he's been dead some hours and is quite rotten and stinking.\" And he pulled the Mouse-deer away and threw him on a heap of rubbish. But the Mouse-deer jumped up and shook himself and shouted, \"I'm not dead but dirty.\" Then he sprang away into the forest.\n\nThe Mouse-deer journeyed on, and came to another cucumber garden, and there, too, he nibbled the cucumbers. But the gardener set a trap and caught him and put him in a cage, while the good-wife prepared spices to dress him for a feast. Now, the gardener had an old watch-dog. And the dog went up to the Mouse-deer's cage and asked him why he was locked up. So, the Mouse-deer said, \"It is because they would force me to marry the gardener's daughter against my will. See, they are preparing spices for a wedding feast.\" Then the dog asked, is it not for stealing cucumbers you are imprisoned.\" But the Mouse-deer persisted it was because he would not marry the gardener's daughter. Then the dog answered, \"How long have I done faithful service here, and why should you a stranger be preferred to me. I will take your place and marry.\" And the dog pushed open the cage and entered it, while the Mouse-deer ran off. By and bye, the gardener came and opened the cage and found only the watch dog; and he cursed and beat the dog: but the dog could only tell, how the Mouse-deer had cheated him.\n\nAt last the Mouse-deer came to the sea-shore and met the king of sea-snails, siput kiyong, by whom he was worsted. \"I pity you;\" said he to the snail, \"well enough, you can only just crawl with your house and pillow on your back.\" \"Why,\" said the snail, \"I'll beat you in a running race along the seashore, if you give me seven days' notice.\" \"Done,\" said Si Plandok, laughing and wondering what the king of the snails would do. But the snail sent messengers to all his rayats and bade them assemble in crowds by the edge of the sea,\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nhiding themselves in shallow water, till they saw a Mouse-deer come running, when they were to pop up one after another in front of the Mouse-deer. So, after seven days, the Mouse-deer started to race the sea-snail along the seashore, but fast as he could run, there was always the snail, or so it seemed to him, before him. And Mr. Mouse-deer was angry and discouraged, because he thought the king of the snails had worsted him.\nAnother Sea-Dyak Legend.*\n\n*vide Journal Straits Branch R. A. Soc. No. 41. 1904.\n\"Two Sea-Dyak Legends.\"\nBy the Revd. Edwin H. Gomes, M.A.\n\nPULANG-GANA\n\nAnd how he came to be worshipped as the God of the Earth.\n\nLong, long ago, though the Dyaks knew of paddy and planted it every year, yet they had very poor crops because they did not know who was the god that owned the land, and as they did not offer him sacrifices, he did nothing to help them. In those days there lived together seven brothers and their only sister. Their names were Bui-Nasi, Belang Pinggang, Bejit-Manai, Bunga-Jawa, Litan-Dai, Kenyawang, and Pulang-Gana, and the sister's name was Puchong-Kompat. They lived on a hill by the side of a broad river. On all sides were wide plains, and beyond these were high hills rising in the distance. Most of these were covered with thick jungle; only a few clearings could be seen where paddy had been planted.\n\nNot far from their house the brothers had a garden, in which they planted potatoes, yams, sugar, cane and tapioca; but a porcupine used often to come at night and do much damage to this garden. Their youngest brother Pulang-Gana was told to keep watch at night, and drive away the animal or kill it if he could. But all his efforts were vain. When he was awake the animal did not come, but as soon as he fell asleep the porcupine would creep in quietly and eat up the potatoes and yams. The elder brothers were not kind to Pulang-Gana. They would not keep watch themselves, but whenever they saw any fresh damage done, then they not only scolded their younger brother but beat him with sticks.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\n\"He is only lazy,\" they said, \"he deserves a thrashing; he does nothing but sleep and is too lazy to wake up at night and drive the porcupine away!\"\n\nPoor Pulang-Gana! His was a hard lot indeed!\n\nHe determined to keep careful watch one night, and whatever it cost him, to kill the porcupine, so that his brothers might have no more cause for blaming him. That night he did not sleep at all. The porcupine came just before dawn when all was very still. Pulang-Gana was awake, and went after it, determined to kill it. The animal ran away and Pulang-Gana followed. The moon was shining brightly and he had no difficulty in seeing in what direction it went. Every now and then the porcupine stopped, but as soon as Pulang-Gana came close to it, it started off again and he was not able to kill it. So the animal went on and Pulang-Gana followed. He was determined not to give up the chase until he had killed the animal that had been the cause of his being scolded and beaten so often.\n\nThe sun was beginning to rise in the East and still Pulang-Gana pursued the porcupine.\n\n\"Sooner or later,\" he said to himself, \"I must catch it up. The animal is already tired. I will not return home till I have killed it.\"\n\nThe porcupine now came to the foot of a rocky mountain. Pulang-Gana thought the chase would soon be over and he hurried on. But before he could come up to the animal it made its escape into an opening in the solid rock. The cave into which it had disappeared was large enough for a man to stand upright in, and Pulang-Gana said to himself:\n\n\"Now I have you; wait till I have a light to show me where you are, and then I will come in and kill you.\"\n\nHe collected some dry branches and tied them together for a torch. He found a piece of dry soft wood, and also a short stick of some hard wood the point of which he sharpened. With the palms of his hands he worked the small stick and drilled a hole in the soft wood. Soon it began to smoke, and with the aid of some dry twigs he blew the fire into a blaze; then he lighted his torch, and hurried into the cave after the porcupine.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nHe saw the animal a little distance ahead of him and followed it leisurely. There was no need for haste, as he would be able to kill it easily enough when he drove it to the end of the cave and it had no means of escape. The cave seemed to extend a great way into the mountain. After a few hours walking Pulang-Gana was surprised to come to an opening in the rock through which the porcupine had evidently escaped. Outside the sun was shining brightly. Pulang-Gana went through this opening, but though he looked in all directions he could see no signs of the porcupine.\n\nHe was uncertain what he ought to do next. The porcupine had escaped and there was no chance of his being able to kill it. He did not feel inclined to return to his brothers because they were all unkind to him. On the other hand, he did not know if this new country in which he found himself was inhabited, and if inhabited, whether the people would treat him kindly. He looked around and saw smoke arising some distance off, and guessed that there was a Dyak house there. As he was hungry he decided to go to it hoping that the inmates would be kind to him and give him food.\n\nAs Pulang-Gana came nearer he saw that the house was a very long one inhabited by about one hundred families. He stopped at the bottom of the ladder leading up to the house, and following the Dyak custom, asked in a loud voice if he might walk up.\n\n\"Yes, come up Pulang-Gana,\" said some one in reply. \"We have been expecting you for some time and will be glad to see you.\"\n\nHe was surprised that his name should be known in this strange country in which he had never been before. He walked up and in the long open room stretching the whole length of the house, he saw an old man and a young and beautiful girl.\n\n\"Spread out a mat, my daughter,\" the old man said, \"that Pulang-Gana may sit and rest after his long journey, and you can prepare some food for him, no doubt he is hungry as well as tired.\"\nShe spread out a mat for Pulang-Gana and then went into the room to get ready a meal for their visitor. Soon after she opened the door of the room and asked him to come in and eat.\n\nThe old man who seemed kind and hospitable said to him:\n\n\"Go in and have some food. You must be hungry after your long journey. When you have eaten and rested, we can have a talk together. I have long wished to meet you and to ask you about yourself and your brothers, and how affairs are in your country.\"\n\nPulang-Gana went into the room and found a nice meal awaiting him. Being very hungry, he did full justice to it.\n\nThat evening as they sat by the fire, the old man asked him about his people and if they had good crops of paddy in his country. Pulang-Gana said in reply that though his brothers possessed the largest paddy fields in the country, still he never remembered their having a really good harvest. The paddy they obtained was not sufficient to last them the whole year, and they had to fall back on potatoes and sago for food. The old man seemed interested in what Pulang-Gana said of himself, and Pulang-Gana went on and told him of all his circumstances, how he lived with his six brothers and only sister and how unkind his brothers were to him. He told the old man also about the porcupine which did such damage to their garden, and how often he had been scolded and beaten by his brothers for not being able to drive away or kill the animal. He gave an account of his adventures that morning, how determined to kill the porcupine, he had followed it through the under-ground passage through the mountain and had found himself in this strange country.\n\n\"I have heard your story,\" said the old man, \"and think you are very much to be pitied. Your brothers seem to have been very unkind and to have treated you very badly. I would like you to stay with me here, and not return to them. I have no son, and would like you to marry my daughter and live with us. I am getting old and am not so strong as I used to be and will be glad of your help.\"\n\nJour, Straits Branch\n\"I should like to stay with you very much, for you seem so kind, and are so different to my brothers, and I should like to marry your daughter and spend the rest of my life here. But there is no one to look after our garden, and the porcupine will do much damage to it. And my brothers are sure to be angry with me for leaving them, and when they see their garden destroyed through my neglect, they are sure to hunt for me and when they find me they will probably kill me. No; much as I would like to stay, I am afraid I cannot. I must start to return to-morrow. It would have been different if I had succeeded in killing the porcupine, then it would not matter so much if I stayed away some time.\"\n\n\"You need not trouble yourself about the animal that attacks the vegetables planted in your garden. I can prevent its coming again. That porcupine is not really an animal. One of our slaves here, named Indai-Antok-Genok, is commanded by me to transform herself into a procupine and pay visits to that garden. I shall tell her to do so no more, and your brothers' garden will be safe enough without you to watch it. You must remain here with us. There is nothing for you to fear. If you do not return your brothers will think that some accident has happened to you and that you are dead. As they are all so unkind to you, you may be sure they will not trouble to look for you.\"\n\n\"Well, if that be the case, I will gladly live with you. I was not happy with my brothers and I am sure I shall be happy here.\"\n\nSo it was decided that Pulang-Gana should remain in the house of the old man. Some months afterwards he married the daughter and they lived happily as husband and wife. His wife's father and mother were kind to him and so were the other people in the house, and Pulang-Gana was very glad he decided to cast in his lot with them.\n\nNow this old man who treated Pulang-Gana so kindly was no ordinary mortal. His name was Raja Shua and he ruled the spirits who live in the under-ground caves of the earth. His wife was quite as powerful as he. She was a goddess and\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nhad power over the animals of the forest, all of which obeyed her. She was known as Seregendah. The daughter that married Pulang-Gana was called Trentom-Tanah-Tumboh and sometimes Setanggoi-Tanggoi-Buloh. It was from his father-in-law and his wife Seregendah that Pulang-Gana received power over the land.\n\nIn process of time Pulang-Gana's wife gave birth to a girl, who was very much admired by all, and greatly loved by her parents.\n\nWhen the child was a few years old, one day she came to her father and mother and asked them what property they intended to leave her. The mother showed her the valuable jars and brassware that she possessed, all of which were to belong to her child. Then the little girl asked her father what he had to give her. Pulang-Gana had no property to leave to his daughter. Years ago he had come by chance to this house of Rajah Shua bringing nothing with him, and unless his brothers gave him a share of their father's property, he would have nothing to leave his daughter. So he told her to be content with what her mother gave her. She would be very rich without anything from him. But she was not satisfied with this reply, and cried because her father said he had nothing to give her.\n\nWhen Pulang-Gana saw how sad his child was, he said to his father-in-law that he would like to pay a visit to his brothers and ask them for a share of the property, that he might have something to give his daughter. Rajah Shua told him he might go to them but warned him that probably he would not have a kind reception, and advised him not to be away long but to return as soon as possible.\n\nPulang-Gana started on his journey to his old home, wondering how his brothers would receive him after his long absence. He had no difficulty in finding his way as his father-in-law gave him very definite instructions about his journey. He found that his brothers had built a new house not far from the site of the old one in which he had lived with them years ago. The house seemed very quiet and he found that nearly all the\npeople were away on a fishing expedition. Only his sister-in-law, the wife of his brother Belang Pinggang, was at home.\n\nShe was very much surprised to see him, and said they had given him up for dead long ago. She told him that the others were away fishing, and that his brother Bui-Nasi, and a little boy, besides herself, were the only ones left at home. He would find his brother and the little boy working at the forge making some implements for their work.\n\nPulang-Gana said he would go to his brother and he left the house and walked in the direction where he guessed the forge was from the sound of hammering he heard.\n\n\"Oh! Is that you Pulang-Gana?\" said Bui-Nasi as soon as he saw him. \"Where have you been all these years? We thought that you had met with some accident and had died long ago.\"\n\nPulang-Gana said little about himself to his brother. He told him how he had lost his way in the jungle years ago, and when he arrived at last at a house, the people there persuaded him to stay with them, and he said that he was now married and had a daughter.\n\n\"Have you come with your wife to stay with us?\" asked Bui-Nasi.\n\n\"No,\" was the answer, \"I have only come on a short visit by myself to ask for my share of the property left us by our father.\"\n\n\"You have nothing whatever to expect. You left us years ago of your own will and have been away all this time, and now you have the impudence to come and ask for your share of the property. I advise you to say nothing of this to the others. They will be very vexed with you if you do.\"\n\n\"I do not ask for much,\" said Pulang-Gana. \"I will be satisfied with little. But my daughter asked me what I had to give her, so I came here to ask for something, and I should be sorry to return empty-handed.\"\n\n\"You shall not return empty-handed,\" said Bui-Nasi in scorn. \"Here is something for you to take back with you. If is all that you will get from us, I can tell you.\" With these\nwords he threw Pulang-Gana a clod of earth which he saw lying near. Now go away, and do not let us see your face again.\"\n\nPulang-Gana put the lump of earth in his bag, and with a heavy heart, started to return to his house. So this was the way his brothers treated him! There was nothing to expect from them!\n\nWhen he arrived at his house all the family gathered round him. They had heard that he had gone to ask his brothers for his share of the property and they were anxious to see what he brought back. His little daughter rushed up eagerly to him and said:\n\n\"Father what have you brought back for me from my uncles? Let me see the nice things they gave you.\"\n\nThen Pulang-Gana said sadly, \"I received no share of the property from your uncles. They would have nothing to do with me, and drove me away.\"\n\n\"But did you get nothing at all from them?\" asked his father-in-law.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pulang-Gana, \"my brother Bui-Nasi did give me something, but I am ashamed to tell you what it is. Here it is,\" and he took out from his bag the lump of earth his brother had given him, and handed it to his father-in-law.\n\nWhen Rajah Shua saw what it was that Pulang-Gana had received from his brothers, he said joyfully:\n\n\"They have given you the most valuable gift it is possible to imagine. You are now a person of great importance. The earth is yours. Whoever wishes to plant on it must first make offerings and sacrifices to you and pray to you to give him a good harvest. It is in your power to make the earth fruitful or barren, and to give mankind a good or a bad harvest as you will.\"\n\nA few months after, the brothers of Pulang-Gana at the advice of Bai-Nasi decided on the site where they were to plant paddy that year. It was a large forest some distance away from their house. First they cut down the smaller trees, and then they felled the large trees, and when all this work was done, they rested for some weeks, waiting for the sun to dry up\nthe timber so that it might be set on fire and the land be ready for planting on.\n\nOne day Pulang-Gana's father-in-law said to him, \"I hear that your brothers have been busy cutting down the trees where they intend to plant paddy this year. As they gave you the earth some time ago to be your share of the property, it is only right that they should ask leave from you before planting on it. Since they have not done so, you must stop them from planting paddy there.\"\n\n\"How can I prevent them planting paddy where they like?\" said Pulang-Gana in dismay. \"Is it likely that they will take any notice of anything I say?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said his father-in-law, Raja Shua, \"they will have to listen to what you say, for I will be on your side and will help you. I am the god that rules the spirits that live in the underground caves of the earth, and my wife Seregendah has power over the animals and the spirits which inhabit the forests. As your brothers have treated you so unkindly, and have given you no share of the property, and have simply given you a clod of earth to take back with you, my wife and I will punish them and reward you by giving you power over everything that grows on the earth. Before the land is planted upon, offerings must be made to you, and invocations must be made to yourself and myself and my wife Seregendah. Unless these things be done, the ground will not be fruitful.\n\n\"As your brothers have not done anything of the kind, you must teach them a lesson and prevent them from going on with their work. This evening at dusk you must go to the newly cleared forest and cry aloud: 'Come here all you who are the servants of Seregendah and Raja Shua,' and name all the wild beasts of the forest. They will come to you in large numbers. Then you must ask them, as well as the invisible spirits, who will be present too, to help you and put up all the trees that have been cut down.\"\n\nAnd Pulang-Gana did as his father-in-law advised him. He went at dusk to the part of the jungle where his brothers had been cutting down the trees and called to the animals in\nthe name of Rajah Shua and of Seregendah, and they came in large numbers and helped him to put up all the trees that had been felled, and the forest appeared just as it had been before any of the trees had been cut down.\n\nThe next day Bui-Nasi went early in the morning to see if the fish traps he had set in the stream had caught any fish, and as he was near the part of the forest where the trees had been cut down by his brothers and himself not long before, he went on to see how things were getting on and if the felled jungle was dry enough to be burnt.\n\nTo his great surprise he found all the trees standing, and no signs of the clearing that had been made! He hurried home and told his brothers what he had seen, and they all returned, accompanied by their friends and followers, and found that what Bui-Nasi had told them was perfectly true. They were all very much surprised as they had never known such a thing happen before.\n\n\"I wonder if this is really the part of the forest which we cleared a few weeks ago,\" said one of the brothers. \"Perhaps we have mistaken the spot.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bui-Nasi in reply, \"there is no mistake. Here are the whetstones on which we sharpened our axes and choppers; and here too\u2014is where we did our cooking for our mid-day meal.\"\n\nThey held a consultation as to what was to be done.\n\n\"This is very strange,\" said Bui-Nasi. \"Some enemy who is helped by powerful spirits is determined not to let us plant paddy here. Let us try and find out who has made the trees that we have cut down stand upright and grow up again as before. My advice is that we cut down the jungle anew, and that some of us remain and keep watch here all night. Perhaps we may be able to catch the culprit.\"\n\nSo the brothers and all their friends and followers set to work, and before the day ended, they had cleared afresh a large stretch of jungle.\n\nTwelve men, with Bui-Nasi at their head, were set to watch, and the others returned home, discussing among themselves what had taken place.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThose that were left by the clearing had not long to wait. Soon after dusk they saw a man come and standing on the trunk of a large felled tree, call aloud to the animals of the forest and the invisible spirits around in the name of Rajah Shua and Seregendah to come to his help. The twelve men crept up cautiously behind him and seized him.\n\n\"We have you now,\" they said as they held him fast. \"It is you who have caused us all the trouble of having to cut down this jungle for the second time. Now we intend to kill you, and you will not be able to play your tricks on us any more.\"\n\nIt was too dark to see who it was, and Bui-Nasi said, \"Let us have a light and see what he is like. I am sure he must be as ugly as he is troublesome.\"\n\nOne of them fetched a light and to their great surprise they saw their prisoner was Pulang-Gana!\n\n\"So it is you Pulang-Gana!\" said his brother in anger. \"You are up to your old tricks again. You were too lazy to work before, and would not keep watch over our garden, and you left us without telling us where you were going. And now, after several years' absence, you come back and disturb us in our work, and by some means or other set up the trees we have had the trouble of cutting down. Though I am your brother I have no pity for you. As long as you are alive you will give us trouble, so we intend to kill you and be well rid of you.\"\n\nHe expected Pulang-Gana to be afraid of him and to plead for his life. But things were very much changed from the old days when Pulang-Gana was the despised youngest brother, beaten and scolded by the others. Now he was the son-in-law of the gods, and had Rajah Shua and Seregendah to help him, and he was not at all afraid of his brothers, because he knew well they could do him no harm.\n\nHe shook off those that held him, and told them to listen to what he had to say. His manner and bearing were very different from that of one who feared them. They stood round him in awe, for they instinctively felt that Pulang-Gana was not to be trifled with, and from what had already taken place, they knew that he was aided by powerful spirits.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nThen Pulang-Gana spoke:\n\n\"I have good reason for doing what I did. You have no right to cut down this jungle or to plant on this land. You have not paid me the price of the land. Not long ago, you, Bui-Nasi, gave me a clod of earth as my share of the property of our father, and so I have now the right of preventing any from planting on the earth. It is no use your attempting to kill me. Though you are many in numbers, it is impossible for you to kill me because I am now the god of the earth, and am assisted by Rajah Shua and Seregendah whose power you know.\"\n\nThere was silence for a short time, and then Bai-Nasi said,\n\n\"No doubt what you say is true, for no one without supernatural aide have could made the trees that were cut down stand upright and grow. What do you wish us to do in order to obtain your leave to plant on the land?\"\n\nPulang-Gana told them to gather all the people together the next day and he would tell them what all must do in order to insure their getting good crops of paddy.\n\nThat same night messengers were sent in all directions to tell the people in the neighbouring villages to come together so that Pulang-Gana might teach them what they were to do before cutting down the jungle and planting paddy.\n\nThe next morning a very large crowd gathered together and Pulang-Gana said to them:\n\n\"You must, before cutting down the jungle, make invocations to me, as well as to Rajah Shua and Seregendah, and you must ask me for leave to plant on the piece of land you have decided on, and you must make sacrifices to me of two kinds, some animal\u2014a pig or a fowl\u2014must be killed, and also there must be some offering of food\u2014rice, or eggs, or potatoes, or fruit. Then some offering must be taken and buried in the ground to be planted. That is the rent you pay to me for the use of the land that year, for all the land belongs to me and I expect rent to be paid by all who use it.\n\n\"And if anything goes wrong in your paddy fields, and the crops are poor, or, being good, are attacked by insects or\n\nJour, Straits Branch\nanimals, then you must call upon Rajah Shua and Seregendah and myself to come to your aid, and we will help you.\"\n\nAnd then for the first time did the new ceremonies come into force, and, aided by the higher powers, mankind were able to obtain much better crops than they had done before. And this is why no Dyak dares to plant paddy without first making invocations and offerings to Pulang-Gana, Rajah Shua and Seregendah and also burying some small gift in the earth for the use of the land that year.\nSome Notes on Malay Card Games.\n\nR. O. Winstedt.\n\nIn preparing these notes, I have used as a ground-work the chapter on card games in Mr. Skeat's Malay Magic, but in addition to supplementing that account in some details, I have collated local variations in the rules of the games and collected some terms which I have not seen recorded elsewhere.\n\nI. Main chabut. This game, says Mr. Skeat, \"is a species of vingt-et-un and is played with either twenty-one or thirty-one points\" or pips or mata as the Malay idiom is. If the game is thirty-one points, not more than nine people can play; if twenty-one not more than seven. The \"ten\" cards are not used: according to Mr. Skeat, court cards also are thrown out in the twenty-one game, but I have seen court cards used in both games and counted as ten pips each. The ace (sat) is used and is worth one, ten, or eleven pips as is convenient to the player; except that, if you have two aces in one hand while playing the twenty-one game or three in one hand while playing thirty-one, the ace must be reckoned as worth only one pip. The dealer (perdi) distributes two lunas or 'keel' cards, 'foundation' cards as we might say, to each player. The nicknames for the various combinations in these 'keel' cards given by Mr. Skeat\u2014lunas nikah, a court card and an ace; lunas dua jalor, two threes; kachang di-rendang di-tugalkan, two aces\u2014I have found to be familiar even to the younger generation in Perak. After the 'keel' cards have been dealt, each player in turn draws (chabut) fresh cards from the bottom of the remaining cards of the pack. Whoever gets thirty-one or twenty-one pips exactly, according as to which game is being played, is said to \"masok mata.\" In a game of thirty-one, no player can chabut more than seven cards or more than five in a twenty-one game, and if he has drawn seven or five cards\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nand not yet got nor exceeded thirty-one (or twenty-one) pips, he is said to masok daun and wins even over a player who has masok mata. Of those who masok daun, the one with the smaller number of pips would win: but for two players to hold such a hand hardly ever occurs. The player who gets more than thirty-one (or twenty-one) points is said to be \"dead\" mati, or \"blind\" bota, or \"to go to pot\" masok pering, literally 'enter the plate,' alluding to the plate in the centre of the players into which he will fling his hand. When a player has drawn cards, till he has a total of twenty-six, twenty-seven or twenty-eight (or sixteen, seventeen, eighteen) points in his hand and is afraid to draw another card for fear of exceeding thirty-one (or twenty-one), he is said to be \"in a small coil,\" blit kecil, and \"passes,\" if this happens, when he has twenty nine or thirty pips, it is blit besar.\n\n\"When two players have the same number of pips. e.g., nine and nine or eight and eight\u2014,\" writes Mr. Skeat, \"the coincidence is described in the words, Jumpa di-jalan, diadu kalah, dichabut mati.\" This is not very intelligible. I believe, it should be explained as follows. If I have passed with twenty-nine or twenty-eight pips in my hand and another player after me does the same, it is a rule of the game that I (who first had twenty-nine pips in my hand) win before him. So, the phrase applies to the loser. If he had drawn another card, he would probably have become mati, holding more than thirty-one points: reluctant to draw another, he cannot adu or compete with the man who was blit first with the same number of pips as he.\n\nKena ranjau, translated by Mr. Skeat \"to be bluffed,\" I take to be the same as kena das. (Singapore) and to apply to a player who inadvertently or foolishly shows his hand, buka daun, before the rest of the players are all blit or mati or masok mata, and so has to pay up all round by way of penalty.\n\nII. Daun tiga' lei or pakau. Three cards are dealt to each player. The best hands are called daun trus. In Perak and Selangor, the very best hand is three aces: the next best in Perak is three court cards, in Selangor three threes. Then\nfollow in Perak, hands of nine and eight pips; in Selangor, says Mr. Skeat, hands of three tens, and three court-cards in that order and then hands of nine, eight, seven pips and so on in descending order of value. \"The highest hand counting by pips,\" Sir William Maxwell puts it clearly, \"is that which contains the greatest number of pips after the tens are deducted.\" In Perak, \"a hand of three threes is really a good hand, being nine, but it is considered a propitiation of good luck to throw it down (without exposing it) and announce that one is bota in hopes of getting good luck afterwards.\"\n\nApparently, Singapore players recognize a different list of daun trus. The best hand is three court-cards, tiga kuda: the next best is three threes or a nine and two court cards. And then follow hands of nine, eight pips and so on in descending scale. The tens are not used at all. Court cards are valued at zero, except when you have three in one hand and so hold the best possible of daun trus. Three aces are reckoned as three pips only: so, a hand of three aces is absolutely worthless, and a hand of two aces and a court card, for instance, makes you only two pips. If you hold one court card, one ace and one nine, the ace is counted as zero like a court-card and you score nine: so, this hand is one of the daun trus, equivalent to two court cards and a nine.\n\nThen there are the phrases, handak kaki tiga, minta penoh, minta isi, minta kosong, used in the process, mengurut daun. \"A player does not hastily, look at his three cards and learn his fate at once,\" says Sir William Maxwell, \"but he prolongs the excitement by holding his cards tight together, and looking alternately at the outside ones, and last of all at the middle one, sliding out the latter between the two others little by little. Thus it is left uncertain for some time whether a card is an eight or a seven, a nine or a ten.\" Handak kaki tiga is a player for a six, seven or eight cards having pips in rows of three. If after seeing my top and bottom cards I want the remaining card to have no pip in the centre; if, for example, I want a six and not a seven or eight, I am said to minta kosong: if, on the contrary, I want a pip or pips in the middle of the\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nthird card, want a seven or an eight, I am said to *minta isi*, or *minta penoh*. Many players make a clicking sound like one encouraging a horse, if they want a *kuda* or court card.\n\n**Main trop.** The following are some terms in connection with this game which I have failed to find either in Skeat or in Wilkinson's Dictionary.\n\nIn *main trup*, when a player leads a trump card, his action is described by the words *sudi* or *juru*. Diamonds are sometimes called *batu Malacca* or *dobin* (or *jubin*: Jav. = square flag-stones) spades, *payong*. *Bibi* is used of the Queen. If I and my partner have already got seven tricks between us, I ask him *kiler-kah atau kot-kah*: should he hold no more cards of value in his hand, he says *kiler* and the game is over; should he hold high cards and thinks we can take all the tricks, he says *kot* and we play on in the hope that our opponents may *kena kot*, not score a single trick; but, if any of our tricks are lost, the tables are turned and we ourselves *kena kot balik*. *Mita sus* is to ask for special cards from one's partner. There are numerous masonic signs accounted by Malay gamblers proper and clever, but which we should call cheating. Thus, to open one's hand of cards fanshape like opening an umbrella is to call for *payong*, spades: brush the edge of your cards along the table and you ask for diamonds, because thus the *batu Malacca* is cut: lift your cards quickly and you ask for the card with the *flying animal*, *klawer*: want hearts and you describe on the table a circular movement with your hand of cards. Of course, you and your partner must be accomplices and your sleights pat and deft.\n\n**Main daun cheki.** The following is a complete list of the names of these cards as given me:\u2014*iyu merah besar, iyu merah sa'krat, iyu kuching, iyu kasut, iyu budak, iyu panjang*: *kau merah, kau jalan, kau kurap*: *sah waji, sah burong, sah halus*: *si lebai, si trubu, si pingyung*: *chek laier, chuk burong, chek halus*: *lah tuli, lah krang, lah halus*: *peh pichak kapala, peh krang, peh pinggang* (or *tali*): *go babi, go tongkang, go pending*: *ji gendang, ji pentil, ji bengkok or burong*. Cho it and chochot are names of two species of *main cheki*.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nA List of the Butterflies of Borneo,\nand Nymphalinae.\n\nBy R.

The different forms of the polymorphic female of this species have been given a great variety of names and the result is that the relationships between the different forms and between topomorphic varieties are much obscured. I believe that three fairly distinct female forms and three only can be recognised, viz.:\n\n1. A form mimicking both sexes of the species of the sub-genus *Danisepa*, to which the name *isa*, Moore may be applied; *alcatheoides*, de Nias *danisepa*. Fruhst, *pfeifferoides*, Fruhst. etc., are merely more or less well-marked varieties of this form; in Borneo or elsewhere this form is highly variable and no two specimens exhibit identically the same markings.\n\n2. A form mimicking a *Euploea* such as *Penoa uniformis*, to which the name *uniformis*, Fruhst. may be applied;\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nthe specimen figured by Moore in his Lepidoptera Indica. Plate 204 fig. 1, 1 a may be considered a typical example of this form.\n\n3. A form mimicking species of the sub-genus *Trepsichrois*; the *nyctelius* of Doubleday and the *cinnamomens* of Wood-Major.\n\nForm No. 2 seems to be intermediate between *isa* and *nyctelius* and I am sure that if a large number of these polymorphic females could be collected from a very wide area a graduated series between extreme forms of *isa* and of *nyctelius* could be constructed, unfortunately the females of this species are very rare and it will be long before this ideal can be attained; in the meantime to recognise in the distributional area of the species merely three female forms with distinctive names or numbers appears to be less confusing than to name indiscriminately every topomorph differing from closely related topomorphs in most trifling details.\n\nGenus *Cupha*.\n\n106. *Cupha crymanthis*, Drury.\n\n*Papilio crymanthis*, Drury, Illust.

Like many other members of the genus the larva is gregarious; it bears a close resemblance to the larva of a day-flying moth *Hypsa* sp. which is also gregarious. Mr. H. N. Ridley, Director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens found a number of the Hypsid larvae grouped\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nclosely and symmetrically around the end of a flower-stalk, the group looking like a large conspicuous fruit. The pupa of *Cethosia hypsea* is at first pure white with a few brown and yellow blotches, but it gradually becomes a pale brown. The adult is one of the commonest butterflies in Borneo and I have no doubt that it is a very distasteful species; when on the wing it is not at all unlike the widespread *Limnas chrysippus* and it may be considered as an \"incipient mimic\" of that species.]\n\n111. *Cethosia biblis*, Drury.\n\n*Papilio biblis*, Drury, 111 Exot.

Marshall (of Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond.) from his breeding experiments with African species of *Precis* afford convincing proof of the extraordinary plasticity of the species of this genus and until similar experiments are conducted with the Indo-Malayan species we can have no worthy evidence of the constancy of the sub-specific or geographical forms distinguished by Fruhstorfer (Berl.

The dorsum of the first abdominal segment is covered with greenish-grey hairs.\n\nUnderside. Olive, brown; on the forewings the markings are much the same as on the upperside, but the\ncell has a whitish streak closing it and two transverse brown lines between the discoidal streak and outer spot; the sub-marginal series of spots is indistinctly doubled and suffused slightly with violaceous; on the hind-wings the abdominal margin and greenish, there is a whitish mark below the pre-costal nervure, the discal band is still more reduced than on the upperside, the inner sub-marginal series is whitish and with internervular obsolete dashes, brown in colour passing from it inwards, the outer series is violaceous.\n\nBody and legs beneath greenish.\n\nExpanse, 51 mm. Hab. Mt. Matang, 3200,' Sarawak (June). Type and only known specimen in the Sarawak Museum. The species is remarkable for the great reduction of the white markings on the upperside.\n\n[A little detail in the markings on the upperside of species of the genus Athymae seems to have hitherto escaped notice. In nearly all the species\u2014A. sclenophora, Koll. and A. zeroca, Moore are exceptions,\u2014the transverse discal white band of one hind-wing is continuous with the corresponding band of the other wing by means of a patch of white hair covering the dorsum of the first abdominal segment; in the males of A. sclenophora and A. zeroca the discal bands are broader and are more oblique and so touch the abdominal margin of the wing at a lower level than they do in such a species as A. kresna, Moore, and we find that the band of one wing is not connected through an abdominal tuft of white hair with the other band; in these details of markings at any rate these two species approach the genus Limenitis but it is interesting to note that the females have these discal bands more transverse and connected one with the other across the abdomen in the manner so characteristic of other athymae. The species of the genus Neptis which serve as models to so many mimicking Athymae in no case known to me have the discal bands of the hind-wings connected by an abdominal patch, even\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nthough these bands in many species are quite as transverse as in characteristic Athymae. The presence of a tuft of white hairs on the dorsum of the first abdominal segment, forming a connection between the discal band one of hind-wing and that of the other wing is then quite an important character of the genus Athymae, it is present in a modified form in A. euloca, milsi, in correlation with the obsolescent discal bands of that species.\n\nGenus Adolias.\n\n167.

Lep. ii. p. 291, pl. 44, fig. 3 (1850).\n\nTenasserim, Malay Peninsula, Great Sunda Is., with a sub-species in Nias.\n\nSub-genus *Cognitia*.\n\nThis sub-genus is in the greatest confusion and a recent paper by Fruhstorfer (Berl. Ent. Zeitschr. XLIV. pp. 121\u2014155 1899) has not cleared matters up very much; in fact until the opposite sexes of several of the species have been taken in coitus, the numerous types compared and the genital armature of the males dissected out no satisfactory revision of the sub-genus can be made.\n\nFrom Borneo seven species have been recorded:\n\n1. *Euthalia ambalika*, Moore.\n2. \" *vacillaria*, Butl.\n3. \" *diardi*, Voll.\n4. \" *asoka*, Feld.\n5. \" *magnolia*, Stand.\n6. \" *gopi*, Moore.\n7. \" *gandava*, Voll.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe habitat of the last two species is extremely doubtful, in fact the only locality quoted for *E. gandava* is \"0.072 meter,\" *E. gopia* may possibly be from the Malay Peninsula. *E. magnolia* is a Kina Balu species and *E. asoko*, Feld. has been wrongly recorded from Borneo as it has been confused with *E. vacillaria*. The remaining three species are found in Sarawak; specimens of all three have been taken at various times of the year at and around Kuching and in my opinion the species can be readily distinguished one from the other.\n\nExamples of both sexes of the three species have been sent to the late Mr. L. de Nic\u00e9ville, to Herr Fruhsstorfer and have been compared with specimens in the British Museum (Natural History) named and as arranged by Dr. A. L. Butler; although I have not invariably found myself in accord with the opinions of these distinguished lepidopterists I am none the less deeply indebted to them for their valuable information and I have not found it impossible to reconcile their rather diverse opinions with what I consider to be the facts of the case.\n\n*Euthalia vacillaria*, Butl. was described in 1868 from a female only, the male has never been described although male specimens agreeing exactly with male specimens in the Sarawak Museum collection stand under the name *vacillaria* in the British Museum collection. A description of the male follows:\u2014**Upperside**\u2014Very like the male of *Euthalia ambalika*, Moore, but the apex of the forewing is distinctly falcate, the pale blue fascia of the forewing is narrow and ends, as a rule, just below the lowest sub-costal nervule, on the hind-wing above, below the costal nervure is a large patch of black androconial scales, **Underside**, dull brown ochreous, the margin of the forewing from just below the apex to the second median nervule lilacine grey\u2014Expanse 60 mm.\n\nThe falcate forewing and the large patch of androconial scales are the salient features of this species. This\nspecies may perhaps be only a sub-species of *E. gsoka*, Feld. from the Malay Peninsula but for the present it will be advisable to keep the two forms separate.\n\n*Euthalia ambalika*, Moore was described in 1859 from a female and nine years later a male described by Butler* was associated with this female but this male is really the male of *E. diardi*. On Mt. Penrisen in 1898 I observed an undoubted female *ambalika* with a male hovering round her and following her from one resting-place to another, fortunately I was able to secure both specimens and I have no doubt that they are the opposite sexes of the same species. The male differs from the male of *E. vacillaria* in the following points:\u2014\n\nThe apex of the forewing is not falcate; the blue border of the forewings extends to near the apex of the wing and internally it is deeply but narrowly notched; the patch of androconial scales is small or absent; the colour of the underside is bright ochreous. The male is very variable in size and rather variable in colouration, the blue band of the upperside often being tinged with lilac and the underside is sometimes rather sullied the markings sometimes being clear sometimes obsolete. The female has no blue band on the upperside of the hind-wings. *E. ambalika* is possibly a sub-species of *E. puseda*, Moore from the Malay Peninsula, *E. blumei* Voll. from Java being another.\n\n*Euthalia diardi*, Voll. was described in 1862 from a female. The male is to be distinguished from the corresponding sex of *E. ambalika* by the following points:\u2014the blue fascia of the forewing is broad and extends to the apex of the wing; the blue fascia on the hind-wing is very broad; the androconial scales are reddish brown; the underside is not bright ochreous.\n\n---\n\n* Herr Fruhstorfer informs me that a specimen of what I consider to be the true male of *E. ambalika* is identical with the co-Type of *E. diardi* in his collection.\nbut dull brown shaded with blacine near the apex of the forewing and on the sub-discal area of the hind-wing. The female is readily distinguished by a broad band of blue on the hind-wing. The species is probably merely a local race of *E. cocytina*, Horsf. from Sumatra.\n\n172. *Euthalia cynitia vacillaria*, Butl.\n\n*Adolias vacillaria*, Butler, P. Z.

In the past, species were described from single male and female specimens in the most reckless manner, whilst more modern authors appear to have shirked a careful revision of the group yet have not refrained from adding to the number of species in it, and the result is\u2014chaos. For my own part I can do no more than give an annotated list of the species found in Borneo; still, such local lists are the necessary preliminaries to an accurate revision of the entire group. It may be remarked *en passant* that many of the characters whereby the sub-genus *Nora* can be distinguished from *Euthalia* in its restricted sense are rather obscure e.g. the patch of glandular scales on the hind-wing of the male is very variable and it occurs moreover in many species of *Euthalia*; in the absence of the\nfemale sex of a species, it is often difficult to state whether that species should be referred to the subgenus Nora or not, the pattern on the underside of the wings is perhaps as good a character as any other.\n\n179. *Euthalia (Nora) ramada*, Moore.\n\n*Adolias ramada*, Moore, Trans. Ent. Soc. London, 1859, p. 69, pl. 4, fig. 5.\n\nSub-sp. *E. ramada surjas*, Vollenh.\n\nThere is no constant or essential difference between *E. surjas*, Vollenh, and *E. limbata*, Fruhst. (Berl. Ent. Zeitschr. XLIV. p. 140 1898). I have Herr. Fruhstorfer's authority for regarding *E. limbata* (i.e. *E. surjas* as a sub-species of *E. ramada*. The typical form comes from Malacca the sub-species seems to be confined to Borneo. The female of this species has yet to be determined with certainty Dr. Butler considers A. M. N. H. (7) vol. viii. p. 356 1901) that the female of *E. indras*, Vollenh is undoubtedly the female of *E. ramada*, whereas Herr. Fruhstorfer (l.c. p. 124 regards it as the female of *E. bipunctata*, Vollenh. Either authority may be right for the females of the species of Nora are most remarkably similar, but any opinions as to the correct pairing of the various species must be pure guess work until the respective sexes are actually captured in coit\u00fb. For reasons stated below I do not consider it at present advisable to sink the name *E. indras*, Vollenh. as a synonym of any other species.\n\n180. *Euthalia (Nora) laverna*, Butl.\n\n*Adolias laverna*, Butler, Cist.

Soc. 1893, p. 45.\n\nFrom Borneo and the Malay Peninsula.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nButler now regards (A. M. N. H. (7) vol. viii. p. 357' 1901) his type female as equivalent to *E. somadeva*, Feld., a species described in 1867 from a single female specimen said to come from N. India and the male of Felder's species he considers to be *E. cordelia*, Fruhst., even though Fruhstorfer has described that species from both male and female specimens. Moore (Lep. Ind. vol. iii. p. 110) considers both the male and female of *E. laverna* Butl. to be the same as *E. somadeva*, Feld. All this is the purest guess work and for the present I prefer to let Butler's name stand and to exclude *E. somadeva* from the Bornean fauna until further evidence of its habitat is forthcoming. So far as I know Butler having relegated to *E. somadeva* his type \u2640 *laverna* has not described what he considers to be the true \u2640 of the species.\n\nIn Northern Borneo, the bluish-green colour on the upperside of the hind-wings in the males becomes replaced by violaceous and the hind-wings of the females also become slightly tinged with this shade, whereas in South country females the hind-wings are brown; it is interesting to note that in the genus *Tanacia* there is a similar tendency towards a violet colouration of the hind-wings in species from Northern Borneo, Southern forms being more or less unicolorous.\n\n181. *Euthalia (Nora) Cordelia*, Fruhst.\n\n*Nora cordelia*, Fruhstorfer, Berl. Ent. Zeitschr. XLIV. p. 121, (1899).\n\nConfined to Borneo.\n\nThis species with its aberration *ilka* from Kina Balu is very close, perhaps too close to the preceding species, but it occurs in the same area with it and is constantly different from it though only slightly.\n\n182. *Enthalia (Nora) indras*, Vollenh.\n\n*Adolias indras*, Vollenhoven, Tijd. Ent. p. 194, pl. 11, fig. 2, (1862).\nConfin\u00e9d to Borneo.\n\nThe species was described from a female specimen, which as already stated has subsequently been associated with *E. ramada*, Moore by Butler and with *E. bipunctata*, Vollenh. by Fruhstorfer. Here occurs in Borneo however a species, represented in the Sarawak Museum by a series of seven male specimens for which no name can be found; the species is allied to *E. laverna* but is abundantly distinct from it and in conjunction with the late Mr. de Nic\u00e9ville I regard this as the male of Vollenhoven's species. As already emphasised the pairing of species of *Nora* from cabinet specimens can only be provisional speculative and it is equally probable that (i) Vollenhoven's type female is a distinct species or (ii.) the female of *E. ramada*, Moore. It certainly is not the female of *E. bipunctata*, Vollenh. for that species has a female very like the female of *E. merta*, Moore also a *Nora*. The insect that I consider to be the male of *E. indras*, Vollenh. is now described:\n\n**Upperside**\u2014Uniform olive-brown with the following markings:\n\nForewing, an angulated submarginal series of sagittae, white outwardly bordered with fuscous, the white becoming obsolete towards the external angle of the wing; a series of five white hasteal markings internal to the submarginal series but fusing with it in the upper discoidal interspace; the fuscous lines in and below the cell are arranged as in *E. laverna*, Butl. Hind-wing, a submarginal series of fuscous sagittae bordered both internally and externally with a shading slightly paler than the ground colour; markings in the cell as in *E. laverna*, Butl.; below the costal nervure and occupying the basal costal and basal subcostal interspaces is a distinct patch of blade androconial scales which show up very clearly against the olive-brown of the rest of the wing.\n\n**Underside.**\u2014Almost the same as in *E. laverna*, Butl. but less ochreous and the outer border of all the\nwings tinged with lilac; on the hind-wing the submarginal sagittae are much more clearly defined.\n\nThe hind-wing is more quadrate than in *E. laverna*, Butl. and the anal angle much more rounded. Expanse 49 mm. (*laverna* 52 mm.)\n\n183. *Euthalia (Nora) indistincta*, Butl.\n\n*Nora indistincta*, Butler, A. M. N. H. (7) Vol. viii. p. 366, (1901).\n\nConfined to Borneo.\n\nThis is yet another species described from a single female specimen. Butler suggests the possibility of this being \"the female of an insect which has been regarded as the male of *N. indras* but which is much darker and redder on the under surface, and decidedly larger than the male of that species might be expected to be.\" The male alluded to by Dr. Butler and compared by me with specimens in the Sarawak Museum is quite a different species from the male just described as the male of *F. indras*, Vollenh. It is much larger, expanding 65 mm., the hind-wing is not so quadrate and the anal angle not pointed; the markings and colouration of the two species are very similar, though in the larger species there is a shading of green at the external angle of the forewing above. The species is even closer to *E. laverna*, Butl. than is *E. indras* 3 mihi and it might well be a seasonal place of that species. Butler's type female is certainly distinct from the other female *Noras* found in Borneo, but there is no particle of evidence to shew that it is the opposite sex of the male alluded to by Butler.\n\n184. *Euthalia (Nora) bipunctata*, Vollenh.\n\n*Adolias bipunctata*, Vollenhoven, Tijd. Ent. 1892, p. 191, pl. 10, fig. 5.\n\nFrom the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Banka.\n\nJour.

Grose Smith associated with his male type the female of another species of this group of *Euthalia*, a species subsequently described by Fruhstorfer as *E. adonia montana*.\n\nThe females of these two species have been confused with each other, which after all is not surprising both species occupying the same area viz., Mt. Kina Balu and other mountains in Borneo; *whiteheadi* is however also found, though rarely, in the low-country and the Sarawak Museum collection contains a male and female\ncaught together, close to Kuching; the female is very like Distants figure of *Euthalia adonia* \u2640 (Rhop. Mal. pl. XIX fig. 11) and there is therefore no doubt that *whiteheadi* is a local race of *adonia*, not of the very different species *lubentina*.\n\nThe typical form of *adonia* occurs in Java and Sumatra *whiteheadi* is confined to Borneo, other sub-species are found in the Malay Peninsula, Lombok and Palawan.\n\n188. *Euthalia* (*Euthalia*) adeona, Gr.

Ridley.\n\nThe expedition to Christmas Island undertaken by Dr. Hanitsch and myself accompanied by the two Assistant Taxidermists, De Fontaine and Ahwang, the plant collector Kassan and two boys, started for Christmas Island on September 20th, 1904, in the S.S. \"Islander,\" and reached Anjer Point on the 23rd. The weather was bright and fine with a fairly strong breeze. Little of note occurred on the way except that I may record seeing no less than eleven *Attagen minor* together at one point in the Banka Straits, a moth, *Ophideres* sp. flew on board when we were nearing Anjer and well out of sight of land, and a snippet probably *Tringa* sp. flew round the ship.\n\nThe boat arriving at Anjer at night 7.30 remained till 11 but it was too late to go on shore. After passing Anjer Point the sea became very rough and we only reached Christmas Island on Sunday (25th) evening at five o'clock, too late to land baggage. That evening we remained on board till next day when all was safely landed and conveyed to a house kindly put at our disposal by Mr. Macpherson.\n\nDuring the transit from Anjer the beautiful orange tropic bird *Phaethon fulvus* appeared first about midway between Java and Christmas Island. This bird was originally described from specimens of unknown locality. It appears to be almost confined to Christmas Island, but is said to fly as far as Southern Java. A large brown shark and a turtle were also seen on the way over.\n\nAfter landing our baggage we made an excursion up towards the waterfall as far as the first Reservoir, collecting plants and insects, and on the following day I walked to the\nwaterfall, Dr. Hanitsch finding quantities of interesting specimens did not go as far. The walk about five miles is very picturesque. After passing through the Settlement one rises across two raised reefs, past the tram line which conveys the phosphate to the tip whence it travels by overhead wires to the wharf, and above the first reservoir arrives at the plateau. Here the flora is quite different from that of the reefs, or terraces as Andrews calls them. The seashore trees Guettarda, Gyrocarpus, Berrya, Kleinhovia disappear together with the Abutilons, Croton caudatus, Acronychia etc. The plateau forest chiefly consists of Eugenia, Barringtonia, Pisonia, Cryptocarya Sideroxylon, while Randia, Suprosma, Corymbis, Ardisia and ferns form the undergrowth. The soil is dark brown and powdery, but here and there masses of coral reef protrude. The big crab, Birgus Latro and the smaller burrowing red crab, Ge\u00e7arcinus are very abundant. Sea birds are absent though occasionally they may be seen crossing above the forest. The large pigeon Carpophaga is abundant and its cooings can be heard far and wide. The hawk, (Astur) is frequently seen, and the ground pigeon Chalcophaps and the thrush are abundant. Whiteeyes Zosterops, the swift Collocalia and in the evening the small bats only occur along the cleared tracks, and in more open places. The lizards too do not frequent the shadier parts of the forest.\n\nAfter crossing the plateau one descends a steep slope to an open flat spot above the sea where are a few native houses for the men employed at the pumping station by which the water is pumped in iron tubes to the Settlement along the track. The water comes out abundantly flowing as it seems always to do from spots where the coral reef overlies the basalt. There are three more small streams along the coast to the north. Where the water comes out of the rock a small pool has been made in which are numerous small freshwater crabs and prawns, not previously recorded from the Island. The flora of this point includes numerous plants not met with on the other coast\u2014Calophyllum inophyllum big trees with more straight and tall stems than one usually sees, Ochrocarpus ovalifolius, Wedelia, Cyperus pennatus, a shrub suspiciously\nlike *Clerodendron inerme* but of which I could never find a trace of flowers or fruit, *Crinum asiaticum* and *Ipomea pesca-pr\u00e6* were abundant there also.\n\nNext day was devoted to the flora of the Cove and beyond Smith Point. Here just beyond the Magistrate's house there is a short track to the point, a mass of sharp-pointed coral with the regular seashore trees, *Pisonia grandis*, *Ochrosia*, *Ficus retusa*, *Pandanus nativitatis* forming dense thickets while on the barer rocks overhanging the sea are bushes of *Pemphis acidula* and *Scoevola* with much of the grass *Isch\u00e6mum*, and *Euphorbia hypericifolia*, and I added to the flora here *Cyperus Iria*, and a small *Selaginella* of which one or two bits were found growing in a hole in the rocks over the sea. Further search on several occasions was not rewarded by a single scrap more of this unexpected find. The great and continued hot and dry weather had dried up many of the smaller herbaceous plants, and this plant should be carefully sought again in damper weather. There is a fine view from Smith Point both into Flying Fish Cove and to North West Point and it is possible to push along the cliff edge by tracks used by fisherman for some way.\n\nDr. Hanitsch meanwhile had found a small puddle of water on the top of a rock containing Copepoda, which were carefully collected. A number of interesting plants were collected including fruiting specimens of *Acronychia Andrewsi*. The fruit, not previously described, is a small juicy flesh-coloured berry *Erythrina indica* was in flower and visited by numerous white-eyes which sought for insects among the scarlet blossoms. The tree appears not to be common now and I saw it nowhere else but here and round the Cove. I picked up flowers of it in the same district when I visited Christmas Island fourteen years previously. Among the rocky woods beyond Smith Point I found a large puffball about 4 inches tall with a broad stalk and a rounded top, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ inches through. It was of a pale fawn colour outside, but when the outer coat was rubbed off bright yellow beneath, the flesh was white. There were a good many of the soft fungi to be found in the earlier part of our visit, in shady places, but as the country got dryer\n\nR. A Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nthey were more scanty. Among them I several times found two species of *Coprinus* both resembling species I have met with in Singapore, but these are so delicate and fugacious that before we could get them home they had utterly perished. *Polypori*, *Polysticti* and other woody fungi were very abundant on decayed wood and a large number were collected. I noticed in them a great scarcity of beetles. Usually these woody fungi are the prey of innumerable beetles of several different groups, but here I could find few or no traces of these insects even in old specimens. Two of the fungi here are eaten by natives. One is *Hirneola Anricula-Juda*, the well-known Jew\u2019s ear fungus, known to Malays as chendawan Telinga.\n\nThe other is a white agaricus which is very common on dead wood, a very poor kind of food.\n\nIn the evening I walked along the cemetery road collecting.\n\nOn the next day, 29th, I walked with Mr. Macpherson to Phosphate Hill, and examined the quarries. Many of the introduced weeds from Flying Fish Cove have found their way up here already, the seeds carried up doubtless on the clothes of the coolies, but besides these I found the common grass *Setaria glauca* and the little yellow *Convolvulus Ipomea chryseides* there which I found nowhere else, both new records for the Islands. Pigeons were very abundant here, as the trees on the fruit of which they particularly feed were bearing heavily. These trees are *Sideroxylon* and *Cryptocarya*. The coolies here were felling many trees to clear the ground for further excavations, and this gave me an opportunity of getting good specimens of the above mentioned trees.\u2014*Hernandia* and a common tree with bipinnate leaves and rather hard green drupes. Of this latter I was never able to procure flowers, and have not yet identified *Tristiriopsis nativitatis* Hemsley but it was not obtained apparently by Andrews. Passing through the coolie lines, we went along a track which had been cut for drainage and abandoned, and came to the edge of a high cliff from which could be obtained a beautiful view of North East Point.\nLooking down on the two great terraces lying below and running parallel with the coast line it was difficult to believe that we were looking down on the tops of trees over 100 feet tall. So dense and equal were they, that one seemed to be looking on grass and bushes. The cliff is about 600 feet above sea level, and nearly vertical, but it might be possible to descend it. The three terraces are distinct to the North but one runs out a little beyond the point where we were to the South where apparently at some time a good deal of stream denudation has taken place. This track was said to have been first made by Mr. Andrews so that we named its terminus Andrew's Lookout. Here grow several plants of interest. Just above the Lookout, were a number of gigantic smooth barked trees bare at the time of my first visit but at the end of our stay revisiting the spot they bore pinnate leaves, red when young, and panicles of small white flowers, with blackish drupes $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long with acid yellow flesh. They were a species of Hog plum *Spondias*. The trees were too big to climb but we managed to get fallen flowers and fruit and a bough of leaves. This was an interesting discovery as the Hog plums are rather characteristic of Polynesian Islands. None were seen on any other part of the Island, nor on the lower cliffs of the North East Point. The ground was strewn with fallen fruit which was apparently not touched by any birds, or the fruit bats. They were much too far from the sea for the seed to have been washed up into that position, in the present condition of the Island, and the circumscribed area which they occupied, and the piles of untouched fruit beneath the trees seemed to suggest that no bird at present on the Island could act as seed-disperser. On the rocks of the cliff edge, were *Colubrina pedunculata* Baker, a large straggling shrub, just coming into leaf and bearing only the dry capsules of last season, and *Premna lucidula* Miq., a shrub of which we got fruit and flowers later. The common *Croton caudatus* formed troublesome thickets along the edge. It apparently flowers but seldom here, but its brilliant red withering leaves brighten up the woods and make it very conspicuous. *Ficus saxophila* a truly rock or rather precipice loving tree about twenty feet tall, had bright yellow figs on it,\n\nR. A. Soc, No. 45, 1905.\nbut the figs of a tree at Steep Point were bright red. *Crinum asiaticum* a quite typical form is abundant here and all along this coast, growing in holes in rocks in rows on the precipices, a most unusual locality for this plant which one is accustomed to see in the sea sand. I returned by the branch pipe line to the Irvine Hall Reservoir on the waterfall track. In the evening collected among other plants at the wharf, *Ipomea grandiflora* a convolvulus like a poor and small form of the moon flower, *I bona-nox* and found also the pretty moth *Deiopeia pulchella* an insect which contrives to get all over the world, even to England where however it is considered very rare. It is common on the open rocks above the sea, and one came into light on one occasion. The lizard *Lygosoma atrocostatum* is common here, I saw it also on the sea rocks at the waterfall and at the further end of Flying Fish Cove. It never seems to go far from the sea and seldom appears till the evening.\n\nNext day (29th) was spent in collecting in Flying Fish Cove and its vicinity and the following day I started up Phosphate Hill to go to the North East Point by way of the new drainage track from the coolie lines. The descent from the top of the upper terrace is over a mass of talus of coral rock rather steep and slow going, then through sloping woods, chiefly of *Celtis* and *Randia* to the sea cliff edge through a band of Pandanus, a fisherman's track. The scrub is too dense to get far along the cliff edge so we had to go through the wood along the coast line in a northerly direction. Having been informed that it was possible to get round North East Point and return by the cemetery track except for a barrier, which might be and indeed had been successfully passed we went as far as time would permit towards the North East Point intending to return the way we came. Passing through these woods a white egret was seen (*Demiegretta sacra*?) on a spot which appeared to have been a stream. Soon the base of the second terrace was reached, and a troublesome mass of tall sharp rocks covered with a dense grove of pandans was crossed. By no means impossible though rough and wearying; expecting to come to the \"barrier\" we pushed on to a thick but more open bit, whence we returned, and eventually discovered\nthat this mass of rocks and pandans was the terrible barrier, its difficulties having been greatly exaggerated. In fact it is, though a stiff walk, quite possible to walk round the coast from the Settlement round North East Point to the waterfall and so back in the day without much trouble.\n\nOn Monday the 3rd October I went with the plant\u2014collector past Rocky Point along the cemetery road to North East Point till we came to the Pandan Scrub again. *Hibiscus vitifolius* a tall mallow with primrose coloured flowers with a pink eye occurs here scantily. It has not been found elsewhere in the Island. A large shrubby plant like a *Triumfetta*, 6 feet tall with very adhesive capsules covered with viscid hooks, grew in masses. No flowers were seen. I found a mass of its burs adhering to my sock when I got home so sticky were they. *Celtis* was coming into flower as were *Macaranga* and *Grewia*. At one point fishermen or runaway coolies had burnt the scrub towards the sea the result of which was a dense upgrowth of *Gyrocarpus* seedlings now about 8-10 feet tall to the exclusion of almost everything else. While taking lunch a whiteeye flew and settled on my bag where it dropped an ornamental red black and white cricket, new to our collections.\n\nOctober 4th. This morning Dr. Hanitsch and I with the Plant Collectors and Taxidermists, as well as a Chinese pigeon-catcher, Ah Soo, started to explore the plateau ascending by a somewhat difficult passage up the rocks at the Northwest corner of the Cove, known as Tom\u2019s Ladder. This rock cleft was formerly easier on account of a big fig root which served as a hand hold, but it was now dead and rotten and broke in two. However by taking off our shoes with the aid of Ah Soo we succeeded in climbing up. The ground above was a steep earthy slope, with large bushes of *Colubrina* and a short tufted grass. *Panicum* n. sp. new to the flora occurred here, above the plateau is level, and we went along a pigeon-catcher\u2019s track till it joined the Murray Hill Road and brought us out on the pipe-line at Irvine Hall. Ah Soo climbed one of the trees and caught three of the large pigeons with a noose on the end of a long stick, and could\nhave caught two more had we permitted it. The birds which sat together in the top of the tree did not seem the least alarmed at their companions being caught. We were informed that during high wind they never coo, and indeed they certainly were more quiet when the wind blew at all strongly. I may say that I never but twice saw any on the ground. One at the waterfall appeared to be sick or injured, the other was a strong healthy bird. Ferns are abundant on this part of the plateau the ground being covered in parts with a dense carpet of *Acrostichum*. I sought carefully for the *Trichomanes parvulum* but only found its prothalli, perhaps the adults had dried up owing to the heat. In the evening I succeeded in catching the humming bird hawkmoth *Macroglossa* which I had tried several times before to get. It frequented the flowers of *Morinda* at dusk. This far ranging insect had not previously been taken in the Island. The next two days were occupied in exploring Phosphate Hill, and the coast beyond Smith Point. The shore terrace here is very barren the flora being very monotonous, and the greater part of the way covered with pinnacles of coral rock very troublesome to cross.\n\nOn the 7th\u2014all started to the waterfall to camp there for a few days. We obtained through the kindness of Mr. Mcpherson a number of Chinese coolies and the use of a pack pony. For shelter we took two Government tents which were very fine affairs but utterly unsuited to the country, as it required 13 men to carry them which with the very limited number of coolies ever available, makes their use almost impossible. The first plant of note obtained was a grass which made a close soft turf often 6 inches or more deep, on the cliff tops above the sea. It proved to be *Lepturus filifarmis* and I was told that it was a good fodder grass for horses, who would not however eat it until it had been well washed to get rid of its salinity. A number of small brown and green grasshoppers frequented it and were seen nowhere else. They were coloured so like the leaves and stalks of the grass that they were not easy to see and often when pursued dived down among the stems where they could not be caught.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nIn the afternoon I went with Kassan through the woods along the shore to the south towards Steep Point, and after passing through a mass of lofty and picturesque rocks, found a fisherman's track which ran along a projecting point of rocks and ended in a very pretty little bay, with a white coral beach beyond which the big rollers broke over great masses of coral reef, where were many of the splendid large blue fishes which seem constantly to haunt the broken water on the reefs. On the right of the bay facing the sea the rocks were low and broken up into sharp pinnacles, troublesome to walk over. *Tournefortia*, *Scoevola* and a curious form of *Pemphis acidula* were the characteristic plants. The *Pemphis* formed large shrubs more or less erect except where exposed to heavy winds, where they were quite prostrate covering the rocks with a close mat of twigs and foliage, but the most remarkable point about this form was the very thick fleshy leaves, quite unlike those of the common form round Flying Fish Cove, which had the usual rather hard and dry leaves. Its appearance, especially that of the prostrate form, was so different that I took it at first for a distinct species, but the flowers and fruit are identical with those of the ordinary form. A few seaweeds and some fine cowries were obtained on the reef, and then we ascended the higher promontory on the North side of the bay by a fisherman's track. It was covered in part with a mass of the yellow flowered composite *Wedelia*, with bushes of *Tournefortia*, *Pandanus*, etc., but the terminal portion of this promontory consisting of the same brown pinnacles of rock as on the other side produced only the pink-flowered fleshy plant *Sesuvium portulacastrum* not previously recorded from Christmas Island.\n\nAn old Javanese woman at the Waterfall told us that the Sepit as she called it was delicious when cooked and that she was a great hand at cooking it. Though abundant so close to the Waterfall she had no idea that there was any to be got. A day or two later we collected a quantity and had it boiled. It was indeed excellent, tasting like something between French beans and spinach. It requires however a good deal of washing previously as otherwise it is very saline. The plant is one of very wide distribution and occurs on most\ntropical sea coasts in the Old and New Worlds, growing on rocks or mud always close to the sea. From this headland a good view of Steep Rock and South Point can be got. Sea birds were abundant here, and the common boobies were nesting among the pinnacles of projecting rock. The nests were placed on the ground and consisted of bits of stick, birds bones, scraps of Sesuvium, etc. The eggs were two, chalky white and usually dirty. One nest contained two unfledged birds, one of which was dead, Revisiting the spot later I found the dead bird gone and the other apparently dying. Though there were generally two eggs in the nest I never except on this occasion saw more than one young bird in a nest, whether the female bird is unable to bring up more than one at a time I do not know. In or close to the nest was usually a fish to be seen, brought by the parents. The hen bird usually sat alone on the nest, feebly pecking from side to side at nothing when a stranger approached. Occasionally the male sat by her also, but except for the feeble demonstration of anger described they made no attempt to defend the nest. The female when approached too near tumbled and flapped along the ground as if either too stiff with sitting or feebly pretending to be injured. In the trees in the bay a number of young boobies in white plumage sat so tame that they could easily be touched by hand, although they could readily fly. Dr. Hanitsch photographed a group. The small black heron and white egret were also seen in this bay.\n\nOn our way back to camp Kassan discovered a plant of a species of *Balanophora* entirely pale yellow. This was a most unexpected find, as these parasitic plants were not recorded from any oceanic Island previously. Careful search for more produced no result here but I later found another above Steep Rock, and one in the centre of the Island. The plant was growing in loose soil on the shore terrace which was wooded with the ordinary shore terrace trees and covered with an undergrowth of *Dicliptera* and *Asystasia*.\n\nThe next day (8th) I started northwards to the first freshwater stream, a thin flow of water over rounded muddy rocks covered thinly with moss. Here grew the fern\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nNephrodium truncatum and there were abundance of the blue crab with white claws Cardisoma carnifex. This crab is only to be met with round these freshwater streams, and their presence shows the proximity of water. I found some however in the forest about a quarter of a mile from the Waterfall, where no water was visible above ground but there was said to have been a stream there at one time. This is the only crab eaten by the natives, who often bring baskets of them into the Settlement and even take them as far as Singapore. Leaving the wood I went along the coast for a considerable distance and found two more streams similar to the first. In many places the pandans which fringed the coast had been burnt evidently by fishermen to get at the sea cliffs for fishing, and they were often replaced by patches of the saltgrass. At one spot was quite a grove of fine Arengas, the ground beneath being almost bare of vegetation. Epiphytic plants are much scarcer in these shore woods than further inland. A few Saccolabiums only were seen. The grass Ischaemum foliosum so abundant on the cliffs of the North part of the Island, is very scarce on the East and South Coast.\n\nOn the following day I started with the Plant Collector for Steep Point, a great vertical cliff to the south, being especially desirous of finding \"Asystasia coromandeliana\" said to have been collected by Andrews there. As this plant commonly cultivated in Singapore occurs wild only in Africa and India it seemed highly probable that there was a mistake in the identification of Andrews' plant. I was quite unable to find a scrap of it wild or cultivated anywhere in the Island, but a very distinct species of the genus is abundant on the shore terraces near Waterfall and elsewhere. Having walked to the Whitebeach we made our way along the coast over the sharp pinnacles of coral reef to a stream bed coming down over basalt rocks but quite dry at that time. The rocks were covered with the prostrate fleshy-leaved Pemphis with tussocks of Fimbristylis cymosa in the hollows. Then we pushed through a very bad bit of thick scrub which had grown up since the whole of this place had been burnt about a year and a half previously. After climbing up a steep rock face on to a spur\nparallel to Steep Point, we found it was necessary to cross to the main hill through a dense mass of scrub composed chiefly of interlaced *Wedelia* over blocks and pinnacles of coral reef. It was intensely hot, and there was no shade, and the work was extremely arduous and exhausting. Then we had to force our way up the great masses of coral rock covered densely with pandans with cudrania and other climbing plants. The whole of this part of Steep Rock to the edge of the cliff is covered with great masses of rock with deep hollows between and covered with thick growth of climbers, Pandans and Ficus and other trees. After a short rest and a drink of cold tea quite inadequate to allay my excessive thirst we felled an Arenga Palm for the sake of the refreshing cabbage of the bud and sought in vain for the *Asystasia*. Another plant of the *Balanophora* was found, fruit of the big tree *Ochrocarpus*, and some other botanical desiderata. Then crossing the ridge northwards and descending a steep slope of loose blocks of coral reef we made our way across the upper part of the dried up stream, hoping to find water as the streams usually break out at the junction of the coral reef and basalt and then after a short distance go underground again. No trace of water was seen, but pushing on through the forest we met with the fisherman's track and in an hour or so got to the Waterfall and lost no time in slaking our thirst at the stream. There is doubtless an easier way of getting to Steep Point than either the way we went or returned, but it would be necessary to go a good deal further inland well above the source of the stream, and in any case it would be a stiff walk.\n\n10th\u2014Next day, we went along the coast to the South East, descending to the shore where it was possible, which it is at several spots, not far from the promontory which bounds Waterfall Bay on this side. The first descent was made over the basalt outcrop. The basalt here is somewhat columnar and in parts in balls or nodules surrounded and aggregated by crystalline carbonate of lime. A number of seaweeds, *Sargassum*, *Turbinaria*, etc., were collected in the rock pools and *Marisecus albescens* almost out of flower and burnt up by the drought was found, a new record for Christmas Island though.\nit is one of the most widely distributed of sea-shore sedges. In another small bay were found three shells of nautilus, and a rhizome and several cut bamboos, which must have been drifted for a long distance there being no bamboo on the Island. The pieces of bamboo were all dry and the rhizome was probably dead when it reached the Island. Although I sought constantly for washed up seeds, etc., on the shores of the Island I could find very little. Seeds, dead, of *Terminalia Catappa* and *Guettarda speciosa*, both common plants on the sea coast and one broken shell of a seed of *Pungium edule* a native of Java were all I could see. Drift wood was also not common. Perhaps when storms occur more seeds and wood are drifted across from Java and elsewhere. Many years ago I received from Mr. Ross an extensive series of seeds drifted up on Cocos Island and one can hardly doubt that many of the trees and shrubs inhabiting Christmas Island are descended from seed drifted there from more distant localities. I was, however, surprised to find so few drift seeds on the beaches. After dark a Malay man captured a large yellow tabby male cat, which said to have escaped a few years ago from an European had become feral. It was extremely savage and bit and scratched the Malay severely, having grown very large and powerful. Although it had been for some time in the forest it had not wandered far from the Waterfall Settlement, and though there was plenty of food in the way of rats and birds in the forest, it had become a nuisance by killing the chickens belonging to the coolies. After it had been confined in a box for a short time it became quite tame again and before we left was quite quiet and merely kept on a string to prevent its taking again to the woods. When Andrew's book on Christmas Island was published there were no cats on the Island and he deprecates their introduction on the grounds that if it were to increase to any extent the sea-birds would probably be destroyed or diminished in numbers. There are plenty of cats on the Island now but except this one it does not appear that any have taken to the forest, and should they do so they are more likely to destroy the ground pigeon, thrush and whiteeye which are more terrestrial birds.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nthan the seabirds which only roost in the higher branches of the big trees and never come low enough for a cat to catch them. Far more dangerous would be the introduction of the civet cats (*Paradoxurus*, etc.,) as these animals are arboreal and would cause great havoc with the pigeons which they could easily catch. Malays often carry these animals about as pets and some one might perhaps introduce a pair, which would be very regrettable.\n\nOn October 11th we all returned to the Settlement. On the way I found *Pittosporum nativitatis* in flower for the first time. It is a common little tree on Phosphate Hill and parts of the plateau. The fully developed inflorescence is not as compact as it is figured and described in Andrews' book. It is a short but well branched panicle. The butterfly *Junonia villida* was first seen this day, and thence till we left was common though very active and difficult to catch.\n\nNext day was occupied in collecting along the Cemetery Road, and at low tide in the afternoon in collecting seaweeds, shells, etc., on the reef in the Cove. The first *Hypolimnas misippus* was seen this day after which it became very abundant, evidently bred in the Island as the specimens were in excellent condition. Two days later a white butterfly *Pieris* sp. appeared. Specimens were caught later. It was not previously recorded from the Island. The next two days were spent in collecting round Rocky Point, Phosphate Hill and the Cove, and packing live plants to transit to Singapore by the \"Islander\" which had arrived. The whole of the neighbourhood was so dry that not only orchids but palms and ferns were sent dry in wooden boxes and arrived safely and in good condition.\n\nOn the next two days arrangements were made for an expedition to cross the Island over Murray Hill to the West Coast were at Hugh's Dale it was expected to find water. No one on the Island apparently had ever been to Murray Hill by that route, but there was a track for some way known as the Murray Hill Track, starting from a little beyond Irvine Hall. Accordingly tents and provisions were brought to Irvine Hall, and with a number of Chinese coolies the expedition started\non Monday morning 17th at 8 o'clock, Mr. Macpherson and Messrs. Jones and Jackson of the Phosphate Company accompanied the expedition and they with myself preceded the coolies to cut the track and blaze the trees. The track is quite level and goes due west at first and except for a few big fallen trees could be used by ponies, but it was more overgrown further on. At 3 o'clock we cleared a piece of forest and pitched camp, the coolies and Messrs. Macpherson, Jones and Jackson returning to the Settlement.\n\n18th\u2014Messrs. Jones and Jackson came up about 9 o'clock, but the coolies delayed so long that they did not arrive till 1 p.m. We then went on for about 1\u00bd hour and pitched camp again. Messrs. Jones, Jackson and I went a long way on what was supposed to be the right track starting from a spot where encampments had previously been made and where there were traces of four tracks going respectively south, southwest, north west and north. The Southwest Track well marked, was the one taken. The yellow *Ipomea* was very abundant here, and very showy. From the old encampment, supposed to have been used by Ross, one of the party affirmed he saw the sea to the south. The track went southwest chiefly and descended to about 700 feet. The coolies were sent back to the previous camp for the night to come on in the morning. *Birquis* was more troublesome this night, coming into the tents several times. One stole a saucepan, others took away old tins. Pigeons were abundant here, and the hawk is not uncommon. Our water supply was rather short and had to be used with care, and only for drinking and cooking. Close to where the camp was pitched we came upon the very fine *Hibiscus (abelmoschus) Vrieseanus* a tall herb about 12 feet tall densely covered with pungent bristles and with large yellow flowers with a deep claret coloured eye. Also a number of plants of a small ground orchid *Zeuxine* and a single plant of a saprophytic orchid *Didymoplexis*; *Dendrobium* was common here and a *Thelasis* apparently identical with a Javanese species was found on fallen boughs of trees. *Ipomea peltata* with its large yellow flowers was climbing up the smaller trees. The common plateau trees,\nEugenia, Sideroxylon, Barringtonia, Laportea with Randia formed most of the forest, and Guettarda and Ochrosia which do not generally occur on the plateau were both here. A little rain fell during the night. The robber-crabs, Birgus latro, invaded the tents and stole a boot, and a killing bottle, which was found next day broken under a pile of cut bushes.\n\n19th\u2014Messrs. Jones, Jackson and I with Kassan started early, leaving the coolies to follow along the track we had marked yesterday. After a short way we noticed we were descending, and eventually the track disappeared, pushing on we came to a ridge of phosphate of alumina and iron, a curious rock resembling sandstone at first glance. This is the rock abundant at Murray Hill. We then came to an old encampment with a bucket, a tin, a grindstone and a pair of shoes, evidently a very old encampment. The ground descended very abruptly to an old stream bed. We appeared to be near the sea but there were no tracks or blaze marks. As it was obvious we were not near Hugh's dale, we pushed on to find out where we were, and at last got to a cliff edge from which the sea could be seen at our feet. We were on the top of the upper terrace of the south coast about two miles from Egeria Point. The view of this point never yet reached by anyone as far as is known was very fine. The immense vertical cliffs densely covered with trees ran in a curve to the point where we were. Below them was the shore terrace, with at one point as far as could be judged an outcrop of basaltic rocks. Immediately below us was a great densely wooded gorge. It was obvious that no water was to be found here, and it seemed impossible to descend these precipitous rocks. A message was sent back to the Settlement for more water as very little remained. The coolies were sent back and we camped for the night. The forest here was botanically poor, the only plant of interest being Melochia arborea of which a large tree was seen over the precipice. Pigeons were abundant. Dr. Hanitsch took photographs of Egeria Point and of a booby on its nest among the rocks. The Birgus was abundant here, and constantly entered the tents at night. One seized a towel while dinner was being cooked and during\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nthe night one conveyed outside the tent a bottle of quinine lying near my head. It was found open but unbroken a short way off.\n\n20th\u2014We decided to retreat to the Settlement without delay leaving the baggage to be fetched by the coolies who would be sent, as there was hardly any water left, and none to be got nearer than Irvine Hall, and all but Dr. Hanitsch who wished to remain till the arrival of the coolies, and his boy, started at daybreak. Messrs. Jones and Jackson went ahead and met the coolies near the first camp and came back with them. I went to the first camp and remained there till the coolies returned, collecting plants in this district. More *Didymoplexis* and *Balanophora* were found. The whole party having reached the first camp about 2 a quick march brought us clear of the forest and into the settlement before dark. The whole distance appeared to be about 15 miles. As ships were now expected in every day, it was impossible to procure the service of any more coolies till the end of our visit as all were wanted for loading the vessels.\n\n21st\u2014The morning was occupied in changing the herbarium papers and a short walk to Smith Point to try and get more of the Selaginella, but I was not successful. *Heptapleurum* was just coming into flower, though it had shewn no signs of buds before we left the Settlement. Another *Laportea* was also flowering, and a large tree with panicles of yellowish berries and very dark green leaves was met with and eventually with some difficulty as the tree was too thick to climb Kassan got specimens of it. In the afternoon I went to Irvine Hall to bring down some large fruits of the big *Pandanus*, I had left there, and Dr. Hanitsch to Phosphate Hill to fetch away some fossils, etc.\n\n22nd\u2014I went along the rocks beyond Smith Point as far as was possible. It was extremely hot and the vegetation somewhat dried up, so much so that the younger trees of *Ochrosia* were often quite withered the whole day not recovering even after the nocturnal dews. Many of the smaller plants such as Capsicums were also drooping even in the woods. On the rocks beyond Smith Point was a pubescent stunted\nform of *Physalis minima* looking very different from the tall glabrous plant common in cooler and less rocky spots. In the afternoon among other things the climber *Limacia n. sp.* was found in flower for the first time.\n\n24th\u2014Went up to Irvine Hall with my boy, Kassan, and two boatmen and a gardener to stop there the night and start early for the Murray Hill Track next morning. Accordingly started at 6.15 and walked fast to Ross\u2019 camp and started from there along a track to the Northwest, at the commencement of which was an inscription in Chinese stating that it was the road to the big hill and place for water. The track immediately disappeared and the woods proved very dense. Here I noticed upwards of a hundred Birgus beneath an Arenga devouring the fruit. They had eaten almost every seed rejecting the pulpy outside cracking and eating all the seeds with their powerful jaws. After pushing a long way and finding no track or rise, I thought it advisable to return and found the men behind had neglected to mark the track properly, so that we had some difficulty in finding the way back. After a short rest returned to Irvine Hall and after a cup of tea back to the Settlement. The whole time occupied in walking was ten hours and a half. It is clear that it is practically impossible to get to Murray Hill and back in the day, unless the track was specially opened beforehand. A few specimens of various plants were obtained and the phosphate rock again met with. *Dendrobium* sp. was in flower.\n\nNext day I went to North East Point collecting flowers of *Pisonia excelsa* which are white and scented like almonds, and *Croton caudatus*, just coming into flower.\n\n26th\u2014To Andrews Lookout, crossing Phosphate Hill. Here I found large trees of *Spondias* in flower with fruits also. The trees were too big to climb but we were able to find fallen sprays of flowers and plenty of fruit and to get leaves. *Premna lucidula* a small straggling tree was in flower as was *Crinum asiaticum* but this latter on the face of the precipice was inaccessible. A fine cycad was seen in the wood growing on a rock.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n27th\u2014To the foot of Tom\u2019s Ladder in Flying Fish Cove, where *Polypodium Phymatodes* new to the flora was found growing on the cliffs of coral reef, but only a few plants. The way along the foot of these cliffs is troublesome being a steep mass of coral reef talus, after passing which one comes to the outcrop of basalt and ash, with a talus of fine dust often difficult to cross. It was extremely dry here and many of the plants were quite dried up. This is the only place at which I found the peculiar grass *Panicum Andrewsii* which was almost quite withered up. The pink flowered *Boerhaavia* grew upon the rock faces. To add to our difficulties at one place stones were falling from the top of the high cliff. Finally coming to an impassible precipice I descended by a long slope to the Cove.\n\nThe next day the \u201cIslander\u201d arrived I walked over to the Waterfall and got *Ipomea biloba* in flower and *Nelochia* also. The 29th was spent chiefly in collecting plants for cultivation near Tom\u2019s Ladder and while so doing I found a single plant of the rare *Asplenium* on the cliff there. Next day explored the cliffs behind the Cove further towards the East, but got but little of interest. Part of this route requires careful climbing as the rocks are often loose and dangerous. A very large rock shifted its position while I was passing it and fell on my leg, but I fortunately managed to get from under it as it fell and escaped with a deep bruise, otherwise it would certainly have broken my leg. Further on we came to a spot where by the aid of fig-roots it is possible to climb up to the plateau where there is a track leading to the pipe-line and so to the Settlement.\n\n28th\u2014The first rainy day since our arrival, raining almost all day. The \u201cIslander\u201d left the next day for Singapore. There were heavy rollers for the first part of the day and steady rain for most of the voyage which ended at about 7 p.m. on November 2nd.\nThe Botany of Christmas Island.\n\nThe first collection of plants made in Christmas Island was that of the expedition of the Flying Fish under Captain Maclear, in 1886, but a few plants only were then obtained. In 1887, H. M. S. Egeria visited the island and remained ten days during which time Mr. J. J. Lister, naturalist to the expedition, collected plants, animals, and rocks but was unable to penetrate into the centre of the island. The account of the plants obtained on these two expeditions was published by Mr. Hemsley in the Journal of the Linnean Society vol. XXV p.351. They amounted to about 52 specimens of flowering plants, 17 Ferns and Lycopodiaceae, and 8 cellular cryptogams. As previous to this time no settlement had ever been made on the island nor any ships except a few whalers, and other vessels touched there, the flora was in its unaltered primitive state and no weeds of cultivation had made their appearance. The collection however was by no means complete even for the area visited, but many of the endemic plants were collected.\n\nIn 1888 (November) Mr. Clunies Ross settled there, and from this period dates the introduction of the weeds and plants generally introduced by human agency.\n\nIn 1890 I visited the island in the gunboat \"Redpole\" landing at Flying Fish Cove, and spent about 10 hours there, during which time I collected as many plants as I could, in the Cove and up as high as the Plateau. As I was chiefly interested in the indigenous plants at that time I paid less attention to the introduced species, but noted Hibiscus abelmoschus, and Spilanthes acmella neither seen since; Paspalum sanguinale and Eleusine-indica. An account of this trip was published in the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Asiatic Society, vol. 22, p.123.\n\nDuring their residence the Ross family introduced a number of useful and ornamental plants many of which are still to be found in the Settlement and with these a number of weeds must have been introduced.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nIn July 1897 Mr. C. Andrews visited the island and remained for upwards of a year, during which he made extensive collections, and explored a good portion of the island. The account of his expedition appeared in 1900 as \"a Monograph of Christmas Island\" published by the trustees of the British Museum. He added a large number of species to the known flora; many indigenous ones, and about a dozen introduced plants or weeds which had more or less established themselves.\n\nAt that time clearings were being made and roads cut, and since the opening up and development of the Phosphate quarries, there has been an influx of Chinese, who have brought in their train a number of cultivated plants and weeds. Practically however the greater part of the island is quite unaffected by these arrivals, which have only spread in Flying Fish Cove, along the Cemetery road, and round the Phosphate hill quarries, and also on the cleared ground at the waterfall. At the time of Mr. Andrew's visit no herbivorous animals except one goat had been introduced, but since then a few cattle and some horses have been brought, and these perhaps are responsible for the appearance of some weeds, such as *Amaranthus viridis*, and *Panicum colonum* which not rarely spring up where the dung of these animals is dropped. In the collections made by myself in 1904 there are a number of introduced weeds not obtained by Mr. Andrews, as well as some indigenous plants which were either overlooked by him or not in flower at the time of his visit.\n\nThe collection although made at a very dry time of the year, as not a drop of rain fell till quite the close of our visit, contained nearly all the flowering plants and ferns previously collected, as well as the novelties alluded to.\n\nThe plants not seen by me on this occasion were *Spilanthes acmella* and *Hibiscus abelmoschus*, introduced and fugacious weeds; *Cerbera odollam* found by Andrews at Rocky Point, which has since been much cleared for coolie lines, and the tree perhaps destroyed; *Remusatia vivipara* in the old path to Phosphate hill, which has perhaps been destroyed by the formation of the tip for the Phosphate, at the end of the\ntram lines, or the plant may still be there and simply dried up at the time of our visit for I sought carefully for it in vain. *Lastr\u00e6a intermedia* collected by Lister, and apparently not by Andrews I did not see, nor *Sagenia polymorpha* found by him, not common at North West point, a locality I could not get to. Some other plants mentioned in previous lists are obvious and others doubtful misidentifications. Lister's collections are preserved at the Royal Gardens Kew and Andrews' at the British Museum and I have not had the opportunity of seeing them.\n\nThe collections made in 1904 included as can be seen a good many additions to what was previously known and contained the first collection of marine Algae from the island. It is only possible to get to the sea in a very few places, on account of the height of the cliffs, and the impossibility of using a boat with any degree of safety. In many places from the top of the cliffs one can see the rocks beneath the surface clothed with masses of *Turbinaria*, *Sargassum* and many other Algae, far out of reach, and doubtless there are many yet to be collected. I have to thank Mr. and Mrs. Gepp of the British Museum for identifying the Mosses and Algae, and some other plants. The fungi and some of the Lichens were identified by Mr. Massee of Kew Gardens and other plants by Mr. Hemsley of Kew. A few plants were met with without any trace of flowers or fruit, one a shrub closely resembling *Clerodendron neriifolium* near the waterfall; a big liane common in the forest; and a small tree with lanceolate leaves common on the plateau, and of *Tristiriopsis Nativitatis* very common in Flying Fish Cove and which was first collected in fruit by Lister and again in fruit by me, the flowers are as yet unknown.\n\nI do not think it at all probable that the whole of the flora even of the flowering plants and ferns is yet known. Many of the indigenous plants were very local, and considering the large area of the island which is practically inaccessible as yet, especially the south coast, and the fine cliffs of Egeria point, one may expect that a number more plants will be found whenever it is possible to explore these parts, and even in the more accessible parts it is probable that many\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nsmall plants will be met with which were dried up at the time of our visit.\n\nNative Names. Mr. Andrews in his account of the flora gave a number of native names which he had obtained apparently from the Javanese temporarily employed on the island, but these are of little importance, as nearly all are either blunders by ignorant natives or expressions made up on the spur of the moment. Thus *Pongamia*, well known as Malapari is called Kayu Kwat, simply \"strong wood.\" *Ochrosia* is given as \"Gundra Roussa\" presumably a blunder for Gendarusa, (*Justicia Gendarusa*) from some fancied resemblance of the leaves to those of the *Justicia*; *Berria Ammonilla* is given as Boognor, but it is really known in the island as Bungoh i.e. *Lazerstr\u00e6mia*, no doubt on account of its hard wood; *Pisonia excelsa* is called Jamboe (i.e. Jambu), that is an *Eugenia* (*Jambosa section*). No Malay who knew anything about the plants would make such a mistake as this if he saw the tree, nor would he call *Kleinhovia Laban* i.e. *Vitex pubescens*. A few of the names of very common and well known plants are correct Javanese names, such as Ketapan, Waroo, Dadup.\n\nDistribution of the species. In giving the distribution of any given species of plant, writers are apt to be very casual in their localities, Malaya for instance is by some authors made to cover anywhere from Tenasserim to the Philippines, including three or four quite distinct floras, and plants are described as \"widely spread in tropics\" when in fact their area is circumscribed to a small portion. The importance of distributional notes depends entirely on their accuracy and their value consists in the light that they throw on the origin of the flora. Comparatively little literature and herbarium material is at my disposal as I write this, but I have given as many distributional notes as I can get, and tried to distinguish indigenous plants (i.e. plants which have arrived at the locality without the direct or indirect\naid of man) from those which have been so introduced which I class as weeds. In order to make the distinction clear, I have given in all important cases the date of the first collecting of these plants. The earliest list, that of Lister published in 1888 in the journal of the Linnean Society, though only a small collection, contains only two plants which one would suspect to be weeds, viz: *Datura*, and *Fleurya*. There is absolutely no evidence of any one's having settled on the island previously to the visit of the Egeria. There may have been wrecks, and doubtless there were and whalers had touched at Flying Fish Cove. Dampier sent a boat on shore on the south west point. But these visits would not be likely to bring introduced weeds, like *Datura* and *Fleurya*, which seem only to occur round Flying Fish Cove, and not in the further side of the island where most of the earlier landings seem to have been made. We may take it then that all the plants collected by the Flying Fish and Egeria parties are indigenous, and Christmas Island may be considered the only Oceanic Island of which the flora has been collected when in its original state and before the appearance of man and his concomitant weeds.\n\nThe settling of the Ross family not long after dates, the first invasion of weeds. Mr. Ross brought many plants to cultivate both useful and economic. Whether in pots of soil or packing or in other such ways, a number of weeds arrived, most if not all these came from Cocos Island and Java. A number of these were seen or collected by myself in 1890, but the few hours at my disposal on that occasion were more devoted to the indigenous flora. More weeds had appeared by the time Andrews made his visit, and about then commenced the influx of Chinese, who often carry pot plants about with them, as well as vegetable seeds, etc. Then cattle and horses were imported, and these added yet more weeds, both in fodder brought with them and in that which they had eaten on the way. Thus I found in 1904, more weeds than Andrews had collected.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThese weeds though in many cases very abundant now in the Settlement and the clearings on Phosphate hill and by the waterfall have not spread to any distance beyond, not even along the fishermen's regular routes.\n\nThe following is a list of weeds of the island, (excluding plants merely planted intentionally which have spread of themselves such as Papaya, Capsicum and Melia) arranged according of the date of their first record.\n\n1890.\nHibiscus abelmoschus.\nSpilanthes acmella.\nPanicum sanguinale.\nEleusine indica.\n\n1897.\nGynandropsis pentaphylla.\nAgeratum conyzoides.\nSynedrella nodiflora.\nIpomea digitata?\nSolanum ferox.\nStachytarpheta indica.\nEnphorbia pilulifera.\nPhyllanthus Niruri.\nTrema amboinensis.\n\n1904.\nCleome viscosa.\nCardiospermum Halicacabum.\nLudwigia prostrata.\nTurnera ulmifolia.\nIpomea chryseides.\nAmaranthus viridis.\nA. paniculatus.\nPeperomia exigua.\nEuphorbia thymifolia.\nCyperus Iria\nPaspalum conjugatum.\nPanicum colonum.\n\nR.

Linn. Soc. l. c. 352) remarks \"most of the plants could not be exactly matched with their congeners from Java but yet do not sufficiently differ to be specifically distinguished, an indication of considerable age of the flora,\" and indeed this is so, for besides these distinguished as distinct species several others are very unlike the plants as we know them from surrounding countries, eg., Randia densiflora, Callicarpa longifolia; Ochrosia Ackeringae and Leea sambucina. Still it must be taken into consideration that the locality where these plants grow is very unlike their habitats in Java and the Malay Peninsula. The soil is very rich in phosphates and lime, and extremely porous, so that in the dry season it becomes extremely dry, the water soak-\ning through the ground till it reaches the basalt. Many of the plants grow on bare rocks of coral reef, others in masses of coral detritus. What wonder that plants growing on such soils and with such a climate should differ from those growing in permanently wet woods with rich humus and little lime and phosphate. Compare the damp dark forests rich in humus with little lime which *Carymbis veratrifolia* inhabits with the dry powdery dust of phosphate of iron and alumina and broken coral reef in which *C. angusta* grows; the damp clay banks where *Asystasia intrusa* lives, with the coral talus which *A. alba* frequents; the low lying damp open country inhabited by *Callicarpa longifolia* with the plateau woods where the variety *glabrescens* grows and one can not wonder these forms are very distinct.\n\nIt must be remembered that we have as yet no complete knowledge of the floras of the adjacent islands, and it is probable that some of these endemic species will be found again in other Malayan islands. Some of the plants indigenous to Christmas Island and not classed as endemic are as yet only known to occur in one other spot, e.g. *Balanophora insularis* and *Dendrocolla carinatfolia* in Pulau Aur, an island lying off the eastern coast of Pahang, and *Sideroxylon sundaicum*, on Pulau Sangian.\n\nThe greater number of the indigenous species however differ little or not at all from the forms known elsewhere, though there seems among the trees to be a tendency to greater size, probably due to some extent to the absence of competition, of the plants found elsewhere than in Christmas Island, nearly all have been recorded from Java. The exceptions are.\n\n| Plant Name                  | Locations                                      |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| *Ochricarpus ovailfolius*   | Admiralty Islands and Timor Laut                |\n| *Strongylodon ruber*        | Andamans, Ceylon and Polynesia.                 |\n| *Inocarpus edulis*          | Polynesia.                                      |\n| *Quisqualis indica*         | Burma, Malay Peninsula.                         |\n| *Blumea spectabilis*        | India, Ceylon, Malay Peninsula.                 |\n| *Sideroxylon sundaicum*     | Pulau Sangian.                                  |\n\nJour.

The importance of these to the coolies working on the Island as well as to the Europeans need not be dilated on.\n\nThe fruit trees included:\n\nPomegranate (more valuable perhaps for its anthelmintic roots). Custard-apple, Bullock\u2019s Heart, Sapodilla, Pumelo, Orange and Limes, Papaya, Pineapple (Mauritius pines only), Tamarind, Coconut, Lime-berry and Bananas. All fruit well here, and there was a good supply of most of them. The limes and orange trees were however much attacked by scale insects. Directions for cleaning them were given to the Manager. Mangosteens had been planted and I heard also that Durians had been introduced. A few dying mangosteen seedlings were all I saw. Soil and climate is not suitable for these. Of other fruit trees were single specimens of Jambu Bol, Jack and Mango, none of which had fruited. Coconuts grow and fruit well in the Cove and appear sufficient in number to supply all local needs.\n\nVegetables. The Chinese have one or two gardens for vegetable cultivation in which grow Dolichos Lablab (Karas bean) Kachang Prut Ayam, Luffas, Waxgourd, Bottlegourd, Peria, Chives, Chinese lettuce, Kangkong, Bayam, Sweet.\npotato, Brinjals and Indian Corn; Chilies have run wild everywhere. Dal and Haricot beans, mentioned by Andrews as cultivated I did not see and of other plants in cultivation mentioned by him Sugar-cane, Bamboos, Nutmeg, and Cocoa, have also disappeared. The dry calcareous soil is not suited for these plants. A few ornamental plants are cultivated but more might be done in this way. There are a few good trees of Kapok, a candle-nut tree, Liberian Coffee, doing well but the trees are getting old. Lemongrass, and a good supply of Tapioca. The attention of the Magistrate was called to a number of thriving plants of the very undesirable Indian Hemp (Ganja) close to his house carefully planted and protected by his gardener.\n\nFodder plants for the horses and cattle are practically restricted to *Oplismenus undulatifolius* which is abundant in many of the woods and is collected and brought in by the grass cutters. There is also *Digitaria sanguinale* and I also found recently introduced *Panicum Colonum* and *Paspalum conjugatum* both in very small quantity. The latter when it gets to the cooler and shadier parts of the island will probably spread, and is a good fodder grass. The rest of the grasses in the island are unsuited for fodder. The horses however eat greedily many of the weedy herbaceous plants such as *Synedrella* and *Ageratum* when young. More might be done in introducing fodder plants as there seems rarely to be sufficient. The soil in a good part of the island is hardly deep enough for much cultivation, but behind the Settlement is a good area tolerably flat in parts of rich brown earth, in which beans, pines, bananas, etc., grow well. A good deal of this is still covered with secondary scrub which could be cleared and used as a fruit and vegetable garden. The difficulty of cultivation in the dry island lies in two factors, the excessive drought in the dry season, accentuated by the porous nature of the soil which does not retain water, and the great mist of sea spray which covers the Cove, and the cultivated area at the Waterfall during the rough seasons. At the latter place where sweet-potatoes were being cultivated the natives told me that the plants were destroyed every year\n\nJouf. Straits Branch\nin the stormy season by the heavy masses of sea spray thrown up by the waves.\n\nThe peculiarity of the soil very rich in phosphate, and lime also must be unsuitable for many plants. The area at present available for cultivation of any trade products is too small for more than experimental work, but a good many more vegetable and fruits might be successfully grown. I brought and gave to Mr. Macpherson who took a good deal of interest in plant cultivation, suckers of pine-apples, and seeds of the cherry tomato. This plant had run wild in Fernando de Noronha, an island very similar in many respects to Christmas Island, just as the Chili has there, and its small sweet fruits were found to be very refreshing, and could be gathered in basketsful from the rocks among which it grew. The birds in Christmas Island would soon disperse the seed and it would probably soon become abundant. The only wild eatable fruits on the island are those of Sideroxylon which somewhat resemble cherries and the kernels of the Ketapang and *Inocarpus edulis*, the Otaheite chestnut, which I was somewhat surprised to find no one on the island seemed to know was eatable. When boiled it has quite the taste of a Spanish Chestnut but it is very much larger.\n\nThe following is a list of all the plants cultivated at present or previously recorded in Christmas Island. The amount of cultivated land is very small. A number of the plants in this list were introduced by Mr. Ross and others later by the employ\u00e9s of the Phosphate Company, of the trees I saw frequently but one specimen.\n\n1.

It hardly occurs on the plateau and I saw it not on the other coasts. The timber of the Eugenia, the biggest tree on the island is fairly good but is not what would be classed as a first class wood. *Sideroxylon* has a white wood, good for planking, etc., but not as good as the wood of most trees of the order, *Sapotaceae*. *Cordia*, the iron wood of Cocos Island, is a first class wood but\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905\nthe trees are scanty and small here. *Ochrosia*, *Pongamia* and *Cryptocarya* also give useful woods. The Katapang is larger here and with harder wood than I have seen elsewhere. In fact it appears to be too hard for practical purposes. The so-called wild coffee, *Randia densiflora* var. supplies excellent walking sticks and umbrella handles, and as there is often a considerable demand for these they might at some time be an article of export.\n\n**The Collection Made:**\n\nConsidering the time at our disposal and the difficulty of getting to further parts of the island a very complete collection of the flora was made which not only added a very large proportion to the plants previously known, but has enabled me to correct a number of misidentifications in previously published works, of previously unrecorded species; a certain number, not very large, were plants introduced accidentally after Andrews' visit; the others were plants obviously overlooked by him. I do not think that even yet we have got a full list of all indigenous species as it is probable that in the at present inaccessible parts of the South and West other plants will be found. I met with three trees and shrubs not previously noticed by other collectors on which no trace of flowers or fruits could be found. They were quite common but I failed to identify them, and doubtless there are others in further parts of the island. A large number of fungi too were collected which had not previously been recorded and others of this group will probably be met with in more suitable time of year.\n\nThe greater part of the flora is however known now.\n\n**The Flora Dicotyledons.**\n\n**Menispermaceae.**\n\n*Limacia nativitatis*, n. sp.\n\nA tall woody climber with slender branches. Leaves (young) elliptic orbicular, (older) lanceolate subacute mucronate 2-3 inches long 1\u00bd-2\u00bd inches wide above glabrous dark green beneath pubescent with yellowish\nhairs especially dense on the midrib, nerves ascending 2 pairs petiole 1 inch long geniculate densely pubescent. Racemes 3 inches long not branched slender, rachis pubescent. Flowers yellow in distant tufts of 5 or 6, shortly pedicelled. Bracts linear pubescent. Sepals 6, 3 outer ones linear spathulate pubescent, 3 inner ones broader obovate obtuse, pubescent on the back. Petals smaller sub-spathulate glabrous. Stamens 6 glabrous, 6 filaments broadly linear, anthers introrse 2 celled, grooved. Fruit not seen.\n\nCommon near Flying Fish Cove and towards Rocky point and on the Plateau.\n\nThe plant which climbs on the smaller trees covering them with a thick mat of foliage, only came into flower shortly before we left, and I only obtained male flowers.\n\nIt seems most nearly allied to *L. borneensis* Miq. and is remarkable for its simple racemes of flowers.\n\nThe genus *Limacia* extends from Tenasserim and Cochin China to the Malay peninsula and archipelago. The fruits are drupaceous.\n\n*Tiliacora racemosa* forma, is given without special locality in the Monograph of Christmas Island. It is an Indian plant. I have not seen it here and would suggest the plant referred to this species may perhaps be the preceding.\n\n**CAPPARID\u00c6.**\n\n*Gynandropis pentaphylla*, Dec.\n\n*Pedicellaria pentaphylla* Schrank.\n\nWas collected in the settlement by Andrews.\n\n*Cleome viscosa*, L.\n\nA few plants were met with on the coral beach in the Flying Fish Cove.\n\nBoth of these tropical weeds occur occasionally in cultivated ground, and often disappear again as quickly as they come.\nCrucifer\u00e6:\n\nSinapis nigra, L.\n\nI found a single stunted plant of what appeared to be this in waste ground near the quarries on Phosphate hill evidently an escape from cultivation.\n\nPortulacace\u00e6:\n\nPortulaca oleracea, L.\n\nThe common Purslane is abundant in Flying Fish Cove and also at the Waterfall.\n\nThis plant was not obtained by any of the previous collectors and is probably a recent introduction. It is a widely distributed weed occurring in all warm countries on sea shores and sandy or open places. It is described by Hemsley (Voyage of the Challenger, Botany vol. I. p. 35) as certainly sea-dispersed, and so it seems to be as it occurs on almost all oceanic islands, but it is also apparently carried about accidentally by man, and then readily spreads, as it is often abundant in estates and waste ground where there seems no other reason for its presence. Hemsley talks of it too as a cultivated plant, and thinks that its wide distribution may be due to that cause. I have never seen it cultivated in the East, nor used by any native race for food, certainly neither Chinese nor Malays eat it here so still less do they cultivate it. Into Christmas Island it certainly seems to have come as an accidental weed, as it did not occur in any place where other weeds had not already come, or where there had not been some cultivation close by. I do not know whether it has ever been recorded that this plant closes up its leaves at night, like Phyllanthus and other such plants.\n\nPittosporace\u00e6:\n\nPittosporum nativitatis Baker, was described in the Monograph of Christmas Island p. 171, fig. XVII, from plants collected by Andrews on the plateau on the East Coast. It is\nabundant on the upper terraces at the cemetery, and Phosphate hill and also on the Plateau. It is a small tree 12 to 14 feet tall, with the foliage much like that *P. ferrugineum*, common, near the sea and in dry places inland. The flowers as described by Baker are in compact heads at first but the panicle opens out later and is nearly as wide as that of *P. ferrugineum*. They are of the same yellowish white colour as those of that species. It appears to be fertilized by wasps.\n\nThe fruit is a capsule and appears to resemble that of *P. ferrugineum*, the seeds of which are dispersed by birds.\n\n**GUTTIFER\u00c6.**\n\n*Ochrocarpus ovalifolius*, T. Anders.\n\nA large tree with very coriaceous oblong dark green leaves, and white flowers solitary or in pairs on the bare portion of the branches below the leaves. Fruit oblong conic eventually brown.\n\nAbundant on the first terrace from North East point to steep point, collected on the East Coast also by Andrews. The plant, known as Nyampon, much suggests *Calophyllum* in habit, but with much larger leaves. The fruits are probably sea drifted. I found a number of them under a rock in the woods at the waterfall, which had been carried there and eaten by rats. *Ochrocarpus ovalifolius* is a native of the Admiralty islands, Timor Laut and Pulau Sangian.\n\n*Calophyllum Inophyllum*, L.\n\nThis common sea shore tree is not as plentiful as would be expected in Christmas Island being confined so far as I saw to the vicinity of the waterfall, where there were a number of tall trees of it. It was not in flower at the time of our visit, but weeds and fruit were obtained. The locality was on the basaltic outcrop or very close to it, and it was probably due to the volcanic soil or to the neighbourhood of subterranean water that it grew there. This tree is common in the\nPolynesian Islands, Malay Archipelago, and Peninsula, India and Mascarene Islands, and is always to be found near the sea, though it will grow in open country inland. The seeds are often drifted about in the sea, but are dispersed inland often by fruit bats.\n\nMALVACE\u00c6.\n\nMalvastrum tricuspidatum, A Gray.\n\nA low shrubby plant with buff yellow flowers, occurs in Flying Fish Cove. It was also collected by Andrews. I saw it nowhere else. It is widely distributed but absent from many places, occurring in Africa, India, Australia, Cocos, and South America, probably introduced in some of these localities.\n\nSida spinosa, L.\n\nAn erect shrublet with buff yellow flowers grew also in Flying Fish Cove near the last species and I also found it along the cemetery road. Not previously recorded. A sea shore plant occurring in America, India, Malayan peninsula and islands. Australia and Africa.\n\nAbutilon auritum, Sweet Hort, Brit. 1 p. 58.\n\nA tall shrubby plant 7 or 8 feet high, much branched pubescent leaves ovate cordate obtuse 4 inches long three inches wide edge crenulate light green pubescent, petiole 3-4 inches long. Stipules ovate \u00bc inch long. Panicles terminal lax with branches 4 or 5 inches or more long pubescent. Pedicels \u00bd inch long. Sepals ovate subacute \u00be inch long green woolly pubescent. Corolla an inch across, petals obovate minutely mucronate bright orange yellow finely striate. Staminal tube much shorter with 6 filaments. Fruit \u00bd inch long of 9 carpels.\n\nCommon all round Flying Fish Cove to Smith point, and to North East point along the Cemetery road. On the lower terrace. Flowers opening in the afternoon.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nTHE BOTANY OF CHRISTMAS ISLAND.\n\nCollected also by myself in 1890 and by Andrews. This plant is figured (Bot. Mag. t. 2495) with pink buds and stamens, and the *Sida atropurpurea* Bl. Bijdr. is said to be the same species. There is no pink or purple about the Christmas Island plant and I do not see why Blume gave his name to the plant. He does not describe the colour.\n\n*A. auritum* Sweet, is recorded from Java, Timor, Philippines and Queensland New Caledonia.\n\n*A. Listeri* Baker, fil. Journ. Bot. 1093 p. 269.\n\nA shrubby plant about 6 feet tall, much branched, branches slender scabrid not pubescent. Leaves ovate cordate acuminate minutely stellate hairy on both surfaces but chiefly on the back 4 inches long $2\\frac{1}{4}$ inch wide. petiole slender 2 inches long. Panicles few flowered or flowers solitary axillary on slender pedicels $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long, Calyx $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long lobes ovate acuminate closely pubescent. Petals oblong obtuse $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch long orange yellow, stamens yellow, free portion of filaments as long as the tubular portion. Carpels densely covered with irritating hairs.\n\nCommon all round Flying Fish Cove, Rocky point, Cemetery road, and lower part of Phosphate hill, and at the Waterfall. Endemic. First collected by Mr. Lister.\n\nThe *Abutilons* are among the showiest plants in the island. They open their flowers in the afternoon.\n\n*Hibiscus vitifolius*, Linn.\n\nA tall slender plant about 6 or 8 feet tall, branched, stems velvety pubescent. Leaves ovate cordate or hussate acuminate or shortly three lobed irregularly crenulate and very variable in size $1\\frac{3}{8}-4$ inches long 1-2 inches wide light green velvety pubescent. Panicles small terminal. Flowers shortly pedicelled, Calyx tube globular lobes triangular lanciolate grey pubescent $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long, Corolla $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long prim rose yellow with a purple\ncentre. Rare, North East Point on the shore terrace. Collected there also by Andrews.\n\nRather a small flowered form with the leaves less lobed than usual. This plant seems to be common in Ceylon and India, and occurs in Moa, Java, Timor and Australia but is absent from the Malay peninsula. It is apparently a weed of cultivation in waste ground in Ceylon, but it grows far away from any cultivation in Christmas Island.\n\n*H. Vrieseanus*, Hassk Pl. Jav. Rar 1048 p. 304.\n\nStems about 12 feet tall \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch through pale green brittle with a large pith inside, densely covered with transparent pungent bristles. Lower leaves cordate suborbicular with 6 acuminate points, edge between waved and serrate, nerves 6 to 8 upper leaves more distinctly lobed 6 inches long seven across, quite glabrous on both surfaces except for some scattered, bristles on the upper nerves, petiole 8 inches long thickly around with pungent bristles. Raceme a foot or nine long bristly. Involucral bracts 1 inch long acuminate lanceolate setose sparingly except the edge which is densely setose. Bracts broadly triangular acuminate \\( 1\\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long. Calyx spathaceous. Corolla 6 inches across, lobes rounded expanded, pale lemon yellow with a maroon eye. Pistil conic densely setose. Capsule conic on a 2 inches peduncle, over 2 inches long 5 angled densely spiny setose. Seeds sub-globose pubescent.\n\nIn the centre of the island on the track to Murray hill in thick scrub. Also obtained by Andrews, in a valley on the West Coast.\n\nThis beautiful Mallow, is I think certainly what Hasskarl intended by his *H. Vriesianus*, a very little known and apparently rare plant. It differs from his description slightly, the leaves can hardly be said to be lobed, and are nearly glabrous and the fruit cannot be described as small. *H. Vriesianus*, was obtained originally in Java, and does not seem to occur elsewhere. The\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nplant is undoubtedly indigenous to Christmas Island. It occurs in the dense woods of the interior. It is very difficult to see how it has got there.\n\n*H. Abelmoschus*, L. The musk seed was found by myself at my first visit near the settlement. It is common cultivated plant, and no doubt had been introduced. It has since disappeared.\n\n*H. tiliaceus*, L.\n\nThis sea shore tree is abundant in Flying Fish Cove and at North East point and also at the Waterfall, growing as usual close to the sea. It is common on all the sea coasts from Polynesia, to Sandwich Islands, Galapagos, Malay islands, Cocos, Pitcairn Island, to the Malay peninsula. First collected in Christmas Island by Lister, also by Andrews. The seeds are sea borne, and the flowers fertilized by *Megachile* sp.\n\n**STERCULIACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Kleinhovia Hospita*, L.\n\nA large shrub or tree about 20 feet tall with panicles of rose pink flowers very showy. Fruit capsular, with small seeds. Common on the lower terraces Rocky point, Phosphate hill, etc. First collected by Andrews. The plant is quite typical. The distribution is Philippines, New Guinea, Java, Banka, Malay peninsula, India and Ceylon and East Tropical Africa. In the Malay peninsula where it is not common, it occurs on river banks. I suspect this plant is dispersed by sea but am doubtful as to how it comes to be widely spread. It does not seem to be a typical sea shore plant.\n\n*Triumfetta suffruticosa*, Bl.\n\nA large branched shrub, stems hairy with pale appressed hairs. Leaves alternate ovate orbicular cordate acute crenulate, sprinkled with stellate hairs on both sides\n(young leaves densely pilose) 3 inches long and as wide, petiole sub-glabrous \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) to 3 inches long. (Flowers yellow). Fruit spike 3 to 4 inches long densely crowded. Capsule 4 or 5 celled; about 1 inch across including the bristles, on a pedicel \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long, cells densely covered with hooked bristles covered with white hairs, cells one seeded seed \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long ovoid pustular-dotted.\n\nShore terrace North East point and on Steep Rock. Not previously collected.\n\nI believe this identification is correct, as Blume's description fits the plant, but it was out of flower at the time I collected it. I do not understand however how Dr. Stapf (Flora of Kinabalu) says it is closely allied to the weedy narrow leaved *T. pilosa* Roth, no two plants of the same genus could be more diverse.\n\nThe distribution given for the species is Lousiade Archipelago, Solomon Islands, Timor Laut, Java, Borneo (Mt. Kinabalu). The fruit is extremely adhesive, and clings to clothing like burrs. It is doubtless distributed by adhering to birds feathers.\n\n*Melochia arborea*, Blanco.\n\nA soft wooded tree about 15 feet tall with a simple stem and a large head of foliage. Flowers in corymbs, small pink with an ochre spot in the centre. Fruit capsular with winged seeds.\n\nOne tree seen in Flying Fish Cove, one at the waterfall and one on the South Coast. Not previously collected. Distribution: Philippines, New Guinea, Java, Borneo, Indian, Malay Peninsula and Mauritius (doubtfully wild).\n\nI am doubtful as to how this plant is disseminated.\n\n*Tiliaceae*.\n\n*Berria ammonilla*, Roxb.\n\nA tree with light colored bark; leaves ovate acuminate, base broad truncate or cordate glabrous 3-8 inches\nlong, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to 5 wide, primary nerves 4-5 pairs, petiole slender 1-4 inches long. Panicle 4 inches long, flowers numerous small $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch across white. Pedicels $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long covered with stellate pubescence. Calyx capsular four lobed, lobes broadly ovate, covered outside with stellate pubescence. Corolla lobes 4 oblong longer obtuse white. Stamens innumerable short, anthers cordate. Capsule 6 to 8 winged, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch across the wings, wings in pairs to each cell, papery red brown oblong rounded $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch long glabrous; seeds one in each cell obscurely angled nearly $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long, fuscous densely covered with stiff red hair.\n\nCommon along the shore terraces from Smith point to North East point, much more scanty on the Plateau. This plant was very early observed though it does not appear in Hemsley's list of plants collected by Lister. Its hard wood was mistaken for teak, and from this error apparently arises the statement first made by Hemsley that *Tectona grandis* occurs in the island. So conspicuous a tree as this latter could not have escaped Andrews nor myself, so that it may be considered that there is no evidence that the true Teak, (*Tectona grandis*) occurs or ever did occur in the island. *Berria* I found in flower and fruit in October, and in fruit also on the occasion of my first visit and also received a fruiting specimen from Mr. Keyser collected in August. It is called Bastard-Teak and Bungor (not Boognor as in Andrews' list) which is the ordinary Malay and Javanese name for *Lagerstroemia*. Probably the Javanese considered its wood to resemble that of the *Lagerstroemia*.\n\nExcept for the much smaller flowers, little over a quarter of an inch across, I see very little difference between this plant and the typical Ceylon plant, which has flowers $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch across.\n\nThe distribution of the Berrias and of this species seems very curious. One or two distinct species occur in Tahiti and *Berria amonilla* is found in the Cumber-\nland islands, East of Queensland\u2014a distinct variety, Christmas Island and Ceylon and is probably native in Southern India.\n\nThe fruit is winged as described, but from what I saw of it does not fly any distance from the tree. When ripe it dehisces letting out its seeds which are covered with appressed hairs. It is not usual to find a winged fruit which dehisces before germination of the seed, and though I would class this among wing-fruited plants, I think it most improbable that the fruit with its seed could have been brought to the island by wind, as it dehisces so soon that the seed would probably be dropped out before it reached the island. It is more likely that the seed is dispersed by sea currents.\n\n*Grewia osmoxylon*, n. sp.\n\nTree, about 30 feet tall. Leaves lanceolate acuminate with a broad or rounded base serrate\u2014crenate 4-6 inches long 2-3 inches wide, glabrous, nerves 6-7 pairs petiole hardly \u00bd inch long sprinkled with a few stellate pairs. Racemes axillary or terminal wider an inch long 4 or 5 flowered, rachis pubescent. Buds globose grey pubescent. Sepals linear oblong 5\u00bd inch long white, rather coriaceous, pubescent outside. Petals \u00bc length rounded base pubescent. Stamens yellow shorter than the sepals very numerous. Fruiting racemes elongated slightly drupes in pairs, pyriform \u215b inch long pulp thin testa bony, one celled one seeded. Rocky point and North East point. \u201cKayu Wangi.\u201d Baker. fil. in the Monograph gives the Kayu Wangi as *Grewia laevigata* Vahl, but this is described very differently by Miquel. In his description, the plant is a shrub with not more than three nerves to the leaf, which is pilose in the nerve axils, and the drupes are puberulous with 4 to 2 pyrenes. I cannot think that this description can possibly apply to the Christmas Island scented wood, nor can I find any description to fit this plant. The fruiting specimens sent me by Mr. Leach, are\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nprobably not ripe but the seeds are hard and the embryo firm in texture. They are remarkably small for a *Grevia*. The tree was commencing to flower shortly before we left the island and seems abundant along the Cemetery road as far as N. E. point, along the shore terrace.\n\n*Gr. insularis*, n. sp.\n\nTree about 20 feet tall, shedding its leaves after fruiting, twigs densely stellate hairy. Leaves ovate subacute with a rounded base, crenulate 3 inches long 2-2\u00bd inch wide sprinkled all over but especially on the nerves with stellate hairs, petiole densely stellate pubescent, \u00bc inch long. Racemes axillary \u00bd inch long in pairs or three densely stellate pubescent. Flowers in umbels of 3 on each raceme, pedicels \u00bc inch long. Buds oblong pubescent. Sepals linear oblong woolly pubescent \u00bc inch long yellow. Petals oblong \u2153 of the length of the sepals pubescent at the base. Stamens \u00be the length of the sepals. Fruit not seen. North East point, fairly common. I cannot identify this with any other described species.\n\n**Rutaceae.**\n\n*Acronychia Andrewsii*, Baker. fil. Monogr. Christmas Island P. 174.\n\nA small tree attaining a height of about 20 feet and sometimes more, bark pale. Leaves bright green trifoliate flowers in short axillary panicles. Fruit a small pale pink berry.\n\nCommon, Smith point, Cemetery road. Endemic. The fruit doubtless eaten by birds.\n\n**Meliaceae.**\n\n*Melia azederach*, L.\n\nThis tree is evidently introduced; the biggest specimens occurring at the police quarters close to Cassiu\nsiamea and Eriodendron, but it has spread abundantly all over Flying Fish Cove and up Phosphate hill and round the coolie lines there. It forms with Trema Boehmeria etc., a great portion of the secondary jungle which springs up after fallowing. The drupes are certainly eaten by birds and the seeds so disseminated. It is absent from all parts of the forest which have not been cleared, and is certainly not native.\n\nDysoxylum amooroides, Miq. Ann. Mus. Bot. v. 4, p. 16.\n\nA very big tree, 60 to 90 feet or more, tall leaves 18 inches long, leaflets glabrous membranaceous, 6 pairs, the lowest smallest, oblong lanceolate acuminate inaequilateral, alternate 6 inches long by 2 inches wide \"Panicle extra-axillary, the branches spike-like or branched with few branches. Flowers sessile. Calyx 5 sepalled villous outside. Petals yellowish pubescent outside.\" Capsule 1-1\u00bd inch long pyriform or sub-globose coriaceous wrinkled orange, 4-split, seeds \u00bd inch long ovoid angled indian red with thin testa.\n\nCommon in the forests of the plateau and descending to Flying Fish Cove. The tree was fruiting at the time of our visit and the ground in some places was strewed with the seeds. Obtained first by Lister, but too incomplete for identification by Hemsley, who describes the tree as 13 feet through. I never saw any nearly as big as this.\n\nDistribution, New Guinea and Java.\n\nThe seeds are certainly eaten by birds;\n\nBurserace\u00e6.\n\nTristiriopsis Nativilatis, Hemsley.\n\nTree 40 to 60 feet tall with grey bark. Leaves bipinnate, in young plants much branched about 2 feet long, adults 6 inches long, leaflets alternate 6 pairs or fewer oblong lanceolate petioled, young serrate, adult\nentire coriaceous, 2 to 4 inches long \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) to \\( 1\\frac{1}{2} \\) inches wide, nerves about 9 pairs, petiole \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. All glabrous except for tufts of hair in the axils of the nerves on the back. Inflorescence in leaf opposed panicles. Flowers not seen. Peduncles in fruit \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long. Calyx persistent 5 lobed to the base lobes \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch ovate obtuse pubescent. Drupe 1 inch long green ovoid beaked, base stalked, 3 celled, pericarp thinly pulpy, cell walls woody, hairy within.\n\nFlying Fish Cove, Phosphate Hill, Plateau No. 67.\n\nThis was mentioned by Hemsley in Journ. Linn. Soc. XXV. (1890) p. 353, as \"Burseracea?\" Flowers have not yet been obtained and though it is common in Christmas Island, Andrews does not appear to have collected it. Identified by Mr. Hemsley.\n\n**Celastrin\u00e6.**\n\n*Celastrus paniculatus*, Willd.\n\nA small tree, Rocky point (Andrews). I saw what I suppose to be this plant in the same locality but it was flowerless and also without fruit.\n\nDistribution Indo-Malaya.\n\n**Rhamnace\u00e6.**\n\n*Colubrina pedunculata*, Bakes fil. Monog. Christmas Island 195.\n\nA straggling tree, with ovate leaves and flowers in axillary cymes, on long peduncles. Fruit subglobose capsular dehiscing irregularly \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) inch long; seeds hemispheric with a rounded back and broad inner faces, bright brown polished and very smooth.\n\nNorth coast, (Andrews) abundant on the upper cliff above Flying Fish Cove, and at Andrews Lookout on Phosphate hill. In dry places. It was in fruit at the time of our visit, Andrews found it in flower in February, Endemie. This is a plant of very different habit\nfrom *Colubrina asiatica* the common Malayan species, being a much bigger and more tree-like plant, with very different leaves as well as its much longer inflorescence. It appears to shed its leaves almost completely after fruiting. *C. asiatica* is a sea shore and open sandy country plant.\n\n**Ampelideae.**\n\n*Cissus repens* Lam.\n\nA common vine over the bushes in Flying Fish Cove Rocky point.\n\nCollected first by Andrews on Phosphate Hill.\n\nDistribution India, Andaman Islands, Malay Peninsula, Java.\n\n*Cissus pedata* var *glabrescens.*\n\nStems glabrous more or less flexuous obscurely 4 angled, internodes 3-4 inches long. Tendrils branched opposite the inflorescence. Leaves when young more or less pubescent adult glabrous, petiole 2 inches long pubescent when young, glabrous in old leaves, limb 5 to 7 foliolate lobes unequal, central one ovate with a broad base, on a petiolule 1\u00bd inch long, thin crenulate dentate 4 inches long 3 inches wide, nerves 8 pairs, sparingly pubescent, lateral lobes oblique inaequilateral narrower, and more distinctly crenate. Cymes small, opposite to the leaves 1\u00bd inch or little more long, peduncle 1 inch long (lengthening in fruit). Flowers green glabrous very small. Calyx shortly 4 lobed. Corolla ovoid in bud, 4 petals 4 valvate narrowed upwards from a broad base. Fruit \u00bc inch through pink, seeds 4\u00bd inch long angled in front, smooth rounded polished on the back.\n\nSmith Point etc., common.\n\nThis is no doubt the plant collected by Andrews and so identified in the monograph of Christmas Island, but it differs from the description by Planchon in the Mon. Phau. p. 558, in the form of its leaves, and its\nmuch more glabrous habit. I have a somewhat similar form from New Guinea.\n\n*Cissus pedata* Lam. is distributed over India, Siam and Java but appears to be quite absent from the Malay Peninsula. Fruit as large as a pea, pink; flowers green fertilized by *Polistes Balder* Kirb.\n\n*Leea sambucina* var *intermedia.*\n\nA tree or large shrub 20 feet or more tall, young stems smooth glabrous green fluted, internodes one foot long, sprinkled over with scattered thorns, adult stems thornless covered with a red, scaly bark. Leaves 12 inches or more long, leaflets oblong lanceolate acute crenulate 3 inches long $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch wide, glabrous except for a tuft of reddish hair in the axils of the nerves on the back. Cymes 3 inches long with tufts of hair in the axils, and the ultimate branches pubescent. Bracts lanceolate acute or subacute. Flowers green, calyx cupshaped with 5 short teeth, pubescent. Petals 5 lanceolate subacute hooded at the tip glabrous staminal tube very short and toothed. Fruit globose grey green $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch through when dry, 4 seeded.\n\nThis plant is common all over the island, but especially on Phosphate hill, Flying Fish Cove, etc. It is rarer or absent on the Plateau.\n\nIt has been referred to the common Malayan species *L. sambucina* and also to *L. horrida* Teysm. It is however not typically either species, but rather intermediate between the two. In general it resembles *L. sambucina* except for its much greater size, smaller corymbs and leaves with tufts of hair in the nerve axils and the presence of distinct thorns on the young stems. In these points it approaches *L. horrida*, which however is much more thorny the thorns being persistent and occurring on the branches, and which does not possess the axillary hairs of the nerves of the leaf.\nDistribution of *Leea sambucina* Willd, India, Andamans, Malay Peninsula.\n\n**Sapindaceae.**\n\n*Cardiospermum Halicacabum* L. A single plant on the coral beach in Flying Fish Cove. This plant occurs frequently as a weed of cultivation and is often cultivated to a small extent as a pot herb.\n\n*Allophyllus Cobbe* var *glaber*.\n\nA common small tree, Rocky point. Plateau, Flying Fish Cove, N. E. Point, Steep Point.\n\nThis plant was collected first by Andrews. The species as generally described includes a number of forms very different in appearance from low shrubs with small glabrous leaves to small trees with large leaves. The Christmas Island plant is not the common sea shore bush, but a bigger erect little tree, which is usually met with in forests.\n\n**Anacardiaceae**\n\n*Spondias dulcis*, Forst.\n\nA gigantic tree 100 feet tall and 2 feet through with light grey crackled bark. Leaves pinnate. Flowers in short panicles, small white. Drupe elliptic oblong brownish black crackled 2 inches long, pulp yellow acid.\n\nWoods at Andrew's Look out, local but a fair number of trees together. Leafless when we first arrived later with young reddish leaves and fruit, and just commencing to flower.\n\nThe first record of this tree here.\n\n**Leguminosae.**\n\n*Erythrina indica*, Lam.\n\nA smooth barked tree usually of a moderate size, but Andrews met with one 18 feet in circumference.\n\nJour.

(Andrews).\n\nThis plant, the Kachang Parang of the Malays is only known in cultivation and is a well-known native vegetable. It was probably an escape from cultivation when Andrews collected it. I did not observe it.\n\nC. obtusifolia var insularis.\n\nA strong but slender climber covering bushes with a dense mat of foliage. Leaves trifoliate, leaflets ovate obtuse, bases nearly equilateral broad rounded 4-5 inches long, 3\u00bd inches wide, petiole 3 inches long, petiolules of lateral leaflets \u00bc, of terminal 1 inch long. Raceme 4 or 5 inches long. Flowers opening singly. Calyx \u00bd inch long urnshaped bilobed, upper lobe larger emarginate. Petals dark red rose, standard 1\u00be inch long \u00be inch wide, oblong obovate retuse, claw and centre at base greenish white. Wings \u00bc inch long \u00bc inch wide oblong obtuse, keel petals broader elliptic oblong. Stamens 10 fertile, anthers rounded ovate dull yellow, style shorter. Pod oblong beaked 4 inches long 1\u00be inch wide, the rib close to the upper suture, seeds 2-4 subglobose, slightly flattened, dark brown.\n\nThis abundant bean climbing over bushes on the Cemetery road and Phosphate hill differs much in appearance from C. obtusifolia, in the more oblong standard, and in Christmas Island in its red not rose colored petals. In plants cultivated in Singapore the petals were more rose colored.\n\nStrongylodon ruber, Vogel.\n\nA climber with slender stems leaves trifoliolate. Flowers red. Pod oblong turgid with large round seeds,\nCommon in Flying Fish Cove, and Phosphate hill; collected also by Andrews. This was not in flower at the time of our visit but in fruit. Distribution, Ceylon, Andamans, Australia and Polynesia. The seed probably sea borne. Seeds sea drifted to Cocos Island.\n\n*Galactia tenuiflora*, W. & A.\n\nA slender climber with trifoliate leaves 1\u00bd-2 inches long. Flowers pink on the inner face, green on the back about \u00bc inch across. Pod sword shaped: 1-2 inches long, narrow.\n\nThis pretty little vetch, climbs over the bushes abundantly at Rocky point and on Phosphate hill.\n\nDistribution Africa East and South, India, Siam, Malay Islands, Australia.\n\n*Pongamia glabra*, Vent.\n\nA tall straight tree in the forest or low bushy straggling one on rocks, with rather thin 5-7 foliate leaves and racemes of pink flowers. Pods one seeded flattened, indehiscent.\n\nCommon beyond Rocky point, Flying Fish Cove, North East Point.\n\nDistribution Mascarene Islands, India, Malay Peninsula, and islands, North Australia and Polynesia. A typical sea shore and tidal river bank plant as far as the typical form is concerned some of the trees in the woodlands were remarkably straight and tall and very different in appearance from the common Malay Peninsula plant.\n\n*Inocorpus edulis*, Forst.\n\nA big tree with a remarkably grooved stem, and light colored bark; leaves oblong very dark green coriaceous. Flowers in short axillary racemes yellow. Fruit flattened orbicular, one seeded. Common, Flying Fish Cove. Distribution Polynesia.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe wood is poor, light colored fawn, the centre darker, rays very fine numerous with many fine transverse bars; pores in short lines, joined together and separated by transverse partitions. Weight 4 lbs per cubic foot.\n\nThe red crabs, *Gecarcinus*, seem very fond of the fruit of this tree of which they eat the green husk. As they drag them from some distance to their burrows for this purpose, it is not uncommon to see a dozen or so young plants growing in a circle round the mouth of the burrow. The seed when boiled is eatable, and very good tasting like a chestnut. It is undoubtedly a sea dispersed plant the strong husk protecting the seed from injury, while floating in the sea.\n\nSpecimens were first obtained by Lister and from these Professor Oliver (*Icones Plantarum* t. 1837) gave a figure and description of the seed, to correct the misconception of its structure by Gaertner, but as a matter of fact Lister's fruit was very young and Gaertner's that of a fully ripe fruit. The tree has long been cultivated in the Botanic Gardens at Singapore, where it regularly flowers and fruits. The fruits, only 2 or three ripening on one raceme, are flattened pear shaped polished green or yellowish green; when quite ripe 5 inches long, 4 wide and about an inch through. The remains of the style, represented by a very short elevation is more than half way along the upper edge from the stalk. There are often a few small points also in the sides. The stalk is short under $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch and stout. The pod which is indehiscent is one seeded. The exocarp is composed of the thin green epicarp, followed by a fibrous almost woody portion $\\frac{1}{2}$ to $\\frac{3}{8}$ inch thick. Beneath this is a pithy white mass, at first very thick but disappearing as the seed develops, so that when the seed is ripe there is little or none left. The ripe seed is 3 inches long thick orbicular heart shaped, yellow wrinkled, with no albumen.\nThe fruits of the Christmas Island trees were on the whole smaller than those of the Gardens plants, but I saw few ripe ones and many fallen ones were sterile. The pod with its fibrous coat is well suited for sea dispersal, and is undoubtedly so dispersed. Its later dissemination over the island is effected in part at least by crabs and perhaps also by the fruit bats. For these animals the eatable part is the green outer coat of the pod. In Singapore the seeds are often destroyed before they are ripe by the squirrels which gnaw through the pod to eat the seed.\n\n*Caesalpinia (Guilandina) borucella*, Fleming.\n\nA strong thorny climber with pubescent leaflets, and racemes of yellow flowers, with recurved pubescent bracts. Capsule 3 inches long brown spiny containing 1 or 2 round grey seeds.\n\nCommon at Smith point, and North East Point collected also by Andrews. In bud at the close of our visit\n\nDistrib. All tropical countries. A typical sea shore plant, the hard seeds of which are sea borne.\n\n*Entada scandens*, Benth.\n\nEast coast (Andrews) I did not meet with this big climber anywhere.\n\nDistrib. India Malay Peninsula, Africa South America seeds are often found in sea drift and it is one of the best known sea-dispersed plants. Mr. Chapman found a seed in the sea at Christmas Island.\n\n**Combretaceae.**\n\n*Terminalia Catappa*, L.\n\nThis tree is very abundant over much of the island not only along the lower terraces and on the sea beach but also on the Plateau. Many of the trees are very large with big buttresses. The wood is hard and dark red brown. I have not seen trees as large elsewhere.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nIt is however otherwise identical with Malayan forms. The fruit is sea borne, and also disseminated over the island by crabs which eat off the outer coat. Occasionally I saw large quantities of seeds collected together but by what animal I do not know, possibly by fruit bats, which in Singapore are very fond of the fruit and carry it far away.\n\nDistribution. Most tropical countries but often planted, wild only on sea shores.\n\nThe wood is very hard, dark red with a satiny lustre, rays fine pores few and large, a very superior timber to any samples I have seen from the Malay Peninsula.\n\n*Combr\u00e9tum acuminatum*, Roxb.\n\nA woody climber common on the shore terraces and on the plateau. I saw neither fruit or flowers of it. The fruit is described as four angled and oblong, like that of *Combretum trifoliatum* which I have found floating in the sea off Singapore.\n\nDistribution India and Malay islands.\n\n*Quisqualis indica*, L. A woody and thorny climber, with bunches of red flowers. Flying Fish Cove on rocks above the bay towards the Magistrate's House, also on North East Point, collected also by Andrews. Undoubtedly wild.\n\nThe fruits are probably sea borne, they are somewhat lanceolate in shape acuminate and angled. Distrib. Burmah, Malay Peninsula, on the East Coast.\n\n*Gyrocarpus americanus*, Jacq.\n\nA very large thick stemmed tree with grey rather smooth bark, and soft white wood with very distant rings. Leaves clustered on the ends of the branches rounded ovate acuminate long petioled. Flowers unisexual in large cymes, apetalous, calyx 4-7 partite, stamens 4-7 in male flower, calyx 2 partite in female. Nut bony with two long spathulate wings 3 inches long. Common and\nvery conspicuous along the lower terraces by the sea. Flying Fish Cove, N. E. Point, Waterfall. The tree sheds its leaves after flowering at the time of our visit only a few bare bunches of hanging green fruits at the ends of the boughs. Many trees were leafless but a few were beginning to produce leaves again. The settlers call it cabbage tree on account of its soft pithy wood like that of a cabbage stalk. It is perfectly useless, of a light fawn color with large rings and wavy fibres with few large pores. Distribution. All tropical countries\n\n**Myrtaceae.**\n\n*Eugenia gigantea*, n. sp.\n\nA gigantic tree over 100 feet tall with immense buttresses. Bark light coloured with large thin flakes. Leaves opposite elliptic oblong or lanceolate or ovate subacute lower ones large 6 inches long by 4 inches wide, upper ones 3 inches by $1\\frac{3}{4}$ wide, glabrous subcoriaceous narrowed at the base to the petiole which is $\\frac{1}{2}$ an inch long, primary nerves 11-12 pairs, prominent beneath. Cymes below the leaves 3 inches long, branches slender divaricate. Flowers in trees at the ends of the branchlets, white sessile $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long, ovary turbinate strongly wrinkled when dry. Calyx cupshaped entire. Petals forming a round shield shaped cap coriaceous. Stamens very numerous short white. Style longer rather stout. Drupe half an inch long subglobose purple.\n\nThe biggest tree on the island and the biggest species of *Eugenia* I have ever seen. It is abundant all over the plateau, occasionally descending a little lower as at Flying Fish Cove. Specimens of this tree have been collected by all botanists who have visited the island but no account of it has been published.\n\n*Barringtonia rubra* Miq. lc. p. 487 *Butonica terrestris* Rumph.

Fruit 2 inches long \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch through green oblanceolate in outline narrowed to the base and shortly beaked, very obscurely four angled.\n\nCommon in the woods on the upper terraces, and plateau, and occasionally lower.\n\nDistribution Banka, Patjetan, South Java and Amboina.\n\nThis plant has been erroneously referred to *B. racemosa* but as Miers (Trans. Linn. Soc. Sec. II. vol. i. p. 69 has very properly shown, *B. racemosa* of many authors is a mixture of several distinct species, and the original species is Indian only. From *B. inclyta* Miers the common plant of the Malay Peninsula, this species differs in its much thinner and smaller leaves, and much smaller flowers and fruits. *B. inclyta* is a typical sea shore plant and grows in damp muddy spots near the sea. It is included under *B. racemosa* in the Flora of British India and the Materials of the Flora of the Malay Peninsula. *B. rubra* is a woodland plant Rumaphius describes it as growing in sulphureous and gravelly soil and it grows in Christmas Island among the detritus of coral reefs. The flowers are either white or rose pink. I was unable to find any other distinction between the two forms, I observed that the fruits were untouched though abundant by any\nanimal, even the crabs which eat the outer coat of the fruits of *Inocarpus* greedily do not appear to relish that of the *Barringtonia*. The plant has doubtless arrived at the island by sea, as seeds of *Barringtonia* are among the commonest sea drift ones.\n\n**TURNERACEAE.**\n\n*Turnera ulmifolia*, L.\n\nThis native of South America has established itself on the sea-beach in Flying Fish Cove. It is a shrubby herb with lanceolate toothed leaves and large yellow flowers.\n\nProbably introduced into cultivation in the East as an ornamental plant it is now well established in sandy places beyond Tanjong Katong in Singapore. It never seems to thrive inland.\n\n**ONAGRACEAE.**\n\n*Ludwigia prostrata*, Roxb.\n\nA common yellow flowered herb abundant in wet spots in many parts of the world. It is rarely prostrate as its name implies but usually erect.\n\nFlying Fish Cove a few plants behind the house, among the bananas. This plant appears to be disseminated by its seeds adhering to the feet or feathers of aquatic birds, and also is spread by streams and rivulets. In this case however I should suggest from its habitat that the seeds have been accidentally brought in rice, and got dropped outside the house.\n\n**LYTHRACEAE.**\n\n*Pemphis acidula*, Forst.\n\nA shrub with a rough barked stem often of considerable thickness, narrow obovate elliptic lanceolate dark green leaves, usually rather stiff, small white flowers and a small acid berry.\nCommon on the sea rocks from South point to Rocky point.\n\nVar crassifolia. Leaves very thick and succulent. Between Waterfall and Steep Rock. This form is very strikingly different from the common one when alive on account of the very thick leaves but I could see no other difference. It formed very large erect or sub-erect bushes or almost trees along the shore in one place, and where exposed to the heavy sea-spray and winds it formed a prostrate dense mat of wiry branches lying over the rocks.\n\nDistrib. Africa and Mascarene isles, Cochin China, Hong Kong, Burmah, Ceylon, S.

Fruit a capsule with many seeds.\n\nDensely covering rocks on the top of a promontory by the little White Cove between the Waterfall and Steep Rock.\n\nThe seeds and probably portions of the plant are dispersed by sea. It is a common seashore-plant in all parts of the Tropics, growing in tidal mud or on sea-rocks. The whole plant when boiled makes an excellent vegetable, and is known to the Javanese as Sesepit. The boobies near the waterfall used branches of it to make their nests.\n\nDistrib. Tropics generally.\n\nCUCURBITACE\u00c6.\n\n*Zehneria alba*, n. sp.\n\nStems slender glabrous.

Phosphate hill, Plateau, etc.\n\nThis is the *Melothria mucronata* of the flora of Christmas Island doubtless, which is identified with *Zehneria Baueriana*, Eudl. but it does not appear to me that it can be even a form of this plant.\n\n*Melothria*, sp. Trailing on rocks east coast (Andrews). There may be another of these small Cucurbitaceae here, as I found a plant with a single yellow flower on the waterfall track, but could get no more.\n\n*Momordica charantia*, L. This common cultivated plant has run wild about cleared spots. It is of course not native but is the common small fruited form to which the cultivated form quickly reverts.\n\n**ARALIACEAE.**\n\n*Heptupleurum natale*, n. sp.\n\nA long climber with grey stems.

Cymes 3 or 4 inches long branched from the base, lower branches 2 inches long, flowers copious green 10-13\ninches in an umbel, pedicels \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long slender. Buds oblong obtuse, ovary short turbinate. Petals oblong linear, obtuse 5, stamens 5 alternate.\n\nFruit not seen.\n\nVery abundant on rocks and trees, all over the island, flowering in the end of October.\n\nThis plant is certainly not I think the common *H. ellipticum* Seem. A native of the Malay Peninsula.\n\n**Rubiaceae.**\n\n*Randia densiflora* var laxior, Bak. fil.\n\nA large straggling shrub, stems under an inch through, 10 to 12 feet or more tall.

Pedicels very short calyx \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long dilated upwards from a narrow base with very short ovate teeth. Corolla tube \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) longer thick, lobes linear lanceolate \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long, white turning yellow, hairs in the mouth of the tube few and short. Anthers linear mucronate.\n\nBerry elliptic red \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long crowned with the persistent calyx lobes.\n\nExtremely abundant all over the island especially on the lower terraces, but also on the plateau up to 900 feet all and perhaps the most abundant plant on the island, commonly known as wild coffee from its white sweet scented flowers. The stems form excellent walking sticks.\n\nCollected first by Lister and by all subsequent visitors.\n\nThis plant is very different from the common forms of *R. densiflora* in many points, but perhaps hardly sufficiently so to be distinguished specifically. The typical plant is a tree 50 to 60 feet tall, with thicker leaves and fewer nerves, a denser corymb of slightly\nsmaller flowers with a pubescent calyx, and shorter corolla tube. Shrubby forms do occur in the Malay Peninsula also and forms with a quite glabrous calyx. Distribution Malay Peninsula and Islands, Hongkong and North Australia.\n\n*Guettarda speciosa*, L.\n\nA big tree with large sweet scented white flowers, and a green drupe.\n\nCommon on the sea coast, Smith Point, Cemetery road, Waterfall, and in the plateau on the Murray hill track, but most frequent near the sea, rarely inland.\n\nThe flowers seemed to me to be larger than usual. The fruit is commonly seen in sea drift, and I found several in the sea, but all had sunk.\n\nDistribution Tropics generally.\n\n*Morinda citrifolia*, Liun.\n\nA large shrub with dark green leaves, and white flowers. Fruit a syncarp about an inch long. Baker fil. (Monograph of Christmas Island), says that the Christmas Island form seems somewhat different from the usual form in its narrower leaves and, occasionally, tetramerous flowers. It is however quite the ordinary plant of the Malay islands, the form with well developed whitish bracts and is identical with the common sea coast plant of Singapore.\n\nIt is common in Flying Fish Cove and at the Waterfall.\n\nThe fruits are sea dispersed and the plant is most commonly met with on rocky places above the sea. The white flowers are visited and fertilized by the wasps. *Odynerus polyphemus* Polistes balder Kirb and by the hawk moths *Cepheonodes hylas* and *Macroglossa*, and the bee *Megachile rotundipennis* Kirb.\n\nJour.

This shrub very common in the Plateau has been well described by Baker. It is quite unlike any other species of *Saprosma* known to me, and does not possess the horrible odour when broken that the other species of the genus emit. It is endemic, and was first collected by myself in 1890, and is the *Psychotria* sp. of my list.\n\n**GOODENOVIEAE.**\n\n*Scaevola Koenigii*, Vahl. A shrub with obovate fleshy leaves and white flowers, fruit baccate white.\n\nOn cliffs above the sea. Common. Smith Point, Flying Fish Cove.\n\nFirst collected by Lister.\n\nSeeds dispersed by sea.

Style twice as long fruit globose white turning to black \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) inch through finely longitudinally ribbed when dry. *Ardisia complanata*, Hemsl. and Bak. fil. In Monograph of Christmas Island etc. Not of Roxburgh.\n\nCommon on the Plateau.\n\nI cannot see how this beautiful and very distinct plant can have been mistaken for *A. complanata*. The winged stems are striking even in the living plant, and more conspicuous in a dried specimen.\n\n**COMPOSIT\u00c6.**\n\n*Ageratum conyzoides*, Cass.\n\nThe common white-weed, with its pale blue or white flowers is common in cultivated ground at Flying Fish Cove.\n\nFirst collected by Andrews. It is common now in all tropical countries as a weed of cultivation, and is partly disseminated by the wind but also by its fruit adhering to cloths etc.\n\n*Blumea spectabilis*, Dec. A tall weedy plant about 6 or 7 feet tall, with yellow flowers.\n\nCommon on the plateau in more open spaces in the woods, along paths and wherever the trees have fallen. First collected by Lister and certainly indigenous.

Collected by me in 1890, not seen before or since. It is one of the common fugacious herbs which appears and disappears in cultivated ground.\n\n*Synedrella nodiflora*, Gaertn.\n\nA common South American weed with small heads of yellow flowers.\n\nExtremely abundant in cleared ground in Flying Fish Cove, and at the Phosphate hill quarries. First collected by Andrews. Abundant in Singapore and Java, from one of which localities it was probably brought accidentally.\n\n*Sapotaceae*.\n\n*Sideroxylon sundaicum*, Burck.\n\nA gigantic tree upwards of 100 feet tall with large buttresses at the base, bark grey, exuding a small quantity of latex when cut. Wood white not very hard. Leaves very variable, lanceolate acuminate acute in young trees and on the lower part of old trees; above elliptic or obovate glabrous dark green when adult; covered with ferruginous tomentum when young, four to six inches long, $2\\frac{1}{2}$ to three inches wide, nerves 7 to 10 pairs conspicuous on the under surface when dry, petiole slender $\\frac{3}{4}$ to $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long.

Staminodes very short acuminate processes alternating with the corolla lobes and adnate below to the tube. Disc thick annular strongly pubescent. Ovary enclosed in disc small conic tapering into a cylindric style shorter than the filaments, glabrous. Stigma minute. Fruit an orange red berry long obovoid, pulpy and sweet, seeds 1 or more, hard dark brown.\n\nThis fine tree is common all over the plateau, but generally scarce or absent from the shore terraces. The fruit is much eaten by the pigeons Carpodectes who swallow it whole. I have also seen the white-eyes pecking at it and the red crab eating it.\n\nDistribution Pulau Sangian.

Much of this ground has been cleared since for cooly lines, and the hospital, and the woods near by form the handiest place for the coolies firewood supply, so that the tree has probably been exterminated. The Cerberas the fruit of which is well adopted for dispersal by sea require tidal mud usually for their growth, and there is no suitable spot for them in the island, Judging by the note as to the form of the leaves in the Monograph I should suggest that the plant collected by Andrews might be *C. lactaria*.\n\nDistribution India, China, Malay Peninsula and Archipelago, Australia and Polynesia.

The stem of this plant which is milky attains a thickness of four inches. The panicles of flowers are nearly 6 inches long on a peduncle of equal length. The calyx half an inch long and wide, sepals ovate subacute and corolla nearly 3 inches wide with a short tube, of a brilliant yellow.\n\nThis fine convolvulus is abundant in the centre of the island on the Murray Hill Park covering trees with a dense mat of stems and leaves collected also by Andrews.\n\nDistribution, Malay Peninsula, Java, Borneo, New Guinea, Amboina, Australia, Polynesia, Mauritius.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nSome of these outlying localities may be doubted, as the Australian and Amboinese plants are said to have white, the Mauritius one yellowish white red spotted flowers. If this is so these are probably distinct. All I have seen have bright yellow flowers.\n\n*I. grandiflora*, Lam.\n\nA climber of no great size with moderately thick stems ovate cordate rather thick leaves, and tubular white flowers, turning yellow soon. The sepals ovate obtuse, corolla tube thick $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long, limb flat 1 inch across. Capsule large an inch through and seeds shortly villous.\n\nClimbing over rocks and bushes at the wharf, collected also by Andrews \"climbing on trees north coast.\"\n\nDistribution Africa and islands, India Laccadives and Ceylon, Timor, New Caledonia, Australia and Polynesia.\n\nSome authors have confused this with *I. bona-nox*, the well known moon flower which is utterly different. The flowers of *I. grandiflora* are very much smaller and it is not at all a conspicuous plant. It is evidently a sea shore plant and the seeds probably sea-borne.\n\n*Convolvulus parviflorus*, Vahl.\n\nA small climbing and twining convolvulus with ovate acuminate pubescent leaves $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long, and umbels over half an inch across of small pink flowers, calyx densely silky hairy, capsule hardly longer splitting into 5 rather thin lanceate acute valves.\n\nCommon near Smith point and Rocky point, collected also by Andrews.\n\nDistribution, India and Ceylon, Java and Australia. I have never seen this in the Malay Peninsula.\n\nThis is possibly introduced as a weed of cultivation, but it is difficult to say how it gets dispersed.\nSolanaceae.\n\n*Solanum biflorum*, Lour.

Flowers white, calyx in fruit large and thorny concealing the fruit.\n\nPhosphate Hill, and on the track towards Murray Hill. Distribution Java. I have never seen this in the Malay Peninsula. My Javanese plant collector recognized it as a Javanese plant used in local medicine and probably introduced for that purpose.\n\n*Physalis minima*, L.\n\nA common or weedy plant, from a few inches to a foot high, sub-glabrous, pubescent or viscid leaves ovate entire or toothed or lanceolate. Flowers yellow with a dark centre, axillary \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long. Berry red globose in closed in the enlarged ovoid calyx.\n\nCommon in Flying Fish Cove and all cultivated ground, and also on the sea rocks.\n\nThree forms were met with, the erect nearly glabrous plant with nearly entire leaves which is common in waste ground; a shorter more prostrate plant with\nbroader pubescent leaves more dentate and rather larger fruit, which occurred on dry hot places near the sea, at the Waterfall; and a more woody prostrate plant densely viscid pubescent with many small round fruits, leaves small and crowded. This grows on very hot rocks above the sea at Smith point.\n\nThe plant which is common on waste ground and sandy sea shores in the Tropics of the Old World, is probably disseminated by birds, as also accidentally by man. It was first collected by Lister in Christmas Island.\n\n*Datura alba*, L.\n\nThe white Datura is abundant along the coast line from Smith point to the Cemetery road. Also at the Waterfall. I did not see this except in the neighbourhood of cultivated ground. Andrews records it on all coasts, and as it was found in the island by Lister it must be classed as a native plant. It is a large flowered single white form.\n\nDistribution Tropical Africa, India, Malay islands.\n\nThe Daturas probably originating in South America seem to have wandered far over Asia, and I believe from the curious way they have of turning up spontaneously in waste ground the seeds are dispersed by birds in spite of their poisonous nature. I have never seen any really wild in the Malay Peninsula, but *D. fastuosa* is commonly grown in medicinal gardens and is accidentally spread.\n\n**ACANTHACEAE.**\n\n*Asystasia alba*, n. sp.\n\nAn erect herb about a foot tall and little branched. Leaves opposite in distant pairs $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to 1 inch apart blade lanceolate or ovate lanceolate acuminate at the tip, and cuneate at the base, thin light green sprinkled\non both surfaces with pale bristles, especially abundant on the midrib, back of the leaf covered with small pustules, nerves 9 pairs ascending conspicuous, 4-inches long 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches wide, petiole setulose \\(\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{3}{4}\\) inch long. Raceme terminal 1 to 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches long. 6-7 flowered, flowers opening singly, rachis setose. Bracts \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) inch long lanceolate acuminate. Pedicel little longer. Calyx split into five narrow lanceolate acuminate lobes nearly to the base \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long glabrous. Corolla one inch long hardly \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch across tube narrow, gradually dilated in the upper part sparingly pubescent pure white. Stamens 4 equal, filaments long slender glabrous, anthers lanceolate minutely cuspidate at the tip, shortly prolonged into two blunt lobes at the lease. Capsule woody narrow \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inch long dilated upwards 1-2 seeded.\n\nThis plant is very abundant on the lower terraces below Phosphate Hill and beyond the Waterfall. I suppose it to be the plant recorded in the Flora of Christmas Island by Mr. Baker as *Asystasia coromandeliana* forma the distribution of which is given as India and Malaya, Africa and Arabia. It would be interesting to know where in Malaya this plant is wild. It is often cultivated in gardens, and occasionally escapes along road sides in villages and towns, but it is certainly not native of the Malay Peninsula nor has it even established itself as a denizen. The only species of *Asystasia* which is indigenous to the Malay region which I have ever seen or heard of is *A. intrusa* Nees, which ranges from Celebes to Singapore, and the Christmas Island plant is certainly allied to that species and not to *A. coromandeliana*. I have a scrap of an apparently identical plant from the Tenimber islands (Timor Laut) collected by Mr. Pereira. The plant differs altogether in habit from *A. intrusa* Nees, which is a scrambling diffuse weed in hedges, and thickets and in its larger pure white flowers, those of *A. intrusa* being\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nviolet. The seeds of *Asystasia* are dispersed by the exploding of the capsule as in so many *Acanthaceae* but this of course would not account for the plant's reaching Christmas Island. They are too heavy probably for wind dispersal and were probably sea borne to the island. It grows in the lower woods near the sea, on soil chiefly formed of broken coral reef.\n\n*Ruellia prostrata*, Lam. var *dejecta* Clarke.\n\nA low spreading herb about 6 inches tall. Leaves ovate or lanceolate acute base cuneate 2 inches long and one inch wide sprinkled with white hairs on both sides especially on the nerves, petiole half an inch long hairy. Flowers solitary axillary opening in the afternoon. Corolla little more than half an inch long light violet dilated upwards. Capsule $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch long base narrowed half its length then dilated pubescent. Seeds numerous orbicular flat margined above covered with minute white processes.\n\nFlying Fish Cove common (Andrews) I could find only a few plants on some boulders close to Ross' old house.\n\nDistribution East Africa, India, Ceylon, Malay Peninsula (type).\n\nThe variety *dejecta* is extremely different from the typical form, which is more compact with much smaller leaves, flowers much more dilated and at least twice as large. Mr. Clarke however has seen intermediate forms.\n\nPossibly accidentally introduced, but may be dispersed by the adhesion of its minute slightly hooked seed processes, or may be sea borne.\n\n*Dicliptera maclearii*, Hemsley.\n\nA weedy plant 2 or 3 feet tall branched, growing in masses with lanceolate leaves pointed at both ends 1 to 3 inches long $\\frac{1}{4}$ to 1 inch wide pubescent on both sides, petiole $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long or less flowers crowded in the\nupper axils, outer bracts needle-like \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long inner bracts, broadly orbicular stalked ending in a sharp needle-like point, \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long green. Calyx very small sepals linear pubescent, corola \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long narrow two lipped pink. Capsule very small.\n\nVery common on the lower terraces, Flying Fish Cove, Waterfall, Cemetery Road etc. Endemic and first collected by Capt. Maclear.\n\nWhen ripe the whole of the fruit including the broad spring bracts breaks off and adheres strongly to cloth etc., by which means the seed included between the bracts is carried about.\n\n**Verbenaceae.**\n\n*Callicarpa longiflora*, Lam. var *glabrescens*.\n\nA shrub about 6 feet tall leaves opposite ovate lanceolate acuminate 7 inches long 3 inches wide edge denticulate glabrous except for some stellate tomentum on the midrib on both surfaces and on some of the main nerves, petiole \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch long tomentose. Panicles about 2 inches long tomentose. Flowers numerous white small. Calyx cup-shaped glabrescent, corolla lobes glabrous. Drupe globose \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long white.\n\nCommon on the Plateau, also the lowest cliffs and near Flying Fish Cove, collected first by Lister.\n\nDistribution of *C. longifolia*, Lam. India, Malay Peninsula and Australia.\n\nThe common form of this plant has very tomentose leaves, covered with tufts of woolly hairs arranged stellately, its flowers also are pale lavender in color. The Christmas Island plant differs in its nearly glabrous larger and thinner leaves and white flowers.\n\nThe seed is dispersed by birds the small drupes being pulpy and sweet.\n\n*Jour.

Flowers very small pink crowded in terminal very lax panicles with few slender short branches pubescent. Perianth pubescent. Fruit \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long and 4 lobed aciniform viscid pubescents stamens 2 anthers very broad.\n\nFlying Fish Cove on the beach, and along Cemetery road, and high upon bare rocks above the Cove.\n\nDistribution all the Tropics.\n\nThis form is more robust and with thicker foliage than the Singapore seashore form, but it appears to be a very variable plant. With the typical form grew one with very condensed leafy branches, the panicle branches very short and flowers a little larger. It seems to be a monstrosity due to some insect attack.\n\n*B. repanda* Willd is recorded by Hemsley from the summit. This species has not since been seen, and perhaps was an error for *B. repens*.\n\n*B. caespitosa*, n. sp.\n\nWhole plant forming a big tuft with a prostrate mass of branches two or more feet long, tips obscurely pubes-\ncent. Leaves ovate to almost orbicular thinner than in preceding 1 inch long \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch wide or much less glabrous pale, nerves 2 or 3 pairs deeply sunk on the upper surface when dry. Panicles lax terminal and axillary with few branches slender viscid. Flowers very small white crowded in small terminal heads viscid. Perianth short campanulate with 5 very short lobes, subacute. Stamens two much shorter, anthers globose. Style stout stigma large thick peltate. Fruit \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long oblong narrowed to the base with several ribs, viscid.\n\nFlying Fish Cove.\n\nI can quite imagine this plant, very distinct when alive, being confused with *B. repens* when dried material only is seen. It differs entirely in habit from any form of *Boerhaavia* I have seen, the flowers are invariably white. Stamens much shorter and stigma larger the fruit is ribbed but not distinctly angled as in the common plant. I have never seen it elsewhere.\n\n*Pisonia grandis*, R. Br.\n\nA big tree with a very thick stem covered with rather smooth grey bark, branchlets pale grey fragile. Leaves crowded at the ends oblong light green glabrous except the petioles, which are tomentose. Corymbs of green flowers fragrant about 3 inches long pubescent \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long. Flowers \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) inch long tube short conical hardly lobed pubescent. Stamens 8 shortly exsert on fili-form filaments. Style as long pubescent stigma peltate.\n\nCommon close to the sea on rocks. Smith Point. Flying Fish Cove etc.\n\nDistribution Australia and Polynesia, also on Cocos Island probably). (Forbes. Wanderings).\n\nThe fruit which I have not seen is said to be spiny and glutinous adhering to the feathers of birds, and is doubtless so conveyed about by the sea birds. The seeds of the Cocos Island plant often prove fatal to the herons by adhering to their feathers (Forbes lc. 30).\nP. excelsa, Bl. A fairly big tree with deep green shining elliptic obtuse or acute leaves narrowed and often inaequilateral at the base 8 inches long 3 inches across, petiole 1 inch long, glabrous except for the base and axillary buds which are tomentose. The leaves are often whorled. Panicle terminal of a few umbelled branches, 1-2 inches across, on a pubescent peduncle 2 inches long. Flowers green $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long on pedicels $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch long all pubescent. Perianth tube elongate conic, with very short rounded recurved blunt lobes. Stamens 8 filaments barely exsert, anthers small. Style as long stigma peltate. Fruit over 1 inch long, $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch through, linear angled, glabrous green exuding a very sticky gum, 1 celled.\n\nCommon on the Plateau, and the lower terraces. Flying Fish Cove etc. Not however a sea shore tree like the last.\n\nDistribution Andaman Islands, Malay Peninsula, and islands.\n\nThis is not a very large tree, much more slender than the preceding species, the long slender fruits when ripe split and exude a very sticky substance which adheres firmly to cloth etc., and doubtless to bird's feathers.\n\nThe occurrence of this plant in the Malay Peninsula is curious as it occurs only so far as I know at Kuala Dipang in Perak, on the limestone rocks, a long way inland, but there is a native tradition that within historical times the sea came up to these limestone cliffs.\n\nThe flowers which are fewer and longer than those of P. grandis do not seem to have ever been previously described.\n\nAMARANTACE\u00c6.\n\nDeeringia celosioides, R. Rr.\n\nA half shrubby plant usually scandent about 12 or 14 feet long leaves alternate light green ovate or ovate\nlanceolate acute 6 inches long and three inches across petiole 1 inch long spikes axillary and terminal, 6 or 7 inches long. Flowers white crowded sessile, sepals 5 oblong stamens 5, stigmas 2-4. Fruit a ribbed crimson scarlet pulpy berry \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long.\n\nVery common all along the coast over the sea, forming thickets.\n\nDistribution India Malay Peninsula and Malay islands, New Guinea, Siam, China and Australia.\n\nThe flowers are white not red as stated Rendle. The fruit is bright red pulpy and sweet, and doubtless dispersed by birds. In the Malay Peninsula it only so far as I have seen grows on the limestone rocks in Perak, and this form has usually short inch-long spikes nearly all axillary. A plant inland at Bangtaphan collected by Dr. Keith had he says white fruits.\n\n*Achyranthes aspera*, L.\n\nA large weedy plant often quite shrubby 3 or 4 feet tall. Leaves ovate lanceolate or lanceolate acuminate at both ends pubescent 6 inches long by 3 wide. Spikes terminal and axillary 4 to 6 inches long, dense flowered bracts and bracteoles subulate with a short wing at the base, straw colored. Sepals 4 or 5 subulate \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long stamens.\n\nVery common shore terraces, all along the coast.\n\nDistribution Africa, India, Malay, Peninsula, Java, New Guinea, Australia and America.\n\nThe common form of this plant in the Malay Peninsula is a weed of cultivation the var *porphyrostachys* with longer and more slender spikes smaller rounds and more tomentose leaves.\n\nThe seeds are dispersed by the adhesion of the sharp sepals and bracteoles to cloth, bird's feathers etc., the whole flower breaking off.\nCelosia argentea, L.\n\nA common garden plant, grows in Flying Fish Cove by the old house etc., and also along the Cemetery Road, evidently introduced for ornament. It is visited by *Megachile rotundipennis*, *Odynerus polyhemus* and a syrphid fly.\n\n*Amaranthus viridis*, L.\n\nA common green weed occurring everywhere in waste ground where it is warm enough for it, is very abundant in Flying Fish Cove. Phosphate Hill etc.\n\nI believe this plant is commonly dispersed by cattle and horses which eat it and pass the seed. It comes up very commonly in manure.\n\n*A. paniculatus*, L.\n\nA tall plant with a stout stem and large lanceolate blunt leaves narrowed at the base. Spikes some axillary but most crowded into a dense erect conic thyrsse 6 inches long, pale green spikes horizontally spreading 1 inch long or less, acicular; bracts squarrose; seeds deep brown or black lenticular and margined. This plant is introduced as a cultivated one and has spread a little in Flying Fish Cove. It does not seem to be typical *A. paniculatus* which is practically only known in cultivation and is very variable. I have the same form from Kuala Lumpor in Selangor.\n\nNeither of these Amaranthi previously recorded.\n\n**Balanophoraceae.**\n\n*Balanophora insularis*, n. sp.\n\nRhizome rather small about 2 inches through or less with one or more\u2014about 5 stems, nodular and warted. Volva irregularly split into 4 or 5 rounded lobes. Stems 3 or 4 inches tall, entirely lemon yellow, fleshy \u00bc inch thick. Leaves oblong linear blunt at first appressed,\nlater spreading, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch wide upper ones smaller, subacute, margins towards the tip often denticulate. Inflorescence one inch long base with scattered male flowers for \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch, apex elliptic ovoid in outline blunt bisexual portion a little longer \\( \\frac{3}{10} \\) inch through. Male flowers about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch across nearly sessile. Perianth lobes oblong subquadrate truncate upper and lower ones larger than the lateral ones, at the base where the staminal thecae are numerous, linear oblong and equal above where there are few. Andracium transversely oblong, thecae 7-8 or fewer hexagonal. Female flowers shortly stalked with numerous obovate tailed spadiceels, ovary obovoid obtuse minutely pustulate.\n\nRare, on the shore terrace south of the Waterfall, on the top of Steep rock, and in the centre of the Island on Murray Hill track, a single plant at each place, growing in soil overlying detritus of coral reef. Also collected in Pulau Aur, on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula by Mr. Fielding in 1892.\n\nThe occurrence of a *Balanophora* in Christmas Island was most unexpected, and is interesting from many points of view. The species is allied not as might be expected to any Javanese species but to *B. Hildebrandti* Rchb. fil a native of Tahiti, and the Comoro islands, from which it differs in its smaller size, fewer anthers, and shortly stalked male flowers. The bisexual yellow Balanophoras have a curious distribution, ranging from the Polynesian islands, to Salayer Island.\n\nTenimber, Christmas Island, Pulau Aur and Comoro Island; the species being:\n\n*B. fungosa*, Forst.\n*B.

Christmas Island and Pulau Aur.\nB. abbreviata, Bl.\n\nAll seem to be insular plants. The seeds are very light, and in B. insularis, a puff of wind blew those of a ripe plant away like the seeds of an orchid. The plant is doubtless wind dispersed, and although it grows very low on the ground hardly projecting more than 2 or 3 inches, in thick woods so that one would hardly expect the winds to drift its seeds high enough to cross the sea, still it has a parallel here, in the little woodland plants Zeuxine and Didymoplexis. The occurrence of the plant in Pulau Aur as well is of interest as that little island is also the only other known locality of Sarcochilus carinatfolius.\n\nI could not determine what tree this plant was parasitic on. The first gathered was nearest to a Barringtonia; another below a Ficus retsa.\n\nPiperaceae.\n\nPeperomia laxifolia, Miq.\n\nA small green succulent branched herb with alternate rhomboid lanceolate bright green fleshy leaves pale beneath, 'an inch long spikes very slender 2 inches long with minute flowers.

Flowers distant. Bract ovate subacute. Fruit globose not distinctly beaked ribbed and warted.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nFlying Fish Cove on rocks close to Ross' House.\n\nThis little plant has been widely spread over the east in cultivated ground especially in gardens where it come up every where, but I have never seen it wild. It occurs thus all over the peninsula, also in the Philippines and New Guinea (and is the *P. ruderalis* Schumann) and is also met with in Burmah.\n\n*P. Rossi*, Rendle.\n\nThis which I did not meet with described as 3-4 inches tall with opposite leaves elliptic petioled, obtuse, black dotted with thick dense flowered spikes, round peltate bracts and a sub-globose apiculate punctate fruit.\n\nNo locality is given for it, but it is endemic.\n\nThe minute seeds of the Peperomias, might be wind borne, and most of them are more or less sticky so that they might be dispersed on bird's feathers.\n\n**Laurineae.**\n\n*Cryptocarya Nativitatis*, Rendle.\n\nA big tree with ferruginous woolly shoots. Leaves elliptic or ovate lanceolate coriaceous shortly petioled 4-6 inches by 1\u00bd-2\u00bd inches wide. Panicles terminal 1-2 inches long, many flowered. Flowers greenish white small. Fruit globose shining black.\n\nCommon on the Plateau, and upper part of Phosphate Hill. Endemic allied to an Australian species.\n\nThe fruit is one of the great food supplies of the pigeon, though it has only a very scanty purple pulp.\n\n*Hernandia peltata* Meissa.\n\nA very big tree with ovate peltate long-stalked leaves, and corymbs of dull greenish flowers. The black globular ribbed fruit is enclosed in the yellowish white calyx enlarged to a bladder shape, but open at the top. It is 2 or 3 inches through. The fruit is doubtless sea-dispersed as the large bladdery calyx.\n\n*A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.*\nwould easily float and, owing to its being weighted at the bottom with the fruit it would float upright with the aperture upwards.\n\nIt is common on the Plateau, but I did not see it on the lower terraces.\n\nDistribution Andaman Islands, Ceylon, Lankawi and a few other places on and round the Malay Peninsula, Malay islands, North Australia, Polynesia, South Africa and Madagascar.

It certainly does not seem very floriferous here.\n\nDistribution India, Ceylon, Malay Peninsula, Java, Philippines.\n\nThis is not typically a sea shore plant. The fruit may however be dispersed by sea.\n\nClaoxylon caulescens, n. sp.\n\nA large bush with white stems. Leaves light green ovate acute or acuminate crenulate dentate 6 inches long, 3 inches wide, pubescent on the back, especially on the nerves, turning indigo-blue when withering. Flower spikes woolly axillary \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch long. Calyx 4 lobed, lobes ovate woolly green, ovary pubescent. Hypogynous scales shorter than the sepals linear entire, stigmas entire recurved. Fruit obconic \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) inch long, hairy outside and in the cells green soft obscurely trilobed. Seed sub-globose wrinkled.\n\nCommon, Rocky Point, Phosphate Hill.\n\nThe fruits, seed and ovary when dried and poisoned with spirits become of a pink color. This plant is obviously the one recorded by Rendle as Claoxylon rubescens, Miq. based on a plant of Zollinger's collected in Java, Miquel's description is short and differs from the Christmas Island plant in most respects, thus the peduncle and petiole are described as rubescent, the top of the petiole glandulous, the base of the leaf acute, the leaf itself glabrous, the spikes graceful, and soon glabrous,\nnot one of which characters fits this plant. There seem however to be indistinct traces of glandular structure covered with hair at the top of the petiole.\n\nThe reddish color noticed by Miquel may be due to some post mortem treatment with corrosive subhinate, for he did not see the plant alive, the bases of the leaves which are distinctly pubescent on the back, are rounded, the spikes are remarkably short, and hairy even in fruit. He gives practically no other characters which are not common to nearly all Claoxylons, so that having only his description to go on, which after all is more important than a type specimen, I consider it advisable to give the plant, a new name, alluding to the deep blue colour of the withering foliage.\n\nMacaranga tanarius, L.\n\nA tall tree, with peltate leaves 6-18 inches long ovate subacute gland-dotted and hairy on the nerves beneath, glabrous above, petiole long glaucous. Flower spikes panicle green. Panicle 6 inches long, male flowers very numerous and small, about 8 or more in a head surrounded by a broad entire cupshaped pubescent viscid bract nearly as long as the flowers. Capsule $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long sub-globose with 4 or 5 tails $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long from the upper end; all covered with sticky viscid glands exuding a yellowish gum.\n\nCommon on the shore terraces Smith-Point, Cemetery, and below Phosphate hill on both sides, Waterfall etc.\n\nDistribution Andamans, Malay Peninsula and islands.\n\nThe Macarangas in the Malay peninsula are usually bird-dispersed, the small pigeons being very fond of the seed. The stem of this plant is solid, though nearly all the allied species have hollow stems tenanted by ants.\n\nCleidion javanicum, Bl.\n\nA shrub or small tree, leaves oblanceolate acuminate, narrowed towards the base, usually more or less den-\ntate, glabrous bright green 6 inches long by 3 inches wide. Male spikes panicled terminal slender 3 or 4 together pubescent 2 or 3 inches long. Flowers distant tufts very small yellow. Calyx lobes ovate obtuse 4. Stamens 4 filaments very short, anthers large globose. Female panicles axillary or terminal. Fruit sub-globose 3 lobed \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long smooth. Seed sub-globose oblong slightly flattened on one side smooth grey.\n\nCommon Rocky point, Plateau, Phosphate hill.\n\nDistribution India, Ceylon, Penang, Java.\n\nVery variable in the form of its leaves which are usually toothed, but a very distinct looking form along the Cemetery road had all its leaves entire.\n\n*Acalypha fallax*, Muell.-Arg.\n\n*A.

The horrible odour of the dead wood is caused by scatol, which is often deposited in crystals in cracks in the bark. I observed a number of pigeons (*Carpophaga*) in a flowering tree apparently eating the young flowers.\n\n*Trema amboinensis*, Bl.\n\nA common shrub or almost a tree about 12 or 14 feet tall. Very abundant in Flying Fish Cove and at the lower part of Phosphate hill, forming a great part of the secondary scrub after clearing. The small red drupes are eaten by birds, but as this appears to be a comparatively late introduction into the island, and has spread no further than cultivated ground it may have been accidentally introduced by man.\n\nDistribution India, Siam, Andamans, Malay Peninsula and Islands, Australia, Polynesia.\n\n*Ficus retusa* var *nitida*.\n\nA large spreading tree with very many strong aerial roots. Leaves small coriaceous dark green shining\noblong or elliptic blunt or rounded at the tip or subacute, base cuneate 2-3 inches long 1-1\u00bd wide. Figs globose as big as small peas, green.

Leaves quite glabrous thinly coriaceous ovate cordate at the base and subacute or blunt at the tip 5 inches long 3 inches wide, petiole 3 inches long. Figs clustered in the upper axils sessile half an inch long, yellow or crimson scarlet shortly beaked, bracts ovate pubescent. Achenes keeled or angled fusiform dark red. Female flowers with 4 lanceolate acute narrow sepals.\n\nOn Andrew's Look-out, and also on steep rock, and about Flying Fish Cove, on rocks.\n\nThis differs from F. saxophila of King's Annals of Calcutta Garden vol. I. p. 17, pls 12 and 8. in the blunter leaves, much larger figs, and the bracts being pubescent which he does not mention, but he says that the plant is not well represented in herbaria.

I only saw two or\nthree trees, which flowered at the end of October. The leaves sting and the flowers are green. Rendle says it is near *L. laxiflora* of Java, which has leaves pubescent beneath and the female inflorescence larger than the petioles, but in my specimens the inflorescence of the female plant is certainly longer than the petioles.\n\n*Cudrania javanensis*, Trecul.\n\nA big woody climber, with pale branches and strong \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch spines.

Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nThis plant was first collected by Lister and as no one had lived on the island previously it may be taken that it was not introduced by man, but I could not find it on Christmas Island except in cleared cultivated spots, and at places where fishermen went to fish off the rocks. On frequented tracks it often occurred but not off the tracks, so that it is certainly now carried about by man.\n\nThe common species in the Malay Peninsula is *Fl. interrupta*.\n\n*Boehmeria platyphylla*, Don.\n\nA shrub or very soft wooded tree about 18 feet tall, branches pubescent hairy. Leaves soft green ovate acuminate crenulate dentate base rounded 3-6 inches long 3-4 inches wide, sprinkled with short hairs above, silky pubescent beneath, petiole 1 to 3 inches long. Male panicles 1 to 3 inches from the axils of the upper leaves, branches an inch or less long. Flowers small globose clustered in distant heads. Calyx cupshaped pubescent with four short acute lobes.

Straits Branch\nDendrobiums of the section *Desmotrichum* are very difficult to describe from dried specimens, as the flowers are of thin texture and very fugacious, and as they only open for a few hours in the morning and are withered by midday. It is not often that collectors can procure good specimens. These are no doubt the reason why there has been so much confusion over these plants and for the identification of the Christmas Island plant with *D. Macraei* Lidley a species apparently confined to Ceylon, and utterly different, belonging indeed to a different, subsection.\n\nIn the Flora of British India, a number of different species are recorded as synonymous with *D. Macraei*, including the Himalayan *D. Rabani* and Javanese *D. flabellum*, a plant with large red spotted flowers. *D. pectinatum* is more nearly allied to the *D. calopogon* Rihb. fil, Xenia, Orch. p. 23 pl. 109, fig. 1. 2. of unknown locality but differs in the form of pseudobulb and narrow claw of the lip, and I cannot identify it with any described species. A considerable number of Javanese Desmotrichums were described by Blume in the Bijdragen, but as in most of his early work so badly that it is utterly impossible to guess at what he meant, and thus they had better be relegated to the class of *nomina nuda* and ignored.\n\n*D. crumenatum*, Sw.\n\nCommon all over the island especially on trees on the Plateau. The plant which is quite typical, was scantily in flower at the time of our visit. I obtained it in 1890 and Andrews also got it.\n\nDistribution, Malay Peninsula and Islands, Southern Siam.\n\n*Phreatia Listeri*, Rolfe.\n\nA small orchid with greenish white flowers in slender spikes.

Common on trees on the Plateau. Endemic.\n\nSaccolabium Archytas, Ridley.\n\nVery common especially on the trees of the lower Terraces. Endemic. This pretty plant grows in masses on the bare trunks of the Gyrocarpus and other trees. The flowers are white with pink spots.\n\nDendrocolla carinatfolia, Ridley.\n\nSarcochilus carinatfolius, Ridley.\n\nLess common than the last, and chiefly on the trees on the Plateau. One plant I found had the petals of a pale ochre colour.\n\nCollected also by Andrews. It occurs also on Pulau Aar, an Island off the East Coast of Johor.\n\nThelasis elongata, Bl? A quantity of plants of a Thelasis resembling Th. elongata Bl. occurred on trees in the plateau near Murray Hill, no trace of flowers, was to be seen, and I have failed to flower it in the Botanic Gardens. Thelasis elongata, Bl. is a native of Java.\n\nCorymbis angusta, n. sp.\n\nStems 2-3 feet tall slender woody. Leaves lanceolate acuminate acute, dark green 8-11 inches long 2-2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches wide speaths ribbed. Panicles 2 or 3, 4 inches long lax. Bracts ovate lanceolate acute \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) inch long. Pedicels \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inch long rather slender. Flowers white smaller than usual. Sepals \\(1\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long very narrowly linear. Petals similar. Lip as long, claw very long and narrow channelled, limb ovate shortly cusped edges crisped, \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch across and little longer. Column slender 1 inch long, anther lanceolate blunt. Stigma ovate triangular. Rostellum very small narrow deeply bifid. Chinandrium sides winged. Fruit 1 inch long as long as the column costae very narrow.\nCommon on the plateau and occasionally descending to the lower reefs, in forest. Flowers fragrant.\n\nThe genus *Corymbis* includes about six or seven species ranging from tropical Africa to Australia. All it is true are closely allied, and the differences are so slight in many that one would be almost inclined to consider them as forming one species only. There are few forms however as distinct specifically as the Christmas Island plant. In habit it is slender and weak, very different from the tall stout *C. veratrifolia* Bl. with which it has been confused by Rendle, but this might have been due to the peculiarly dry locality in which it grows. The flowers are smaller, and the extremely narrow petals and sepals, long narrow claw to the lip, the limb of which is more ovate and much smaller, and the different form of the clinandrium which has thin elevated wings on either side, and of the small narrow rostellum and broader stigma, make it quite distinct from the Javanese and Malayan species.\n\n*Didymoplexis pallens*, Griff.\n\nA small terrestrial orchid. Stem slender 4 inches long in flower becoming stouter and growing to 8 inches tall in fruit. Leaves \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) inch long ovate. Flowers 2 or 3, shortly pedicelled flesh-colored. Sepals oblong obtuse. Petals ovate obtuse. Lip entire with 3 nerves not elevated, numerous scattered papillae and a raised mass at the tip of crowded papillae, apex broad crisped denticulate. Column broad, anther rounded flat papillose. Wings obscure. Stigma transversely elliptic. Pedicels lengthening in fruit to 6 inches long. Capsule globose, with slender ribs \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long.\n\nWoods in the centre of the island towards Murray Hill. This plant is always difficult to find. I got 3 specimens in flower and one in fruit, growing among a carpet of *Acrostichums*.\n\nR.A.Soc., No 45, 1905.\nI cannot distinguish this plant from the *C. pallens* of India and the Malay peninsula. It is probably a native too of Java, but I am doubtful as to the *D. pallens* of Smith in the Ic. Bogor, found at Buitenzorg.\n\n**Zeuxine exilis**, n. sp.\n\nWhole plant 12-18 inches tall succulent, rhizome shortly creeping, roots fleshy. Leaves lanceolate acute light green 1-3 inches long \\( \\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{3}{4} \\) inch wide glabrous, shortly petioled, sheaths papery \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long. Stem white-hairy, peduncle (portion of stem above leaves) 3-6 inches long, raceme many flowered 1-3 inches long. Bracts lanceolate acuminate hairy. Sepals reddish hairy lanceolate acute \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long. Petals thin white adnate to the upper sepal. Lip base saccate with broad wings, then narrowed, limb broadly bilobed, lobes broad oblong divaricate edges crenulate, processes in the base of the lip 2. slender subulate curled, whole lip white with a central yellow bar. Column short, anther lanceolate beak up curved dull red, pollinia elongate pyriform, disc large oblong. Rostellum lobes linear acuminate. No accessory processes. Capsule pubescent elliptic \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long.\n\nCentre of the island, among ferns not rare.\n\nEndemic.\n\n**AMARYLLIDEAE.**\n\n*Crinum asiaticum*, L. The common white *Crinum* of the Indo-Malayan shores, is abundant on the rocks in many places, e.g. Andrews Look-out, N. E. point, at the Waterfall and Rocky point. It grows in clefts in rocks often in somewhat inaccessible places over the sea, and occasionally on the more inland terraces. The form is quite typical. It commenced to flower at the close of our stay and fruit were also found. It is a natural flowering plant, and a certain attraction for *Sphinx Convolvuli*, of which insect I took two or\nthree at the flowers of plants growing in the Settlement at Flying Fish Cove, this being the first record for this almost ubiquitous hawkmoth in the island. The large corky seeds are sea-dispersed being well adapted for this. Plants however occur often abundantly in hollows in rocks far from the sea at the present time, and at a great height above it, suggesting that the ancestors of these plants were there at the time when these now inland reefs were close to the sea. The plant though doubtless rapidly dispersed by sea, moves but slowly inland and apparently climbs up the rocks in the following manner. The long peduncles after flowering droop as the fruit develops till it reaches the ground when the seeds all fall and usually lie in a pile on the ground, where some at least germinate. On the sloping rock-faces the peduncles which fall towards the upper slope drop their seeds thus about four feet above the parent-plant, and so it creeps gradually up. Seeds from peduncles which droop downwards over the precipice either fall into the sea, or into the woods at the base of the precipice where they can seldom grow. Around the Malay coasts the plant almost invariably grows in sand or mud, close to the sea, but there is hardly any suitable place for this on Christmas Island as all the shores are mere masses of coral fragments turned over by the waves in the seasons of gales, and with no soil beneath. It grows however well enough where there is soil in Flying Fish Cove.\n\n*Crinum Asiaticum*, L. is distributed over India, Ceylon, the Malay Peninsula and Islands Admiralty Isles, Japan and North Australia, Polynesia, Fiji Islands.\n\n**Palmae.**\n\n*Arenga Listeri*, Becc.\n\nA single stemmed palm about 30-70 feet tall and 6-15 inches through, grey and distinctly ringed.\nSpathes 4 or 5 lanceolate acuminate coriaceous pale brown ribbed and keeled towards the tip 6-8 inches long 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch across, spadices numerous about 2 feet long with numerous spikes 18-24 inches long male flowers, calyx-lobes 3 rounded imbricate. Petals \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long spathulate woody yellow.\n\nStamens shorter about 40, filaments connate at the base, free about half their length, slender filiform, anthers linear oblong.\n\nFruit oblong elliptic \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch long pink, 3 seeded. Common all over the island but chiefly on the upper terraces. When the tree has fruited all the leaves fall off and the dead or dying stem with the inflorescences persisting has a most curious appearance. The spadices are in threes 2 males and 1 female. They are only produced about half way down from the top not down to the base as in the other species of the genus. The flower has a musky scent.\n\nEndemic, and not closely resembling any other species. The fruit is much more like that of a *Didymosperma* being small elliptic and pink with 3 seeds elongate flattened acute at both ends, pale brown. It is very difficult to get ripe seed of this plant, as soon as the fruit is ripe hundreds of the large robber crabs swarm round the tree and devour the seeds, crushing them in their jaws. They do not eat the pulp of the fruit. Hardly one seed is left and only those survive which have fallen into cracks, or got somehow covered up and concealed from the crabs. The young shoot of the palm is excellent either raw or cooked, and formerly I procured some excellent flour made from the stem.\n\n**PANDANEE.**\n\n*Pandanus nativitatis*, n. sp.\n\nA bushy pandan with branched stems, about 8-14 feet tall. Leaves six feet or more long 2 inches wide linear\nacuminate edge and keel with close-set pale thorns. Male spadix a foot or more long. Bracts about 10 linear acuminate 2 feet long or less 1 inch wide white. Branches of spadix 2 inches long or less numerous, acuminate not candate. Stamens very numerous in racemes, anthers linear mucronate much longer than the filaments which are very short.\n\nFruit as big as a man's head orange when ripe, rachis stout 6 or more inches long. Syncarps of 5 to 22 carpels, 2 inches long oblong, top broad, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch wide irregularly angled. Stigmas little elevated.\n\nCommon along the coast edges forming dense almost impenetrable thickets along the whole coast line above the sea. Very near *P. Forsteri* of Lord Howe's Island. This has just the habit and general appearance of *P. odoratissimus*, L. the plant that is so common along the Malay coasts, but it is less glaucous, the leaves and bracts not tailed, the syncarps a little shorter and broader and more deeply grooved. The male flowers are indistinguishable.\n\n*P. elatus*, n. sp.\n\nStems few together 40 to 60 feet tall 6 inches through very hard with numerous short hard aerial roots at the base, grey and sparingly thorny, above with a few erect branches. Leaves when young 6 to 10 feet long, adult 6 feet linear acute 4 inches across thorns at the base and tip very numerous and close bases swollen tip red brown \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long more distant in the middle of the leaf, and distant on the keel. Male spadix dense about 8 inches long. Bracts over a foot long linear acuminate hardly thorny. Spikes very dense 6 inches long 1 inch through or shorter. Stamens fascicled on a short stem, anthers crowded at the top, filaments short anthers oblong obtuse shortly mucronate. Fruit on a peduncle 2 feet long and \\( 2\\frac{1}{2} \\) inches thick, oblong 12 to 15 inches long 7 inches through. Syncarps \\( 1\\frac{1}{2} \\) to 2 inches across and \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch\nwide. Drupes 9 to 10 or fewer in a syncarp glaucescent bluntly angled tops free, 3 inches long \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch or less through style short. Stigma ovate acute sloping nearly \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Common in the interior on the Plateau. Endemic.\n\n**Aroideae.**\n\n*Remusatia vivipara*, Schott.\n\nThis was obtained by Andrews on the Phosphate Hill Road in January no one has seen it there before or since. I carefully sought both the old road and the new one and the surrounding region in vain for it. But possibly it had temporarily vanished during the hot and dry season. It should be looked for again in the rains.\n\nThe plant occurs in India, Ceylon, Siam and Java but is apparently absent from the Malay Peninsula proper.\n\n**Cyperaceae.**\n\n*Cyperus Iria*, L.\n\nSmall plants of this very widely distributed sedge were found at Smith Point.\n\nIt was evidently a recent introduction, as it was not seen by Andrews, and seemed hardly to have established itself.\n\n*Mariscus albescens* Gaud, *Cyperus pennatus*, Lam.\n\nThis fine rough sedge with its great tufts of stiff glaucous leaves and panicles of pale brownish spikelets, grows on the basaltic rocks over the sea just beyond the Waterfall. It was nearly out of flower at the time of our visit and had not previously been seen.\n\nIt is a common sea shore plant distributed over Tropical Africa, India, Ceylon, Malay Peninsula and Islands, Australia and Polynesia.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nTHE BOTANY OF CHRISTMAS ISLAND.\n\nApparently it would not grow on the limestone rocks, being confined to the basaltic outcrop.\n\n*Fimbristylis cymosa*, R. Br.\n\nA narrow leaved tufted sedge forming clumps resembling those of the Thrift (*Armeria*) in rocky dry spots above the sea. This was first recorded from the island by Hemsley from Lister's collection and was overlooked by Andrews. It is very common on the rocks by the wharf in Flying Fish Cove, Smith Point, beyond north-east point, and at the Waterfall and beyond towards Steep Point. It occurs in Polynesia, and Australia.\n\n**Gramineae.**\n\n*Paspalum conjugatum* Berg. This grass probably of South American origin, and now abundant in the Malay Peninsula has quite recently been introduced, accidentally, and has hardly established itself yet. It was met with at the wharf, and occurs too in Flying Fish Cove by one of the houses.\n\n*P. sanguinale var commutatum.*\n\nCommon all over the area cleared for cultivation and along paths. There are three forms of this, one the typical form with broad leaves and several spikes. Another with narrower leaves and narrow finely ribbed glumes. At Flying Fish Cove and Phosphate hill; and a dwarf tufted form with narrow bright green foliage, slender and few spikes and slightly ciliated glumes. This grows on Phosphate hill and in Flying Fish Cove and the Waterfall in dry open spots.\n\nThe plant is distributed over nearly all the regions warm enough for it and is very variable, but all the forms here belong to the variety *commutatum*. It had reached the island by 1890 when I saw it there, but was not collected before that, and I do not think it is indigenous.\n\n*R. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.*\nP. colonum, L.\n\nThis common grass occurs in Flying Fish Cove in no great abundance. It is probably of recent introduction as it was not collected by Andrews.\n\nIt is common all over the tropics and warmer parts of the world.\n\nP. Andrewsi, Rendle.\n\nThis elegant grass described by Rendle in the monograph of Christmas Island p. 192, and figured on Pl. XVIII of that work, seems to be very local. Andrews gives no specific locality for it, and I sought it unsuccessfully everywhere till I found it on the basalt outcrop above Flying Fish Cove. The plants were almost completely dried up, and those I found were much more elegant than the figure represents. It is more graceful and slender than P. ovalifolium.\n\nDistribution Timor.\n\nPanicum clivale, n. sp.\n\nA tufted grass with a short creeping rhizome about 6 inches tall, stems slender. Leaves narrow linear acute glabrous 2 inches long \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch wide, ligule ciliate. Panicle slender few branched erect, branches scabrid. Spikelets solitary shortly pedicelled with a sinuous slender scabrid barren branch subtending each, about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Pedicel of spikelet very short with a cup-shaped top spikelet ovoid barely \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long. Glume I. ovate subacute small. Gl.

Glume IV. white crustaceous finely dotted large lanceolate boatshaped Palea thin lanceolate narrower.\n\nVery local on the dry earth above Tom's Ladder, in Flying Fish Cove not previously collected.\n\nSetaria glauca, Beauv. A single plant of this almost worldwide weed of cultivation was found by me on Phosphate\nhill on ground cleared by the Chinese for cultivation. It occurs nearly all over the world.\n\n*Oplismenus compositus*, Beauv.\n\nPerhaps the most abundant grass on the island, growing all through the more open woods. It is the best fodder grass on the island and is regularly collected for the horses and cattle. As it is so widely distributed in the island I surmise that it is indigenous, though it was not obtained by Lister. Andrews however collected it and found it abundant. There are two forms here, one tall with long spikes the other more compact. Distribution, all tropical and warm countries.\n\n*Ischaemum foliosum var leiophyllum*, Hack.\n\nA somewhat variable usually tufted grass growing on the rocks above the sea, from beyond Smiths' Point to Flying Fish Cove, and along to near the Waterfall but scarcer on this coast. It does not grow inland. Rendle suggests that it is probably only a form of *I. ciliare*, but no two species could be more different in habit and structure. It is the *I. murinum* Forst, of Hemsley's list. The plant varies somewhat. Specimens growing in less exposed places are taller and more flaccid than those of the much exposed places. The spikelets break off when ripe and are drifted along the coast by the wind. One often sees little piles of them in holes on the rocks. Distribution New Caledonia.\n\n*Eleusine indica*, L.

Ceylon, Malay Islands, Australia, Polynesia.\n\nAlways a sea shore plant the spikes break up readily into joints and are doubtless sea drifted.\n\n**Gymnosperms.**\n\n*Cycas circinalis* var *javana*, Miq.\n\nA tall plant about 20 feet high, with rather slender pinnae to the leaves. I did not see fruit or flowers, Andrews says it grows all round the island and is most plentiful on the upper terrace at the west end of the south coast. I found it comparatively scarce, and the plants all isolated, one in Flying Fish Cove, one on Phosphate hill, one near Andrew's Lookout, and one on Steeprock. Except the one in the Cove, all were on the upper terraces a good way from the sea. This is interesting as the seeds of *Cycas* are typically sea disseminated, and these plants though growing on the coral\nrocks formerly washed by the sea, are now far out of reach of the waves, and the plant probably reached the island in its early days. I saw no young plants and it does not appear to be spreading. I am not sure as to the species of this plant but have followed Rendle in the name. The pinnae are much more narrow than in *C. Rumphiana*, the common Malayan species.\n\n**Ferns.**\n\n*Trichomanes parvulum*, Poiret.\n\nOn trees on the Plateau, (Andrews.)

Its geology was carefully studied by Andrews and is described in the Monograph of Christmas Island. He shews it to be an extinct volcano covered with coral reefs of various ages from the eocene period to the present day. This being so it follows that the indigenous plants reached the island by means which enabled them to cross the sea either by their seeds being drifted by sea-currents, or blown there by the wind, or carried by birds or bats.\n\nIt is probable that some part of the island was above water, and capable of maintaining terrestrial plants in Miocene times so that some of the plants may have established themselves as early as that period, but no fossil plants have yet been\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nobtained there, nor are we yet acquainted with the Miocene flora of the neighbouring countries, so as to be able to suggest which of the plants if any belong to that date.\n\nFor the purposes of this paper I have classified the plants found in the various islands which are considered to have been always isolated from the mainland according to the methods by which their seeds or fruits can be disseminated and conveyed across a large tract of sea.\n\nIn this way plants may be divided into seven classes, viz.\n1. Sea-borne. 2. Bird or bat-borne, by the seeds being swallowed by these animals and eventually deposited uninjured. 3. Adhesive (the seeds or fruits being attached to their fur or feathers and so conveyed). 4. Plumed seed. 5. Winged seed or fruit. 6. Powder seed; these last three being conveyed by gales of wind: and 7. Weeds, plants dispersed accidentally or more or less intentionally by man. There are some other methods of dissemination on land which cannot come into play in populating islands, such as dispersal by terrestrial animals, and insects, and by streams or rivers, and these may be neglected though they may act in dispersing a plant (the seeds of which have once been successfully landed) over the remainder of the island.\n\nThere are a certain number of plants often widely distributed which are certainly disseminated by one of these seven methods, but by which is at present doubtful. Such for instance are the herbaceous Malvaceae and many grasses and sedges, and again there are some plants which may reach these islands in more ways than one. Portulaca oleracea may be an example of this. In some cases it appears to have been accidentally introduced as a weed, while in others it apparently came by sea. In this paper I class it as Sea-borne.\n\nThe weeds of human introduction have been already discussed. It remains to deal with the six other classes. (1) Sea-borne seeds or fruits. The larger Sea-borne seeds or fruits are tolerably well known for the most part. They have often some adaptation or modification for protection from the action of the sea water, as in the case of the strongly developed bladder-like calyx of Hernandia which protects the seed.\nenclosed in it from the action of the salt water, and also aids to float it, and the corky outer coat of the seed of *Carapa*.\n\nBut many of the seeds often sea-dispersed have no more protection than the hard seed-coat. Such are the beans *Canavalia*, *Erythrina*, *Strongylodon*, *Entada*, *Guilandina* etc. It is essential of course that these seeds should float uninjured and it is necessary also that the plant should be able to grow on the sea shore when it arrives; so that the greater number of Sea-borne plants are always to be found on the shores or close to the sea. But there are some, such as *Terminalia Catappa* and *Eugenia grandis* which also can grow for some way at least inland, and their fruits are carried by bats or birds to some distance from the sea, whence they originally landed. Probably a good many plants travel by sea occasionally and arrive in safety at distant islands which one would not imagine to be able to travel so. I have seen plants of *Dendrobium crumenatum* a widely distributed plant floating apparently quite uninjured by sea water in the Banka Strait far from land, and I have been informed by Mr. Ross, that a clump of sugarcane had once drifted up upon Cocos Island where it began to grow and was eventually propagated. Many small seeded plants which commonly occur on sea beaches and shores are almost certainly sea dispersed, but owing to the smallness of their seed they have not been detected in sea drift, and thus one may be uncertain about them. A good deal more information is wanted on this head.\n\nAs to the direction of sea-currents in these seas, I have but little information but I may remark that we found plenty of pumice-stone in the eastern corner of Flying Fish Cove and this had doubtless come from Krakatau, which is west of Christmas Island, and in 1890 I saw, in going from the Sunda Straits to Cocos and Christmas Islands, much of this pumice floating in large patches. The pumice also occurred some years ago in quantity on the point known as Tanjong Gol in the extreme south west of Singapore. So that currents capable of carrying pumice-stone run both east and west from Krakatau. Seeds therefore of plants could be brought to Christmas Island at least from Java and Sumatra without\nrequiring to be drifted to Australia and back. Andrews points out that the Ocean current which passes the island is the equatorial drift which comes down from the Timor sea and receives tributaries through the Straits between Bali and Lombok etc. This would bring down doubtless all the Sea-borne seeds of Australian types on the island. But there must be also currents from the north to account for the typically Javanese plants.\n\nThe absence of many plants of which the seeds must at times have reached the island is perhaps due to the unsuitability of soil for them. Thus the Mangrove plants, *Rhizophora*, *Bruguiera* and *Avicennia* the fruit of which may be seen in abundance drifting down the Banka Straits are absent, *Cerbera odollam* too seems to have failed to properly establish itself though a tree of this was seen by Andrews. It seems to have disappeared since. There is in fact no suitable ground for these plants which require a muddy soil for their existence. *Pangium edule* a riverbank plant, the seeds of which have been seen in sea drift in other parts of the Archipelago besides Christmas Island where I found one battered seed, has not succeeded in establishing itself as there is no place suited for it.\n\nSome of the plants which have established themselves are very local and only growing special soils, such are *Mariscus albescens*, on the out crop of volcanic rock near the Waterfall, and *Nephrodium truncatum* on the mud by the fresh-water stream in the same locality, both evidently plants which cannot grow on the coral reefs or their detritus.\n\nThe great height of the cliffs surrounding the island for its greatest part would also militate against the successful landing of sea-drifted seeds. There are as far as is known only two or three possible landing places for such plants, Flying Fish Cove, the Waterfall bay and a few smaller beaches beyond, the West white beach and a few other possible spots, but in former years there may have been other suitable spots, and during the Monsoon the waves beat up very high on parts of the coast, and seed might be thrown to the top of many of the lower cliffs.\n\nDuring my stay in Christmas Island I looked for fruits and seeds washed ashore in the bays but could find very few.\nDuring the heavy storms there might be more. All I could find were *Terminalia Catappa*, *Guettarda speciosa*, (sunk) and the remains of a seed of *Pangium edule*. Portion of a rhizome of a bamboo, long dead however, was found in a bay near the Waterfall. No bamboos are grown on the island. Mr. Chapman however after my departure at my request kindly sought for seeds etc., after heavy storms, and obtained seed of *Cerbera odollam*, *Terminalia*, *Entada scandens*, *Pandanus*, and fruits of *Bruguiera* dead and nibbled by molluses, and carrying barnacles. Also he found many large bamboos with shoots but dead on the West white beach.\n\nThe following is the list of plants probably introduced by sea-currents to Christmas Island.\n\n*Portulaca oleracea.*\n*Ochrocarpus ovalifolius.*\n*Calophyllum inophyllum.*\n*Malvastrum tricuspidatum.* Probably.\n*Sida spinosa.* Probably.\n*Abutilon auritum.* Probably.\n*A Listeri.* Probably.\n*Hibiscus vitijolius.* Probably.\n*H. tiliaceus.* Common sea drifted plant.\n*Colubrina pedunculata.*\n*Erythrina indica.*\n*Strongylodon ruber.*\n*Galactia tenuiflora.*\n*Canavalia.* Common in sea drift.\n*Pougamia glabra.*\n*Inocarpus edulis.*\n*Gudandina bonducella.* Well known as a sea drift seed.\n*Entada scandens.* Well known as a sea drift seed.\n*Terminalia Catappa.* Well known as a sea drift seed.\n*Combretum acuminatum.*\n*Quisqualis indica.*\n*Gyrocarpus asiatica.*\n*Burringtonia rubra.*\n*Pemphis acidula.*\n*Sesuvium portulacastrum.*\n\nR.

They included.\n\nMucuna sp.\nCynometra. Pods containing seed.\nEntada scandens.\nStrongylodon ruber.\nGuilandina bonduc.\nGarcinia mangostana fruit.\nCarapa moluccana.\nHodgsonia heteroclitus.\nOchrocarpus ovalifolius.\nPangium edule.\nHeritiera littoralis.\nTerminalia catappa.\nAlcurites moluccanus.\nQuercus 2 species.\nErythrina probably indica.\nCanavalia lineata.\nBarringtonia 2 species?\n\nand several other indeterminable seeds. Most of these were in good condition, and would probably have readily germinated but of all, only two species are established on the island, viz. Guilandina bonduc, and Aleurites moluccanus. Mr. A. S. Keating in Holmans travels quoted by Mr. Hemsley (Voy. H. M. S. Challenger Botany of South Eastern Moluccas p. 114) records also the \"Soap-tree\" (probably Sapindus) Castor-oil (Ricinus communis), and timber from Java and Australia and suggests that the seeds were first drifted to the Australian coasts by the North-West monsoon and then back again by the South-East trade wind. In view of the fact that there are no plants on the island nor seeds in these lists at all characteristic of Australia, and the abundance of specimens of almost all kinds mentioned in Mr. Ross' collection and the absence of the Australian and Polynesian forms occurring in Christmas Island, viz Inocarpus edulis, Ischoemum foliosum and Finbristylis cymosa (represented in Cocos by the Malayan F. glomerata,) I should doubt this very much, in spite of the trees of blue gum wood of Australia said to have drifted there.\n\nAll the plants recorded from Cocos Island in Forbes' list (introduced plants excepted) occur in Christmas Island, except Triumfetta procumbens, Guilandina Bonduc (replaced by G. Bonducella, Ochrosia parviflora (represented by O. Ackeringae) Dicliptera Burmanui, (D. macleari in Christmas) Fleurya aestuans (Urera Gandichandiana) represented by Fl. ruderalis Gaud. Stenotaphrum lepturoide (said to be identical with S. americanum by Hemsley) and Finbristylis glomeratus.\n\nThere are however in Christmas Island three noticeable plants of Australian and Polynesian origin only, Inocarpus edulis, Ischoemum foliosum and Finbristylis cymosa. These it is most probable arrived by sea at Christmas Island. It would indeed be unlikely for any bird except sea birds to fly successfully for that distance, nor is it probable that even\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nplumed seed would be drifted by wind from Australia to Christmas Island.\n\n2. Bird and bat-borne seed and fruit. By this class of seed I mean those that are carried about by birds or fruit-bats swallowing the fruit or seeds and afterwards passing the seed in their excreta. Fruits and seeds dispersed by adhering to fur or feathers are classed separately for they may be dispersed by sea birds only, while this class require the aid of frugivorous birds.\n\nMost of the seeds borne by birds and bats internally are enclosed in fleshy drupes, berries, and figs, but it is certain also that a number of seeds of small hard seeds or fruits such as those of the capsular Euphorbiaceae are also swallowed by birds and passed unharmed, though it is hard to see why a hard dry seed such as those of Macaranga, and Sapium seceratum (a plant thus dispersed by birds in Fernando de Noronha) should be attractive to birds. Possibly also some of the fruits of the Cyperaceae and grasses found in Oceanic Islands have been brought there by birds.\n\nFruit-bats though fond of large-sized drupes do not usually at least swallow them but flying to a neighbouring tree nibble off the flesh and drop the stone on the spot. They however eat figs greedily, swallowing the whole fruit.\n\nChristmas Island possesses at present as residents the following frugivorous birds and mammal. A fruitbat, two pigeons, Carpophaga whartonii and Chalcophraps natalis, the white-eye Zosterops natalis and an occasional fruit or seed-eater Merula erythropleura. All are endemic, but the Chalcophraps is hardly distinct from the common Malay one. The white pigeon Myristicivora has been seen on the island, blown over in heavy gales, and a minah (Acridotheres) was shot on the island during our visit but may possibly have been brought over by a native. How many more birds have been driven on to the island by the heavy gales and either perished or managed to fly back again no one can say. Many waders, as well as wagtails and a duck seem to come over regularly from Java.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nIn the commencement of the afforestation of an Oceanic Island, it is obvious that the first terrestrial birds who bring the seeds of such fruit as they eat must perish of starvation or less probably fly on to other places where they can get food. It is only when food has become plentiful by the growth of the seeds birds have brought that the frugivorous birds can settle down in an island.\n\nIn Cocos Island there seem to be no frugivorous birds, nor can the *Pteropus* occasionally finding its way there survive its voyage. (Forbes wanderings p. 32). Pteropus however can subsist very well on shoots of trees as well as fruits.\n\nIn Cocos Island there are no fruits suitable for frugivorous birds except those of a few introduced plants so that birds requiring food of this nature would hardly be likely to survive a long voyage to the island.\n\nI made some experiments in the Botanic Gardens in Singapore with fruit-eating birds, to discover if possible how long they retained the seed of fruits they had swallowed before passing them.\n\nA Cassowary was fed with fruits of the Cocoplum (*Chrysobalanus Icaco*) at 9.20 a.m. and passed the seed after 8 p.m. but before morning.\n\nA Hornbill fed with Cocoplum passed the seed at the same time as the Cassowary. It ate berries of *Rhodamnia trinervia* at 10 a.m. and passed some of the seed at 12, and the rest at 2 p.m. It ate fruits of *Carissa carandas* at 7 a.m. and passed some at 8 a.m. the rest at 1 p.m.\n\n*Myristicivora*, the white pigeon known as the Rawai was unable to swallow seed of the Cocoplum or that of the Rambutan, *Nephelium lappaceum*. It ate *Rhodamnia* fruits at 10 a.m. and passed all the seed at once at 1 p.m. It ate fruits of *Pinanga kuhlii* at 8.30 a.m. and began to pass them at 10 a.m. continuing till it passed the last at 4 p.m. Carissa fruits, it swallowed at 7 and passed the seed at 8 a.m and 1 p.m. as did the Hornbill.\n\nIt was observed that when fed with much fruit, and these birds passed the seed more slowly than when they had but little given them.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nBetel nuts with the husk on were swallowed by the hornbill but it vomited up the seed. Naturally this fruit is not eaten by any animal so far as I am aware. Rambutans (*Nephelium*) it only pecked and sucked not swallowing the seed.\n\nIt would appear from these observations that these birds would only carry the seed for a distance which could be covered by them in 8 hours or a little more, so that in conveying seeds from say Java to Christmas Island about 300 miles the birds must make the passage in a comparatively few hours.\n\n**Bird and Bat-borne Seeds.**\n\n*Limacia nativitatis.*\n*Pittosparum nativitais,* fruits of *P. ferruginens* in Singapore commonly so carried.\n\n*Grewia* two species,\n\n*Acronychia Andrewsii,* Fruits, pink berries.\n\n*Dysoxylon amooroides,* Seed swallowed by birds.\n\n*Celastrus paniculatus?*\n\n*Vitis repens.*\n\n*V. pedatus,* Berries pink.\n\n*Lea sambucina.*\n\n*Allophyllus Cabbe,* Berry red.\n\n*Eugenia,* Drupe small red.\n\n*Zehneria,* Berry small pink.\n\n*Heptopleurum.*\n\n*Randia densiflora,* Drupe small red.\n\n*Ardisia pulchra,* Drupe small.\n\n*Sideroxylon sundaicum,* Favourite food of *Carpophaga.*\n\n*Ehretia buxifolia?*\n\n*Solanum biflorum,* Berry red.\n\n*Physalis minima.*\n\n*Datura alba,* From the way *D. fastuosa* spreads in Singapore I believe it is the dispersed by birds, though its dry and indeed poisonous seed does not seem inviting.\n\n*Callicarpa longifolia,* Drupe white small.\n\n*Premna lucidula,* Drupe white small.\n\n*Deeringia celosioides,* Drupes red.\nCryptocarya nativitatis, Favourite food of Carpophaga.\nClaoxylon caeruleascens.\nMacaranga tanarius?\nCeltis cinnamomea.\nTrema amboinensis, Drupes orange, commonly dispersed by birds in Singapore.\nFicus retusa, Eaten by bats and birds.\nF. saxophila, Figs bright red or orange.\nLaportea?\nBoehmeria plutyphylla?\nArenga Listeri, Berry pink.\n\nSpondias dulcis may have been sea-drifted to the Island as fruits of one species have been found in sea-drift in Jamaica, but it is stated that it is commonly carried about by Hornbills in Java, and as these are far-flighted birds one or more may have reached Christmas Island at some period. The fruit appears to be too big for Carpophaga, as it remained untouched at the foot of the trees, and the trees were confined to a limited area.\n\nIt is perhaps worth noting that all these plants in this list are either Javanese or from one of the neighbouring islands or allied to plants from this region, with the exception of Cryptocarya nativitatis of Australian affinities.\n\nAdhesive seeds or fruits.\n\nThese are furnished with hooks, bristles, or hair, or a gummy secretion by which they adhere to the fur or feathers of birds and animals and are so borne from place to place. This class of seeds is rare in Oceanic Islands, the greater number of the plants possessing such means of dissemination being low growing plants, with which birds seldom come in contact. Such are Centotheca and Laphotherum grasses dispersed by mammals walking through the forests. These plants through common and widely dispersed through the Malay region are absent from the\nIsland. Several of the weeds are dispersed by their adhesive fruits such as *Synedrella* and *Paspalum conjugatum* but these evidently did not reach Christmas Island without the aid of human beings and are not yet to be found in any parts of the island which is not constantly visited by man.\n\nThe following list contains all the plants exclusive of weeds which seem to have reached Christmas Island by adhering to the feathers of birds.\n\n*Triumfetta suffruticosa*, A shrub with capsules covered with hooked bristles very adhesive. Probably brought by sea-birds, as it was abundant in two places where the birds nested.\n\n*Dicliptera Macleari*. Low herb, adheres by its spiny bracts.\n\n*Anisomeles ovata*, perhaps adheres by its spiny calyx.\n\n*Leucas*, adheres by its spiny calyx.\n\n*Boerhaavia*, fruits glutinous and sticky may be sea borne, but I found it not only on the sea shore but on high cliffs above Flying Fish bay, where it is hardly likely to have been thrown by the sea.\n\n*Pisonia grandis*, and *P. excelsa*, Fruits when ripe split and exude a glutinous matter very adhesive. Forbes mentions (Naturalist's wanderings pp. 30, 33) how he found a *Pisonia* in Cocos the fruits of which adhered to the feathers of the herons, and often killed them by clogging their feathers. One of these herons was *Demigretta sacra*, not rare in Christmas Island. Many sea birds nested in the trees of *Pisonia grandis*, but I did not find any fruits of this species so that I am not sure whether they are as adhesive as those of *P. excelsa*.\n\n*Achyranthes aspera* has spiny burrs which are adhesive, and is commonly to be found on the cliff edges near the boody's nesting places.\n\nAll these plants are either Javanese or have Javanese affinities except *Pisonia grandis*, a native of Australia and Polynesia.\nPlumed Seed and Fruits.\n\nThese are chiefly of plants belonging to the orders Apocynaceae, Aselepiadeae, Compositae, with a few Gesneraceae, and grasses. The seed or fruit are disseminated by wind, and it might be thought that these would readily be conveyed to Oceanic Islands, as are the dust seed plants. This is not the case. They are comparatively scarce, and curiously most of the Compositae of Oceanic Islands are the ones which have plumless fruits, introduced weeds excepted. Only 3 plants with distinctly plumed fruits or seeds are known from Christmas Island, of these one Ageratum conyzoides is certainly a weed. The others are Blumea spectabilis and Hoya Aldrichi. The former is a hill forest plant of the Malay region, the latter an endemic species allied to Javanese species.\n\nWinged Fruit and Seeds.\n\nThese are still rarer than the plumed seeds, and of the very few that are to be met with in Oceanic Islands, it may be doubted very much whether their wings have played a large if any part in their dissemination. The Dipterocarp\u00e6 for instance are quite absent from Oceanic Islands. Gyrocarpus which occurs in Christmas Islands and other Islands a sea shore plant is certainly disseminated by its wings, but I suspect it reaches the islands by sea. I cannot conceive of the winged fruits of Berria being drifted by the severest gale for two hundred miles, as it is really hardly adapted for flying more than about 40 yards, yet it occurs on Christmas Island. The fruit is a winged capsule which splits when ripe and releases its pubescent seed, so that really ripe fruit if blown out to sea in a gale of wind, would almost certainly break up ere it had gone far and the seed would fall into the sea.\n\nDust Seed.\n\nThe very fine dust like seed of orchids, and Balanophora and the spores of ferns, Lycopods and cellular\nplants have perhaps the widest and most rapid dissemination of any group and there can be no doubt that they are the first seeds to arrive at an Island when it first becomes in a fit state to receive terrestrial vegetation, but there are islands in which plants with this class of seed are scanty, notably Fernando de Noronha on which I found no orchids, only one fern and very few cellular plants. The reasons for this seemed to be that the neighbouring land from which the wind could bring seed was somewhat of a desert nature, and ferns at least were not very common, also the island itself was distinctly xerophilous with a very dry season during which no rain fell and the ground became very dry. In Cocos Island also dust\u2014seed plants are very scarce no orchids or ferns, and only one moss and one fungus being recorded. Here again it is doubtless the unsuitability of soil and climate that prevents these plants from establishing themselves. In Christmas Island indeed that though the number of ferns is large, the ground and rocks were in the dry season so arid that a considerable area produced no ferns or mosses. Where the ground was damper in the forests of the plateau, ferns and mosses were plentiful. One fern was confined to the fresh water stream never dry at the Waterfall, and mosses and fungi were commoner round the water tanks where water was often spilt.\n\nCellular plants, algae and fungi, have an extremely wide dispersal area, far more so than the more elaborate vascular plants, and a good many seem to occur in all corners of the world. Some of the fungi, such as *Polyporus sanguineus*, *Guepinia*, *Schizophyllum commune* which are common on old timber may easily have been brought on pieces of wood by ships stopping at the island but most at least of the fungi must have arrived by the drifting of their spores by the wind. Considering the dryness of the weather a large number were obtained and some more were seen which could not be preserved. There are probably very many more to be collected at more suitable seasons. Besides the cellular plants there occur of the dust\u2014seed group, the following, one *Balanophora*, ten orchids, 21 ferns two *Lycopadiaceae*. Of these 34 plants 17\nare epiphytic plants, 7 orchids, and 10 ferns, the rest are small low-growing terrestrial plants. All are either Javanese or closely allied to Javanese species, but two; *Balanophora insularis* and *Dendrocolla carinatfolia* have hitherto been only met with in the island of Pulau Aur off the East coast of the Malay Peninsula. Balanophoras of this type however occur in Tahiti, Salayer Island, Timor Laut, and the Comoro Islands. They seem to be all insular and to occur only in the Southern Islands in a line fringing the South of Asia and reaching to Tahiti and Comoro respectively. The endemic species of dust seed plants are 6 orchids and two ferns.\n\nBesides these there are a large number of cellular Cryptogams, most if not all brought to the island by the drifting of their seeds in the wind. Two species of *Peperomia* also occur the very small fruits of which may possibly have been blown by the wind to Christmas Island.\n\nI have assumed that the epiphytic orchids have all reached the island by their seeds, but it is quite possible that some of them have been sea drifted to the Island. For in 1890 I saw plants of *Dendrobium Crumenatum* apparently quite fresh and green floating about in the sea off the coast of Banka and Moseley (Notes by a Naturalist p. 368) mentions finding in Little Ki Island an epiphytic orchid washed up by the sea in a quite lively state. Most epiphytic orchids however are very quickly killed by sea water.\nMalacca Lace.\n\nBy Mrs. Bland.\n\nFifty years ago really fine cotton pillow lace was made in Malacca. The lace was worn by the Chiefs and Hajis on their coats and trousers, and it may still be seen occasionally at weddings, but with the use of European clothing the lace has more or less disappeared. The present generation are content to use nine to nineteen bobbins, while their grandmothers and great aunts before them used fifty to one hundred, or even more. Moreover, they have lost all their patterns, all their fine bobbins and even their pillows. The white ants have consumed them all. Occasionally; one may come across a few relics of this past art in beautiful ivory bobbins and faded trouser borders. I myself obtained a very fine specimen of the latter from an old Malay, and have no doubt others can be picked up in the Kampongs (see plate No 3). All that remains of this old industry is the present \"biku\" making, chiefly found in the district of Pringgit, where quite fifty women use pillows\u2014also at Bukit Tempurong and Bukit China, but here in much fewer numbers\u2014at the outside twenty workers. \"Biku\" or edging is made of coloured silk for native use to border handkerchiefs and veils, and is sold very cheaply for that purpose to Malays and Chinese. It is sold in lengths of $2\\frac{1}{2}$ yards or one \"bimpul.\" The silk is bought by the woman in skeins from \"kelontong kain\" the travelling draper, or pedlar, and he also sells the \"biku\" itself with his other wares. The pillow used, as depicted in the photograph, (see plate 1) is of the simplest description\u2014a rough wooden sloping stool padded with cloth and stuffed with sawdust. The cost is fifty or sixty cents at the present date. It is called \"bantal\" by the Malays, and I have noticed the little girls\n\nJour. Straits Branch, R. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nsitting astride their pillows when just commencing a new piece. It is perhaps to this reason that the pillow owes its shape\u2014it no doubt suits the Malay who always works sitting on the floor,\u2014but it is very back-breaking to the European. Formerly the pillows always had a drawer for holding extra bobbins. It is now omitted. The bobbins are either made of wood, horn, or ivory, and are called \"buah.\" They are very similar in shape to the Ceylon bobbins, but rather more delicate in make and size. At the present time, there is considerable difficulty in getting bobbins made at all and the old bobbins made in ebony and ivory for three or five cents, cannot now be obtained in plain wood for less than eight or ten cents. There are five patterns now in common use, the greatest number of bobbins used being nineteen. Four of these patterns are depicted in plate 2, requiring nine, eleven, fifteen, and nineteen bobbins respectively beginning at the foot of the plate. There is one other pattern not shown requiring thirteen bobbins. The two insertions shown at the top of plate 2 are old patterns not now made. Fifty and thirty bobbins were used respectively in their composition. The patterns are pricked out in paper and called \"Sepesel\" and \"achuwan.\" The Malays have names for their patterns such as:\n\n1) \"Prut Lintah\" or leech's stomach. This in \"torchon\" would be called \"bar\" stitch\u2014In the insertions shewn in Plate 2, these bars are combined to form 6-pointed stars, which are known as \"Bunga Tanjong\":\n\n(2) \"Anyam Krosi\" or chair-plait which in \"torchon\" would be called cloth stitch, is also shown in the same insertions alternating with the \"Bunga Tanjong.\"\n\n(3) \"Siku Keluwang\" or bat's wing, which is a vandyke pattern depicted in the wide insertions of the old trouser border in plate 3. And I daresay many others which are now forgotten with the art. The various stitches are also named, and one \"biku\" of thirteen bobbins was thus described to me, beginning at the foot of the edging right across to the top:\n\n\"Puchok\" or \"Kipas\" taking one bobbin.\n\n\"Buah Sirih\" taking two bobbins\n\n[Jour. Straits Branch]\n\"Ikatan kipas\" taking two bobbins.\n\"Penyambut\" taking two bobbins.\n\"Prut Lintah\" taking two bobbins.\n\"Tali Ayer\" taking two bobbins.\"\n\"Kaki\" taking two bobbins.\n\nThe most common stitch in all their laces is the \"Ikatan,\" or fastening stitch. It does not resemble the torchon \"half stitch\" or \"whole stitch\" but seems to be original. A more elaborate form of it is called \"Mata Punai,\" and is the only stitch which has the same name as in the Palembang patterns sent to me. The Malacca Malays use the word \"renda\" for all lace except the narrow edgings which they call \"biku.\" They themselves never seem to have made wide edgings; all their wide laces being insertions joined together for trouser borders. They throw their bobbins across with incredible rapidity using their second and third fingers to flick the bobbin across more especially in making the \"bars\" or \"prut lintah.\" It is an art which cannot be acquired by everyone. As to the origin and history of the industry I have been unable to find out anything. Through the kindness and courtesy of Mr. Spakler, Consul General for the Netherlands in Singapore, I have obtained a pillow from Palembang, Sumatra, where lace is also made by the Malays. This pillow is identical with the Malacca one in structure and design only with a drawer and more elaborately ornamented. The industry is a flourishing one in Palembang where the Dutch ladies buy the lace in quantities for their Kebayas (jackets) and it is sold in lengths of $4\\frac{1}{2}$ yards for this purpose. The bobbins are also identical, though slightly longer and up to one hundred are employed. What is more interesting the common terms are the same\u2014\"Bantal,\" \"Buah,\" \"Sepesel\"\u2014but in addition they have the word \"Papan\" for insertion, and \"renda\" is confined to wide (2), edgings which in Palembang are also made by the natives. \"Renda\" is I believe, a Portuguese word and is also used in Ceylon for lace, were I am told the lace industry was undoubtedly founded by the Portuguese. But again it may be native. If is impossible now to say. A very curious pillow was shown to me by Mr.\nR. Shelford, Curator of the Sarawak Museum at Kuching, on which edgings are made by the Malays principally in gold thread for veils and coats worn by the Dyak women. This edging is there called \"puntas,\" the pillow \"guling puntas,\" the bobbins \"pelulak,\" and the pattern which is pricked out on a strip of palm leaf is called \"kabat puntas.\" The pillow is very primitive, a cylindrical cushion, placed on an earthenware bowl, and the bobbins which vary in number from four to sixteen are like ninepins and extremely clumsy. Good specimens of all the three pillows here described may now be seen in the Singapore Museum. I have learnt myself to make the Malacca \"biku\" and have appended to these notes the common words used by my teacher during our lessons. A tentative attempt is now being made to revive the industry at the Girls' School at Pringgit. It is an industry specially adapted to Malay women. I owe my grateful thanks to the Bible Society Ladies for introducing me to this local industry, also to Mr. Howell, who has so kindly assisted me with his camera, and for some very careful and detailed information received from the Resident in Palembang through Mr. Spakler.\n\nTerms.\n\n\"Kuku\" finger nail, applied to loops in the \"kipas\"\n\"Kedut\" crumpled\n\"Ulor\" slack\n\"Tegang\" tight, taut\n\"Selang\" alternate\n\"Pintal\" to cross\n\"Kipas\" fan\n\"Rengkap\" pair, complete set of two\n\"Chuchok jarum\" put in pin\n\"Ikat Jarum\" to enclose pin\n\"Peniti\" pin\n\"Kwet\" flick given to the bobbin\n\"Unting\" skein\n\"Tukal\" bundle\n\"Chuchok sepesel\" to prick out the pattern\n\nJour.

The surrounding country is quite flat, the solitary granite hill of Jugra, the nearest high hill being some sixteen miles away. Wild goats have not been heard of on this hill. It may be that this goat was driven from the interior by some rival and wandered down to the coast. It was driven with the sea by the Penghulu's dogs and has since been in captivity, the animal is becoming quite tame.\n\nHENRY NORMAN.\n\nHabits of the Tupaia.\n\nThe common little Tupaia, (*T. ferruginea*) seems to be quite omnivorous in its habits. In the Journal No. XXIX p. 148, I mentioned that it ate considerable quantities of fruit, although it belongs to the order tinsectivora. Recently I saw one chasing a bull-frog (*Callula pulchra*) along a garden path. The frog puffed out as usual when alarmed and hopped along as fast as it could, the Tupaia trying to catch it by the leg. Another Tupaia ran out of the wood, and drove off the first one, and began to chase the frog, finally catching it in its mouth and darting away with it into the wood. The frog when alarmed exudes a very sticky liquid from its back, and apparently the Tupaias either could not or were unwilling to seize it by the back, and tried to catch it by the leg, but appeared to have some difficulty in so doing.\n\nH. N. RIDLEY.\n\nJour. Straits Branch, R. A. Soc., No 45, 1905\nSome Birds of Tiuman Island.\n\nC. Boden Kloss, F.Z.S., F.S.A.\n\nTowards the end of a cruise in the Southern China Sea undertaken in 1899 (see journal 41), Dr W. L. Abbott and I spent about a week on the east coast of Tiuman collecting mammals and birds in the vicinity of Joara Bay, and again, a year later, on our return from an expedition to Tringanu, stopped for some days at Tingah Bay on the west side of the Island for the same purposes.\n\nIt was my intention to have given some account in the Journal of this little known Island and our experiences; but my notes have been mislaid and all that I have now to hand of the results are lists of the mammals and birds collected, of which I now record the latter here.\n\nA word with regard to Tiuman. It is about 120 miles by sea from Singapore opposite the mouths of the Rumpin and Endau Rivers though the nearest point of the Malay Peninsula is distant about 22 miles S. E. It belongs to Pahang, and is inhabited by a few Malays of that race who collect rattan in its forests. The island is some eleven miles long N. S. and six wide at its broadest part and is very hilly, the highest peak being 3444 ft. while high above the southern shore are two peculiar bare rocky pinnacles known as the Dragons Ears to which reference has already been made in this journal and in the journal of the Indian Archipelago.\n\nVarious new species of mammals were obtained, but there were no novelties among the birds which were all collected below 500 feet alt. as during neither visit did we ascend the mountain. A number of species were observed in addition to those preserved but for the reason given above I am unable to include them here.\n\n1 Malacopterum magnirostre, Moore.\n2 Stachyris davisoni, Sharpe.\n3 Cyanoderma erythropterum, Blyth.\n4 Aegithina viridissima, Horsf.\n\nJour.

N. Ridley. When we reached the Kangka at the foot of the mountain one of my collectors, whom I had sent on in advance, informed me that an ular saua, 5 depas in length, had been killed by the Chinese there a few days before. The skin was nailed out along several boards but was unfortunately without the head which the Chinese had chopped off in slaughtering the reptile. We measured the portion that remained however and found it to be 29ft. 10 inches in length so I have no doubt that the dimensions given by my collector of the snake in the flesh were correct. This python had entered a pig-sty\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nin the evening and there made a meal of a gravid sow, for when it was skinned next day it was found to contain thirteen pigs of various sizes in all, and by these the reptile had been so distended that it was unable to make its way cut through the hole by which it had entered.\n\nWhile pythons under twenty feet are common enough, the occurrence of a 30ft. snake in the Peninsula seems to me of sufficient interest to be recorded here.\n\nC. Boden Kloss, F. Z. S.\n\nAccount of three Snakes.\n\n*Coluber oxycephalus.* This snake is usually bright green above and of a paler colour below, the tail being yellowish brown as if it were withered: the Dyaks here on that account call this snake the Ular Matiko. A short time ago the Museum received a large specimen over 4 feet long which had no trace of a green colour: dorsally throughout the animal had a uniform brownish colour like that of the tail of a normal form; ventrally it was pale yellowish. In other respects the specimen conforms precisely to the description of *C. oxycephalus*. In the Museum Catalogue of snakes Mr. R. Shelford my predecessor states that on the sea coast near the mouth of Trusan river he took a brilliant ochreous specimen of this species which was put in formol: after two or three days it turned green but finally the specimen became rotten and had to be thrown away. Possibly his specimen was the same as the variety now described. The colour of my variety however is quite permanent in methylated spirits.\n\n*Dipsadomorphus cynodon* The British Museum catalogue describes 3 distinct colour varieties of this rather large snake. Our Museum has 19 specimens, of which one from Bau received a year ago and one from Kuching just arrived are of the type described below which does not come directly under any one of the 3 varieties described by Mr. Bonlenger but is not far from his variety B.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nDorsally the general colour is yellowish brown speckled with close-set irregular black dots: there are a number of ill-defined black cross bars which are not so wide as the interspaces between them but anteriorly in the first $\\frac{1}{4}$ of its length all these colours are merged together. In the posterior half of the body there is a series of white spots close to the ventrally and anteriorly the colour is yellow with some black spots, posteriorly the two colours merge the black predominating. The tail is black with incomplete white rings. These two species of snakes were taken near the Astana, Kuching by His Highness the Rajah Muda of Sarawak who kindly presented to the Museum all three snakes here mentioned.\n\nJohn Hewitt.\n\nNote on the life-history of the Cicindelid beetle, *Collyris emarginatus*, Dej.\n\nWithin quite recent years a most interesting entomological discovery has been made by Dr. J. C. Koningsberger of the Buitenzorg Zoological Museum, but the facts being hidden in a publication of somewhat limited circulation seem to have escaped the general notice of those interested in the insects of the Far East.\n\nNearly all the Cicindelidae or tiger-beetles are found in exposed situations, such as sandy banks, roads or even the sea-shore and as a general rule the larvae live in burrows in the soil and feed on insects which they capture when these pass over their burrows. *Collyris emarginata* however is arboreal in its habits, running with great speed over leaves and flowers and readily taking to wing; its larvae live in small burrows excavated in coffee shoots and in these burrows await their prey which consists of ants and aphides. Cicindelid larvae are readily recognised by the swollen anterior end and by the presence of two tubercles armed with small hooks on the dorsal surface of the eighth segment; by means of these protuberances the larvae are enabled to wedge themselves up at the top of their burrows awaiting their prey, retiring to the\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nbottom of the burrows once the prey has been seized. The *Collyris* larvae differs in no important particulars from the characteristic type, though its habit of living in burrows in wood is sufficiently remarkable. Dr. Koningsberger informs me that he never observed the egg-laying and that he never found any very young larvae, he is unable then to state whether the eggs are laid under bark or on it, and if the young larvae excavates for itself a small burrow which is enlarged as the larva grows in size. Pupation takes place in the burrow. In the Dentchi Entom. Zeitschrift for 1905. p. 172 this Cicindelid is alluded to as herbivorous, but Dr. Koningsberger tells me that this is a mistake, the beetle living on small insects, just like other Cicindelidae. Dr. Koningsberger publishes an all-too brief account of this larva and a poor figure in \"Mededeelingen uit 'Slands Plantentuin\" XLIV p. 113. fig. 59. (1901). It is much to be hoped that more information will soon be forthcoming about this most interesting form and its allied species. After all it is facts about the life-histories of insects that is wanted now, rather than more dried specimens, and it is a standing reproach to entomologists that so little is known about some quite common tropical insects.\n\nR. Shelford.\n\n**Nesting of Silk-weaving Ants.**\n\nThe remarkable habit of the \"Karinga\" ant (*Oecophylla smaragdina*) in employing its larva as a spinning machine is well known, thanks to the observations of Ridley in Singapore (this journal xxii. 345, (1890-1) and of Holland in Ceylon (Proc. Ent. Soc. London, 1896. p. ix. E.E. Green. On the habits of *Oecophylla smaragdina*). The habit may be mentioned again in order to shew the interest of other observations on another species of ant belonging to a different sub-family. The nest of *Oecophylla smaragdina* is constructed of leaves bound together with a web of silk. If the leaves are torn apart it has been observed that the adult ants immediately repair the breach in the following manner:\u2014several ants hold the separated\nedges of the leaves together with their jaws, each ant thus acting as an animated clamp; then come other ants every one holding in its mandibles a larva, the mouth of which is applied first to one edge of the leaf and then to the other; as a filament of slightly glutinous silk is being constantly emitted by the larva, a fine silken web is soon woven by the to and fro movements imparted to it by its bearer the worker ant and the breach in the nest is quickly repaired; the \"animated clamps\" relax their hold as soon as their need is past. Inasmuch as the worker ant is itself incapable of supplying silk, there seems no doubt but that all the silk of the nest is provided by the larvae. The same habit has been recorded for another species of the same genus, viz. *Oe. longinoda* of the Upper Congo and for *Camponotus senex* of Brazil.\n\nIn Notes from the Leyden Museum vol. xxv., 1905. Father E. Wasman records the observations of Herr Edu. Jacobson at Semarang in Java on the ant *Polyrhachis dives*. The nest is constructed between the leaves of a tree alluded to as the Japanese palm; the leaves are bound together by silk and the interior of the nest is lined with silk in which are entangled chips of bark, wood and fragments of dead leaves; the nest in divided into chambers by partitions of semitransparent silk. Jacobson noted that the nest which he had under observation was broken at one point and that the breach was repaired by the same method as that employed by *Oe. smaragdina*, the larvae held in the jaws of the workers being used to spin a silken web across the rent in the nest. A good many species of *Polyrhachis* employ silk in the manufacture of their nests and it would not be surprising to learn that this habit of the workers of employing the larvae as spinning machines is more general than has been hitherto suspected.\n\nR. Shelford.\n\nMalayan Musical Instruments.\n\nIn \"Fasciculi Malayenses\" Pt. II (a) Anthropology, of which a notice is given in \"Man\" 1904, there is a\ndescription and figure of a bamboo tuning-fork supposed to be made by the Sennangs of the Peninsula. As an identical instrument is described by Dr. A. Schaudenhorst from the Philippine Islands, Mr. W. N. Annandale remarks that \"should it prove to be a real Semang instrument and be peculiar to the Malay Peninsula and the Philippines, it would be a most interesting link between the Semangs and the Negritos of these Islands.\" It may therefore be worth while to record the occurrence of this instrument in Engano, the most southerly Island of the West Sumatran chain.\n\nExamples were obtained by Dr. W. L. Abbott in the early part of this year which only differ from the figure in Fasciculi Malayenses in being without ornamentation and more roughly made. They vary in size, my examples being 25 and 30 cms. in length, and are played by being struck upon the thighs.\n\nThe Enganese have no Negrite strain and appear to be Proto-Malayans: there are at present only about 500 left and although inter-propagation has now practically ceased they are being slightly hybridised by intercourse with visiting traders principally Chinese.\n\nThe \"Fascicugi Malayenses\" also figures and describes Peninsula L'nongs or zithers. I have variants of the types given from Simalur, the most northern of the West Sumatran Islands.\n\nThe first is a closed interwove of bamboo, 66 cms. long with five strings raised from the skin and bridged in the usual manner. It is peculiar in having on the reverse side from the strings a long vibrating tongue formed by cutting a broad transverse notch opposite one set of bridges and running a split from either end to the further extremity of the instrument.\n\nThe second g'noung consists of a closed internode 37 cms. long with only a single string, but having tied to the centre of this an elliptical flat wooden tongue exactly above a rectangular hole cut in the bamboo cylinder. Both instruments are played by means of wooden plectrons.\n\nJour. Straits Branc\nThough made by the natives of Simalur it is possible that they are of Chinese origin, of which nation there are a number of settlers on the Island, while the Simalurese have only passed out of a wooden and shell stage within the last two or three generations.\n\nC. Boden Kloss, F.S.A., F.A.I.\n\nChinese Names of Streets.\n\nThe following notes, by an old resident, on Mr. Firmstone's valuable list in Journal No. 42 may prove of some interest.\n\nArmenian Street.\u2014Tan Seng Po was, I believe, a brother-in-law of Mr. Seah Liang Leah. His house was the one in Hill-street occupied till recently by St. Mary's College.\n\nBeach Road (VII.)\u2014\u201cTwenty buildings,\u201d possibly this refers to the large houses in compounds which formerly fronted the whole of this road between Bras Basah Road and Clyde Terrace, and were in old times occupied by leading European residents.\n\nSelegie Road.\u2014\u201cTek-kha, foot of the bamboos.\u201d I remember when the road from near what is now the entrance to Sophia Road to Mackenzie Road was bordered by luxuriant lofty bamboos\u2014the most beautiful, I think, that I have seen. I mourned when they were removed to make room for houses.\n\nStamford Road.\u2014The shop ceased to be a \u201cshoe shop\u201d a couple of years ago.\n\nTanglin.\u2014\u201cNo \u2018little Tanglin.\u2019\u201d\u2014The part of Orchard-road between Tank-road and Grange-road, where there have been shop-houses for very many years, was formerly known as \u201cTanglin Kechil,\u201d and may be so still.\n\nKeppel Harbour.\u2014\u201cJardine\u2019s Wharf.\u201d\u2014Jardine\u2019s and the Borneo Company\u2019s Wharves were separate but adjoining the former the nearer to town.\n\nR.A. Soc., No. 45, 1905.\nMalacca.\u2014Riverside.\u2014\u201cFoot of the Dutch trees.\u201d\u2014The Fort Road, the ascent to the Stadt House, and the road to Tanjong Kling were adorned with magnificent avenues of *angsana* (sometimes called \u201csena\u201d) trees\u2014the same as we have on the Singapore Esplanade. These avenues all decayed in the course of two years\u2014some five-and-twenty years ago, I should say.\n\nA.
