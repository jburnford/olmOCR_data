JOHN'S HOUSE, CLERKENWELL, E.C.\n\n1901\nPREFACE\n\nThe Prabandhacint\u0101ma\u1e47i belongs to a class of compositions, the existence of which does, to a certain extent, blunt the edge of the reproach frequently directed against Sanskrit literature, that, with the single exception of the R\u0101jatarangini, there is to be found in it no work meriting the title of history. To remove this reproach was the lifelong aspiration of the late Hofrath Professor B\u00fchler. Professor Jolly, in the interesting obituary of B\u00fchler, which he wrote for the Grundriss der Indo-Arischen Philologie, quotes from a letter of B\u00fchler's addressed to N\u00f6ldeke in 1877, \"You are a little behind the age with your notion that the Indians have no historical literature. In the last 20 years, five fairly voluminous works have been discovered, emanating from authors contemporary with the events which they describe. Four of them I have discovered myself, viz., Vikram\u0101\u00f1kadevacarita, Gaudavaho, Prthvir\u0101jadigvijaya and Kirtikaumudi. I am on the track of more than a dozen more.\" It is owing to Professor B\u00fchler's exertions that so many of these chronicles, historical poems, and historical romances have been edited. It was at his suggestion that I undertook the present translation, and it will be evident to any one, who takes the trouble to read my notes, that, without his assistance and encouragement, it would never have been able to \"pass the ferry backward into light.\" It was his intention to write full historical and geographical notes to it, which would have greatly enhanced its value. But this, unfortunately, must now be numbered among the many projects whelmed by \"that fatal and perfidious bark, which sank so low that sacred head.\"\n\nIn connection with Indian historical literature, and especially that bearing on the history of Gujar\u0101t, another name must occur to every British student, that of Alexander Kinloch Forbes, author of the R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101. His life has been written by Mr. A. J. Nairne, B.C.S., and it will be found prefixed to Colonel Watson's edition of the R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, published in 1878. Mr. Forbes belonged to a class of Indian civilians deeply interested in the\n\n---\n\n1 It appears from the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, for March, 1900, p. 70 and ff., that Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dhy\u0101ya Hara Prasad \u010c\u0101stri, M.A., has found a MS. named R\u0101mapalacarita, by Sandhy\u0101kara Nandi, giving an account of R\u0101map\u0101la, king of Ga\u1e47\u1e0da, who succeeded his father, Vigr\u0101hap\u0101la, in 1080.\nhistory, literature and antiquities of the people among whom their lot was cast. His careful and conscientious study of these subjects is apparent in every page of the R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101. The Prabandhacint\u0101mani is one of the many sources from which that work was compiled. So complete was the use that he made of this chronicle, that in the course of writing my own translation, it often occurred to me that I was engaged in an unnecessary labour. My justification must be that, as I was informed by Professor B\u00fchler, Mr. Forbes himself often expressed the wish that the Prabandhacin- t\u0101mani might be translated. Besides, I flatter myself that not only students of Indian history, but folklorists and anthropologists may take interest in the quaint traditions recorded by this medieval Jain monk, which lose half their charm when paraphrased or summarized. He himself tells us that his principal object is to amuse, and confesses that the stories he has been able to gather about persons and events are frequently inconsistent. Moreover, as Dr. Johnson, when composing the Parliamentary Debates in a garret in Exeter Street, took care \"that the Whig dogs should not have the best of it,\" so this zealous Jain has an evident leaning in all doubtful cases towards the votaries of the orthodox faith of Mah\u0101v\u012bra, and takes care that they shall not suffer in comparison with the worshippers of \u0100iva. Professor B\u00fchler puts the matter very clearly in the following words, \"The objects with which the Caritas and Prabandhas were composed, were to edify the Jain community, to convince them of the glory and power of the Jain religion, or, in cases where the subject is a purely secular one, to provide them with an agreeable entertainment.\" It is therefore useless to expect from these writers a Thucydidean narrative, or the mature wisdom of Tacitus. B\u00fchler, in fact, places the Jain chroniclers, in point of credibility, below the medieval European and Arab chroniclers. He warns us that they are to be used with the greatest caution. But, at the same time, he reminds us that their testimony is often confirmed by inscriptions and other evidence of a trustworthy kind.\n\n\"In particular, must it be admitted that the persons introduced in the older, as well as in the more recent narratives, are really historical characters. Although it is frequently the case that an individual is introduced at a period earlier or later than that to which he really belonged, or that the most absurd stories are told with regard to him, yet there is no case forthcoming in which we could affirm with certainty that a man named by these chroniclers is a pure figment of the imagination. On the contrary, nearly every freshly discovered inscription, every collection of old manuscripts, and every really historical work that is brought to light, furnishes confirmation of the actual existence of one or other of the characters de-\n\n1 Boswell's Life of Johnson, Vol. I. p. 108. (Macmillan and Co., 1900.)\nscribed by them. In the same way all exact dates given by them deserve the most careful attention. When they are found to agree in two works of this class, that are independent of one another, they may, without hesitation, be accepted as historically correct.\u00b9\n\nIn estimating the comparative value of the various narratives contained in the following work, it is perhaps scarcely necessary to draw attention to the fact, that those dealing with individuals, preceding the time of the author by a century or two, deserve more credence than those embodying traditions about more remote epochs. Merutunga, of Vardham\u0101napura or V\u0101ghv\u0101n, completed his Prabandhasa\u1e45gama\u1e47i, according to the date given in D\u012bn\u0101n\u0101tha's edition, in the year 1361 of the era of Vikram\u0101ditya. Kum\u0101rap\u0101la died in 1229 of the same era. It is, therefore, hardly too much to suppose that Merutunga's account of Kum\u0101rap\u0101la and his successors is based upon respectable oral tradition.\n\nBy this I do not mean to imply that our author had no documents before him. His statements at the commencement of his work seem to imply that he had. I think, however, that he has quoted even the Kirtikaumudi of Somegyara from memory. He certainly not only misquotes, but misunderstands that poet.\n\nThe section dealing with the life of Vikram\u0101ditya, though it has no claim to be called historical, possesses an interest of its own. It may be compared with the Jain recension of the Sinh\u0101sanadv\u0101trin\u00e7ik\u0101 so exhaustively discussed by Professor Weber in the XVth volume of the Indische Studien, and the account given of the same monarch in the Prabandhabakosha. In accordance with their custom of annexing all the heroes of Indian tradition, the Jains maintain that Vikram\u0101ditya was converted to the Jain faith by Siddhasena.\u00b2 The story of \u010c\u0101l\u012bv\u0101hana is treated on much the same principle as that of Siddhasena. I would fain hope that these sections may be of some interest to the folklorist and the student of religion, but I cannot flatter myself that they possess any solid historical value.\u00b3\n\nWe seem to approach the domain of historical tradition with the founding of the city of Anahillapura, or Anhilw\u0101d, in the 802nd year of the era of Vikram\u0101ditya, which corresponds to 746 A.D. Miss Duff (Mrs. Rickmers) in her Chronology of India, seems to accept this date given by Merutunga, and also the tradition of the Ratnam\u0101l\u0101 that Vanar\u0101ja was the son of Jayacakha of Pa\u00f1c\u0101cara. The most that can be said for\n\n\u00b9 B\u00fchler, \u00dcber das Leben des Jaina M\u00f6nches Hemacandra, p. 6.\n\u00b2 See, in my translation of the Kath\u0101 Ko\u00e7a, p. 191, the note furnished by the great Jain teacher \u0100tm\u0101r\u0101m Muni. In the XVIIIth Book of the Kath\u0101 Sarit S\u0101gara, the adventures of Vikram\u0101ditya are related from the Hindu point of view.\n\u00b3 But Forbes, who misses nothing or very little, when describing on pages 190, 191, of the R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, the swinging bed on which the king of Guj\u0101rat slept, was indebted to the Vikram\u0101ditya section of the Prabandhasa\u1e45gama\u1e47i, p. 4.\nMerutunga's support of this genealogy is, that his narrative is not inconsistent with it. If we adopt this tradition of the Ratnam\u0101l\u0101, given by Forbes in the R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, we may, perhaps, conclude that the name of his maternal uncle, who lived the life of a bandit, was \u010c\u016brap\u0101la (Soorpal).\n\nThe story of the founding of Anahillapura or Anhilw\u0101\u1e0d, belongs to a class of legends, which might appropriately be termed \"the city foundation cycle.\" The animal, with which the foundation of this city is connected by our author, is a hare. One is irresistibly reminded of the legend of Aeneas. I quote from Arnold's history of Rome, Vol. I. p. 2, \"The Trojans, when they had brought their gods on shore, began to sacrifice. But the victim, a milk-white sow, just ready to farrow, broke from the priests and their ministers, and fled away. Aeneas followed her, for an oracle had told him that a four-footed beast should guide him to the spot where he was to build his city.\" It is unnecessary to pursue the story further, but we should, perhaps, be justified in comparing the J\u0101li-tree with the Ficus Ruminalis. In the same way Cadmus was commanded by the oracle at Delphi to follow a cow of a certain kind, and to build a city on the spot where the cow should sink down from fatigue. Athens also had its horse and its olive, not to mention the owl. Perhaps the wolf, \"the thunder-stricken nurse of Rome,\" belongs to the same cycle. So the first beginnings of the new city, \"founded with Jain mantras,\" as the pious chronicler tells us, may, after all, be more closely connected with the worship of trees and animals than with the formulas of Mah\u0101v\u012bra.\n\nAs indicated in my note on page 22 of the following translation, the story of the three pilgrims, who paid a visit to king Bh\u016bya\u1e0dadeva, does not find favour with modern critics. B\u00fchler gives his opinion in the following words, \"I think Merutunga's whole narrative must be rejected, as an invention of the bards, who wished to join together, in a convenient manner, the histories of their C\u0101potk\u0101\u1e6da and Caulukya rulers.\" Miss Duff's chronological note runs as follows, \"A.D. 941, V. Samvat 998. M\u016blar\u0101ja I. son of R\u0101ji of Kaly\u0101na (probably Kanauj) conquers Gujar\u0101t and founds there the Caulukya or Solagki dynasty of Anhilw\u0101\u1e0d: reigns till A.D. 996.\" Possibly, the inventors of this romantic tale may have wished to explain\n\n1 It would, perhaps, be going too far to compare Vanar\u0101ja (the forest king) with Silvius.\n2 Andrew Lang (Custom and Myth, p. 114) quotes from Strabo a story to this effect\u2014\"That emigrants had set out in prehistoric times from Crete. The oracle advised them to settle 'wherever they were attacked by the children of the soil.' At Hamaxitus in the Troad they were assailed in the night by mice, which ate all that was edible of their armour and bowstrings. The colonists made up their minds that these mice were 'the children of the soil,' settled there, and adored the mouse Apollo.\"\n3 B\u00fchler, however, seems disposed to concede that M\u016blar\u0101ja's mother may have been a C\u0101potk\u0101\u1e6da. For the bards of Gujar\u0101t, see R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101 (Watson's edition) pp. 558-61.\nthe proverbial phrase \"a C\u0101potkats'a gift.\" We may leave the question as it now stands, with the hope that some inscription may soon be discovered, which will clear the matter up.\n\nM\u016blar\u0101ja's victories over B\u0101rapa and Lak\u1e63a, the king of Kaoh, are mentioned by Arisimha. The retirement of M\u016blar\u0101ja before B\u0101rapa and V\u012bgrahar\u0101ja to Kanthkot derives some support from a grant published by B\u00fchler in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. VI., p. 180 and ff.\u00b9 The testimony of the poet Some\u015bvara (KK. ii. 3 and 4) is to the same effect, as far as regards the ultimate triumph of M\u016blar\u0101ja, but the preliminary retirement is not mentioned.\n\nThe section of the Prabandhacint\u0101mani dealing with the history of Mu\u00f1ja contains at least one historical fact, that Mu\u00f1ja, or V\u0101kpatir\u0101ja II.,\u00b2 carried on war for a long time with Tailapa II., the C\u0101lukya king of K\u0101ly\u0101na, and was at last conquered by him and put to death. B\u00fchler has shown that of this execution there can be little doubt, as two C\u0101lukya inscriptions boast of it. Moreover, Rudr\u0101ditya was really his minister, as he is mentioned in the grant of 979 A.D. \"The fact that V\u0101kpatir\u0101ja or Mu\u00f1ja was put to death by Tailapa II. makes it possible, with the aid of a notice in a Jain work, to fix, within narrow limits, the time when his campaign took place and his reign came to an end. Amitagati finished his Subh\u0101\u1e63itaratnasandoha in V.S. 1050 or 983-94 A.D., in the reign of king Mu\u00f1ja,\u00b3 and Tailapa II. died shortly before, or actually in, the \u010caka year 919, i.e. 997\u2014998 A.D., which is the first year of his successor. The death of Mu\u00f1ja, therefore, must have taken place in one of the three years 994-996. The beginning of his reign must be fixed before V.S. 1031 or 974 A.D., the date of his first grant of land, but, as we have before remarked, cannot be far removed from that date.\"\u2074\n\nThe portion of this section that describes Tailapa's treatment of Mu\u00f1ja, when in captivity, possesses a poetical, rather than a historical, truth. But there is a strange pathos in the romantic story told by Merutunga. Even, if we do not accept the details, we may be satisfied that Merutunga's account contains nothing which his readers would consider improbable, and that, therefore, the picture, which he gives of the life and manners of the Indian princes of the time, represents substantial truth. Moreover, king Mu\u00f1ja's boast before his execution, that by his death Sarasvat\u012b would be left without a support, rests on a solid basis of fact. Not only did he patronize Padmagupta, who wrote the Navas\u0101has\u0101\u1e45kacarita in praise of\n\n\u00b9 See particularly p. 184. For Arisimha's testimony, see B\u00fchler, Das Sukritasam-kirtana des Arisimha, p. 11.\n\u00b2 For his other names see note on p. 30 of my translation.\n\u00b3 See also Miss Duff's Chronology of India, p. 102.\n\u2074 B\u00fchler und Zachari\u00e6, Navas\u0101has\u0101\u1e45kacarita, p. 44.\nhis successor, and Dhanap\u0101la, who flourished under him and not under Bhoja, as Merutunga erroneously states, but Dhana\u00f1jaya and his brother Dhanika, of whom the first wrote the Da\u015bar\u016bpa, while the second commented on it. Hal\u0101yudha also, the commentator on Pingala's work, lived according to his own statement (Subhag\u012bt\u0101vali, p. 116) under the sway of this prince. That he was himself a poet rests not only on the fact that Merutunga and the other authors of Prabandhas, and also the compilers of anthologies ascribe to him verses, but a stanza is given as his by K\u1e63emendra, who wrote about fifty years after his death.\u00b9\n\nAbout few kings of India have more myths accumulated than about Bhoja or Bhojadeva, the famous Param\u0101ra sovereign of Dh\u0101r\u0101. We must, therefore, not be surprised to find that, in giving an account of his treatment in early youth by his uncle, Merutunga at once falls into the mythopoeic vein. The oft-repeated story of the wicked uncle Mu\u00f1ja must, to begin with, be relegated to the domain of folk-lore, and with it must go all Merutunga's statements with regard to Sindhur\u0101ja or Sindhula, which remind one of a tale in the Kath\u0101 Sarit S\u0101gara. As a matter of fact, he succeeded his brother Mu\u00f1ja, and though he may, occasionally, have been on bad terms with him, it is obvious that he was not confined in a wooden cage, or deprived of his eyes.\u00b2 The reign of this prince may be described in the words of Miss Duff,\u2014\u201cSindhur\u0101ja, Navas\u0101has\u0101\u1e45ka, or Kum\u0101ran\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Param\u0101ra of M\u0101lava, conquered a king of the H\u016bnas, a prince of the Ko\u1e0dalas, the inhabitants of V\u0101ga\u1e47a and L\u0101\u1e6da, and the Muralas; wedded the N\u0101ga princess \u010ca\u00e7iprabh\u0101, probably of the race of the N\u0101ga K\u1e63atriyas; had for his chief minister Ya\u00e7obha\u1e6da-Ram\u0101\u1e45gada.\u201d\u00b3 It would appear that he was by no means successful in his war against the Caulukya king of Gujar\u0101t, C\u0101mu\u1e47\u1e0dar\u0101ja, if Merutunga is correct in his statement that this king died of small-pox while investing the fortifications of Dh\u0101r\u0101.\n\nThe section of our author's work, dealing with Bhoja and Bhima, may be looked at from two points of view. It is in the first place a storehouse of mythical legends with regard to Bhoja, the reputed author of the Sarasvat\u012b-kant\u0101bh\u0101rana and other works, who is supposed to have been surrounded by a galaxy of poets; and in the second place it is a political history of the two kingdoms of M\u0101lava and Gujar\u0101t, under two rival sovereigns. The history of king Bhoja's relations with his literary coterie sets chronology at defiance. Of the poets with whom he is associated by Merutunga, R\u0101ja\u00e7ekhara flourished under Mahendrap\u0101la of Kanauj (A.D. 903-7) and his son Mahip\u0101la (A.D. 917); Dhanap\u0101la, as before remarked, flourished\n\n\u00b9 See B\u00fchler und Zachari\u00e6, Navas\u0101has\u0101\u1e45kacarita p. 42; Miss Duff, Chronology of India, p. 100.\n\u00b2 See B\u00fchler und Zachari\u00e6, Navas\u0101has\u0101\u1e45kacarita, p. 45 and ff.\n\u00b3 Chronology of India, p. 102.\nunder Mu\u00f1ja; while B\u0101\u1e47a and May\u016bra and M\u0101natunga are generally held to have been contemporaries of the great Har\u1e63avardhana of Th\u0101nesar, and Kanauj. M\u0101gha, whatever his date may have been, probably lived before the time of king Bhoja.\n\nNo one, who considers the history of king Bh\u012bma as detailed in this section, can help being struck by one remarkable omission. Nothing is said about the capture of Soman\u0101tha Pattana by Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni, though this event appears to have taken place in 1026 A.D., according to Miss Duff's Chronology of India, four years after Bh\u012bma's accession. Perhaps Merutunga omits to mention this disaster from patriotic motives, though Bh\u012bma is said to have displayed great courage on the occasion. He does not scruple to mention the sacking of Anhilw\u0101\u1e0d by Kulacandra, though he accounts for it by the absence of Bh\u012bma in Sindh, and treats it as a mere raid. Forbes seems to accept as historical Bh\u012bma's visit to Bhoja's court in disguise, which is admirably related by Merutunga. At length the standing enmity between the Caulukyas of Gujar\u0101t and the Param\u0101ras of M\u0101lava, which is ascribed by Merutunga to Mu\u00f1ja's ill-treatment of Durlabha, took a tragic turn for king Bhoja. Bh\u012bma allied himself with Kar\u1e47a of D\u0101hala, which is probably equivalent to Cedi or Bandelkhand, and with his help overpowered Bhoja. This statement of Merutunga's is supported by the K\u012brtikaumudi, the Suk\u1e5btsa\u1e45kirtana, and by Kum\u0101rap\u0101la's V\u0101\u00f1agar pra\u1e47ast\u012b. There seems to be some doubt as to how Bhoja met with his end. Som\u0113vara seems to imply that Bh\u012bma spared his life. Miss Duff tells us that the exact date of his death is unknown. The date given by Merutunga for the accession of Kar\u1e47a, the son of Bh\u012bma, is accepted by Miss Duff. The statement of this author, that this king was married to Mayanalladevi, daughter of Jayake\u015bin, is, according to the same authority, confirmed by Hemacandra and Abhayatilaka. This Jayake\u015bin is supposed to be Jayake\u015bin I. of the K\u0113damba family of Goa. Merutunga's account of Kar\u1e47a is meagre, though he mentions his public works, but he takes great interest in his son and successor Jayasimha or Siddhar\u0101ja, probably because in his reign the great Jain teacher Hemacandra first comes into prominence. It would appear that Siddhar\u0101ja was not only a great conqueror, who captured Ya\u00e7ovarman, king of M\u0101lava, and reduced Varvaraka, apparently the leader of a non-Aryan tribe, to the position of an obedient vassal, but also took great interest in literature and religion. His court-poet, we learn from the Prabandhacint\u0101ma\u1e47i, was \u010c\u0101p\u0101la, but he appears to have favoured other literary men. Though he was a professed votary of \u010civa, the god of his family, he seems to have been somewhat latitudi-\n\n1 B\u00fchler's introduction to his edition of the Vikram\u0101yakad\u0113vacarita, p. 18.\n2 Chronology of India, p. 113.\n3 See the couplet quoted in the note to p. 71 of my translation.\nnarian in his religious views, and, like Akbar, to have taken pleasure in controversies between the adherents of rival creeds. Hemacandra, no doubt, gained his favour, at first, by his literary eminence, and subsequently made good use of his gifts as a courtier to advocate the claims of his own faith. On the whole, there can be little doubt that Merutunga's picture of Siddharaja's court is true to life. It is possible to feel doubt about particular incidents, which are omitted or related in a slightly different form by other authorities, but not to doubt the main effect of our author's narrative. Moreover, it is impossible to doubt that Hemacandra composed his well-known grammar at the request of Siddharaja, and it is, at least, probable that he took part in the famous discussion between Devasiri and Hemacandra, though this discussion may have taken place at an earlier date than that assigned to it by Merutunga.\n\nThe section dealing with the life of king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, the Param\u0101rha\u1e6da, must have been a labour of love to the Jain chronicler. This being the case, it is painful to have to point out that B\u00fchler convicts him of a gross anachronism at the outset. It is difficult to believe that Hemacandra was introduced to Kum\u0101rap\u0101la by Udayana. According to Merutunga's own statement, Udayana migrated into Gujar\u0101t shortly after the commencement of the reign of Siddharaja, that is to say, about 1150 V.S. But Kum\u0101rap\u0101la succeeded his great uncle in 1198 V.S. It is obvious that Udayana cannot have been long employed under the latter monarch, even if he was alive in his reign. Merutunga is also guilty of an inaccuracy in asserting that Hemacandra recommended Kum\u0101rap\u0101la to restore the temple of Soman\u0101tha at Devapattana. For an inscription in the temple of Bhadrak\u0101l\u012b, at Devapattana, dated Valabhi-Samvat 1850, or V.S. 1225, expressly states that the Ganda Brhaspati, who had already been in great favour with Jayasimha, induced Kum\u0101rap\u0101la to rebuild the ruined temple. This is intrinsically more probable than Merutunga's tale. As it appears that Merutunga's story about the introduction of Hemacandra to Kum\u0101rap\u0101la is not to be trusted, suspicion is also cast upon our author's account of their earlier relations.\n\nIt is evident that Kum\u0101rap\u0101la was engaged in war with Arjor\u0101ja shortly after he ascended the throne. This alone would make it probable that Kum\u0101rap\u0101la's acquaintance with Hemacandra and his conversion to\n\n---\n\n1 The stories told by Merutunga, Jinamandana, the author of the Kum\u0101rap\u0101lacarita, and the authors of the Prabh\u0101vakacaritra are compared and critically examined by B\u00fchler in his essay, \"\u00dcber das Leben des Jaina M\u00f6nches Hemacandra.\"\n\n2 B\u00fchler's Hemacandra, p. 29.\n\n3 Miss Duff tells us that Kum\u0101rap\u0101la conquered M\u0101lava and defeated Arjor\u0101ja in or shortly before V.S. 1207 (A.D. 1161). I may here mention that the same authority accepts as historical the defeat of Mallik\u0101rjuna by his general Ambada.\nthe Jaina faith took place at a later date than is represented by Merutunga.\n\nThe exact date of Kum\u0101rap\u0101la's conversion to Jainism is inferred by B\u00fchler from a passage in Yagahp\u0101la's drama, the Mohapar\u0101jaya. In this play the king's conversion is allegorically represented as his marriage with K\u1e5bp\u0101sundari (beautiful compassion), the daughter of Dharmar\u0101ja and Viratidevi, and Hemacandra is mentioned as the priest that blessed the union. The date of the marriage is given as V.S. 1216. As the Mohapar\u0101jaya was written shortly after the death of Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, this date may be accepted as correct. B\u00fchler would place the introduction of Hemacandra to Kum\u0101rap\u0101la about two years earlier.\n\nWhatever may be thought of Merutunga's dates, or B\u00fchler's rectification of them, there can be no doubt that Kum\u0101rap\u0101la was practically converted to Jainism, and set himself to make Gujar\u0101t a model Jain state. Under the guidance of Hemacandra, he not only denied himself the enjoyments and amusements forbidden by the Jain law, but he compelled his subjects to practise similar self-denial. He promulgated an edict which enjoined abstinence from the taking of animal life in the widest sense of the term, and which was most strictly enforced in every part of his dominions. The Brahmans, who immolated animals at their sacrifices, were ordered to give up the practice and to substitute corn. Even in Pallide\u00e7a, in Rajputana, people were compelled to obey this edict, and the ascetics of that country, who clothed themselves with the skins of antelopes, found great difficulty in procuring them. The consequence was that, as we are told in the Mah\u0101viracarita, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0durangas (i.e. the votaries of \u0106\u012bva) had to live like born \u0106\u012bvakas. The prohibition of the chase, of which the above-mentioned work speaks, was the obvious result of this edict, and even the inhabitants of Pallide\u00e7a, that is, of middle K\u0101thiaw\u0101d, who had been terrible sinners in this respect, were obliged to submit to it. A further consequence of it was the measure against butchers, of which we read in the Dvy\u0101craya K\u0101vy\u0101. They had to give up their trade, and received compensation to the amount of three years' income.\n\nThe absurd extent to which Kum\u0101rap\u0101la carried his tenderness for animal life, is shown by the ridiculous story of the Y\u016bk\u0101vih\u0101ra, told by Merutunga. Such are the melancholy results that follow, when philosophers and literary men, like Hemacandra, are in a position to control the government of a nation. A less objectionable result was the prohibition of spirituous drinks, dice-playing, animal combats and betting, which, according to B\u00fchler, is vouched for by two of the Jain authorities. But the people\n\n---\n\n1 The same date is given in a story which forms an appendix to MSS. P and a. In this story the lady is called Ahim\u015b\u0101, the daughter of \u0106rimadarhaddharma by Anukamp\u0101devi.\n2 B\u00fchler's Hemacandra, page 39.\n3 See page 143 of my translation.\nof Gujar\u0101t were no more ripe for this advanced legislation in the twelfth century than the people of Great Britain were in the nineteenth. Another instance of the conscientiousness of Kum\u0101rap\u0101la is related by Merutunga. He determined to forego the income derived from confiscating the property of those of his subjects, who died leaving widows, but no son. B\u00fchler points out that this practice, though contrary to the Sm\u1e5btis, prevailed in many parts of India, notably in the west. Accordingly, it is alluded to by K\u0101lid\u0101sa, who was a native of M\u0101lava, which borders on Gujar\u0101t, in his Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntala.\n\nThough Kum\u0101rap\u0101la was, no doubt, a conscientious follower of the Jain discipline, he managed to combine with it a lurking regard for \u015aiva, the family god of the Caulukyas of Gujar\u0101t. This halting between two or more opinions in religion has been characteristic of many Indian sovereigns. B\u00fchler in his essay on the life of Hemacandra, and Cowell and Thomas, in their translation of the \u0106r\u012bh\u0101r\u1e63acarita, ascribe this liberality of view to the famous Har\u1e63avardhana of Th\u0101ne\u015bar and Kanauj. \"He was the Akbar of the Hindu period of Indian history; and under his wise toleration the adherents of the contending religions, Brahmanism and Buddhism, seemed to forget their divisions in a common feeling of loyalty, just as Rajputs and Mu\u1e25ammadans served Akbar with equal devotion.\" B\u00fchler thinks that Kum\u0101rap\u0101la was compelled to show some consideration for the orthodox party because some of his courtiers and ministers belonged to it. It would seem from Merutunga's narrative that even Hemacandra was not ashamed to bow himself in the house of Soman\u0101tha in the company of his sovereign. He probably excused himself on the ground that his object was to win over, by a pious fraud, Kum\u0101rap\u0101la to the Jain faith. The friendship between the sage and the monarch, which was brought about by the similarity of their religious views, seems to have been sincere, resembling that between Fronto and Marcus Aurelius.\n\nMerutunga's description of the closing scene of Kum\u0101rap\u0101la's life is full of genuine pathos. But, unfortunately, the parallel between the Roman Stoic and the Indian Param\u0101rhat\u0101 holds good in another particular. As Aurelius looked forward to the day when his courtiers would congratulate\n\n---\n\n1 See page 133 of my translation.\n2 Har\u1e63acarita of B\u0101\u1e47a, translated by Cowell and Thomas, Preface, pages viii. and ix.\n3 I think, however, that Kapardin was clearly a Jain, in spite of B\u00fchler's doubts. See page 152 of my translation. On another point I should presume to differ from the guru. I should compare the story of the priests of Kantheqvar\u012b (H.C. pp. 45, 46) to that of the priests of Bel in the Apocrypha. The parallel is very close.\n4 Page 181 of my translation.\n5 B\u00fchler (H.C. p. 29) is justly severe upon \"die Uebert\u00f6lpelung des K\u00f6nigs durch einen Hokus-Pokus,\" which he declares to be quite after the manner of Jain missionaries.\n6 Page 151 of my translation.\nthemselves on \"being rid of this pedagogue,\" so Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, if he had been able to foresee the future, might have beheld his most faithful followers tortured and slain, and his temples broken down by his nephew Ajayap\u0101la, who is pictured by the Jain writers as an Indian Commodus. But some excuse may be found for Ajayap\u0101la's severity in the tradition that the Jain party in the state had wished to exclude him from the throne, in favour of Prat\u0101pamalla, the son of Kum\u0101rap\u0101la's daughter, who was sound in the Jain faith. It is clear that, on Ajayap\u0101la's accession, a reaction in favour of the religion of \u0106\u012bva set in. Merutunga tells us that Ajayap\u0101la was stabbed by a door-keeper, and, like another religious persecutor, was eaten of worms.\n\nMerutunga drops no hint which might guide us as to his opinion on the character of Bhimadeva II. He mentions an abortive invasion of Gujar\u0101t by Sohada of M\u0101lava, and a subsequent successful invasion by his son Arjunadeva. Bhima does not seem to have been a very capable monarch, and it used to be supposed that Lavanapras\u0101da and his son Viradha\u015bala rebelled against him, and established an independent sovereignty at Dholka about A.D. 1219. This view was put forward by B\u00fchler in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. VI., page 187 and ff., and is adopted by Miss Duff in her \"Chronology of India.\" But Merutunga lends no support to this view. He speaks of Lavanapras\u0101da as the vicegerent of Bh\u012bma. B\u00fchler in his Suk\u1e5btas\u0101\u1e45kirtana of Arisinha, p. 21 and ff., retracts his former view. He is of opinion that recent discoveries make it doubtful whether Lavanapras\u0101da ever rebelled against Bh\u012bma. Not only the statements of Arisinha, but the terms of a grant dated V.S. 1288, in a book called Lekhspanc\u0101gik\u0101, discovered by Dr. R. G. Bhand\u0101rkar, show that Lavanapras\u0101da recognized Bh\u012bma II., outwardly at any rate, as his overlord. Professor K\u0101thav\u0101\u1e6de is very near the mark when he compares the attitude of Lavanapras\u0101da towards Bh\u012bma, with that of the Peshv\u0101s towards the court of Sat\u0101ra. The fact that Merutunga takes such interest in Lavanapras\u0101da is, no doubt, in great measure to be ascribed to the discretion which he showed in choosing the famous Jain brothers Vastup\u0101la and Tejahp\u0101la for his ministers. Though pious Jains, they were, like \u0100mrabhata, the follower of Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, men of action. Moreover, they seem to have shown a becoming regard for learned men. It was, apparently, on account of his patronage of poets and pandits that Vastup\u0101la was called the younger Bhoja.\n\nThe story of Vastup\u0101la's pilgrimage is also told by Arisinha and Some-\n\n---\n\n1 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2.

Maccabees, IX. 9.\n4 Introduction to K\u0101thav\u0101\u1e6de's edition of the Kirtikaumud\u012b, p. xxv.\nThey fill in details which Merutunga has overlooked. Vastup\u0101la, as leader of the pilgrimage, seems to have provided the poorer pilgrims not only with protection, but also with conveyances and food. Here K\u0101thav\u0101\u1e6de's remarks are very much to the point,\u2014\"When there were no made roads, when pilgrims had to pass through the territories of neighbouring princes, bearing all varieties of relations one to another, and when bands of marauders were more numerous than peaceful travellers, whenever a great man undertook a pilgrimage, all the intending pilgrims in the neighbourhood and poor people unable to bear the expense of the journey flocked together under the wings of this great man, who then considered himself responsible for protecting them against the dangers of the way, and for supplying their wants.\"\u00b9 Arisinha, in his account of Vastup\u0101la's pilgrimage, tells us that this pious leader of the Jain religious caravan went so far as to provide medicines and physicians for any pilgrims that might happen to fall sick. His benevolence seems to have known no bounds. We read that a halt was made at K\u0101sabhrada, and a feast held in the temple of R\u0101shba. When the foot of \u010catrunjaya was reached, Vastup\u0101la made a great encampment, and distributed presents, principally of food, to all the needy among his followers. B\u00fchler gives the following summary of Arisinha's description of Vastup\u0101la's visit to this holy mountain:\u2014\"The ascent of the mountain took place the morning after his arrival. The first sanctuary that the pilgrims visited was that of the Yak\u1e63a Kapardin. Vastup\u0101la worshipped the Yak\u1e63a and sang a hymn in his praise. Then he hastened to the temple of \u0100din\u0101tha (R\u0101shba), whither the majority of the pilgrims followed him in dense crowds. Vastup\u0101la, still covered with the dust of the journey, fell down before the lord of the Jinas, and adored him with a hymn of praise. Then, and not till then, did he indulge in ablutions, whereupon the pilgrims followed his example, and he and they approached the C\u0101itya with dancing and song. Then he washed the image, in accordance with due prescription, with saffron-water, and anointed it with musk, and hung garlands round it. The pilgrims, at the same time, burned so much incense, that the temple was completely darkened by the fumes, and finally the \u0100r\u0101trika was performed by the waving of lights in front of the image.\"\u00b2\n\nIn a note to page 136, I quoted, to illustrate the description of the setting up of the finial on the temple of Suvrata by \u0100mrabhata, an extract from a communication made to the Times of India of April 13th, 1889, by Mr. A. Cousens. I now proceed to lay this interesting narrative once\n\n\u00b9 Note on Some\u00e7vara's Kirtikaumud\u012b, IX. 2.\n\u00b2 B\u00fchler's Arisinha, p. 26. With regard to the washing of the image cp. Forbes's R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101 (Watson's edition), pp. 596-8. The washing of the image is common to Jains and Hindoos.\nmore under contribution in connection with Arisinha's and Merutunga's descriptions of Vastup\u0101la's pilgrimage. After describing his ascent of the hill in company with gaily-dressed crowds of pilgrims, and his entry into the sacred precincts, Mr. Cousens proceeds to give an account of the scene in front of that very lord of the Jinas whom Vastup\u0101la adored. \"Within the temple are men, women and children, with a sprinkling of Yatis, sitting, kneeling, or standing, all more or less engaged in reciting or chanting their sacred hymns, while on the brass stands before them they lay their offerings, and mark out with grains of rice the sacred symbols. In the shrine, whose brazen doors stand open, on the high throne sits, in solid marble effigy, the great Rsabha or \u0100din\u0101tha. With legs crossed, and hands lying in listless repose in his lap, he sits there with a placid, contemplative expression, adorned with great garlands of pink roses. Small hanging lamps lend an additional subdued and mysterious light, while backwards and forwards move the picturesque forms of the pujaris. On special occasions the image is laden with its jewels, and these are both magnificent and costly. A massive crown adorns his brow, an ample breast-plate with heavy armlets and wristlets further embellishes his person, and all these are richly wrought in gold, thickly set with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and pearls; and the rich necklaces of pearls are enough of themselves to make the feminine mind envious. It is said that this jewellery is valued at four lakhs of rupees; it is kept in a strong room on the hill.\"\n\nIt appears from Mr. Cousens's narrative that the enthusiasm of the Jain pilgrims to \u010catur\u00f1jaya has by no means died out in modern times. In some points there is a change. The pilgrims no longer pass the night upon the hill, though we read that Vastup\u0101la's stay there lasted eight days. Moreover the establishment of the pax Britannica has rendered an armed escort unnecessary for pilgrims, and though some of the antiquated pieces of ordnance, formerly used to defend the shrines, may still be seen on the hill, and the strong gates of the enclosures still remain, the fortifications are not armed and guarded, as in the old days, when the land swarmed with marauders.\n\nBoth Arisinha and Some\u00e7vara assert that Vastup\u0101la travelled to Girnar and the temple of Soman\u0101tha. Arisinha describes his worship in the temple of Nemin\u0101tha, on Girnar, with much detail, but as the rites do not differ materially from those performed in the shrine of \u0100din\u0101tha, it is, perhaps, hardly worth while to reproduce his statements.\n\nThe account given by Merutunga is not so clear, but there is a substantial agreement between all three writers.\n\nWith the death of Vastup\u0101la, Merutunga brings to an end that part of his work which may be looked upon as a continuous narrative.\nThe miscellaneous chapter is, as its name imports, a collection of disconnected anecdotes. The account of the destruction of Valabhi\\(^1\\) is, to a certain extent, supported by the testimony of Alberuni, and may, possibly, be partly historical. But the episode of Rajka, and his daughter's fateful comb, savours strongly of the story of Count Julian and his daughter, which is, I believe, not accepted in all its details by sober historians. Miss Duff considers that the Mleechas were Muhammadans, and that they came from Sindh under 'Amru Ibn Jamal. The Mleechas were also instrumental in causing the death of Jayacandra of Benares, according to Merutunga.\\(^2\\) It is not difficult to identify this sovereign. According to Miss Duff, in the year 1194 \"Qu\u1e6dbu-d-D\u012bn, leaving Delhi, crosses the J\u016bn and takes the fort of Kol after an obstinate resistance. Later in the same year he aids Mu\u02bfizzu-d-D\u012bn in defeating Jayacandra of Benares and Kanauj, and capturing his fort of Asni.\" It appears that Jayacandra met his death on this occasion. He was the last of the R\u0101\u1e6dhor dynasty of Kanauj. Another prince overthrown and killed by the Mleechas was the well-known Prthvir\u0101ja. Of this monarch Merutunga relates in the first place that he defeated Paramardideva. This king, who has left, according to Miss Duff, numerous inscriptions, appears to be the Candella sovereign who succeeded his father Madanavarman in 1167. This sovereign was, according to the same authority, defeated by the C\u0101ham\u0101na king Prthvir\u0101ja in 1182. This date is based upon inscriptions. The following account is given of Prthvir\u0101ja's final overthrow in 1192:\u2014\"Mu\u02bfizzu-d-D\u012bn, returning to Hindustan, again encounters Prthvir\u0101ja and his allies near Th\u0101nesar, and totally defeats them, thus becoming virtually master of the country. Prthvir\u0101ja, being captured, is put to death, and his son appointed governor of Ajmir.\"\n\nMuch will be found about Prthvir\u0101ja in Forbes's Ras M\u0101la, Elphinstone's History of India and other works, but my present object is to show that Merutunga's statements are, on the whole, not at variance with the testimony of inscriptions and of Muhammadan historians.\n\nThe king, Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47asena, of Gauda, who had for a minister Um\u0101patidhara, may possibly have been the Vaidya king of Bengal, who founded the Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47asena era in 1119. Tradition has it that Jayadeva, the author of the G\u012bt\u0101 Govinda, flourished under a king of that name.\\(^3\\) I have pointed out\\(^4\\) that a poet of the name of Um\u0101patidhara is mentioned in the fourth stanza of the G\u012bt\u0101 Govinda. There can be no doubt that the poet and the minister who admonished his king in verse are identical.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pages 172-176 of my translation.\n\\(^2\\) Pages 183-186 of my translation.\n\\(^3\\) Indian Chronology, p. 136.\n\\(^4\\) In my note on p. 181. [The poetical claims of Um\u0101patidhara have been considered by Professor Pischel in his pamphlet, Die Hofdichter des Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47asena, G\u00f6ttingen, 1893, pp. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 13. I owe my introduction to this pamphlet to Professor Zachariae. I wish I had known of it sooner.]\nThere is little else in the miscellaneous section that can properly be called historical. Many of the tales belong to the great mass of edifying anecdote that seems to have been at the disposal of the Jain community, consisting principally of old Indian legends, skilfully adapted by Jain teachers for the moral improvement of the faithful. The fact that Indian folklore, principally in my opinion the folklore of Eastern India, was so adapted, by no means deprives the stories of their interest for students of that new science, the importance of which is, perhaps, greater than some people suppose; and the fact that Jain chroniclers delicately manipulated history, with the object of putting Jain kings and Jain ministers in a favourable light, should not prevent readers from receiving their descriptions as a faithful picture of the social and political condition of the times in which they lived. Moreover, it seems to be demonstrated by the testimony of grants and inscriptions that many of their statements are literally accurate.\\(^1\\) Much has been done already towards revealing this new world of literature to the Indian public,\\(^2\\) and it is to be hoped that the young Sanskrit scholars of India will not rest until all the works that have any claim to the title of history are edited and translated.\n\nI have used, in making this translation, three MSS., one lent to me by the kindness of the Bombay Government, No. 617 of 1885-86,\\(^3\\) my collation of which I call P, in honour of the late Dr. Peterson, and Nos. 296 and 297, belonging to the collection which the late Hofrath B\u00fchler presented to the India Office, which I call \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) respectively.\n\nOf the first MS. Dr. Peterson writes in his second report (pp. 86-87).\n\n\"I will close these hurried notes with the announcement that in the end of the year I was fortunate enough to secure a copy of Merutunga's Prabandhacint\u0101ma\u1e47i, a work of great historical importance, which we have been long endeavouring to add to our collection. I have placed this copy in Pandit Bhagw\u0101n L\u0101l's hands, for whose forthcoming history of Guzarat it was very necessary, and that learned scholar has furnished me with the following account of it for the purpose of this report:\n\n\"Folios 81.

This copy was presented by Mr. Forbes to the Forbes Gujar\u0101ti Sabha, but is now missing.\n\n\\(^1\\) The chronology of India, by Miss C. Mabel Duff (Mrs. W. R.

The Prabandhacint\u0101ma\u1e47i really ends on page 272. The remaining pages contain a story, which is also found in the Bombay Government MS.

The four gates are the four classes of the Jaina scriptures, which are sometimes divided into (1) Pratham\u0101nuyoga, i.e. legends and history; (2) Karan\u0101nuyoga, i.e. works describing the origin and order of the universe; (3) Dravy\u0101nuyoga, treating of philosophy and doctrine; (4) Caran\u0101nuyoga, treating of customs and worship. As the classes of the sacred writings are four, they fit into the four mouths of Sarasvati, who has four heads in the Jaina mythology. The names of the four classes given above are taken from Hofrath B\u00fchler's article on the Digambara Jainas (Indian Antiquary, VII. p. 28). But Hofrath B\u00fchler informs me that these four classes are known to the \u010cvet\u0101mbara Jainas by slightly different names, namely dharmakath\u0101nuyoga; ganit\u0101nuyoga; dravy\u0101nuyoga; caranukaranaanuyoga. Hofrath B\u00fchler refers me to Weber, Catalog, Vol. II. pt. 2, p. 361.\n\nI may here mention that as a general rule I do not translate \u0106ri and \u0125rimat when prefixed to the names of persons and places.

Now this man, though afflicted with poverty from his birth, was devoted to policy, and when he did not obtain wealth even by more than a thousand devices, he, once on a time, set out for the Rohana mountain in company with a friend named Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dam\u0101tra. When they approached it, they rested in the house of a potter, in a city called Pravara, near the mountain. When Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dam\u0101tra, the next morning, asked the potter for a pickaxe, he said, \u201cAny man in low circumstances, who goes into the middle of this mine, and hearing in the morning unwelcome news, touches his forehead with his hand, and exclaims, \u2018Alas, Destiny!\u2019 and then strikes a blow, obtains whatever jewels may turn up.\u201d Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dam\u0101tra, having thoroughly ascertained this fact from the potter, took those tools with him, and when Vikrama was standing in the mine, ready to strike, in order to obtain jewels, being unable to induce him to assume the requisite despondency by any other method, he said to him, \u201cA certain stranger has come from Ujjayini, and when he was asked for news of the welfare of those at home, he said that your mother was dead.\u201d When Vikrama heard that intelligence, which was like a red-hot diamond needle, he struck his forehead with the palm of his hand, and exclaiming, \u201cAlas, Destiny!\u201d he flung the pickaxe from his grasp. When the ground was torn up by the point of the pickaxe, a gleaming jewel, worth a lakh and a quarter, sprang to light. Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dam\u0101tra took the jewel and returned with Vikrama. In order to remove the danger of the dart of his friend\u2019s grief, Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dam\u0101tra told him at that time the secret of the mine, and also the fact that his mother was in perfect health. Thinking that covetousness was bred in the bone of Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dam\u0101tra, Vikrama flew into a passion, and tearing the jewel from his hand, he returned to the mouth of the mine. He exclaimed,\u2014\u201cCurse on the Rohana mountain, that heals the wound of the poverty of the wretched! Which gives jewels to petitioners, on their exclaiming, \u2018Alas, Destiny!\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter uttering these words, he flung down the jewel in that very mine, in the sight of all the people, and wandering off to another country he reached the environs of Avanti. Having heard the sound of a shrill drum, and having ascertained the whole secret, he kept quiet about it, and entered the palace simultaneously with the drum. The ministers installed him as\n\n---\n\n1 See Index to my translation of the Kath\u0101 Sarit S\u0101gara s.v. \u201cmarks.\u201d\n2 Strictly speaking we are only told in the original that Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dam\u0101tra rested.\n3 I read pr\u0101tarapu\u1e63ya\u00e7ravap\u0101p\u016brvam as the context seems to require it.

Owing to his sagacity, he said to himself, \"Some mighty demon or god is angry with this kingdom, and kills one king every day, and\\(^1\\) as there is no king, wastes the realm. So by fair or foul means I must win him over.\\(^2\\) So he had prepared various kinds of viands and delicacies, and having arranged them all at night-fall in an upper room of the palace, he went there immediately after the evening ceremony of waving lights before the idol, surrounded by his guards, and placed a bolster covered with his own turban and garments on a swinging bed which was suspended from the ceiling by chains,\\(^3\\) while he himself, excelling in valour the three worlds, stood, sword in hand, in a part of the room not lit up by the lamp. While he remained gazing into the air, lo! in the very dead of the night he beheld entering by way of the window first a smoke, then a flame, then a terrible vampire,\\(^4\\) looking like the visible embodiment of the ruler of the dead; and he, with belly pinched with hunger, having enjoyed to his fill those delicacies, and having anointed his body with the sweet-smelling substances, and being pleased by tasting the betel, sat down on that bed and said to Vikrama, \"Mortal, my name is Agnivet\u00e2la, and I am well known as the doorkeeper of the king of the gods. I kill one king every day. However, being pleased with this devotion on your part, I grant you your life and give you the kingdom, but you must always provide for me the same amount of viands and delicacies.\" When both had agreed to this compact, after the lapse of some time, king Vikrama asked the Vet\u00e2la the length of his own life. The Vet\u00e2la said, \"I do not know, but I will ask my master and inform you.\" Having said this, he departed. He came again on another night and said to Vikrama, \"The great Indra says that you will live for one hundred years exactly.\" The king urged strongly the obligations of friendship and entreated him earnestly, that he would induce Indra to make the hundred years shorter or longer\\(^5\\) by one year. He promised to do so, but returned and said, \"The great Indra will not consent to make your life ninety-nine or one hundred and one years.\" When the king heard this decision, he ordered the customary viands and delicacies not to be cooked for the next day, and remained at night ready to do battle. Thereupon the vampire came there the next night according to previous\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) P and \\(a\\) insert ca after nrp\u00e2bh\u00e2ve.\n\n\\(^2\\) This story is found in the Jaina recension of the Simh\u00e2sanadv\u00e2tr\u00eem\u00e7ik\u00e2.

Then a single combat took place between them, and lasted for a long time, but at last the king, by the help of his own good actions in a previous state of existence, beat the vampire down to the ground and putting his foot upon his heart, he said to him, \"Call to mind your favourite deity.\" The vampire answered the king, \"I am delighted with this marvellous daring on your part, and you may consider that you have won over me, the vampire named Agniyet\u0101la, as a slave to execute all your commands.\" So Vikrama's kingdom became free from enemies. In this way he brought into subjection to himself the territories of ninety-six rival monarchs, conquering by his prowess the whole circle of the regions.\n\nO S\u0101has\u0101yka, the wild elephant of the woods, approaching the palaces of thy enemies,\nAnd beholding afar, in that part of their walls which is made of crystal, his own reflected image,\nThinking it a rival elephant, smites it in wrath, and breaking his tusk, looks again,\nAnd then slowly, slowly strokes it, thinking it a female of his own race.\n\nIn the city of Avanti lived Priyangum\u0101\u00f1jari, the daughter of King Vikram\u0101ditya. She was made over to a pandit named Vararuci for the purpose of study, and, owing to her cleverness, she learnt the \u0100stras from him in a few days. She was in the prime of youth, and remained continually gratifying her father. One day in the season of spring, when she was sitting on a sofa in the window at the time of mid-day, when the sun was scorching men's foreheads, she saw her teacher coming along in the road; and when he had rested in the shade of the window, she said to him, showing him some mango fruits mellow with ripeness, and knowing that he longed for them, \"Would you like to have these fruits warm or cold?\" He, not seeing the real cunning of her question, answered, \"I should like to have them warm.\" Thereupon, she threw them sideways into the corner of his garment, which he held out to receive them. They fell on the ground, and were consequently covered with dust. So the pandit took them in his two palms, and proceeded to remove the dust by blowing upon them. While he was doing this, the princess said to him tauntingly, \"What,\n\n1 I read with a and P, yutkrty\u0101de\u00e7ak\u0101ri.

At the end of these lines a inserts the following words, \"Now we return to the narrative. Being praised in such words by K\u0101lid\u0101sa and other great poets, he enjoyed for a long time the kingdom. Now we will relate concisely the origin of K\u0101lid\u0101sa, as the subject presents itself naturally.\" The story of K\u0101lid\u0101sa is tacked on in a clumsy way, whatever reading we adopt.\nare these fruits too hot, that you cool them with your breath!\" That Brahman, being annoyed by her taunting speech, said to her, \"Ah! young woman, you fancy that you are very clever, but as you choose to cavil at your teacher, may you have a herdsman for a husband!\" When she heard this curse of his, she uttered the following vow, \"Whoever is your supreme preceptor through excelling you in knowledge, though you do know the three Vedas, that man I will marry.\" Then, as king Vikrama was whelmed in a sea of anxiety with regard to finding a distinguished youth who would be a suitable match for her, once on a time that pandit, by order of the king, who had become impatient for the pointing out of the desired bridegroom, entered a large forest, and was afflicted with excessive thirst. As no water appeared in any direction, seeing a herdsman he asked him for water. The herdsman, as he had no water to give, said, \"Drink milk,\" and then told him to make a karavadi. When the pandit heard this term, which of all terms he had never heard before in his life, his mind was devoured by bewilderment. But the herdsman put his hand on the pandit's head, and placed him under a buffalo-cow, and then, having induced the pandit to put the palms of his hands together, so as to form what is called a karavadi, he made him drink milk till his throat was filled. The pandit considered the herdsman as good as his preceptor, because he placed his hand on his head and taught him the specific term karavadi, and thought that he would be a fitting bridegroom for the princess. So he made him leave the buffalo-cow, and brought him to his own palace; and for six months made him cultivate his person, and repeat the formula of blessing, \"Om namah Shivaya!\" After six months he found that those syllables were well impressed on the surface of his throat, so in a fortunate muhurta he conducted him to the court of the king, after he had been suitably adorned. The herdsman was so bewildered by the sight of the court, that when he tried to address to the king the formula of blessing he had carefully practised, he brought out the syllables, \"Ucarata.\" When the king was puzzled with the herdsman's stammering utterance, the pandit, wishing to have him credited with a cleverness he did not possess, said:\n\n1 This feeble joke is found in the Kath\u0101 Sarit S\u0101gara. See Vol. II. of my translation, p. 619.\n2 I read with a and P, adhikavidyalay\u0101. This reading is justified by the sequel. It is also found in the MSS. which Din\u0101n\u0101tha calls A and B.\n3 I read sarvata\u1e25 sarvatomukh\u0101bh\u0101v\u0101t. I find this reading in a and P. Hofrath B\u00fchler has reminded me that sarvatomukha means \"water.\"\n4 A, B and a give karacand\u012bm. P agrees clearly with the text, wherever the word occurs. I have therefore followed the text.\n5 It will be observed that he satisfied both conditions, being a herdsman, and the preceptor of the pandit, superior to him in the knowledge of one word.\n6 For a similar story see the reference on p. 161 of Fick's \"Sociale Gliederung im Nord\u00f6stlichen Indien zu Buddha's Zeit\" to the Somadatta J\u0101taka (II. 165).\n\"May Rudra together with Um\u0101, bestowing blessings, trident in hand,\nElated with the might of his shout, protect thee, O lord of the Earth!\"\n\nBy understanding this couplet to be intended, he interpreted in diffuse\nlanguage the depth of the herdsman's learning. The king, pleased with\nthis satisfactory evidence of the herdsman's learning, had him married to\nhis daughter. In accordance with the advice of the pandit, the herdsman\npreserved unbroken silence; but the princess, wishing to test his cleverness,\nentreated him to revise\u00b9 a newly-written book. He placed the book in the\npalm of his hand, and with a nail-parer proceeded to remove from the\nletters in it the dots and the oblique lines at the top indicating vowels,\u00b2\nand thus to isolate them, and then the princess discovered that he was a\ncowherd. After that the son-in-law's revision became a proverb everywhere.\nOnce on a time they pointed out to him a herd of buffalo-cows in a picture\npainted on a wall. In his delight he forgot his high rank, and uttered the\nbarbarous\u00b3 words made use of for calling buffalo-cows. So it was ascer-\ntained for certain that he was a keeper of buffalo-cows.\u2074 The herdsman,\nreflecting on that contempt, which the princess showed towards him, began\nto propitiate the goddess K\u0101l\u012b in order to attain learning. The king, being\nafraid that his daughter would be left a widow, sent a female slave in\ndisguise\u2075 at night, and when she woke him up and said to him, \"I am\npleased with you,\" the goddess K\u0101l\u012b herself, apprehending that some\ndisaster would take place, appeared in visible form and granted his request.\nWhen the princess heard of that occurrence she was delighted, and came\nthere and said, \"Is there any special utterance?\" He thereupon, having\nbecome known by the name of K\u0101lid\u0101sa, composed the three Mah\u0101k\u0101vyas,\nthe Kum\u0101ra Sambhava, and so on, and six other works.\u2076\n\nOnce on a time a merchant named D\u0101nta, who lived in King Vikram\u0101-\nditya's city, came to him as he was in his hall of audience, with a present\nin his hand, and, bowing low, said to him, \"King, in a lucky m\u016bh\u016brta I\nhad a palace built by distinguished master-builders, and I went into it with\n\n\u00b9 The word used means also \"purify,\" and perhaps the herdsman interpreted it\nliterally.\n\u00b2 I have taken this sense of m\u0101tr\u0101 from Molesworth's Marathi Dictionary. But\nin Hindi, according to the Dictionary of Bates, the word in addition to this\nmeaning, indicates the horizontal stroke of a letter.\n\u00b3 I read with P, vik\u1e5bta for vik\u1e5bti.\n\u2074 I find taj\u0101 inserted in a after ni\u1e63cikye. This means that the princess ascer-\ntained the fact.\n\u2075 She was of course personating the goddess. Propitiating K\u0101l\u012b often involves\nsuicide.\n\u2076 This account of K\u0101lid\u0101sa's origin and his acquisition of literary ability by the\nfavour of the goddess K\u0101l\u012b is also found in T\u0101rn\u0101tha's History of Buddhism. See\nMr. Heeley's paper in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. IV. pp. 101\u2014104. Cp. also the\nform of the story given in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. VII. pp. 116\u2014117.

I was bewildered with fear, and exclaiming, 'Do not fall,' I immediately made my escape. I have been to no purpose mulcted by the astrologers, who have had to do with this mansion, and by the architects, in the form of contributions, such as seasonable complimentary presents, and so on. Now it remains for your Majesty to decide what should be done.\" When the king had carefully considered the account given by the merchant, he paid him the three lakhs which he fixed as the price of that splendid mansion, and, after the general assembly of the evening, king Vikrama slept comfortably in that palace which he had made his own. When he heard that same voice say, \"I am falling,\" he, being a man of unrivalled daring, said, \"Fall quickly,\" and so he obtained a man of gold that fell near him. Such is the story of the attainment of the man of gold.\n\nThen, on another occasion, a certain poverty-stricken man was introduced by the warder, with a very thin iron doll, representing poverty, in his hand, and said to the king, \"Your Majesty, I heard the report that in Avanti, famous for having you as its lord, all things are quickly sold and easily purchased, and yet I have during a day and night carried round this poverty-doll for sale in the eighty-four cross-roads of the city, but no one has bought it; on the contrary, I have been abused. I have made known to your Majesty this reproach to the city, as it is, and I now return by the way by which I came. I hereby take my leave of your Majesty.\" Immediately the king, taking into account that great stain of reproach on the honour of his city, gave him one hundred thousand din\u0101ras, and placed that iron doll in his treasury. In the course of that same night, in the first watch, the deity that presided over the elephants appeared to the king as he was comfortably asleep; in the second watch appeared the deity that presided over the horses; in the third watch appeared the goddess of Fortune herself, and they all said, \"Since your Majesty has been pleased to buy a doll representing poverty, it is not fitting for us to remain here.\" In these words they took leave of him, and saying, \"Let not your Majesty's courage\n\n1 I read yath\u0101v\u0101saram arha\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101dhi\u1e25.

In the fourth watch a certain noble-looking man, of a celestial radiant form, appeared, and said, \"I am named Courage; I have attended on you since your birth, and now I take leave of you, being about to go.\" When the apparition had said this, the king took his sword in his grasp and prepared to slay himself, but that moment that very same being seized him by the hand, and restrained him, saying, \"I am pleased with you.\" The three deities that presided over the elephants and other departments, returned, and said to the king, \"We have been deceived by this genius of courage, who has broken the compact we made to depart, so it is not fit that we should go away and leave the king.\" Accordingly, they also remained, without the king's making any effort to detain them.\n\nThen, on another occasion, a certain foreigner, who was well acquainted with the science of palmistry, was introduced by the doorkeeper into the presence of the king, who was in his hall of audience, and after entering, looked at his marks, and began to shake his head. The king asked him the cause of his despondency. He replied, \"Now that I have seen that, though you possess in fulness all the inauspicious marks, you are enjoying the fortune of sovereignty over ninety-six realms, I have become sceptical about the science of palmistry. But I do not perceive in you any speckled entrail, which could give you the power to hold sway, as you do.\" As soon as king Vikram\u0101ditya heard this speech, he seized his sword, and proceeded to put it to his stomach, but the professor of palmistry asked him what he was about. The king answered, \"I am about to rip open my stomach and show you an entrail of that kind.\" The professor of palmistry said, \"I now perceive that you possess the mark of courage, which is better than all the thirty-two auspicious marks.\" Thereupon the king dismissed him with a present.\n\nThen, having heard on a certain occasion, that all accomplishments are useless in comparison with the art of entering the bodies of other creatures, king Vikrama repaired to the Yogin Bhairav\u0101nanda, and propitiated him for a long time on the mountain of \u010cri. But a former servant of his, a certain Brahman, said to the king, \"You ought not to receive from the teacher the art of entering other bodies, unless it is given to me at the same time.\" Having been thus entreated, the king made this request to the teacher, when he was desirous of bestowing on him the science, \"First\n\n1 Sattva.\n2 In a is found the word mutkal\u0101payas\u0101mi (for mutkal\u0101payisy\u0101mi ?).

Then both returned to Ujjayini. When the king reached it, seeing that his courtiers were depressed on account of the death of the state elephant, and also in order to test the science of entering another body, he transferred his soul into the body of his own elephant.\n\nThe occurrence is thus described:\n\nThe king, while the Brahman kept guard, entered by his science the body of his elephant;\nThe Brahman entered the body of the king; then the king became a pet parrot;\nThe king transferred himself into the body of a lizard; then considering that the queen was likely to die,\nThe Brahman restored to life the parrot, and the great Vikrama recovered his own body.\n\nIn this way Vikram\u0101ditya acquired the art of entering another body.\u00b2\n\nThen, on another occasion,\u00b3 as King Vikrama was going about on his royal circuit, he saw the teacher Siddhasena\u2074 approaching, being followed by the members of the Jaina community residing in that city, and praised by sons of bards as the son of the All-knowing. The king was annoyed by the phrase \u201cson of the All-knowing.\u201d In order to test his omniscience, he paid him the tribute of a mental salutation.\n\nWhen a worthy person has come within range of my eyes, ten hundred,\nand when I speak to him, ten thousand,\nAnd as for the man whose saying may make me laugh, on him let a hundred thousand be quickly bestowed by you,\nI always give in a present ten million ni\u1e63kas, such is my supreme command for aye,\nO superintendent of the treasury; such a system of liberality did Vikram\u0101ditya observe.\u2075\n\nSiddhasena, for his part, by means of the P\u016brvagata scripture\u2076 having understood the mind of the king, lifted up his right hand and gave the\n\n\u00b9 Patthahastin.\n\u00b2 See my translation of the Kath\u0101 Sarit S\u0101gara, Vol. I. pp. 21, 22; Vol. II. p. 358.\n\u00b3 I read at/\u0101\u00f1yaseminarasare with a.\n\u2074 For the story of Siddhasena see Weber\u2019s Indische Studien, XV. p. 279 and ff.\n\u2075 This stanza is found in the Jaina recension of the \u015ar\u012bh\u0101sanaadv\u0101trim\u00e7ik\u0101.

The king asked him the reason which led him to bestow his benediction. Thereupon the great hermit told him, that it was being bestowed upon him in return for his mental salutation. When he said this, the king, astonished at his knowledge, gave him ten millions of gold pieces by way of reward. Then, on another occasion, the king asked the superintendent of the treasury the story of the gold which he had ordered to be given to the sage, and he said, \"I entered the item of the gift of gold in the charity accounts in the form of the following couplet,\u2014\"\n\n\"When the Jaina sage Siddhasena, lifting up his hand, said to the king from afar,\n\n'May you obtain the faith,' the monarch of men gave him ten millions.\"\n\nAfterwards, when the king summoned the sage Siddhasena into the hall of audience, and said, \"Take that gold,\" the sage exclaiming that it was useless to give food to the sated, bade him free the earth which was laden with debt, by means of that gold. When the king had received this piece of advice, being pleased with the contentment of the sage, he promised to do as he bade.\n\nA beggar, that has come, longing to see you, stands stopped at the door,\nWith four couplets in his hand; is he to come or go?\nLet ten hundred thousand be given, and fourteen grants,\nWith four couplets in his hand, let him come or go!\n\nFalsely art thou praised by the wise on the ground that always thou givest all things,\nThy enemies have not gained a sight of thy back, nor the wives of others thy heart.\nThe goddess of eloquence resides in thy mouth, fortune in the lotus of thy hand,\nWhy is fame so wroth, O king, that she has travelled to foreign lands?\nWhence hast thou learnt this so strange science of archery?\nThe stream of arrows comes towards thee, the bow-string goes to another quarter.\n\n1 The words dak\u1e63inap\u0101ni\u2014dadau form half a cloka.\n2 Dharmachikits\u0101ya\u1e25.

See also Weber's Indische Studien, XV. p. 288.\n6 The king's fame has spread to foreign countries. For this stanza see Indische Studien, XV. p. 288.\n7 The word that means \"arrow,\" also means \"petitioner.\" This couplet is found on page 124 of Pavie's Bhojaprabandha.\n8 The word gu\u1e63a means \"bow-string\" or \"virtue.\" The king's virtue is renowned afar. See Indische Studien, XV. p. 287 for this, and page 288 for the following couplet.\nWhen thy loud-sounding drum is struck, the hearts of thy enemies break like jars,\nBut the eyes of their wives stream; this, O king, is a great miracle.\nThe goddess of eloquence dwells ever in the lotus of thy mouth, but thy lower lip is always red,\nThy arm is quick to remind men of the might of R\u0101ma, thy right hand is a sea.\nArmies, having come to thy side, do not even for a moment leave thee,\nWhence, O lord of earth, is there repeatedly in this thy transparent inner mind, the desire of drinking water?\n\nIn that very night the king roamed about in the city in search of adventures, and heard the following half-couplet being repeated again and again by the mouth of an oilman:\n\nOne might indeed call our ruler K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the preserver.\n\nThe king waited all the remainder of the night until daybreak, in hopes of hearing the second half of the couplet, but not hearing it he became despondent, and going back to his palace he went to sleep. In the morning, after the king had performed the duties incumbent on him at that time, he summoned the oilman, and asked him the second half of the couplet. He repeated it as follows:\n\nThe world is whelmed in poverty, and the bonds of taxation are not indeed relaxed.\n\nReflecting that Siddhasena's advice was now repeated, he began to free the world from debt. Then he asked Siddhasena whether there would ever be any Jaina king like himself; and thereupon the sage Siddhasena said:\n\n\"When a thousand years are fulfilled, and a hundred and ninety-nine,\nThere shall be a king, Kum\u0101rap\u0101la by name, like thee, O Vikram\u0101ditya.\"\n\nThen, on another occasion, while the world was being freed from debt, feeling puffed up with conceit on account of his own virtue of generosity,\n\n1 Sarasvati is represented as extremely white. See Miss Ridding's K\u0101dambari, p. 104, note.\n2 Perhaps it also means \"You have the Southern sea.\"\n3 Or \"rivers.\"\n4 In mind (m\u0101nas\u0101) there is a reference to the M\u0101nas\u0101 lake. Here I have omitted one Sanskrit couplet, which is repeated further on in the book, and one Prakrit couplet for reasons which will be apparent to the student of the original text.\n5 Here a and P have paribhrama\u1e47 for bhraman. This is, perhaps, an improvement.\n6 The reading of a is n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a ha kahija.\n7 The word translated \"bonds of taxation\" also means \"fettering of Bali.\" Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is called \"Balibandhana,\" the fetterer of Bali, in allusion to the dwarf incarnation. No doubt the king expected that the second line would be laudatory.\nhe said to himself that he would have a pillar of fame erected next morning, and as he was wandering about that very same night in the cross-road in search of adventures, being chased by two fighting bulls, he climbed up a pillar in the ruined cowhouse of a certain Brahman afflicted with poverty, and while he was there, these two bulls struck the pillar again and again with the points of their horns. In the meanwhile that Brahman was suddenly awakened from sleep, and seeing that the disk of the moon was obscured in the sky by Venus and Jupiter, he woke up his wife, and perceiving that danger to the life of the king was indicated by the disk of the moon, he ordered his wife to bring things fit for sacrifice, in order that he might make an oblation in the fire to avert that calamity.\\(^1\\) The king all this while was listening attentively, and heard his wife answer him, \"This king, though he is freeing\\(^2\\) the world from debt, does not bestow wealth to marry my seven daughters.\\(^3\\) So how can it be fitting to perform an evil-averting ceremony to deliver such a man from calamity?\" By this speech of the Brahman's wife, the king had his pride completely stripped from him, and after he had escaped\\(^4\\) from that danger, forgetting all about the pillar of fame, he ruled his realm for a long time.\n\nAlas! though thou hast lost thy courage and defiled thyself,\nThou hast not obtained freedom from old age and death;\\(^5\\) alas! Vikrama,\nthy birth has been thrown away.\n\nOnce on a time, at the end of his life, when Vikrama was in an unhealthy state of body, a certain professor of medical science gave this advice, \"The disease may be cured by eating the flesh of a crow.\" The king ordered that dish to be cooked, but the physician, reflecting that this was in opposition to his natural character, said to him, \"At the present juncture the medicine of religion is the really efficacious one. The alteration of the natural character of anything is a portent of evil. Through longing for life you have abandoned your world-surpassing courageous nature, and long for the flesh of a crow; so, in any case, you will not live.\" When thus admonished by the physician, the king gave him a present, and praised him as his true friend. He then distributed to petitioners all his property, consisting of elephants, horses, treasure, and so on, and took leave of the courtiers and the citizens, and after performing the charitable\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A very similar incident will be found in J\u0101taka 290 (p. 291 of J\u0101taka, Vol. II.

The king said to them, \"When you live in the world of heaven, how can my fault be attributed to you?\" When the king's speech was ended, the chief of the nymphs, named Sumukhy\u0101, said to him, \"King, owing to the development of your meritorious actions in a former life, in this life nine treasures have descended into your palace. We preside over them. Your Majesty, by giving great gifts from your birth like a god,\\(^3\\) has subtracted so much from one treasure, that you do not see the tip of its nose.\" When he heard this reply from the nymph, he touched his forehead with the palm of his hand, and said, \"If I had known that I had nine treasures, I would have given them to nine men; I have been defrauded by destiny, owing to my ignorance.\" While he was uttering these words, they informed him that he was the only really generous man in the Kali Yuga,\\(^4\\) and so he passed to the other world. From that time forth, this Samvatsara era of that Vikram\u0101ditya has prevailed in the world up to the present day. So we have related various stories about the generosity of Vikram\u0101ditya.\n\nNow follows the History of \u010c\u0101l\u012bv\u0101hana.\\(^5\\)\n\nNow you must learn the story of S\u0101tav\u0101hana, illustrative of generosity and wisdom, related according to tradition. The story of his former life is as follows:\n\nAs king \u010c\u0101tav\u0101hana was going on his royal circuit in the city of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Brahmadv\u0101ra is, of course, equivalent to Brahmarandhra, a suture or aperture in the crown of the head, through which the soul is said to escape at death.\n\n\\(^2\\) I read ekam eva with A, B, a, and P. The sequel will show that this is absolutely necessary.\n\n\\(^3\\) The reading of the text is supported by P. Devat\u0101r\u016bpa is omitted in a.\n\n\\(^4\\) This corresponds to the Iron Age of European mythology.\n\n\\(^5\\) Din\u0101n\u0101tha points out that this king is called \u010c\u0101l\u012bv\u0101hana, \u010c\u0101lav\u0101hana, S\u0101lav\u0101hana, S\u0101lav\u0101hana, S\u0101l\u0101h\u0101na, S\u0101tav\u0101hana, and H\u0101la. He is also called \u010c\u0101tav\u0101hana in this book.\nPrat\u012bsth\u0101na, he saw in the river near the city a certain fish that had been thrown up by the waves on the bank of the river, laughing; and reflecting that the alteration of the natural character of anything is a portent of evil, he was bewildered with fear, and he asked all clever people about this doubtful point, and at last he questioned a Jaina hermit, named J\u00f1\u0101na-s\u0101gara. He having discerned by the surpassing excellence of his knowledge the king's former life, gave this instructive response, \"In a former life you were in this very city a man whose family had become extinct, and you supported yourself only by carrying loads of wood. At meal-time you used to repair to this very river, and on a slab of rock near it, you used continually to stir up barley-meal with water and eat it. Once on a time you saw walking in front of you a Jaina hermit, who had come to take food after a month's fast. So you called him, and gave him the ball of meal that you had made. From the surpassing merit acquired by giving to that fitting object, you have become King \u010c\u0101lav\u0101hana. That hermit has become a god. That god entered into the fish, and the fish being thus animated by the god laughed for joy at beholding the soul of the wood-carrier, which is none other than yourself, born in the rank of a king.\" And this story is summed up in the following stanza:\n\nWhen the face of the fish laughed, the hermit said to king \u010c\u0101tav\u0101hana,\nWho was bewildered with fear, \"Because thou on the bank of this river,\nDidst cause a hermit to break his fast on barley-meal long ago,\nHappening to behold thee, thereupon the fish laughed.\"\n\nThat \u010c\u0101tav\u0101hana, having represented to his mind, by his power of remembering his former births, that incident of old time, practised from that day forth the virtue of charity, and devoted himself to collecting the compositions of all great poets and wise men. He bought four g\u0101th\u0101s for forty million gold pieces, and had a book made, which was a treasury of g\u0101th\u0101s that he had collected, named \u010c\u0101liv\u0101hana, containing seven hundred g\u0101th\u0101s, and so being a storehouse of various glorious achievements, he ruled for a long time.\n\nThese four g\u0101th\u0101s are as follows:\n\n1 I have given what I suppose to be the sense of the passage. The MSS. support the text.\n2 Sagrakag\u0101th\u0101ko\u00e7a. Sagraka is omitted in a. In the Nava\u015b\u0101has\u0101\u1e45gacarita by B\u00fchler and Z\u00e1charie, p. 32 note, we find \"Der S\u0101tav\u0101hana, welcher hier gemeint ist, wird H\u0101la der compilator des G\u0101th\u0101kosa sein.\" On the second page of Weber's \"\u00dcber das Saptas\u0101gakam des H\u0101la,\" we find it stated that Dr. Bhau D\u0101ji identified H\u0101la with \u010c\u0101tav\u0101hana.

The first and tenth enumerate the sums paid, mentioning the principal words of the g\u0101th\u0101s bought. I have not found any one of the ten g\u0101th\u0101s in Weber's book.\nDo not learn, O parrot, how a ripe mango, caressed by the beak, falls,\nHere is a field of rice sprung up, presuming on its hardness.\nNo disrespect should be shown to those men, who are like banana-stems,\nWho, when bestowing fruits, do not regard their own destruction.\nThe Vindhya supports every day dry trees as well as trees full of sap,\nThe great do not abandon one who has been reared in their laps, though he\nbe worthless.\nWhen a first object of regard has for some reason or other been adopted by\nthose men and women,\nThe reason that they do not look at another is that it is even like the roof-\ntree familiar to them from their birth.\nWill the fragrance delighting all men, that belongs to the sandal-wood tree,\nthough dry,\nWill this fragrance, I say, be found in it, in the condition of a new tree full\nof sap?\nThe banana-tree, the Vindhya mountain, the object of regard, and the\nsandal-wood tree,\nThese were immediately bought by \u00c7\u0101liv\u0101hana for ninety millions.\n\nNow follows the story of the moral vow. The following is a brief abstract\nof it. In the city of Kanyakubja, the royal residence, which is of the size\nof thirty-six lakhs of villages, the king Bh\u00fbdeva, on account of the fact\nthat he fell in love with the wife of the servant that superintended his\nbeverages, propitiated Kadramahak\u0101la in M\u0101lava, and after giving the realm\nof M\u0101lava to that god, himself became an ascetic.\n\nIn the land of Gujar\u00e2t, in the region called Vadhiy\u0101ra, in the village of\nPa\u00f1c\u0101ra, the mother of a boy of the C\u0101potkata race placed him in a\ncradle, on a tree called v\u0101ga, and herself went to gather fuel.\n\nIt happened that, for some reason or other, the Jaina teacher, named\n\u00c7ilagupas\u016bri, came there and saw that the shade of that tree was not inclined,\nthough it was the afternoon. He thought that this strange fact must be\ndue to the power of the merit of that very boy that was in the cradle, and\nhoping that he was destined to extend the Jaina faith, he bought him from\n\n1 Kaly\u0101nakataka. Is this the Hindustani \"urd\u0101 mu'all\u0101\"?\n2 The story is told at length in the Appendix to Din\u0101n\u0101tha's edition, after B\napparently. It is also given in a. The god is called simply Mah\u0101k\u0101la. By way\nof atonement for his offence, the king makes over to the god the land of M\u0101lava,\nwhich is half of the kingdom of Kanyakubja, and appoints the Param\u0101ra Rajputs\nto guard it.\n3 Sanskrit Jholik\u0101. Hofrath B\u00fchl (H.C. p. 41) translates Jholikavih\u0101ra by\n\"Wiegen-Tempel.\" I find that in Hindi there is a word \"Jhuli\" meaning \"a\nhammock or swinging-cot,\" while in Gujarati Jhodi means \"a child's cradle.\"\nAnother, and a still more romantic, account of the origin of this dynasty will be\nfound in the R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101 (Watson's edition), p. 19 and ff.\nhis mother by giving her the means of subsistence. He was brought up by the abbess V\u012bramat\u012b, and his spiritual preceptor gave him the name of Vanar\u0101ja. When he was eight years old he was entrusted with the duty of keeping off the mice that spoiled the offerings made to the god. He killed them with clods but was forbidden by the teacher, whereupon he said they must be got rid of by the fourth expedient. The teacher investigated his horoscope, and finding in it an arrangement of the heavenly bodies, which showed that he was destined for kingship, he came to the conclusion that he would be a powerful sovereign, and gave him back to his mother. He lived with his mother in a certain district, inhabited by a wild tribe, belonging to his maternal uncle, and as his maternal uncle lived the life of a bandit, he made raiding expeditions in all directions. Once on a time, in the village of K\u0101kara, he had dug a tunnel into the house of a merchant, and was stealing his wealth, when his hand slipped into a vessel of curds. He said to himself, \"I have eaten in this house,\" and so he left all the merchant's possessions there, and went out. The next day the merchant's sister \u0100r\u016bdev\u012b sent for him secretly in the night, out of love for her brother. She treated him kindly, giving him food and wealth; so he made her this promise, \"You, lady, shall at the ceremony of my coronation, place, as my sister, the ornament on my forehead.\" Then, on another occasion, as he was living the life of a freebooter, some of his bandit followers stopped in a certain district of the forest a merchant named Jamb\u0101, who, seeing those three thieves, broke two out of the five arrows that he had. They asked him the reason. He said, \"Since there are only three of you, the two surplus arrows are useless.\" When he had given this answer they pointed out to him a moving mark, which he hit with an arrow. They were so delighted that they took him with them to Vanar\u0101ja, who admired so much his warlike skill, that he said to him, \"At the cere-\n\n1 We learn from B\u00fchler's Homeacandra that the order of Yatis is recruited by the purchase of boys.

The Globe newspaper for February 4th, 1899, tells a similar story with regard to a bandit named \"Yakook Lais\" who flourished about the middle of the ninth century. \"The robber's eye was attracted by something small and glittering on the ground, which he took to be a diamond; picking it up he thoughtlessly conveyed it to his lips.\" The consequence was that the robber had to abandon the property of the governor of the province, as he had eaten his salt.\n7 Or, according to a, a bath, food and clothes.

Then a pa\u00f1cakula came from Kanyakubja in order to draw tribute from the land of Gujar\u0101t, which had been given by the king of that country to his daughter named Mahanik\u0101, by way of marriage portion, and he made the man named Vanar\u0101ja his arrow-bearer. After the pa\u00f1cakula had collected wealth from the country for six months, he set out to return to his own land, with twenty-four lakhs of silver dramas, and four thousand well-bred horses; but Vanar\u0101ja killed him at a gh\u0101\u1e6d named Saur\u0101stra, and lived in concealment for a year in a certain forest fastness, out of fear of his sovereign. Then he was desirous of building a capital, in order that he might be crowned as monarch of his own territory; so he began to look out for a heroic stretch of land, and as he was thus engaged, he was asked by a man named Anahilla, the son of Bh\u012br\u016by\u0101da S\u0101khada, who was comfortably seated on the edge of the Pipalut\u0101 tank, \"What are you looking for?\" Those ministers said, \"We are looking for a heroic stretch of land fit to build a city on.\" He answered, \"If you will give my name to the city that you build, I will show you the piece of land of which you are in search.\" Then he went near a J\u0101li-tree, and showed them as much land as a dog was chased over by a hare. There Vanar\u0101ja founded a city called Anahillapura, on the second day of the white fortnight of Vai\u1e63\u0101kha, on a Monday, in the 802nd year of the era of Vikram\u0101ditya, and had a palace built under that J\u0101li-tree. Then, a time pointed out by the astrologers as suitable for his coronation having arrived, he sent for that \u010cr\u012bdev\u012b, whom he had adopted as his sister, who lived in the village of K\u0101kara, and had the ornament on his forehead affixed by her, and had himself crowned king under the title of Vanar\u0101ja, being fifty-six years old.

The statement in the text derives some support from a recently discovered copperplate, which seems to belong to the eighth century. We learn from it that king Bh\u014dja of Mahodaya or Kanauj confirmed a land-grant made originally by his great grandfather Vatsar\u0101ja, and a letter of consent (anumati) of his grandfather N\u0101gabhata. The village, which was the subject of the grant (c\u0101sana) was \u010civ\u0101gr\u0101ma situated in the \u1e36endv\u0101 province of Gujar\u0101t.

P gives \"again and again forbade him.\" But a supports the text.} Thinking that he would in this way repay his kindness, the king caused to be built, in accordance with the command of the sage, the Caitya called Pa\u00f1c\u0101sara, adorned with an image of P\u0101r\u1e47avan\u0101tha,\\footnote{This is mentioned in the Suk\u1e5btasamkirtana of Arisi\u1e41ha.

In the same way also he had made a temple of Kanthevar\u012b in the immediate neighbourhood\\footnote{Perhaps we should omit the word \"Kanthevar\u012b\" with A and a, which give only dhavalaghe.

The list as given in B\u00fchler, MS. 296 (a), is nearly identical with that of A and B given in the Appendix to the Bombay edition (see B\u00fchler's Arisi\u1e41ha, p. 9, note 1). For the chronology of this dynasty I would beg to refer to p. 282 of the Chronology of India, by C. Mabel Duff (Mrs. W. R. Rickmers).} the whole life of Vanar\u0101ja was 109 years, 2 months and 21 days. In the 862nd year of the era of king Vikram\u0101ditya, on the third day of the white fortnight of \u0100\u1e63\u0101\u1e0dha, on a Thursday, in the nak\u1e63atra of A\u1e63vini, during the continuance of the lagna of Leo, took place the coronation of Yogar\u0101ja, the son of Vanar\u0101ja. He had three sons. Once on a time the prince named K\u1e63emar\u0101ja made this representation to the king. \"The ships of a king of a foreign country having been driven out of their course by a cyclone, have come from other tidal shores to Some\u015bvarapattana. Now there are in them a thousand spirited horses, and elephants a hundred and fifty in number, and of other things to the number of ten millions. All these will go to their own country through our country. If your Majesty will give the order, then I will bring them to you.\" When this proposal had been made to the king, he forbade the attempt. Immediately those three princes, thinking that the king was decrepit from old age, made ready an army in that very border district of their country, and in the stealthy manner of thieves intercepted that whole caravan and brought it to their father. The king was inly wroth, so\nhe kept silence, and did not extend to them any welcome, or any kind of civility. Prince K\u1e63emar\u0101ja, having made over all that wealth to the king, asked him whether their deed was honourable or dishonourable. Then the king said, \"If I were to say that it was honourable, I should be guilty of the crime of stealing my neighbour's goods, if I were to say that it was dishonourable, I should produce a feeling of irritation in your mind.\" Therefore I have come to the conclusion that silence is the preferable course. Now let me tell you why I forbade you to carry off the property of your neighbour, when you first asked me. When in foreign countries, kings praise the government of all sovereigns, they say scornfully that in the land of Gujar\u0101t there is a government of robbers. When we are informed of this and similar facts by our representatives in their reports, we are afflicted, because we do to a certain extent feel despondent on account of our ancestors. If this reproach attaching to our ancestors could be forgotten in the hearts of all men, then we also might attain the title of kings in all gatherings of sovereigns. But now, you princes, being greedy of a trifling gain, have furbished up anew that reproach of our ancestors.\" Then the king brought out his own bow from the armoury, and said, \"Let whichever among you is a strong man, bend this bow!\" When he had given this order, they all tried in succession with all their might, but not one of them was able to bend it. Thereupon the king strung it with ease, and said,\n\n\"Disobeying the order of kings, cutting off the salary of dependents,\nAnd deserting the society of wives, is called killing without weapons.\"\n\n\"It follows that, according to this teaching of the treatises on policy, you, my sons, are killing me without weapons, so what punishment will meet your case?\" Then the king starved himself, and ascended the funeral pyre after one hundred and twenty years had been accomplished. This king built the temple of the goddess Yog\u012bcvari. The reign of Yogar\u0101ja lasted for 17 years, 1 month and 1 day, as it came to an end in the 878th year of the era of Vikram\u0101ditya, on the 4th day of the white fort-\n\n---\n\n1 I find in a, ceta\u1e25su, in your minds.\n2 Here a gives sth\u0101napurusai\u1e25.

His reign came to an end in V.S.\\(^1\\) 881, on the 9th day of the white fortnight of K\u0101rtika, so this king reigned 3 years, 3 months and 4 days.\\(^2\\) In V.S. 898, on the 13th day of the white fortnight of Jye\u1e63\u1e6dha, on a Saturday, in the nak\u1e63atra of Hasta, in the lagna of Leo, the coronation of king K\u1e63emara\u1e47ja took place. That king's reign came to an end in V.S. 922, on Sunday the 15th day of the white fortnight of Bh\u0101drapada, after it had lasted for 38 years, 3 months and 10 days. The coronation of king C\u0101munda\u015bar\u0101ja took place in V.S. 935, on Monday the first day of the white fortnight of \u0100gyina, in the nak\u1e63atra of Rohini, in the lagna of Aquarius. His reign came to an end in V.S. 938, on a Monday, the 3rd day in the black fortnight of M\u0101gha, and so that king reigned 13 years, 4 months and 16 days. King \u0100k\u0101\u1e0dadeva ascended the throne in V.S. 938, on the 14th day of the black fortnight of M\u0101gha, on a Tuesday, in the nak\u1e63atra of Sv\u0101ti, in the lagna of Leo. This monarch caused to be built in the city of Karkar\u0101 the temple of \u0100k\u0101\u1e0de\u00e7v\u0101ri and Kanthe\u00e7v\u0101ri. His reign came to an end in V.S. 965, on the 9th day of the white fortnight of Pau\u1e63a, being a Wednesday, and so he reigned 26 years, 1 month and 20 days. Bh\u016bya\u00e7a\u1e0dadeva came to the throne in V.S. 990, on the 10th day of the white fortnight of Pau\u1e63a, on a Thursday, in the nak\u1e63atra of \u0100rdr\u0101, in the lagna of Aquarius. This king made the temple of Bh\u016bya\u00e7a\u1e0de\u00e7vara in Pattana and a rampart. His reign came to an end in V.S. 991, on the 15th day of the white fortnight of \u0100\u1e63\u0101\u1e0dha, and so he reigned 27 years, 6 months and 5 days. So there were seven kings of the C\u0101potkata dynasty, and their reigns extended over 190 years, 2 months and 7 days.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe elephants are ill to take service with, the mountains have lost their wings,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) V.S. stands for the era of Vikram\u0101ditya. In P I find only the figure 8. In other cases also that MS. gives only one figure.\n\n\\(^2\\) The text does not give the number of days.\n\n\\(^3\\) I now give for the purpose of comparison a translation of the list as given in the Appendix from MSS. A B. This agrees almost exactly with that of MS. No. 296 (a).\n\n\"This king reigned 35 years. K\u1e63emara\u1e47ja's reign began in V.S. 897, and he reigned 25 years. Bh\u016bya\u00e7a\u1e0da's reign began in V.S. 922, and he reigned 29 years. He caused to be built the temple of Bh\u016bya\u00e7a\u1e0de\u00e7vara in Pattana. In V.S. 951 Vairi\u015bin\u1e25a began to reign, and he reigned 25 years. In V.S. 976 Ratn\u0101ditya began to reign, and he reigned 15 years. In V.S. 991 S\u0101mantasi\u1e41ha began to reign, and he reigned 7 years. So there were seven kings of the C\u0101potkata race, and they came to an end in V.S. 998.\" The passage continues as in the printed text, but the verses are omitted, and the three brothers are made to return from pilgrimage during the reign of S\u0101mantasi\u1e41ha, instead of during the reign of Bh\u016bya\u00e7a\u1e0dadeva. So also in MS. 296 (a).\nThe tortoise is a \"laggard in love\" of his friends, and this lord of the snakes is double-tongued;\nThe Creator considering all this, produced, for the support of the earth,\nFrom the mouthful of water sipped at the evening ceremony, a brave warrior with waving sword-blade.\\(^1\\)\n\nThen three brothers by the same mother, sons of Mu\u00f1jaladeva, of the family of King Bh\u00fbyagad\u00e2, previously mentioned, named R\u00e2ja, Bija and Dan\u00e7aka, went on a pilgrimage to Soman\u00e2tha, and paid their adorations to him, and on their return were looking at King Bh\u00fbyadadeva, while engaged in the amusement of the man\u00e8ge.\\(^2\\) When the king gave the horse a stroke with the whip, the K\u1e63atriya named R\u00e2ja, who was dressed as a pilgrim, was annoyed with that cut, which was given inopportunely. He shook his head, and said, \"Alas! Alas!\" When the king asked him the reason of his behaviour, he praised the particular pace performed by the horse, considering it not inappropriate, and said, \"When you gave the horse a cut with the whip, you made my heart bleed.\" The king was astonished at that speech of his, and made over to him the horse to drive. He, seeing that the horse and groom were equally well-trained,\\(^3\\) praised them at every step. That conduct on his part made the king think that he was of high birth, so he gave him his sister, called Lil\u00e2dev\u00ee. After some time had elapsed from the beginning of her pregnancy, the lady died suddenly, and the ministers reflecting that if they did not take some steps the child would die also, performed the c\u00e6sarian\\(^4\\) operation, and took the child out of her body. Because he was born under the nak\u1e63atra M\u00fbla, he gained the name of M\u00fblar\u00e2ja. By his general popularity, due to his being resplendent as the newly-risen sun, and by his valour, he extended the sway of his maternal uncle. Under these circumstances, king Bh\u00fbyada,\\(^5\\) when intoxicated, used to have him crowned king, and used again to depose him when he became sober.\\(^6\\) From that time forth a \"C\u0101potkata's gift\" has\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In these lines Ca\u1e47lukya, the name of the dynasty, is derived from culuka. The elephants, the tortoise, and the king of the snakes support the earth. The mountains had their wings clipped by Indra. But the word \"wing\" also means \"party, following.\" Mountains, as well as kings, are spoken of as \"earth-supporters.\" The word m\u00e2ttagga, which means \"elephant,\" also denotes a Cand\u00e2la, or man of the lowest caste. Such people are ordained to serve, not to keep servants.\n\n\\(^2\\) B\u00fchl\u00e9r (Antiquary, Vol. VI. p. 181) rejects this story as an invention of the bards. The chronological difficulties are enormous. See also B\u00fchl\u00e9r's Arisimha, p. 10. Generally the king is called in the text Bh\u00fbyagad\u00e2, but here Bh\u00fbyada.\n\n\\(^3\\) I find in a, sadracyogayat\u00e2m.\n\n\\(^4\\) Thus this heroic king was execitus jam matre perempta, like Macduff.\n\n\\(^5\\) According to A and a, S\u0101mantasi\u1e41ha.\n\n\\(^6\\) I find in P, madamattena s\u0101mr\u0101jye 'bh\u012b\u1e63icaye amattenoth\u0101pyate ca.

Forbes (R.M. p. 37) describes the transaction in the following words, \"When he was arrived at mature age, S\u0101manta Singh, in a fit of drunkenness, caused the ceremony of his inauguration to be performed, but no sooner had the king recovered his senses, than he revoked his abdication of the throne.\"\nbecome a proverbial jest. Being disappointed every day in this way, he made ready his followers, and having been placed on the throne by his uncle when not master of himself, he killed him, and became king in reality. In the year 993 V.S., on the 15th day of the bright fortnight of the month \u0100\u015b\u0101\u1e0dha, being a Thursday, in the nak\u1e63atra of A\u1e63vini, in the t\u0101r\u1e47a of Leo, at twelve o'clock in the night, in the twenty-first year from his birth, M\u016blar\u0101ja was crowned king.\n\nOn a certain occasion, the king of the country of Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a came to the border of the land of Gujar\u0101t to attack M\u016blar\u0101ja. At the very same time arrived B\u0101rava, the general of the monarch that ruled over the Tilanga country. King M\u016blar\u0101ja, in deliberation with his ministers, laid before them the probability that, while he was fighting with one enemy the other would attack him in the rear. They said to him, \"If you throw yourself into the fort of Kanth\u0101, and tide over some days, when the Navar\u0101tra festival comes, the king of Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a will go to his capital of \u00c7\u0101kambh\u0101ri to worship his family goddess. In that interval we will conquer the general named B\u0101rava, and after him the king of Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a also.\" When he heard this advice of the ministers, the king said, \"Will not the disgrace of running away attach to me in the world?\" But they said,\n\n\"That the ram retires, the reason is that he may butt,\nThe lion also, in wrath, contracts his body, eager for the spring,\nWith enmity hid in their hearts, employing secret counsels,\nThe wise endure anything, making it of little account.\"\n\nPersuaded by this speech of theirs, M\u016blar\u0101ja threw himself into the fort of Kanth\u0101. The king of Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a passed the rainy season in the country of Gujar\u0101t, and when the Navar\u0101tra came on, he planted the city of \u00c7\u0101kambh\u0101ri on the very ground where his camp stood, and having brought his family goddess to the spot, began the Navar\u0101tra festival there. M\u016blar\u0101ja, hearing of that occurrence, perceived that his ministers were men of no resource, and developing in that crisis great intellectual\n\nthat time,\" says the Jaina annalist, 'the valuelessness of the gift made by a C\u0101potkata became proverbial.'\"\n\n1 I find in a, vi\u1e0dambyam\u0101no.\n2 I regard abhi\u1e63eka as practically equivalent to the European ceremony of coronation.\n3 Eastern R\u0101jput\u0101n\u0101 (B\u00fchler's H.C. p. 28).

Then he informed them of the time agreed upon, and placed them all near the camp of the king of the Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a country. On the day fixed, M\u016blar\u0101ja mounted a splendid female camel, and with its keeper traversed a great tract of country, and in the early morning unexpectedly entered the camp of the Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a king, and dismounting from the camel alone, sword in hand, said to the king's doorkeeper, \"Is the king at leisure at present? Inform your master that king Mular\u0101ja is entering the royal door.\" And with these words he pushed the servant away from the neighbourhood of the door with a blow of his strong arm, and himself entered the royal pavilion\u00b3 at the very moment that the doorkeeper was saying, \"Here is king Mular\u0101ja entering at the door,\" and sat down on the king's bed. The king, beside himself with fear, kept silence for a moment, and then shaking off his terror to a certain extent, he said, \"Are you really king Mular\u0101ja?\" Mular\u0101ja said in clear tones, \"Yes.\" The Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a king, hearing this utterance, was proceeding to make some remark suitable to the occasion, when those soldiers with whom it had been previously arranged, four thousand in number, surrounded that pavilion. Then Mular\u0101ja said to that king, \"When I was reflecting whether on this terrestrial globe there was any king heroic enough to stand against me in battle or not, you arrived exactly in accordance with my wishes. But as flies alight in swarms at meal-time, this general of the king of the land of Tilanga, who is named Tailapa, has come to conquer me, so I have come here to ask you to abstain from attacking me in the rear, and similar operations, while I am engaged in chastising him.\" When Mular\u0101ja had said this, the king replied, \"Since you, though a sovereign, are so careless of your life as to enter thus alone the dwelling of your enemy, like a common soldier, I will make peace with you until the end of my life.\" When the Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a monarch said this, Mular\u0101ja rejected his overtures, saying, \"Do not speak thus,\" and when invited to take food he refused the invitation out of contempt. He rose up, grasping his sword in his hand, and mounting that female camel, surrounded by that very body of troops, he fell upon the camp of the general B\u0101rava. He killed him, and captured his horses, ten thousand in number, and eighteen elephants, and while\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps we ought to read r\u0101ja with a and B for r\u0101ja.\n\u00b2 Here a has k\u1e63\u1e47alekhaka.\n\u00b3 Gurudara. The word occurs frequently in this book, and its meaning is self-evident.\nhe was encamping, the Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a king, having been informed of this fact by his spies, took to flight. That king caused to be built the vasahik\u0101\u00b9 of M\u016bl\u0101r\u0101ja in Pattana, and the temple of Mu\u00f1j\u0101ladevasv\u0101min. Moreover, he went continually every Monday on a pilgrimage to Some\u00e7varapattana\u00b2 out of devotion to the god \u00c7iva, and Soman\u0101tha was so pleased with his devotion that, after informing him of his intention, he came to the town of Ma\u1e47\u1e0dali. The king caused to be built there the Mule\u00e7vara temple, and as he went there every day in the ecstasy of his devotional fervour, the god Some\u00e7vara was so much pleased with the zeal of his worshipper, that he said, \u201cI will come to your capital and bring the sea with me,\u201d and thereupon he manifested himself in Apahillapura.\u00b3 As a proof that the sea had come with him, all the waters in all the reservoirs in that city became brackish. The king caused to be built in that city the Tripurusa temple. Then while he was looking out for an ascetic, who would be a fitting superintendent of that temple, he heard of an ascetic named Kantha\u00e7i, on the bank of the river Sarasvat\u012b, who, in taking nourishment after an Ek\u0101ntara\u2074 fast, was living on five mouthfuls of food not specially set apart for him. When the king went there to pay him his respects, the ascetic, who was suffering from a tertian\u2075 ague, transferred the ague to his patched garment. The king observing that, asked him how it came to pass that the garment trembled. The ascetic replied that he had transferred the ague to it, as otherwise he could not talk to the king. Thereupon the king said, \u201cIf you possess such power, why do you not get rid of the fever altogether?\u201d Then the ascetic repeated the following distich from the \u00c7ivapur\u0101na,\u2014\nLet my diseases come upon me, whatever they may be, that were earned in previous lives,\nI wish to go clear of debt to that supreme place of \u00c7iva.\n\nHe then went on to say, \u201cAs I know that action, the consequences of which have not been endured, is not exhausted,\u2076 how can I dismiss this fever?\u201d When he said this, the king asked him to accept the office of superintendent of the Tripurusa religious foundation. But the ascetic\n\n\u00b9 This word denotes an aggregate of buildings, including a temple and monastery, and corresponds to the term basi, i.e. basati, used by the Digambaras.

Of course the author uses Some\u00e7vara and Soman\u0101tha indifferently.\n\u00b3 The modern name is Aphilw\u0101d.\n\u2074 Professor Leumann informs me that I am justified in taking this to mean \u201cfasting every other day.\u201d\n\u2075 In P. the word trtiya is inserted above the line by a later hand.\n\u2076 MS. No. 298 (a) has the full quotation, \u201cAction, the consequences of which have not been endured, is not exhausted even in hundreds of crores of kalpas; we must of necessity suffer the consequences of the deeds that we have done, whether they be good, or whether they be evil.\u201d\nrefused in the following words, \"Since I know the maxim of the Sm\u1e5bti, which runs as follows,\u2014\nBy holding office for three months, by being abbot of a monastery for three days, hell is certain;\nBut if you wish to merit hell quickly, you have only to be a king's domestic chaplain\\(^1\\) for one day:\nwhy should I, who have crossed the ocean of mundane existence in the boat of ascetism, be drowned in a puddle!\"\\(^2\\) After this refusal, the king had a copper grant prepared and baked up in pastry, and gave it him in the hollow of a leaf, when he came to beg. He returned from the palace ignorant of that fact. Though the river Sarasvati had let him pass before, it was now in flood, and would not let him pass. He therefore began to think over his sins from the time of his birth, and at last to look carefully in order to find out if there was anything wrong with the food which he had just begged, and lo! his eye fell on the copper grant. Afterwards the king, knowing that the ascetic was angry, came to visit him, and while he was making deferential speeches to propitiate him, the ascetic observing that, as he must have taken the copper grant with his right hand, it could not be null and void, made over to the king his pupil, named Vayajalladeva. That Vayajalladeva said, \"If you will give me every day for the rubbing and cleansing of my body eight p\u0101las of genuine saffron and four p\u0101las of musk, and one pala of camphor, and if you will also give me thirty-two women, and a white umbrella with a grant of land,\\(^3\\) I will then accept the office of superintendent.\" The king agreed to all his conditions, and so he was installed in the office of chief of ascetics in the Tripurusa religious house. He became known by the name of Kajkaraula. Though he enjoyed luxuries in this style, he lived in unblemished chastity. Once on a time M\u016blar\u0101ja's wife proceeded to test his chastity at night. He made her a leper by striking her with betel, but on being propitiated, he restored her to health by having her rubbed with the unguents with which he anointed himself, and washed in the water that he had used for bathing.\\(^4\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) Perhaps there is an allusion to the fact that a king's domestic chaplain must be acquainted with sorcery. See Maurice Bloomfield's Introduction to the Hymns of the Atharva Veda, pp. xlvii., xlix. and lxi.\n\\(^2\\) Literally, \"enough water to fill the hole made by a cow's foot.\" Cowell and Thomas (Har\u1e63a Carita, p. 169), compare the use of \u03b2\u03bf\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd in Hesiod's Works and Days, 489.\n\\(^3\\) MSS. A, B, and P read gr\u0101sasa\u1e25it\u0101ni, which means \"with a grant of land.\" Forbes (R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, p. 186) expressly says so. It appears that the word gr\u0101s was at this time exclusively appropriated to religious grants, and Forbes refers to this particular instance. It is absurd to suppose that this luxurious gentleman would have been satisfied with one village. I therefore follow the MSS.\n\\(^4\\) This is a translation of the reading given by a and P, which runs as follows,\u2014nijodvartanirepan\u0101t sn\u0101noch\u012bstapay\u0101h-prak\u1e63\u0101lan\u0101cca.\nNow follows the story of the birth and death of L\u0101kh\u0101ka.\n\nLong ago, in a certain Param\u0101ra family, there was a king called Kirtir\u0101ja, who had a daughter named K\u0101malat\u0101. Once on a time, in her childhood, as she was playing with her female friends in front of a certain temple, they said to her, \"Choose a bridegroom.\" That K\u0101malat\u0101, having her sight dimmed with terrible darkness, chose a neatherd named Phulada, who was concealed by a pillar of the temple. Having chosen him without knowing exactly what she was doing, though she was subsequently during many years offered to many distinguished bridegrooms, yet she craved the permission of her parents to carry out her vow of fidelity to her first love, and owing to her persistency, succeeded in marrying him. Their son was L\u0101s\u0101ka; he was the king of Kaccha, and owing to the boon of Yaor\u0101ja, whom he had propitiated, he was altogether invincible. He repulsed eleven times the army of king M\u016blar\u0101ja. On one occasion, L\u0101s\u0101ka, while in the fortress of Kapilakoti, was besieged by king M\u016blar\u0101ja in person. Thereupon he kept waiting for the return of a follower named M\u0101heca, a man of great courage, whom he had sent to attack some place or other. M\u016blar\u0101ja, having ascertained that fact, occupied all the avenues by which M\u0101heca could return, and as he was coming back, having accomplished the errand on which he was sent, he was summoned by the king's soldiers to surrender his weapon. In order to aid the cause of his master, he did so, and going into the presence of L\u0101s\u0101ka, he prostrated himself before him. Then, when the time of battle came, L\u0101s\u0101ka uttered many words of wisdom, such as the following,\u2014\n\"In the place where he was not warmed with courage the contemptible Lak\u1e63a says,\n'When you sum up the days, how many are gained? Ten, perhaps, or eight;'\" and having his valour stimulated by beholding the magnanimous behaviour of his follower M\u0101heca, he engaged in a single combat with M\u016blar\u0101ja. M\u016blar\u0101ja, after three days' fight, considering that his foe was invincible, called to mind Some\u00e7vara, and a portion of Rudra came from that god and slew Lak\u1e63a. Then, Lak\u1e63a having fallen on the field of battle, king\n\n1 I read vipati for vipratipatti. This king is afterwards called Lak\u1e63a and L\u0101s\u0101ka. But s and kh are frequently interchanged in MSS.\n2 In the original \"Choose ye bridegrooms.\" The plural may be used out of deference, or perhaps the words were addressed to all present, though this does not quite agree with the text.\n3 In a and P I find Phulada.\n4 In the original \"that Lak\u1e63a.\"\n5 I read with a, M\u0101h\u012bc\u0101bh\u1e5btyoddh\u0101tav\u1e5bttidar\u00e7anena. I find the same reading in P, but M\u0101heca for M\u0101heca.\nThe text perhaps means \"by his follower M. by exhibiting magnanimous behaviour.\"\nM\u016blar\u0101ja touched with his foot the beard of his foe, which was waving in the wind, and was cursed by Lak\u1e63a\u2019s mother in the following words, \u201cYour race shall be afflicted with the disease of leprosy.\u201d\u00b9\n\nWho made a sacrifice of Lak\u1e63a in the fire of his valour,\nAnd so put an end to the drought, which withheld the tears of his wives,\nWho killed the Lak\u1e63a of Kaccha,\u00b2 when he rushed inconsiderately into an overlong net,\nAnd so showed a fisherman\u2019s skill in the midst of the sea of battle.\n\nHere ends the story of the birth and death of L\u0101\u015b\u0101ka.\n\nThe creeper of generosity first sprang up in the earth in Bali,\u00b3 who conquered the mighty;\nIt fixed its roots firmly in Dadhi\u00e7i;\u2074 in R\u0101ma it put forth shoots;\nIn the child of the sun\u2075 it spread into great and small branches; owing to N\u0101garjuna\u2076 it budded a little;\nIn Vikram\u0101ditya it blossomed; but in thy generous self, O M\u016blar\u0101ja, it was covered with fruits from its root.\nThe palaces of your enemies, bathed in the rainy season with the waters from the clouds,\nHaving taken, as it were, bundles of ku\u00e7a in the form of tufts of bent-grass that grow on them,\nHaving given the prescribed handfuls of water by means of the gushings from their spouts, seem in the masses of masonry that fall from their walls,\nTo be performing every day the ceremony of offering funeral-cakes to the ghosts of their\u2077 dead lords.\n\nSo this king enjoyed a reign free from enemies for fifty-five years. Once on a time, immediately after the evening ceremony of waving lights, the king gave some betel to the servant, and he, on receiving it in the palms\n\n\u00b9 Latiroga.

To this single dead person the ekodd\u012b\u1e63\u1e6daprad\u0101na is offered. For this ceremony only purifying grass, a pitcher of Arghya water and a ball of meal are required.\nof his hands, perceived worms in it. Hearing of that circumstance the king was seized with a desire for asceticism, and determined to abandon the world, and applied fire to the toe of his right foot, and performing the great gifts, such as the bestowal of elephants and so on, through a period of eight days.\n\nSubmissive to discipline only, he endured clinging to his foot\nA fire, with its smoke streaming up like hair;\nWhy mention any other brave warrior in comparison with him?\nSince\\(^1\\) he pierced even the circle of the sun.\\(^2\\)\n\nBeing praised with this and other panegyrics of the kind, he ascended to heaven.\n\nThen in 1050 V.S.\\(^3\\) on the 11th day of the white fortnight of \u00c7r\u0101vana, being a Friday, in the nak\u1e63atra of Pu\u1e63ya, in the lagna of Taurus, king C\u0101mu\u1e47\u1e0da ascended the throne. He caused to be built in Pattana the temple of the god Candan\u0101tha and the god C\u0101cine\u00e7vara. His reign came to an end in V.S. 1035, on the 5th day of the white fortnight of \u0100\u00e7vina, on a Monday. He reigned for thirteen years, one month, and twenty-four days. In 1065 V.S. on the 6th day of the white fortnight of \u0100\u00e7vina, on a Tuesday, in the nak\u1e63atra of Jye\u1e63\u1e6dha, in the lagna of Gemini, king Vallabha\u00f1ja assumed the sovereignty. That king, after investing the fortifications of Dh\u0101r\u0101, in the country of M\u0101lava, died of smallpox.\\(^4\\) He acquired two titles, \"Subduer of kings, as Ciiva subdued the god of Love,\"\\(^5\\) and \"Shaker of the world.\" In 1065 V.S., on the 5th day of the white fortnight of Caitra, his reign came to an end, so he reigned five months and twenty-nine days. In 1065 V.S., on the 6th day of the white fortnight of Caitra, being a Thursday, in the nak\u1e63atra of Uttara\u015ba\u1e45ha, in the lagna of Capricorn, his brother, named Durlabha\u00f1ja, was crowned king. He caused to be built in Pattana a palace with seven storeys, with a disbursement office, and an elephant-stable, and a clock-tower. Moreover, he had built for the welfare of the soul of his brother Vallabha\u00f1ja the temple of Madana\u00e7aykara, and he also had the tank of Durlabha excavated. He reigned twelve years in this fashion, and at the end of that time he established on the throne the son of his brother, who was called Bh\u012bma.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) For k\u0101 yad\\(^6\\), a reads k\u0101cid.

But as this king was very chaste (B\u00fchler's Arisi\u1e41ha, p. 11) and as a temple of Madana\u00e7aykara was built for his spiritual benefit, perhaps the r\u0101ja\\(^\u00b0\\) is superfluous. P supports the printed text.\nThis took place in 1077 V.S., on the 12th day of the white fortnight of Jyes\u1e6dha, on a Tuesday, in the nak\u1e63atra of A\u1e63vini, in the lagn\u0101 of Capricorn. Being himself desirous of travelling to Benares, as he longed to perform his devotions\\(^1\\) in a holy place, he reached the country of M\u0101lava. There he was called upon by king Mu\u1e47ja to give up the umbrella and chowries and the other insignia of royalty, and to continue his journey in the dress of a pilgrim, or to fight his way through. When this message was delivered to him, he perceived that an obstacle to his religious resolutions had arisen in his path, and after impressing the circumstance in the strongest way on king Bh\u012bma, he went to the holy place in the dress of a pilgrim and gained paradise. From that day forth there was rooted enmity between the kings of Gujar\u0101t and M\u0101lava. Now we will relate, as follows, the history of king Mu\u1e47ja, the ornament of the country of M\u0101lava, which presents itself naturally to our consideration at this point.\\(^2\\)\n\n**The History of King Mu\u1e47ja.**\n\nLong ago in that very country of M\u0101lava, a king named \u015ai\u1e41hadantabha\u1e6d\u1e6da, of the race of Param\u0101ra,\\(^3\\) as he was roaming about on his royal circuit, saw in the midst of a thicket of reeds a certain male child of exceeding beauty, that had been just born. He took it up as lovingly as if it were his own son, and made it over to his queen. The child's name was called Mu\u1e47ja\\(^4\\) with reference to his origin. After that, a son was born to the king, named \u015ai\u1e41dhala. As Mu\u1e47ja was attractive by uniting in himself all good qualities, the king wished to crown him king, and visited his palace for\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Or according to the reading of a, \"to fast.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) I now proceed to translate the account of these kings given in the Appendix from A and B. It agrees pretty closely with the readings of B\u00fchlcr's 296, which I call a.\n\n\"Then M\u016blar\u0101ja ruled for fifty-five years, as his reign began in 998 V.S. So far the history of M\u016blar\u0101ja. The reign of king C\u0101mu\u1e47\u1e0da began in 1053 V.S. and continued thirteen years. Then Vallabhar\u0101ja began to reign in 1066 V.S., and reigned for six months. Then in 1066 V.S. Durlabhar\u0101ja came to the throne and reigned eleven years and six months. [Then that king acquired the two titles of R\u0101jamadana\u015b\u0101kara and Jagajjhampanna.\u2014B.] That king made the tank of Durlabha in the city of Pattana. Afterwards, he placed on the throne his own son named Bh\u012bma.\" Arisi\u1e45ha tells us (B\u00fchlcr's Arisi\u1e45ha, p. 11) that Vallabha was called Jagajjhampanna. Whatever may be thought of the reason assigned for the enmity between the Param\u0101ras of M\u0101lava and the Ca\u1e45kukyas of Gujar\u0101t, there can be no doubt that it existed. B\u00fchlcr thinks that it was due to a race-feud, and the natural tendency to expansion of the two kingdoms. (Navas\u0101has\u0101\u1e45kacarita, p. 47.)\n\n\\(^3\\) See the Navas\u0101has\u0101\u1e45kacarita by B\u00fchlcr and Zachari\u0113, pp. 28, 29, 38, 37. Param\u0101ra, the Heros eponymos of this race, is said to have sprung from the flame of Va\u1e63i\u1e63\u1e6dha's sacrifice on Mount Abu. \u015ai\u1e41hadantabha\u1e6d\u1e6da is probably identical with the Siyaka of Padmagupta (op. cit. p. 39).\n\n\\(^4\\) Mu\u1e47ja and \u010cara are said to be names for the Saccharum Sara. B\u00fchlcr and Zachari\u0113 (op. cit. p. 40) reject the legend that Mu\u1e47ja was a foundling as unhistorical. Mu\u1e47ja was also called V\u0101kpatir\u0101ja II., Utpalar\u0101ja, Amoghavarsa, P\u1e5bthivallabha, and \u010crivallabha.\nthat purpose. Mu\u00f1ja, out of excessive bashfulness, hid his wife behind a cane sofa, and politely received the king with the customary prostration. The king, seeing that that place was apparently private, told him of the circumstances of his origin from the beginning, and said, \"I am so pleased with your devotion to me that I mean to pass over my son, and bestow the kingdom on you, but you must live on good terms with this brother of yours named Sindhala.\" Having given him this caution, he performed the ceremony of his coronation. Mu\u00f1ja, fearing that the story of his origin would get abroad, went so far as to kill his own wife. Then he conquered the earth by his valour, and for a long time enjoyed pleasures, while the great minister named Rudr\u0101ditya, a very prince of good men, looked after the affairs of his kingdom. During this stage of his life, he was devoted to a certain lady, and he used to mount a camel named Cirkall\u0101, and travel twelve yojanas, and return in a night. When he broke off his liaison with her, she sent him this dodhaka verse,\u2014\n\nMu\u00f1ja, the rope has fallen; you do not see it, mean wretch,\nThe clouds of \u0100\u015b\u0101dha are roaring, the ground will now be slimy.\n\nThat brother, named Sindhala, out of high spirit, disobeyed the orders of Mu\u00f1ja; accordingly he banished him from his kingdom, and so ruled for a long time. That Sindhala came to Gujar\u0101t, and established his settlement in the neighbourhood of the city of K\u0101c\u0101hrada.\n\nOnce, on the Diw\u0101li festival, he went out to hunt at night. He saw a boar roaming near a place where a thief had been put to death, and not observing that the corpse of the thief had fallen down from the stake on which he had been impaled, he pressed it down with his knee, and proceeded to aim an arrow at the boar. Thereupon that corpse called to him. He prevented it from touching his hand, and having pierced the boar with an arrow, was drawing it towards him, when the corpse rose up, uttering a loud laugh. Sindhala said to it, \"When you called to me, was it better that I should hit the boar, or attend to you and not hit the boar?\" When he had finished his speech, that ghost, which was seeking occasion against him, was so pleased with his boundless daring that it said, \"Ask a boon from me.\" Sindhala requested that his shaft might never fall useless to\n\n---\n\n1 I give what seems to be the sense, neglecting grammar. From this point I am able to use B\u00fchler's MS., No. 297, which I shall call \u03b2.\n2 This g\u0101th\u0101 is added by a later hand in P. It is not found in \u03b1 and \u03b2. For na, P reads nai.\n3 Half.\n4 The modern K\u0101sandra or K\u0101sandhra. (See B\u00fchler's Aris\u012btha, p. 25.)\n5 I read avabudhya madadattak prah\u0101ra iti. I find in \u03b1, avabudhya madattak, P has avabudhya matpralattak prak\u0101ra\u1e25, which may be translated \"or attend to you and let the boar strike me.\"\n6 I find in \u03b1 and \u03b2, ityabhihit\u0113.\nthe earth. But the ghost then ordered him to ask another boon. When he heard that, he said, \"May all fortune be in the power of my two arms!\" That ghost, astonished at his daring, said to him, \"You must go to the country of M\u0101lava. There king Mu\u00f1ja's destruction is drawing near, but you must go all the same; there the sceptre shall be in your line.\" Being thus sent by the ghost, he went there, and received from king Mu\u00f1ja a certain district, which brought him in revenue; but again displaying haughtiness, he had his eyes put out by Mu\u00f1ja, and was confined in a wooden cage. He begot a son named Bhoja.\n\nBhoja studied all the treatises on king-craft, and learnt the use of thirty-six weapons, and attained the further shore of the ocean of seventy-two accomplishments, and grew up distinguished by all the auspicious marks. At his birth, a certain astrologer, skilled in calculating nativities, gave in the following horoscope,\n\nFor fifty-five years, seven months, and three days\nKing Bhoja is destined to rule Dak\u1e63in\u0101patha with Gau\u1e0da.\n\nWhen Mu\u00f1ja learnt the meaning of these lines, he feared that, if Bhoja lived, his son would not inherit the kingdom, so he made over Bhoja to some men of the lowest caste, to be put to death. Then, at night, they perceiving that his form was conspicuous for beauty, felt pity for him, and trembled, and said to him, \"Call to mind your favourite deity.\" Then he wrote on a leaf the following stanza:\n\nM\u0101ndh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d, that lord of earth, the ornament of the Krta age, passed away;\nWhere is that enemy of the ten-headed R\u0101va\u1e47a, who made the bridge over the ocean?\nAnd many other sovereigns have there been, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and others, ending with thee, O king;\nNot with one of them did the earth pass away: I suppose, it will pass away with thee.\n\n1 So far from this being true it appears that Sindhula or Sindhur\u0101ja, as he is also called, ruled over M\u0101lava for a long time. (B\u00fchler and Zachari\u00e6, Navas\u0101has\u0101\u1e45kacarita, p. 45.) Sindhula was called Navas\u0101has\u0101\u1e45ka, because he undertook hundreds of daring deeds. He was succeeded by his son Bhoja. Our author uses throughout the form Sindhala.\n\n2 This story of the wicked uncle Mu\u00f1ja is now disproved. (B\u00fchler and Zachari\u00e6, Navas\u0101has\u0101\u1e45kacarita, p. 50.)\n\n3 I find in a, \"c\u0101stam gal\u0101,\" instead of \"y\u0101vad bhav\u0101n.\" The rendering will therefore be, \"Many other sovereigns, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and others, have perished.\" This is the reading followed by Forbes. (See R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, p. 65.) The stanza, as in the Bombay printed text, is No. 4831 in B\u00f6htlingk's Indische Spr\u00fcche. He refers it to the Subh\u0101sit\u0101r\u1e47ava.\nThis stanza he sent to the king by the hand of the executioners. When the king saw it, his mind was filled with regret, and he shed tears, and blamed himself as equal in guilt to the slayer of an embryo. Then the king had Bhoja brought by them with great respect, and honoured him with the dignity of crown-prince. Then as the king of the Tilinga country, named Tailapadeva, harassed Mu\u00f1ja by sending raiders into his country, he determined to march against him, though his prime minister Rudr\u0101ditya, who was seized with illness, endeavoured to dissuade him. The minister conjured him to make the river God\u0101v\u0101ri the utmost limit of his expedition, and not to advance beyond it, but he looked upon Tailapa with contempt, as he had conquered him six times before; so in his overweening confidence he crossed the river and pitched his camp on the other side. When Rudr\u0101ditya heard what the king had done, he augured that some misfortune would result from his headstrong conduct, and he himself entered the flames of a funeral pile. Then Tailapa by force and fraud cut Mu\u00f1ja's army to pieces, and took king Mu\u00f1ja prisoner, binding him with a rope of reed. He was put in prison and confined in a cage of wood, and waited upon by Tailapa's sister Mr\u1e47\u0101lavat\u012b, with whom he formed a marriage union. His ministers, who had arrived subsequently, dug a tunnel to where he was, and made an appointment with him. Once on a time, as he was looking at his own reflection in a mirror, Mr\u1e47\u0101lavat\u012b came up behind him, without his being aware what she was going to do, and seeing in the mirror the reflection of her own face wrinkled with old age near the face of the youthful Mu\u00f1ja, she was despondent on account of its extreme want of brightness. Mu\u00f1ja, perceiving this, addressed her in the following couplet,\n\nMu\u00f1ja says, O Mr\u1e47\u0101lavat\u012b, do not regret your vanished youth,\nThough the sugar has been pounded into a hundred fragments, still its powder is sweet.\n\nAfter addressing her in these words, he was eager to start for his own country, but unable to endure separation from her, and yet afraid to tell her the facts; and though she spoke to him again and again, he would not reveal the cause of his perturbation. She gave him food without salt to\n\n1 This was Tailapa II. of Kaly\u0101\u1e47a. (See the Navas\u0101has\u0101\u1e45kacarita by B\u00fchler and Zacharias, pp. 43, 44.) Rudr\u0101ditya was really the minister of Mu\u00f1ja or V\u0101kpatir\u0101ja II., as he is mentioned in his \u010c\u0101sana of 979 A.D. Mu\u00f1ja's death took place in one of the three years 994-96.\n2 Mu\u00f1ja.\n3 I owe this interpretation of p\u0101\u1e0dc\u0101tyair to Hofrat B\u00fchler. On page 153 of the printed text p\u0101\u1e0dc\u0101ty\u0101ns means \"that were left behind.\"\n4 Jarjara means literally \"broken,\" which sense harmonizes with the expressions used in the couplet that follows.\n5 Rasavat\u012b. According to the Kath\u0101 Ko\u1e63a, Nala was celebrated for his skill in preparing this dish.\neat, and food with too much salt, but he did not seem to recognize any difference in the taste, so she questioned him lovingly with a voice persistently charming, and at last he said, \"I am about to escape by this tunnel to my own country; if you will come there, I will crown you as my queen consort, and show you the fruit of my favour.\" When he said this, she answered, \"Wait a minute, while I fetch a casket of jewels.\" But she said to herself, \"As I am a middle-aged widow, when he reaches his own kingdom, he will cast me off\"; so she went and told the whole story to her brother the king, and then, in order to expose him to special scorn, had him bound with cords, and taken about to beg from house to house. As he was going round to the various houses, being full of despondency, he uttered the following speeches:\n\nThose men are terribly grieved in their hearts, who confide in a woman,\nWho, to captivate all minds, speaks courteously with words of love.\nBurnt and broken why did I not die? why did I not become a heap of ashes?\nMu\u00f1ja wanders about, tied with a string like a monkey.\n\nAnd such as these:\n\nI have lost my elephants and chariots, I have lost my horses; I have lost my footmen, servants have I none;\nSo, Rudraditya, sitting in heaven, invite me eager to join you.\n\nThen, on another day, he was taken to the house of a certain householder to beg. The householder's wife, seeing him with a little pot in his hand, made him drink buttermilk and water, but, having her neck uplifted with pride, forbade food to be given to him when he begged, so Mu\u00f1ja said to her,\n\nFoolish fair one, do not show pride, though you see me with a little pot in my hand,\nMu\u00f1ja has lost fourteen hundred and seventy-six elephants.\nDo not be distressed, O monkey, that I was ruined by her:\nWho have not been ruined by women, R\u0101ma, Ravana, Mu\u00f1ja, and others?\nDo not weep, O my jailor, that I have been made to wander by her,\nOnly by casting a sidelong glance, much more, when she drew me by the hand.\nIf I had had at first that discretion, which was produced too late,\nSays Mu\u00f1ja, O Mrp\u0101lavat\u012b, no one would have cast an obstacle in my path.\n\n1 I read k\u0101ty\u0101yani\u1e41 with \u03b1 and \u03b2.\n2 I translate the printed text, which omits many Prakrit verses contained in \u03b1.\n3 P and \u03b1 give p\u0101dekap\u0101ni.\n4 I take magkada to be a Pr\u0101krit form for marka\u1e47a; but P gives ma\u1e45daka.\nMu\u00f1ja, that treasury of glory, lord of elephants, king of the land of Avanti,\nThat creature who was long ago produced as the dwelling-place of Sarasvati,\nHe has been captured by the lord of Karn\u0101\u1e6da, owing to the wisdom of his ministers,\nAnd has been impaled on a stake: alas! perplexing are the results of Karma.\nDa\u00e7aratha, friend of the king of the gods, father of a portion of the might of the genius that issued from the sacrifice,\u00b9\nPerished on his bed, out of sorrow for separation from his son R\u0101ma.\nThe body of that king was placed in a cask of boiling oil,\u00b2\nAnd his funeral took place after a long time: alas! perplexing are the results of Karma.\nO man, bewildered with the darkness of wealth, why do you laugh at the man fallen into calamity?\nWhat is there strange in the fact that Fortune is not constant?\nDo you not see that in the water-wheel for irrigating fields\nThe empty buckets become full and the full buckets empty?\u00b3\nHis ornament is a terrible human skull;\nHis retinue Bh\u1e5bg\u016bn of shrivelled frame, and his wealth one aged bull;\nWhen this is the condition even of \u010civa, the chief of all the gods,\nOf what account, pray, are we poor wretches, when once adverse fortune has stood on our heads?\nThe sea for a moat! L\u0101\u1e45k\u0101 for a fortress! its commander the ten-headed king!\u2074\nWhen his fortunes fell, all that fell: do not despair, O Mu\u00f1ja.\n\nAfter they had led him about in this way to beg for a long time, they took him, by the king's order, to the place of execution, in order to carry out the sentence of death. They said to him, \"Call to mind your favourite deity.\" He exclaimed,\u2014\nFortune will go to Govinda; the glory of heroism to the house of the Hero;\nBut when Mu\u00f1ja has passed away, that storehouse of Fame, Sarasvat\u012b will be without a support.\u2075\n\n\u00b9 See R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a I. 15 (Gorresio's edition). R\u0101ma was born from Kan\u00e7aly\u0101, who received a portion of the g\u0101yasa, brought by a \"great being\" that issued from the flame of Da\u00e7aratha's sacrifice.\n\u00b2 See R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a II. 68.

The Hero is perhaps Mah\u0101v\u012bra or \u010civa. Sarasvat\u012b is the goddess of literature. Forbes (R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101,\nThese and other speeches of Mu\u00f1ja are to be looked upon as based on oral tradition. Then the king had Mu\u00f1ja put to death, and his head fixed on a stake in the courtyard of the palace, and by keeping it continually covered\\(^1\\) with thick sour milk he gratified his own anger.\n\nThen the ministers in the country of M\u0101lava, hearing of that event, placed on the throne Bhoja, the son of Mu\u00f1ja's brother.\n\nHere ends the first chapter of the Prabandhacint\u0101mani, entitled the Chronicle of the Kings, beginning with Vikram\u0101ditya.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nHISTORY OF BHOJA AND BH\u012aMA.\n\nNow, when king Bhoja was reigning in M\u0101lava, at that very time in this land of Gujar\u0101t, Bh\u012bma, of the Caulukya race, was ruling the earth.\n\nOnce on a time, at the close of night, Bhoja was meditating in his heart on the instability of fortune, and reflecting that his own life was uncertain as a wave; so, after the morning duties, he went into the pavilion of distribution, and began to bestow at will gold coins on petitioners summoned by his attendants. Then his prime minister, named Rohaka, considering that the king's virtue of generosity was really a vice, because it exhausted the treasury, and seeing no other means of putting a stop to that system of charity, after the general assembly\\(^2\\) was dissolved, wrote with chalk on the notice-board of the pavilion the following words:\n\n\"One should preserve wealth against the day of calamity.\"\n\nNext morning the king happened casually to observe these words, and as all his attendants denied that they had done the deed, he wrote up,\n\n\"How can calamities befall one who enjoys good fortune?\"\n\nWhen the king had written this, the minister wrote up,\n\n\"Sometimes, verily, Destiny is angry.\"\n\np. 68) quotes these lines, but follows the story given in a (B\u00fchler, MS. No. 296), according to which Mu\u00f1ja was hanged on a tree. B\u00fchler and Zachariae, while recognizing the legendary character of many of the incidents in this tale, point out that two Caulukya inscriptions boast of this execution. In a footnote they refer to J. F. Fleet, the dynasties of the Kanarese Districts, p. 40. (Navas\u0101hasapkacarita, p. 44.)\n\nThe B\u00fchler MSS. (\u03b1 and \u03b2) read vilipt\u0101n for vestit\u0101n.\n\nI think that in this work sarv\u0101vasara is equivalent to the Urdu phrase d\u012bv\u0101n-i-\u2018\u0101mm or dar\u0101r-i-\u2018\u0101mm. \"Notice-board\" is a conjectural translation of bh\u0101rapatta. In the Bhojaprabandha (p. 151 of the Bombay edition published at Kaly\u0101\u1e47a in 1896) the words are said to have been written up in the bedroom of the king.\nAfterwards the king saw it, and wrote up,\u2014\n\"Even a piled-up heap disappears.\"\u00b9\n\nWhen the king wrote up this before his eyes, the minister craved that his life might be spared, and confessed to what he had written. After that the king said, \"People like the prime minister are not able to restrain the elephant of my intention with the elephant-hook of knowledge,\" and so five hundred learned men obtained the grants they chose to ask for.\u00b2\n\n\"For indeed,\" continued the king, \"I have inscribed on my bracelet the following four \u0100ry\u0101 couplets:\u2014\n\nThis is the opportunity for doing good, as long as I possess this prosperity by nature uncertain,\nIn calamity, which must, of necessity, arise, how will there be a further chance of doing good?\nO full moon, whiten the worlds with the full wealth of your abundant rays.\nAccursed destiny, alas! does not suffer anything to remain long well established here.\nThis is the time for you, O lake, to aid suppliants continually with fertilizing streams;\nMoreover, this water is easy to obtain, since long ago the clouds arose.\nBut for a few days does the flood remain, though mounting high, with violent current,\nOnly the mischief, that it does, remains long, laying low the trees on the river-bank.\n\nMoreover,\n\nIf I have not given wealth to suppliants before the sun sets,\u00b3\nI do not know to whom that wealth will belong on the morrow.\n\nMuttering this couplet, which was composed by myself and made the ornament of my neck, like a favourite charm, how am I, O minister, to be entrapped by you, as by a ghost?\"\n\nThen, on a subsequent occasion, the king, while going round on his circuit, reached the bank of the river. He saw a certain Brahman, afflicted with poverty, who had forded the river, coming towards him, carrying a load of wood, and said to him,\u2014\n\"How deep is the water, O Brahman?\"\u2074\n\n\u00b9 The four inscriptions form a couplet.\n\u00b2 This passage is evidently corrupt. The printed text follows P pretty closely.\n\u00b3 I find in \u03b1, \u03b2 and P, yadunastamite. The sense is much the same as that of the printed text. Of course this couplet is in the Anustubh metre.\n\u2074 This is found in the Bhojaprabandha (Bombay edition of 1875, p. 143).\nThe Brahman answered,\u2014\n\"Knee-deep, O king.\"\nWhen he said that, the king continued,\u2014\n\"How have you been reduced to this state?\"\nThe Brahman replied,\u2014\n\"Not everywhere are there patrons like you.\"\u00b9\n\nThe present, which the king caused to be given to the Brahman, when he ended this speech, was entered in the charity account-book by the minister in the form of the following couplet:\u2014\n\nA lakh, a lakh, again a lakh, and ten furious elephants\nWere given by the king, pleased on account of the knee-deep utterance.\u00b2\n\nThen, on another occasion, at night, at the midnight hour, the king suddenly woke up, and seeing the moon recently risen in the sphere of heaven, he uttered this half-stanza, like the rising tide of his literary sea:\u2014\n\nThis, which within the moon has the appearance of a strip of cloud,\nPeople call a hare, but to me it does not wear that form.\n\nWhen the king had repeated this half-stanza again and again, a certain thief,\u00b3 that had entered the king's treasure-room by digging a tunnel into his palace, being unable to restrain the volume of his poetical inspiration, exclaimed,\u2014\nBut I think that the moon has its body marked with the brands of a hundred scars,\nEntrenched by the meteor-strokes of the sidelong glances of the fair girls afflicted by separation from your foes.\n\nWhen the thief had recited this half-stanza, the king had him put in prison by his guards. Then, at the dawn of day, he had the thief summoned to his hall of audience, and gave him a present, which the officer, who superintended his charity account-book, entered in the following stanza:\u2014\n\nTo this thief, who laid aside the fear of death, and composed\nThe two remaining lines;\u2074 the king, being pleased, gave\nTen crores of gold coins, and eight mighty elephants also,\nWounding mountains with the points of their tusks, while bees hum rejoicing in their ichor.\n\n\u00b9 These four speeches form a couplet.\n\u00b2 But C, D and P give prabh\u0101\u015b\u012bne, to the utterer of the knee-deep couplet. This is found in the Bhojaprabandha (Bombay edition of 1895, p. 148).\n\u00b3 This story will be found on page 184 of the Bhojaprabandha (Bombay edition of 1895).\n\u2074 I read with a and \u03b2, p\u0101dadvayak\u1e5bte. This reading is also found in the Bhoja-prabandha.\nThen, once on a time, while this book was being read, the king, considering himself munificent, exclaimed, as if overpowered with the demon of pride,\u2014\nI have done what no man has done, I have given what no man has given,\nI have accomplished what it is impossible to accomplish, my heart is not thereby grieved.\n\nWhile he was praising himself again and again in these words, a certain old minister, wishing to cut short his pride, brought to the king the charity account-book of Vikram\u0101ditya.\n\nIn the introductory section of the book, first of all was found this stanza, being the first in it:\u2014\nEight crores of gold, ninety-three tul\u0101s of pearls,\nFifty elephants excited with anger on account of the bees drunk with the smell of their ichor,\nTen thousand horses, a hundred fair ones wheedling with wiles,\nAll this that was given by the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du king by way of fine, was made over to a bard.\n\nThis stanza is to be known as the \"eight crores of gold\" stanza, on account of the nature of the remuneratory gift described in it.\n\nWhen king Bhoja had grasped the purport of this stanza, all his pride was crushed by the liberality of Vikram\u0101ditya, and after he had worshipped that account-book, he had it put back in its place.\n\nThen he was addressed by the warder in the following words, \"Your Majesty, the family of Sarasvat\u012b waits at your gate, eager for an interview with the king.\" The king gave this order, \"Introduce them quickly.\" Then the family entered in order of precedence. The servant said,\u2014\nThe father is learned, the son of the father also is learned,\nThe mother is learned, the daughter of the mother also is learned,\nThe wretched one-eyed maid-servant is also learned,\nKing, I think that this family is a mass of learning.\n\nThe king laughed somewhat at this farcical utterance of the warder, and gave to the eldest male of the party the following quarter of a couplet to complete:\u2014\n\"From the unsubstantial one should extract substance.\"\n\n1 I read gl\u0101gham\u0101nah with \u03b2.\n2 I omit four lines which have already been translated in the history of Vikram\u0101ditya. In Ms. \u03b2 they come before these lines. This stanza is found on page 181 of the Bhojaprabandha (Bombay edition of 1895).\nThe verse ran thus when completed:\u2014\n\nMunificence from wealth, truth from speech, so, too, fame and piety from life,\nDoing good to one's neighbour from the body; from the unsubstantial one should extract substance.\\(^1\\)\n\nThen the king gave to the son the following words:\u2014\n\nHim\u0101laya, in truth, the monarch of mountains;\nMen\u0101, with her limbs afflicted by bereavement, made.\n\nNo sooner had the king spoken than the son replied,\u2014\n\nBy the fire of thy valour was melted\nHim\u0101laya, in truth, the monarch of mountains;\nMen\u0101,\\(^2\\) with her limbs afflicted by bereavement, made\nA bed of young shoots the refuge of her body.\n\nWhen the stanza had been thus completed, the king said to the wife of the eldest son:\u2014\n\n\"Which am I to feed with milk?\"\n\nWhen the king gave her this quarter of a couplet to fill up, she filled it up as follows:\u2014\n\nAnd if R\u0101vana, in truth, was born with ten mouths, but one body,\nHis mother gaping with astonishment must have thought, \"Which am I to feed with milk?\"\n\nThen the king gave the following quarter of a couplet to be completed:\u2014\n\n\"On whose neck am I to hang?\"\n\nThe maid-servant\\(^3\\) thus filled it up:\u2014\n\nA certain lady, enraged with neglect, drove away her wretched husband,\nMy friend, a strange thought did I think, \"On whose neck am I to hang?\"\n\nThe king forgot to test the daughter, but rewarded them all, and then dismissed them. Then the king, as he was walking about on the floor of the upper room of his palace, holding up an umbrella, during an audience at which everybody was allowed to be present,\\(^4\\) was reminded by the warder of what had happened to the daughter. The king said to her, \"Speak.\" Then she uttered this stanza:\u2014\n\n\\(^1\\) This stanza is No. 2750 in B\u00f6htlingk's Indische Spr\u00fcche. He finds it in the S\u0101hityadarpana and the Subh\u0101sit\u0101r\u1e47ava.\n\\(^2\\) The wife of Him\u0101laya and mother of P\u0101rvat\u012b.\n\\(^3\\) I read s\u0101 with a and \u03b2.\n\\(^4\\) Here again I take sarv\u0101vasara as equivalent to d\u012bw\u0101n-i-\u02bf\u0101mm.\nO king Bhoja, light of your race, crest-jewel of all kings,\nIt is right that you should walk about in this world with an umbrella, even at night,\nLest, by beholding your face, the moon should become abashed with shame,\nAnd this reverend saint Arundhati\u00b9 should be tempted to unchastity.\n\nAs soon as she had said this, the king, having his mind captivated by her beauty, married her, and made her one of his wives. Then, on another occasion, king Bhoja, though a league of friendship\u00b2 subsisted between him and Bhima, being desirous of breaking the peace, and also wishing to test the cleverness of the inhabitants of the country of Gujar\u0101t, put this g\u0101th\u0101 into the hand of a diplomatic agent,\u00b3 and sent it to Bhima:\n\nThe lion who with ease cleaves the foreheads of mighty elephants, the progress of whose valour is published abroad,\nHas no war with the deer, and yet cannot be said to have peace with him.\n\nBhima was asked to send a g\u0101th\u0101 in answer to this, but considered all the compositions, which the great poets submitted, as so many fruitless efforts, until at last this g\u0101th\u0101 came:\n\nBhima was created on the earth by Destiny as the destroyer of the sons of Andhaka,\nHow can he, who made no account of a hundred foes, make account of thee who art but one?\u2074\n\nThe king sent this mind-astonishing g\u0101th\u0101, which was composed by Govind\u0101c\u0101rya, to king Bhoja, by the hand of that minister, and thus avoided a breach of peaceful relations.\n\nOn a certain occasion,\u2075 a certain man, introduced by the warder, entered the hall of audience, and said to Bhoja,\u2014\nThe mother is not satisfied with me nor with the daughter-in-law, the daughter-in-law neither with the mother nor me,\nI for my part neither with one woman nor the other; tell me, O king, whose is this fault?\u2076\n\n\u00b9 The wife of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha (or Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha) and one of the Pleiades. This stanza is found on pp. 163, 164 of the Bhojaprabandha (Bombay edition of 1895).\n\u00b2 Yamalapitresu.\n\u00b3 S\u0101ndhivigr\u0101hika. Forbes (R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, p. 188) tells us that at the courts of their more powerful neighbours, the kings of Aphilw\u0101r\u0101 were represented by accredited diplomatic agents, called \"S\u0101ndhivigr\u0101hik\" or makers of peace and war, whose duty it was to keep them informed of foreign affairs\u2014a task performed also in another manner by persons called \"Sth\u0101napurush,\" men of the country or spies, who were probably unrecognized by their employers.\n\u2074 I read with B, a and \u03b2, Bh\u012bma puhav\u012b, omitting ya.\n\u2075 Here P gives sarv\u0101vasare, which, as I have already pointed out, means an audience, open to all people, of whatever rank.\n\u2076 The Bombay edition of the Bhojaprabandha (Kaly\u0101na, 1895) reads kupyati for tusyati in this couplet, which is found on page 252.\nAs soon as the king heard this, he caused a present to be given to him, which chased away the poverty that had beset him from his birth. Then on a certain night in the winter season, as the king was roaming about in search of adventures,\u00b9 he heard a certain man in front of a certain temple repeating the following stanza:\u2014\n\nWhile I am shrivelled up\u00b2 with cold like the fruit of the bean, and plunged in a sea of anxiety,\nThe fire of my belly pinched with hunger, which blows and parts my lips, is appeased,\nSleep has abandoned me, and gone somewhere far away, like an insulted wife,\nThe night does not waste away, like fortune bestowed on a worthy recipient.\n\nAfter the king had got through the latter part of the night, he summoned that man in the morning, and said to him, \u201cHow did you endure the great severity of the cold during the rest of the night?\u201d And then he reminded him of the line:\u2014\n\n\u201cThe night does not waste away, like fortune bestowed on a worthy recipient.\u201d\n\nThe man answered, \u201cYour Majesty, by virtue of the three thick garments\u00b3 I manage to hold out against the cold.\u201d When the king asked him again, \u201cWhat is that triad of garments\u2074 that you speak of,\u201d he repeated the following couplet:\u2014\n\nAt night the knee, by day the sun, the fire at both twilights,\nKing, I endured the cold by the help of knee, sun and fire.\n\nWhen he said this, he was made happy by the king by the gift of three lakhs. The man continued,\u2014\n\nBy thee, thus imprisoning thyself\u2075 now by the way of munificence,\nBali, Karna and others have been released from their gaol in the minds of the good.\n\n\u00b9 Forbes has some interesting remarks on this subject. See page 191 of the R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, Watson's edition.\n\u00b2 This translation is conjectural. Perhaps we ought to read uddh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6ditasya with D. This word is said to mean \u201cshivering.\u201d Monier-Williams tells us that uddh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6ditasya is a corruption of uddh\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6dasya. In the Bhojaprabandha (page 181 of the Bombay edition of 1885) this stanza begins with \u0100tman\u0101hyusitasya.\n\u00b3 Here I read with a, tric\u0113t for tric\u0113t\u012b. P has may\u0101dya for may\u0101.\n\u2074 Here I read v\u0101str\u0101rayi with a, or perhaps it would be better to read tric\u0113t again, taking into consideration the fact that in Jaina MSS. it is difficult to distinguish c from v.\n\u2075 I read with a and P, \u0101tm\u0101namah\u014d for m\u0101namah\u014d. I find \u0101tm\u0101nam in the corresponding passage in the Bhojaprabandha (Bombay edition, p. 183), but the rest of the stanza differs so much that it throws no light on this.\nWhile the man was thus pouring forth the full volume of his literary flood,\u00b9 the king, who felt unable to give an adequate present in return for it, induced him by his entreaties to stop. On another occasion, when the king was mounted on an elephant, and was going round the town on his royal circuit,\u00b2 he saw a certain beggar picking up grains that had fallen on the ground. The king uttered the first half of a half-stanza,\u00b3\u2014\n\nWhat is the use of those people being born who are not able to fill their own stomachs?\n\nThe beggar continued,\u2014\nIndeed there is no use at all of those people being born, who do not help others, though well able to do it.\n\nWhen he had ended, the king continued,\u2014\nO mother, do not produce such a son as is intent on begging from his neighbours!\n\nAfter this speech, the beggar rejoined,\u2014\nDo not, O earth, do not give support to those who refuse their neighbours' requests!\n\nWhen he had said this, the king said, \"Who are you?\" He replied, \"I here am R\u0101ja\u00e7ekhara, who, having been prevented by the chief men of the city from obtaining in any other way an entrance into your coterie of various learned men, have striven by this trick to enjoy an interview with your Highness.\" When he had been favoured with great gifts, suitable to him, he said,\u2014\nIn that lake in which the frogs, lying in the holes, were as if dead, the tortoises had gone into the earth,\nThe sheaf-fish had swooned again and again, from rolling on the broad slab of mud,\nIn that very lake a cloud, rising out of season, has wrought such a mighty work,\nThat herds of wild elephants drink water in it, immersed up to their foreheads.\u2074\n\nThis is the utterance of R\u0101ja\u00e7ekhara called \"The cloud out of season.\"\nIn a certain year, owing to a failure of rain, it became impossible to obtain\n\n\u00b9 P has \"odg\u0101roparastai\".\n\u00b2 I read with a, r\u0101jap\u0101\u1e6dik\u0101y\u0101\u1e41.\n\u00b3 Here the text reads ardha\u015baiv\u0101. But I have substituted ardha\u015bakav\u012bt\u0101.\n\u2074 This stanza is found on page 155 of the Bhojasprabandha (Bombay edition of 1895).\ngrain and grass, and king Bh\u012bma was informed by his representatives\\(^1\\) that king Bhoja was for this very reason preparing an invasion. This made him anxious, and he gave orders to a diplomatic agent named D\u0101mara, to this effect, \"Whatever we may have to pay by way of fine, king Bhoja must be prevented from coming into this country during the present year.\" On receiving this order, he repaired to the court of king Bhoja. Now he was exceedingly ugly, but skilled in penetrating the minds of others. King Bhoja said to him,\n\n\"Tell me how many messengers are there, belonging to your king, holding the office of diplomatic agent?\"\n\nThe ambassador replied,\n\n\"Many like me, O king of M\u0101lava, they are there of three degrees,\nThey are sent in order, according as the foreign court is considered to be\nof low, medium, or excellent quality.\"\n\nWhen he gave this answer with a suppressed smile, the king of Dh\u0101r\u0101\nwas pleased with him.\n\nKing Bhoja, astonished at the cleverness of his speech, had the drums\nbeat as a signal for beginning the march towards Gujar\u0101t. At the time\nof beginning the march, a bard said,\u2014\n\nThe Cola king enters the bosom of the sea, the Andhra king repairs to a\nhole in a mighty mountain;\nThe king of Karn\u0101\u1e6da does not wear his turban, the king of Gujar\u0101t frequents\nthe mountain torrents;\nCedi, that warlike monarch, flickers with weapons; the king of Kanyakubja\nis here bent double;\nO Bhoja, all the kings are distracted with the burden of the fear of the\nadvance of thy army only.\nOn the floor of thy prison, the angry wrangle about a place on which to\nlay their beds,\nHas increased in the night among these mutual rivals, who thus dispute,\n\"The king of Ko\u1e45kana sleeps in the corner, L\u0101\u1e6da near the door, Kalinga in\nthe courtyard;\nYou are a new arrival, Ko\u1e63ala; my father also used to abide on this level\nspot.\"\n\nAfter the king had ordered the drum for the advance to be beaten, a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Sth\u0101napurusai\u1e25*. Forbes (R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, p. 188) gives it as his opinion that these\n\"men of the country\" were spies. But we shall soon come to a passage which\nshows that one of the representatives of the Gujar\u0101ti sovereign in M\u0101lava declared\nhimself to be a native of Gujar\u0101t. The passage is found on page 108 of the\nSanskrit printed text.\ndramatic performance, taking off all the kings, was enacted. In it a certain angry king tried to make Tailapa, who, being in the prison, had established himself in a comfortable place, get up, and was thus addressed by him, \"I have an ancestral holding here, why should I leave my own home at the bidding of a new-comer like you?\" Thereupon the king turned to D\u0101mara with a laugh, and praised the display of wit in the play, but received from him this reply, \"King, the display of wit is, no doubt, extraordinary, but out on the ignorance that this actor shows with regard to the history of the hero of the tale, for this mighty king Tailapadeva is recognized by having the head of king Mu\u00f1ja fixed on a stake!\" When D\u0101mara said this before all the court, Bhoja was so stung by his sarcasm, that, without making any further preparation, he proceeded to march at once towards the country of Tilanga. Then, hearing that a very strong force was coming under the banner of Tailapadeva, Bhoja was very anxious, and at this conjuncture D\u0101mara came to him, and showing him a forged rescript from the king, informed him that Bh\u012bma had reached Bhogapura. By that intelligence brought by D\u0101mara, which was like the sprinkling of salt on a wound, king Bhoja was exceedingly cast down, and he said to D\u0101mara, \"You must, by hook or by crook, prevent your master from coming here during the present year.\" When the king said this over and over again in plaintive accents, D\u0101mara, who knew how to suit himself to every conjuncture, took a male and female elephant from him by way of present, and sent them to Bh\u012bma in Pattana to appease him.\n\nWhen king Bhoja was listening to the reading of a treatise on law, he heard of the R\u0101dh\u0101vedha of Arjuna. He reflected, \"What is difficult to practise?\" And so he himself, by dint of constant practice, succeeded in performing the world-famed R\u0101dh\u0101vedha, and then proceeded to illuminate the markets of the city; but an oilman and a tailor out of contempt would have nothing to do with his rejoicings, and then justified their refusal to the king. The oilman stood in the upper room of a house, and from it poured a stream of oil into a narrow-mouthed earthen vessel that was on the ground; and the tailor stood on the ground, and on the point of an uplifted thread caught the eye of a needle, that was thrown down from above, and so threaded the needle. Having shown in this way their skill acquired by practice, they said to the king, \"If your Majesty possesses the\n\n---\n\n1 I read nata\u015bya for bha\u1e6da\u015bya. P has dhig nata\u015bya, a, dhik nata\u015bya, B, dhigdhana-tasya.\n2 This is said to mean a particular attitude in shooting, but I think it must mean a feat similar to that performed by Odysseus. R\u00f6htlingk and Roth, in their W\u00f6rterbuch in k\u00fcrzerer Fassung, give for R\u0101dh\u0101vedhin \"etwa nach der Scheibe schiessend.\" The meaning will, to a certain extent, appear in the sequel. Literally translated it means \"the cleaving of R\u0101dh\u0101.\"\n3 P gives bh\u0101misthita \u015br\u0101dheinukhak\u1e5btatatantramukhe, but also vivare.\nrequisite skill, then do what we have done.\u201d In this way they cut short the king\u2019s pride.\n\nKing Bhoja, I know why you performed the cleaving of R\u0101dh\u0101,\\(^1\\) It was because your Majesty could not tolerate an opposite to Dh\u0101r\u0101.\n\nIn these words he was praised by the learned, and being desirous of laying out a new city, he had the drum beaten. Then a hetaera, named Dh\u0101r\u0101, who, with her husband, named Agnivet\u0101la, had gone to L\u0101jk\u0101, and seen the way in which that town was laid out, and returned, requested that her name might be given to the new city, and making over to the king an accurate plan of L\u0101jk\u0101, she laid out the town of Dh\u0101r\u0101.\n\nOn a certain day, the king was wandering about in his town, after the evening general assembly, and he heard a certain Digambara reciting the following g\u0101th\u0101;\u2014  \n\nThis birth has been a failure,\\(^2\\) I have not broken the successful sword of the warrior;  \nI have not listened to the shrill drums;\\(^3\\) I have not clung to the neck of a fair one.\n\nThe next morning the king summoned him, and taking the opportunity of reminding him of the fact that he had uttered these words in the night, he asked him what ability he possessed. The Digambara set forth his valour in the following couplet,\u2014  \n\nKing, when the Dip\u0101li festival has taken place, and the ichor of elephants flows,  \nI will reduce under one umbrella Gau\u1e0da and Dak\u1e63in\u0101patha.\n\nThereupon he was appointed commander-in-chief. King Bh\u012bma having marched\\(^4\\) to conquer the country of Sindh, the Digambara arrived with all the officers and sacked the august city of Anahilla, and having caused cowries to be sown at the gate of the clock-tower of the palace, extorted a record of victory. From that day forth it became a common saying in that land that such and such a thing has been stolen by Kulacandra. He returned to the country of M\u0101lava with that record of victory, and related the whole story to king Bhoja. He said to him, \u201cWhy did you not have charcoal sown? The taxes of this country shall go to the land of Gujar\u0101t.\u201d This is what king Bhoja, the neck-ornament of Sarasvat\u012b, said to him.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) R\u0101dh\u0101vedha. Of course, if the syllables of R\u0101dh\u0101 are inverted we obtain Dh\u0101r\u0101.\n\n\\(^2\\) P gives nagg\u0101h\u0101\u1e41. I take it to be the Sanskrit nigrah\u0101\u1e41.\n\n\\(^3\\) P gives tikkh\u0101\u1e41 turiya na m\u0101niy\u0101, but \u03b1 and \u03b2 give tirak\u0101 (sic). The anusv\u0101ra in P is not very clear. For gor\u012b see Hemacandra (ed. Pischel) IV. 395, 4.\n\n\\(^4\\) P, \u03b1 and \u03b2 read vy\u0101prte, being engaged in conquering.\nOne night, Bhoja was sitting in the rays of the moon, with Kulacandra near him, and looking at the circle of the full moon, he repeated these two lines,\u2014\nThose who find the night pass as quickly as a moment in the society of the beloved,\nFind, when separated, the cold-rayed moon as scorching as a meteor.\n\nWhen the poet-king had in these words uttered the half\\(^1\\) of a stanza, Kulacandra continued,\u2014\nBut I have neither a beloved nor separation; therefore to me deprived of both these things\nThis moon shines like a mirror, neither hot nor yet cold.\n\nAfter Kulacandra had said this, the king bestowed on him a beautiful damsel.\n\nThen the diplomatic agent, named D\u0101mara, came from the country of M\u0101lava, and by describing the court of Bhoja, created great astonishment. Then he returned to M\u0101lava, and by describing Bh\u012bma as possessing extraordinary beauty, he made\\(^2\\) Bhoja excited with a longing to see him; so Bhoja entreated him, saying, \u201cBring him here, or take me to his capital;\u201d and Bh\u012bma, who wished to see the court of Bhoja, used exactly the same language to him. So, in a certain year, the resourceful D\u0101mara, conveying a great present, and taking with him king Bh\u012bma, disguised as a Brahman, and officiating as a betel-box bearer, went into the court of Bhoja, and made his salutation. When Bhoja began to broach the subject of his bringing king Bh\u012bma, D\u0101mara said, \u201cKings are independent persons, and who can force them to do what they do not wish to do?\\(^3\\) But, anyhow, some slaves must not be despised by your Majesty.\u201d\\(^4\\) After he had said this, Bhoja asked what the age, colour, and form of Bh\u012bma were like, and looked round at those people who were present in court. Then D\u0101mara pointed out the betel-box bearer, and said to Bhoja, \u201cKing,\n\nHe has the same form, the same colour, the same beauty, and the same age;\nThe difference between him and the king is that between glass and a wishing-jewel.\u201d\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I read ardhe, but a has tenoktam which comes to the same. P gives iti ardha-kavina tenokte. See page 74 of the printed text, where ardha-kavina occurs.\n\n\\(^2\\) The grammar in this passage seems to be defective. I have given what I suppose to be the sense.\n\n\\(^3\\) I read with a and \u03b2, sv\u0101mino nabhimatam. P gives nabhimatam, which gives the same sense.\n\n\\(^4\\) Perhaps the reading of \u03b2, servatheyam kad\u0101c n\u0101vadh\u0101rasya is correct. The same reading is found in a except that \u201cin is given for \u201cyam. This will mean \u201cYou must certainly not entertain this chimerical hope.\u201d P has this reading, but kad for kad\u201d. However, the reading of the printed text gives a tolerable sense.\nWhen he said this, king Bhoja, who was a very emperor among discerning men, looked at the distinguishing marks of the betel-box bearer, and then, with fixed gaze,\\(^1\\) reflected that such a person must be a king. Then the diplomatic agent sent the betel-box bearer to bring the articles that composed the present. While the things were being brought, a great deal of time was taken up by D\u0101mara's protracting matters by describing their advantages, and dilating on other subjects. At last the king said to him, \"How much longer is this betel-box bearer going to linger?\" Then D\u0101mara told him plainly that he was Bh\u012bma. Immediately the king set about getting ready troops to pursue him. But D\u0101mara said to him, \"At the end of every twelve yojanas there are horses attached to a horse-litter, and female camels\\(^2\\) that go a yojana in twenty-four minutes, so, as Bh\u012bma is getting over the ground with all these appliances, how are you likely to catch him?\" When D\u0101mara had made this representation, Bhoja remained for a long time rubbing his hands.\n\nThen king Bhoja, having been continually hearing of the literary merit and virtue of the pandit M\u0101gha, out of eagerness to see him, kept continually sending royal invitations, and so brought him from the town of \u010cr\u012bm\u0101la in the cold weather season. He entertained him with the utmost respect, with delicious dishes and other luxuries, and after that showed him entertainments fit for a king, and then, at night, after the ceremony of waving lights before the idol was concluded, he made the pandit M\u0101gha recline on a bed near his own, and exactly like it, and he gave him his own rug, and after conversing pleasantly with him for a long time, he slept comfortably. In the morning the king was aroused by the sound of the auspicious drums, and then the pandit M\u0101gha asked him for leave to return home. The king, with his heart full of astonishment, asked him how he had enjoyed his food and coverlets in the day that had passed, but he said, \"Let us not discuss the question as to whether the food was good or bad,\" but represented that he was exhausted with the weight of the rug.\\(^3\\) The king, who was vexed, at last, with difficulty, consented to his departure, and so the pandit M\u0101gha, being accompanied by the king as far as the city park, and honourably dismissed, returned to his own home. M\u0101gha, before he left, entreated\\(^4\\) the king to honour him with the favour of a visit to him in his own house. Some days after, king Bhoja, eager to see the apparatus of M\u0101gha's wealth and luxury, went to the town of \u010cr\u012bm\u0101la.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) P and \u03b2 give ni\u00e7calad\u1e5bc\u0101\u1e41 n\u1e5bpa\u1e41. This would mean, I suppose, that D\u0101mara, remarking that Bhoja was looking intently at Bh\u012bma, sent the latter away. In any case, the grammar is defective.\n\n\\(^2\\) MS. \u03b1 has kariny\u0101h (female elephants), \u03b2, karibhyah.\n\n\\(^3\\) I read citarak\u1e63\u0101bh\u0101rena with P, \u03b1 and \u03b2, instead of citabh\u0101rena, which is, perhaps, a misprint.\n\n\\(^4\\) P, \u03b1 and \u03b2 give vy\u0101napya.\nThe pandit M\u0101gha won his heart by showing him appropriate respect in going to meet him and paying him other attentions, and the king found that there was room for himself and his army in M\u0101gha's stables. But he himself went to pandit M\u0101gha's palace, and observed that the floor of the passage leading to it was inlaid with gold. After he had bathed, he put on a clean garment, standing on the floor of the god's shrine, which was made of a pavement of crystal and emerald in such a way as to resemble water full of the branching stems of aquatic plants. The commencement of the rite was immediately announced to him by the family priest, and after the worship of the god was over, and the mantra ceremony had come to an end, the king tasted the savoury food, which was brought in at meal-time. His mind was surprised by all kinds of accessory delicacies, such as fruits, which came from foreign countries, or were produced out of their due season. After he had eaten to his fill savoury food remarkable for well-seasoned milk and rice, at the end of the meal he went up into the upper chamber, and was a spectator of poems, tales, histories, and plays, not seen or heard before. Though it was the cold season, there was artificially produced a sudden semblance of terrible heat, so that the king had to put on white transparent garments, and being fanned by servants holding palm-leaves in their hands, and having his clothes anointed with much sandal-wood ointment, he passed that night in delightful sleep, as if it had been but a moment. In the morning he was waked by the sound of conchs, and was informed by the pandit M\u0101gha of the fact that the hot season had suddenly appeared in the middle of the cold weather. He spent some days, as suited the season, full of astonishment, and then asked leave to depart to his own country, and after bestowing on M\u0101gha all the merit of the new Bhojasv\u0101min temple, that he was about to build himself, he set out for the country of M\u0101lava.\n\nNow, on the day of his birth, M\u0101gha's father had his horoscope cast by an astrologer, and the astrologer stated that at the beginning of his life his prosperity would be continually increasing, but at the end he would lose all his opulence, and a disease of swelling would to a certain extent manifest itself in his feet, and so he would die. When the astrologer said this, M\u0101gha's father was desirous of counteracting that predicted course of the planets by an accumulation of wealth, and so, having reflected that in the life of a\n\n---\n\n1 Or glass, according to \u03b1 and \u03b2, which have k\u0101cabaddh\u0101m.\n2 Probably the circumambulation accompanied by the repetition of a mantra. (Forbes, R\u0101s M\u0101la, p. 387.)\n3 P gives apr\u0101d\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6da apurvo. I have followed the printed text.\n4 P, \u03b1 and \u03b2 give bh\u012b\u1e63mamah\u0101bh\u1e5btya. This I translate.\n5 The reading of \u03b1, vyatikara\u1e43, improves the grammar. I find vyatikara in \u03b2.\n6 Both \u03b1 and \u03b2 read k\u0101rita = caused to be built.\n7 P and \u03b1 give \u1e5bi\u1e47imitavidd\u0101 nivedite. This I have followed, but the sense is not thereby much altered.\nhuman being, which is of the length of a hundred years, there will be thirty-six thousand days, he placed so many strings threaded with coins in new receptacles that he had made for the purpose, and gave his son hundredfold more wealth in addition to that, and bestowed on him the name of M\u0101gha, and gave him the education befitting his family, and then thinking that he had done his duty, he died. Immediately M\u0101gha, having, like the lord of the northern quarter,\u00b9 a vast empire over luxuries,\u00b2 began to give to learned men as much wealth as they desired, and fulfilled the wishes of the tribe of petitioners with measureless gifts, and by various\u00b3 kinds of enjoyments showed himself in his own country\u2074 like the incarnation of a god. He excited admiration in learned men by composing the epic poem named C\u012bc\u016bp\u0101labadha; but at the end of his life, owing to the fact that the merit acquired in a previous state of existence was exhausted, he lost his wealth, and as calamity had fallen upon him, he was unable to remain in his own country, and so he went with his wife to the country of M\u0101lava, and took up his residence in Dh\u0101r\u0101.\u2075 He made up his mind that he must obtain some money from king Bhoja by offering him a book to purchase. So he sent his wife to him, and remained long hoping for it. In the meanwhile, king Bhoja, seeing his wife in that condition, opened that book, hastily thrusting a pin\u2076 into it and saw the following stanza:\u2014\n\nThe clump of night-lotuses has lost its glory, glorious is the mass of day-lotuses,\nThe owl abandons his joy, the Brahmany drake is full of happiness,\nThe warm-rayed sun is rising, the cold-rayed moon\u2077 is setting,\nVarious, alas! is the development of the freaks of accursed Fate.\n\nThen, having grasped the meaning of the stanza, he said, \u201cWhy need we consider the whole book? The world itself would be a small price for this stanza alone.\u201d So the king gave by way of remuneration for the word \u201cAlas!\u201d which was appropriate to the occasion, and not redundant, wealth to the amount of a lakh, and so dismissed M\u0101gha\u2019s wife. But she\n\n\u00b9 i.e. Kuvera, the god of wealth.\n\u00b2 I insert with \u03b1, bhojya between pr\u0101jya\u2019 and s\u0101mr\u0101jyo. The same MS. has pr\u0101pta before pr\u0101jya\u201d.\n\u00b3 I read with \u03b1, \u03b2 and P, taistair\u2078.\n\u2074 Before sv\u0101m I insert niy\u0101de\u1e63e, which I find in \u03b1.\n\u2075 This part of the story is found in the Bhojaprabandha, pp. 220 and ff. (edition of 1895, Kaly\u0101na, Bombay).\n\u2076 According to Molesworth\u2019s Mar\u0101\u1e6dhi Dictionary, it is customary to examine a candidate by piercing the sheets of a book with a \u00e7a\u0142\u0101k\u0101 or pin, and asking him to explain the stanza on which the pin rests. Books are apparently used in this way to inquire into the future. Cp. the Sortes Virgili\u00e6. The word \u00e7a\u0142\u0101k\u0101 may also mean a stilus for writing on palm-leaves. (B\u00fchler Indische Pal\u00e6ographie, p. 92.)\n\u2077 The moon is the friend of the white lotus, which expands its petals during the night, and closes them in the daytime. The Brahmany drake is separated from his mate during the night.\nas she was returning from the king's palace, being known to be the wife of\nthe pandit M\u0101gha, was solicited for alms by certain petitioners, and so she\ngave them the whole of the king's present, and returned to the house no\nricher than she left it, and informed her husband, in whose feet a swelling\nhad to a certain extent manifested itself, of what had taken place, with a\nfull explanation. Then he praised her, saying, \"You are my reputation\nmanifest in bodily form,\" and then, seeing that a beggar had come to his\nhouse, and that there was nothing in it fit to give him, he fell into a state\nof despondency, and said this,\u2014\nI have no wealth, and yet vain hope does not leave me,\nMy perverse hand does not abandon the desire to give.\nBegging involves disgrace, and yet in self-slaughter there is sin,\nYe vital spirits, depart ye of yourselves; what availeth it to lament?\nThe scorching of the fire of poverty is allayed with the water of acquiescence,\nBut, as for this pain produced by frustrating the expectation of the wretched,\nby what is this to be allayed?\nLeave me, leave me, ye vital spirits, since a petitioner has gone to dis-\nappointment,\nSooner or later you will have to go, but where will you find such a caravan\nto start with?\nIn time of famine begging is out of place; how can the poorly-circum-\nstanced contract a loan?\nAnd who will give the lords of the earth work to do?\nThis householder is about to perish without having given a mouthful;\nWhere are we to go, what are we to do, wife? Mysterious is life's dis-\npensation.\nA wayfarer, gaunt with famine, has come from some place asking for my\nhouse;\nSo, wife, is there anything which this man, afflicted with hunger, may eat?\nShe says with her voice, \"There is,\" and again, \"There is not,\" without\nsyllables;\nBy drops of flowing tears, by broad, broad streams pouring from her rolling\neyes.\n\n1 I find in \u03b2, ty\u0101g\u0101nna sa\u00f1calati and in P and a, d\u0101n\u0101nna sa\u1e45kucati. I think that\na negative is required. I find in the Bhojaprabandha, ty\u0101ye ratim vahati. The\nreading of the printed text means, \"In truth my perverse hand contracts from\ngiving.\"\n2 This passage is full of puns. \"Disappointment\" may also mean \"want of\nmeaning\"; the word for \"caravan\" means also \"having meaning,\" and the word\nfor \"petitioner\" is connected with artha which means \"petition,\" \"meaning,\"\nand \"wealth.\"\n3 Or, \"This sun is setting without allowing R\u0101hu to swallow him in an eclipse.\"\nGr\u0101sa also means \"grant.\"\nImmediately after uttering this speech, that pandit M\u0101gha died. Next morning king Bhoja heard of that occurrence, and as M\u0101gha's fellow-tribesmen, the M\u0101las, were wealthy, and yet allowed such an admirable man to die overpowered with hunger, he gave them the well-known name of Bhilla\u00b9-M\u0101las.\n\nOnce on a time, in the city of Vi\u1e63\u1e47\u0101la, which was great in prosperity, there was dwelling a Brahman of the name of Sarvadeva, of the K\u0101\u00e7yapa gotra, & native of Madhyade\u00e7a.\u00b2 By associating with the followers of the Jaina religion, he had well-nigh suppressed falsehood\u00b3 in himself. With his two sons, Dhanap\u0101la and \u00c7obhana, he entertained in a monastery\u2074 of his own, out of regard for his merits, the Jaina teacher, Vardham\u0101na, who came to him one day, and as the teacher was pleased with his unvarying devotion, Sarvadeva, thinking that he was a son of the omniscient one, asked him about a treasure of his ancestors that had disappeared. The teacher, making use of words intentionally ambiguous, asked him to give him half, and after Sarvadeva had found the treasure by the indications which the teacher gave, he was for giving him half of the treasure, but the teacher then asked him for half his couple of sons. Dhanap\u0101la, the eldest, whose mind was blinded by falsehood, and who was addicted to denouncing the Jaina way, refused his consent, and with regard to the younger, named \u00c7obhana, he was restrained by compassion. So, being desirous of washing away in holy bathing-places the crime of breaking his promise, he set out on a pilgrimage to holy bathing-places. Then the younger son, named \u00c7obhana, who was devoted to his father, dissuaded him from his intention, and took a vow to make good his father's promise, and himself repaired to that Jaina teacher. Dhanap\u0101la studied all the branches of Brahmanical learning, and, by the favour of king Bhoja, obtained the post of superior\u2075 of all the pandits, and, out of a feeling of hostility to his brother, he prevented the professors of the Jaina faith from entering his country for the space of twelve years. The Jaina laymen of that country called upon the teacher with vehement entreaty, and so that ascetic, named \u00c7obhana, who had reached the further shore of the ocean of Jaina treatises, took leave of the teacher, and went there and entered Dh\u0101r\u0101. As he was entering, the pandit Dhanap\u0101la, who was accompanying the king on his royal circuit, not\n\n\u00b9 Or \"barbarous M\u0101las.\" The reading of \u03b1 and \u03b2, tajj\u0101ter n\u0101ma would mean, \"He gave that tribe the name,\" &c. B\u00fchler (Indian Studies, No. 1) tells us that \"\u00c7rim\u0101la\" is another name of Bhillam\u0101la, the modern Bhinn\u0101l in southern M\u0101rv\u0101d. P has, as I read it, tajj\u0101ter, the vowel e being omitted.\n\u00b2 The country lying between the Him\u0101layas on the north, the Vindhya mountains on the south, Vina\u00e7ana on the west, Pray\u0101ga on the east.\n\u00b3 Probably in the sense of wrong belief from the Jaina point of view.\n\u2074 Up\u0101raya.\n\u2075 P and \u03b1 give prasfa (for prattha) instead of the prak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da of the printed text. I have followed these two MSS.\nrecognizing that he was his brother, said to him jeeringly, \"All hail! ass-toothed mendicant!\" The hermit, \u00c7obhana, answered, \"Good luck befall you, my friend, with a mouth like a kapiv\u1e5b\u1e63a\u1e47a.\" Dhanap\u0101la was inwardly astonished at this speech of \u00c7obhana's, and said to himself, \"I said, 'All hail to you,' in pure joke, but this man, by saying 'Good luck to you, my friend,' has conquered me by his dexterity in speech.\" So he said to \u00c7obhana, \"Whose guests are you?\" These speeches of Dhanap\u0101la elicited from the hermit \u00c7obhana the reply, \"We are your guests, sir.\" When Dhanap\u0101la heard this speech of the hermit \u00c7obhana, he sent \u00c7obhana, with his attendant novice, to his own palace, and assigned him a place there. Then Dhanap\u0101la himself returned to the palace, and with polite speeches invited \u00c7obhana with his attendant to dinner. But they, who were addicted to taking only pure food, refused. Dhanap\u0101la earnestly inquired what objection could be taken to his food. They answered,\u2014\n\nA hermit should eat food collected as bees collect honey, even if given by a family of Mleechas,\nHe should not eat a regular meal, even if offered by one equal to V\u1e5bhaspati.\n\nMoreover, the same doctrine is laid down in the Jaina religion, in the Da\u00e7avaik\u0101lika,\u2014\nThose wise persons, who are like bees, not depending on any one person for food,\nDelighting in many scraps, self-subdued, are for that reason called saints.\n\nAccordingly, as food expressly prepared for us is forbidden both by our own religion and an alien religion, we avoid it, and eat pure food. Dhanap\u0101la was astonished at their virtuous practice, and silently rising up went into his palace. When he was beginning his bath, those two hermits arrived on a begging round, and the Brahman's wife seeing them, as the cooking of the food was not completed, brought the two hermits sour milk to drink. They asked, \"For how many days has this been kept?\" But Dhanap\u0101la jeeringly remarked, \"Do you suppose that there are maggots in it?\" The Brahman's wife investigated the matter and said, \"It has been kept for two days.\" Thereupon the two hermits said, \"Undoubtedly there\n\n---\n\n1 Perhaps this refers to the fact that the Jaina ascetic ate only vegetables. Professor Leumann kindly informs me that \"Garlabhadanta bhadanta namaste\" and \"Kapiv\u1e5b\u1e63a\u1e47aya vayasya sukha\u1e41 te\" are two P\u0101das composed in the Vi\u00e7\u014dka metre with rhyming syllables. I do not understand the meaning of kapiv\u1e5b\u1e63a\u1e47a.\n2 Here the plural is used, but further on the dual.\n3 This passage is found on page 613 of Professor Leumann's Da\u00e7avaik\u0101lika S\u016btra, as he has kindly pointed out to me. The same idea will be found in Hemacandra's Yogac\u0101stra, III. 140.\n4 I read asiddhe 'nnap\u0101ke with \u03b2. I find in a, asiddh\u0101ntap\u0101ke. P gives asiddhe annap\u0101ke. P also gives prcchyam\u0101no Dhanap\u0101la\u1e25.\nare maggots in it.\" So Dhanap\u0101la rose up from the seat on which he had placed himself to take his bath, in order to look into the matter, and when he saw that on a piece of cotton coloured red being placed in the vicinity of the sour milk, which was put on a plate, creatures of the colour of the sour milk climbed upon the red cotton, and made it as white as the clot of milk, he admitted that the Jaina religion was conspicuous for its compassion towards all living creatures, and also conferred skill in detecting their production. For\u2014\n\nOne should avoid mudga and m\u0101\u1e63a and other leguminous plants, if unboiled milk is thrown upon them.\n\nThey say, moreover, that living animals are produced in sour milk, after it has remained three days.\n\nThis is laid down in the law of the Jina. Having ascertained this, Dhanap\u0101la, owing to the excellent instruction of the hermit \u010cohana, accepted the correct belief, and entered into full possession of the truth. Being naturally clever, he became exceedingly learned in the Karmaprak\u1e5bti and other argumentative treatises of the Jainas, and he repeated as follows, every morning after the ceremony of worshipping the Jina,\u2014\n\nThe lord of a few cities, hard to win even by bodily sacrifices,\nI have, alas! in former days followed, under the delusion that he would bestow measureless gifts; Now I have gained as my master the lord of the three worlds, who bestows his own rank,\nWho is to be worshipped with the reason; but the waste of days, that preceded my conversion, afflicts me.\nI thought that true religion was everywhere until, O Jina, I knew thy law,\nAs the gold-sick think everything gold, not having recovered their white condition.\n\n1 P reads p\u0101tar\u0101h santityatra abhihit\u0113. The two other MSS. give, with the text, a superfluous t\u012bt\u0101.\n2 I find in P, tairjantubhir, those creatures. Pumba is, I suppose, the Persian word pamba, which is sometimes pronounced punba.\n3 Mugam\u0101s\u0101. Hoernle tells us that mudga is Phaseolus Mungo, and m\u0101\u1e63a is Phaseolus mungo radiatus (Uv\u0101sagad\u0101s\u0101o, p. 18). My translation is based upon Hemacandra's Yog\u0101c\u0101ra (ed. Windisch), III. 7.\n\n\u0100magorasaanprktai dvidal\u0101m puspiteudanav\u0101n\nDadhyaharditay\u0101tt\u0101m kuthit\u0101nn\u0101vi ca varjayet.\n\n4 I find in P, a and B, samyaktattvam bhaje. This I translate.\n5 I follow P, which gives durgrahomitaritarit\u0101mohena. I assume that amitavitarin means \"giver of measureless gifts.\"\n6 The editor explains that this gold sickness is produced by the Dhatt\u016bra poison; \"as all looks yellow to the jaundiced eye.\" He gives another explanation of the concluding words of the second line: \"not obtaining a place suitable for confidence.\" I prefer to read alabham\u0101d\u0101tam with a and B, and apparently P. For this gold sickness cp. Pari\u00e7\u012b\u1e6da Parvan (ed. Jacobi), p. 168, Mrtpi\u1e0ddam api hemaiva pitonmatto hi pa\u00e7yati.\nThe lord of a country bestows one village,\nThe lord of a village bestows one field,\nThe lord of a field bestows kidney-beans,\nThe All-knowing one, propitiated, bestows his own bliss.\n\nSuch speeches Dhanap\u0101la recited continually.\nWhile in this frame of mind, he was one day taken out to hunt with the king, and was thus addressed by him,\u2014\n\"Dhanap\u0101la, what, pray, is the cause that these deer Leap up towards the sky, while the boars furrow the ground?\"\n\nDhanap\u0101la answered,\u2014\n\"King, terrified by your weapons, they seek to take refuge with their kind,\nThe deer with the deer in the deer-marked moon, the boars with the primeval boar.\"\n\nWhen the king pierced a deer with an arrow, he looked at the face of Dhanap\u0101la, in order that he might celebrate his exploit in verse, but Dhanap\u0101la said,\u2014\nMay your valour in this matter go to the region under the earth!\nThis is evil policy, for he who takes refuge is held guiltless:\nThat the weak is even slain by the mighty,\nOh! alas! woe worth the day! is a sign that the world is kingless.\n\nThe king was indignant at this reproach from Dhanap\u0101la, and said,\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" But he received this answer,\u2014\nSince even enemies are let off, when near death, if they take grass in their mouths,\nHow can you slay these harmless beasts, who always feed on grass?\n\nThen a strange pity arose in the mind of the king, and he consented to break his bow and arrows, and he renounced the evil practice of hunting for the term of his natural life. As he was returning to the town, he heard there the plaintive cry of a goat that was fastened to a sacrificial post in the sacrifice-shed, and asked Dhanap\u0101la, \"What does this animal say?\" Thereupon he answered, \"It is entreating that it may not be slain.\n\nI am not desirous of enjoying the fruits of heaven, I never asked you for them;\nI am always satisfied with eating grass; this conduct does not become you, holy man;\n\n1 It is well known that the Hindns place a deer in the moon instead of a man; the \"primeval boar\" is, of course, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in his third incarnation.\nIf the living creatures slain by you in sacrifice assuredly go to heaven,\nWhy do you not offer sacrifice with your mother and father, your sons and\nbrothers likewise?\u00b9\n\nWhen he had said this, the king again attacked him with the question,\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d He replied,\u2014\nHaving made a sacrificial post, having slain beasts, having made gory\nmire\u2014\nIf by this one goes to heaven, by what does one go to hell?\nTruth is my sacrificial post, penance indeed is my fire, deeds are my fuel,\nOne should offer harmlessness as a burnt-offering, thus one\u2019s sacrifice is\napproved by the good.\u00b2\n\nReciting these and other speeches uttered in the \u00c7ukasamv\u0101da, in front\nof the king, and teaching him that those creatures of harmful nature, who\npreach the gospel of doing harm to living beings, are only R\u0101kshasas in\nBrahman form, he made king Bhoja well-disposed towards the Jaina\nreligion. Then, on a certain occasion, the king was walking in the\nSarasvat\u012bkanth\u0101bharana temple, and he said to the pandit Dhanap\u0101la, who\nwas always praising the law of the All-knowing one, \u201cAdmitting that\nthere once was an All-knowing one, is there now any superiority of know-\nledge in his sect?\u201d Thereupon Dhanap\u0101la answered, \u201cIn the book called\nArhacc\u016b\u1e0d\u0101ma\u1e47i written by the Arhat, there is even now contained informa-\ntion about the real facts with regard to all objects in the three worlds in\npast, present and future.\u201d When he said this, the king was in the ante-\nchamber\u00b3 of the temple, which had three doors. Being eager to cast a slur\non the Jaina treatises, he said, \u201cBy what door are we going out?\u201d Then\nDhanap\u0101la, proving the truth of the version, \u201cThe really auspicious thir-\nteenth\u2074 is intellect only,\u201d wrote the answer to the king\u2019s question on a leaf\n\n\u00b9 See the translation of the Sarva Dar\u00e7ana Sangraha by Cowell and Gough, p. 10.\n\u00b2 I find in a and B, Esha yaj\u00f1ab san\u0101tanah. P gives san\u0101tanah (sic).\n\u00b3 Sanskrit maydapa. Dr. Burgess translates it sometimes by \u201chall,\u201d sometimes\nby \u201cporch.\u201d On this point Dr. Burgess writes to me as follows: \u201cThe shrine\n(garbha-grha) contains the image or li\u1e45ga. In larger temples there is often in front\nof it a chamber either partly or entirely open in front, with pillars between it and\nthe hall: this is the antar\u0101la-mandapa. In front of this again is a larger apartment\nwith the walls rising to half the height (in smaller temples), the upper part of the\nheight having short pillars to support the roof; usually four, twelve or more pillars\naccording to size. This is the mandapa (if there is not a second in the front of it\nagain), or mah\u0101mandapa; and if the walls go to the roof, I would call it the Hall.\nIf it is a \u2018porch\u2019 open for the upper part of the height, and not very large, I think\n\u2018porch\u2019 is the more descriptive appellation. Again, in front of the Mah\u0101mandapa\nthere is not unfrequently a smaller porch, often open, supported by pillars on three\nsides. This then is the mandapa or true porch. There may also be a small pavilion\nover the Garuda or Nandi in front of the temple, which is the Garuda-mandapa or\nNandi-mandapa.\u201d\n\u2074 This appears, according to the Bombay editor, to be an improved version of\nthe astrologers\u2019 saying, \u201cThe thirteenth is all-auspicious.\u201d\nof birch-bark, and placed it in an earthen jar, and gave the jar to the betel-box bearer,\u00b9 and then said to the king, \"Set on your foot, your Highness.\" The king thought that he himself had now fallen into a difficulty created for him by the cleverness of Dhanap\u0101la,\u00b2 but considering that Dhanap\u0101la must have fixed on one of the three doors, he had the lotus slab \u00b3 of the ante-chamber removed by masons, and went out by that aperture. Then he broke the jar, and reading the precise description of this mode of exit in those letters inscribed on the birch leaf, he was excited in mind by surprise at that incident, and praised the law of the Jina.\n\nWhat Vi\u1e63\u1e47u cannot see with his two eyes, \u0100\u015bva with his three, and Brahm\u0101 the Creator with his eight,\nWhat Skanda cannot see with his twelve eyes, and the lord of L\u0101\u1e45k\u0101 with his twice ten,\nWhat Indra cannot see with his ten hundred, what the multitude cannot see even with their countless eyes,\nThat thing the wise man sees clearly with the eye of wisdom alone.\n\nThen Dhanap\u0101la, after composing the praise of R\u0101sabha in fifty verses,\u2074 showed to the king, once on a time, a eulogistic tablet composed by himself, in the Sarasvatikan\u1e6dh\u0101bh\u0101rana temple. On it there was the following stanza:\n\nHe has delivered the earth, he has torn open the enemy's breast,\nHe has, with might, taken into his bosom the fortune of the kingdom of Bali,\nThis young man has achieved in one birth\nWhat the primeval spirit accomplished in three.\u2075\n\nHaving read this stanza, the king gave by way of recompense for that tablet a jar of gold. As Dhanap\u0101la was leaving that temple, he saw in the passage \u2076 of the door, a statue of the god of love clapping hands with his wife Rati,\u2077 and laughed. When the king asked him the cause of his laughter, the pandit said,\u2014\n\u00b9 Chagik\u0101 is, of course, a misprint for sthagik\u0101.\n\u00b2 I find in a, n\u1e5bpastu budha\u1e25. This, perhaps, gives a better sense.\n\u00b3 I find in a a simpler reading, viz. c\u016blam, which I translate \"stone.\" The king therefore had a stone removed. But P gives padma-c\u016blam. Dr. Burgess refers me to Ferguson's Eastern Architecture, p. 197, where he figures two \"moonstones.\" Dr. Burgess informs me that they are often carved with lotus-petals and kalasas.\n\u2074 According to B\u00fchler (Introduction to P\u0101y\u0101lacch\u012b, p. 9) this work is still extant. B\u00fchler quite accepts Merutunga's statement that Dhanap\u0101la was converted from Brahmanism to the Jaina religion.\n\u2075 This is an allusion to the Var\u0101ha, Narasi\u1e43ha and V\u0101mana incarnations of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. \"The kingdom of Bali\" may also be translated \"The kingdom of the mighty.\"\n\u2076 Sanskrit khattaka.\n\u2077 For para\u1e41 P gives paraparam.\n\"That very \u00c7iva, whose self-restraint is celebrated through the three worlds,\nAfflicted with separation, now bears his beloved in his own body,\\(^1\\)\nSo we are conquered by this god, are we?\" saying this, and patting with\nhis hand\nThe hand of his beloved, triumphs laughingly the god of love.\nAnother day, beholding, in the temple of \u00c7iva, Bh\u1e5b\u1e45gin at his own door,\nThe king asked Dhanap\u0101la, \"Why does he look so emaciated?\" Dhana-\np\u0101la answered,\u2014\n\"If he is sky-clothed, why has he a bow? If he has a bow, away with\nashes!\nIf he has ashes, then why a wife? If he has a wife, then why does he\nhate Love?\"\nBeholding thus the inconsistent conduct of his own master, Alas!\nBh\u1e5b\u1e45gin has his body reduced to a skeleton, and rough, as covered with\na close network of veins.\\(^2\\)\nGlorious is the body of \u00c7iva, at the time of his marriage, horripilant,\nadorned with ashes,\nIn which the god of love has, as it were, sprouted, though reduced to a\ncinder.\nShe eats filth, void of discernment,\nShe loves her own son, too fondly attached,\nWith hoof-points and horns she smites creatures,\nFor what good quality, O king, is the cow worshipped?\\(^3\\)\nIf the cow is to be worshipped, because it is able to give milk, why not\nthe female buffalo?\nThere is not seen in the cow even the slightest superiority to the other.\\(^4\\)\n\nWhile Dhanap\u0101la was delighting the king by these and other well-\nknown perfect literary utterances, a certain merchant, announced by the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) An allusion to the Ardhan\u0101r\u012b\u00e7a form of \u00c7iva. This god, on one occasion,\nreduced K\u0101ma, the god of love, to ashes with the fire of his eye.\n\n\\(^2\\) Professor Leumann informs me that the last four lines are also quoted in the\ncommentary on the first two stanzas in Haribhadra's \u0100staka.\n\n\\(^3\\) It will be observed that Dhanap\u0101la runs a tilt at sacrifices, and the principal\nHindu gods, and, at last, attacks the sacred cow.\n\n\\(^4\\) I find in P an interesting stanza which is omitted in the printed text. It runs\nas follows:\u2014\n\nAsatyuttam\u0101gye katha\u1e41 m\u016brdhni m\u0101l\u0101?\nAbh\u0101lasya bh\u0101le katha\u1e41 pafabandhah?\nAk\u0101ryasya karpe katha\u1e41 gitantrye?\nAp\u0101dasya p\u0101de katha\u1e41 ne pran\u0101ma\u1e25?\n\nAs he has no head, how can there be a garland on it?\nAs he has no forehead, how can it be crowned with a turban?\nAs he has no ears, how can song and dance sound in his ears?\nAs he has no feet, how can I fall prostrate at his foot?\nwarder, entered the hall of audience, and, after bowing to the king, showed some laudatory stanzas on a tablet of wax. When the king asked where they were obtained, he said as follows, \"My ship suddenly stopped in mid-ocean, and when the sailors began to sound the sea, they saw submerged in it a temple of Civa, and though the waves were surging around it, they saw that, inside, it was free from water, and perceiving that there were letters on a certain wall, they applied a tablet of wax to it, in order to find out what they were, and here is the tablet with the letters that came off on it.\"\u00b9\n\nWhen the king heard that, he applied a tablet of clay to the wax tablet, and had the letters\u00b2 that then appeared on it, read by pandits. They ran as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Though brought indeed by me, through my association with him from boyhood, to the highest pitch of prosperity,\nThis king's son is now ashamed, when there is even any conversation about me.\"\nThus vexed, supported by glory, as if by a son, the aged assemblage of virtues\nHas gone to the ascetic groves on the bank of the sea, as if to perform penance.\nWhen the king, eager to conquer the world, was roaming about wrathful to every quarter,\nImposing vows of widowhood on the wives of rivals, who took in hand the bow,\nNot to speak of other ladies, even Rati, through fear, did not permit her husband\nTo carry in his hand his flowery bow, which is clothed with the indigo hue of female bees, blind with joy.\nKing, these wives of your enemies carry, without resting, with the twin pitchers of their breasts,\nSighing as they go, in the shape of a stream of tears discharged from the revolving buckets of their broad eyes,\nDrawn by the ever-moving irrigation wheel of much grief from the deep well of thought,\nThe water of weeping, falling through the difficult path of the bridge of the nose, as if through pipes of bamboo.\n\nWhile these complete stanzas were being read, they came upon this half stanza:\u2014\n\n\u00b9 I read with \u03b2, tatkr\u0101nt\u0101ksaramayi. The text would mean \"containing those beautiful letters.\"\n\u00b2 P, a and \u03b2 insert viparit\u0101n, reversed, like the inscription on a seal.\nAlas! indeed the results of deeds formerly done\nAre terrible in the case of living creatures.\n\nThough more than a hundred pandits, skilled in completing fragmentary\nstanzas, tried to produce a second half to this, their compositions would not,\nin the opinion of the king, harmonize with the first part. Then the pandit\nDhanap\u0101la was asked by the king. He produced the following continua-\ntion,\u2014\nAlas! Alas! those very heads, which gleamed on the head of Civa,\nAre now rolled about by the feet of kites.\u00b9\n\nWhen the king said, \"This second half really harmonizes with the first,\"\nthe pandit asserted, \"If this is not found both in words and sense on the\nwall that contains this panegyric at R\u0101me\u00e7vara, I will henceforth renounce\nthe profession of poet until the end of my life.\" The moment the king\nheard Dhanap\u0101la make this vow, he ordered sailors to embark on a vessel,\nand putting out to sea, they reached that temple in six months, and again\napplied a tablet of wax to the inscription. When the king saw that they\nbrought this very second half of the stanza, he gave the pandit the reward\nthat he deserved for his cleverness. The numerous stanzas of the frag-\nmentary inscription must be considered as related above according to\ntradition.\n\nOne day the king asked the pandit the reason of his remissness in attend-\nance. He excused himself on the ground that he was engaged in composing\nthe Tilakama\u00f1jari.\u00b2 The king was at a loss for some distraction in the last\nwatch of a night of the cold weather, so he got the pandit to bring for\nhim the first original manuscript\u00b3 of the story called Tilakama\u00f1jari, which\nhe read, while the pandit explained it. While he was reading it, being\nafraid that the sentiment\u2074 of the book might fall, he placed under it a\ngolden plate with a saucer. When the king had finished it, his mind was\nfilled with admiration on account of its wonderful poetical merit, and he\nsaid to the pandit, \"Make me the hero of this tale, and put Avanti in the\nplace of Vinata, and let the shrine of Mah\u0101k\u0101la take the place of the holy\n\n\u00b9 These two lines are found in the Bhojaprabandha (p. 246 of the Bombay edition\nof 1895), but the second line begins, Civa, Civa, t\u0101ni. This suggests the reading,\nHara, Hara, t\u0101ni. The word which I have translated, \"Alas!\" means literally,\n\"O Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\" In the Bhojaprabandha the inscription is found by fishermen on a\nstone in the Narmad\u0101.\n\u00b2 Professor Aufrecht, in his Catalogus Catalogorum, tells us that this book by\nDhanap\u0101la is quoted by Nami on K\u0101vy\u0101lank\u0101ra 16, 3.\n\u00b3 The three MSS. that I have seen, give pratim. I find that in Gujarati and\nMarathi prat means a copy of a book.\n\u2074 Rasa means \"moisture\" and also \"sentiment\" or \"poetical flavour.\" The\naction is, probably, to be conceived of as symbolical.\nwater of \u00c7akr\u0101vat\u0101ra,\u00b9 and then I will give you whatever you like to ask.\u201d The pandit thereupon exclaimed, \u201cThere is as vast a difference between the two sets of things as there is between a fire-fly and the sun; between a grain of mustard-seed and the Golden Mountain;\u00b2 between glass and gold; between a Dhatt\u016bra plant and the wishing-tree of paradise;\u201d and he continued,\u2014\nDouble-mouthed, speechless, covetous-minded, javelin-like creature, what are we to say of you?\nWeighing gold with gu\u00f1ja-seeds\u00b3 you have not gone to the subterranean world.\n\nWhile the pandit was reproaching him in these words, King Bhoja\u2074 burnt that original draft in the blazing fire. Then the pandit was doubly dispirited and doubly crestfallen, and he flung himself down on an old couch in the back part of his palace, and lay there sighing deeply. His daughter B\u0101lapandit\u0101\u2075 roused him from his stupor with loving attention and made him bathe and eat and drink, and then remembering the first half of the Tilakama\u00f1jari from having seen the writing of the first draft of it,\u2076 she wrote it out, and the second half she composed anew, and so completed the book.\n\nOne day, in the assembly-hall of Bhoja, Dhanap\u0101la uttered this stanza,\u2014\nO lord of Dh\u0101r\u0101, this Creator, wishing to count the kings of the earth,\nMade a streak in the sky with a piece of chalk to note down you,\nThat became this very river of the gods;\u2077 because there is not a husband of the earth equal to you,\nHe let drop the piece of chalk; this on the surface of the earth is that snowy Him\u0101laya.\n\nWhen the other pandits laughed at this stanza, Dhanap\u0101la said,\u2014\nV\u0101lmiki makes the sea to be bridged with rocks brought by the monkeys,\nVy\u0101sa by the arrows of Arjuna; and yet they are not charged with exaggeration;\n\n\u00b9 Mentioned in the Jaina recension of the \u015ai\u1e41h\u0101sanadv\u0101tr\u012b\u1e47\u1e0dik\u0101, fifteenth story.

They revealed\nin their speeches partiality for their own particular sects, but being united\nby a desire to find out the true way, they fixed as a limit a period of six\n\n\u00b9 The meaning seems to be: V\u0101lmiki the author of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, and Vy\u0101sa\nthe author of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, as their reputation is established, escape criticism.\n\u00b2 I conjecture sam\u0101naj\u00f1\u0101na\u00b2 for sam\u0101naj\u00f1\u0101ta\u00b2.\n\u00b3 This work of \u010cohbana is extant according to B\u00fchler (Introduction to P\u0101iyalacchi, p. 9).\n\u2074 Sanskrit prabandha.\n\u2075 Hoernle, in his note on page 106 of his translation of the Bower Manuscript,\ntells us that \u015bro\u1e47\u1e0dala is the same as k\u0101\u015b\u012bka or dh\u0101ny\u0101mla. On page 14 he speaks\nof it as a kind of sour gruel made with unhusked rice. It is clear that Dhanap\u0101la\nwas under medical treatment. This stanza is found in the Bhojaprabandha, p. 223\n(Bombay edition of 1895).\n\u2076 Rasa means \"juice,\" and also poetical sentiment. This couplet is found in the\nKirtikaumudi of Som\u0113gyara, I. 16. Dhanap\u0101la composed Sanskrit poetry and a\nSanskrit Ko\u1e63a, and also the P\u0101iyalacchi for his sister Sundari. (B\u00fchler's Introduc-\ntion to the P\u0101iyalacchi, pp. 7 and 10.) It is, unfortunately, probable that Meru-\ntunga's account of Dhanap\u0101la's adventures at Bhoja's court is not founded on fact.\n(B\u00fchler o.c. p. 9.) Dhanap\u0101la was really a contemporary of Muhja or V\u0101kpati-\nr\u0101ja II. (B\u00fchler and Zacharise, Navas\u0101has\u0101gakacarita, p. 42.)\nmonths, and devoted themselves to propitiating the goddess Sarasvati. At the end of a certain night, the goddess roused up the king, saying, \"Are you awake?\n\nYou must listen to the religion of the Buddhists, but you must practise that of the Jainas,\nYou must observe in ordinary life that of the Vedas, you must meditate on the supreme \u012a\u015bvara.\"\n\nOr, \"You must meditate on the undecaying place.\" Having repeated this verse to the king, and the representatives of the sects, the goddess Sarasvati disappeared. Then they composed this couplet, which continued the sense of the preceding one:\n\nReligion is characterized by harmlessness, and one must honour the goddess Sarasvati,\nBy meditation one obtains salvation; this is the view of all the sectaries.\n\nThus they gave the king a safe decision.\n\nThen a cook, living in that town, named \u010cit\u0101, when a pilgrim, a native of a foreign country, had arrived on the solar festival, with food to be cooked, and had come to her house, after tasting, at a tank, oil of Panic seed, and she saw that he had died from that emetic, being tormented with fear that a stigma would attach to her on account of his being possessed of wealth, swallowed that very emetic, in order that she might die. When she persisted in this endeavour, there was produced in her intellectual ability; and so, after she had to a certain extent studied the three Vedas, the Raghuvan\u1e63a, the K\u0101ma-\u015b\u0101stra of V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, and the writings of C\u0101\u1e47akya on morals and the principles of government, she went with her daughter, named Vijay\u0101, who was in her fresh youth and learned, and adorning with her presence and that of her daughter the royal assembly-hall, said to king Bhoja,\n\nHis valour extends even to the extirpation of the race of his enemies, his glory over the vessel of the universe,\nHis munificence extends to satisfying the wants of petitioners, as this earth extends to the sea,\n\n1 I read dhy\u0101tavya\u1e25 with \u03b1, \u03b2 and P.\n2 This is omitted in \u03b1 and \u03b2, but P has dhy\u0101tavyam padam akshayam. This I translate.\n3 I read yugmaclokam with \u03b1 and \u03b2.\n4 For some account of the poetess \u010cit\u0101 or S\u012bt\u0101, see Navasahasinkacarita, by B\u00fchler and Zachariae, p. 90, note 2. They refer to Pischel in Festgruss an Bohtlingk. The poetess S\u012bt\u0101 is mentioned in the Bhojaprabandha (edition of 1895, K\u0101vy\u0101, Bombay), pp. 88, 89, 147, 204, and some verses by her are given.\n5 Here I follow \u03b1, which reads k\u016brpa\u1e6dik\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da p\u0101k\u0101ya\u1e47am upantya s\u016bryaparvan\u0101. P has the same reading, but p\u0101k\u0101ya\u1e47am; \u03b2 also, but p\u0101d\u0101ya for upantya. The words seem to have been misplaced in the text by the printers. But \u03b2 goes on to represent that the cook \u010cit\u0101 ate the food, not the oil. I find in \u03b1, \u0101d\u0101ya for \u0101v\u0101da. All the MSS. give tasmai sthira, which I do not understand.\nHis faith extends to the measure of the two feet of the husband\\(^1\\) of the daughter of the mountain,\nBut the other virtues of the glorious king Bhoja extend without limit.\n\nThen king Bhoja made Vijay\u0101 an inmate of his harem.\\(^2\\) Once on a time, being touched by the rays of the moon within the lattice, she repeated this:\u2014\n\nCease, O planet adorned with a spot, this sport of touching people with thy rays,\nThou art not fit for touching, being the remains of the adornment of the person of the husband of Cand\u012b.\\(^3\\)\n\nOn this point much is to be said, but it must be learnt from tradition. Here ends the story of the learned \u010cit\u0101.\n\nThen two pandits, related as sister's husband and wife's brother,\\(^4\\) who were called May\u016bra and B\u0101na, and were engaged in a perpetual rivalry on account of their own respective literary merits, had obtained an honourable position in the king's court. One day the pandit B\u0101na went to his sister's house at night, to pay her a visit, and as he was lying down at the door, he heard his sister's husband trying to conciliate her, and paying attention to what was being said, he managed to catch these lines:\u2014\n\nThe night is almost gone, and the emaciated moon is, so to speak, wasting away,\nThis lamp, having come into the power of sleep, seems drowsily to nod,\nHaughtiness is generally appeased by submission, but, alas! you do not,\neven in spite of submission, abandon your anger,\u2014\n\nWhen B\u0101na had heard these three lines repeated over and over again by May\u016bra, he added a fourth line:\u2014\n\nCruel one, your heart also is hard from immediate proximity to your breast.\n\nWhen May\u016bra's wife heard this fourth line from the mouth of her brother, being angry and ashamed, she cursed him, saying, \"Become a leper.\" Owing to the might of the vow of his sister, who observed strictly her vow of fidelity to her husband, B\u0101na was seized with the malady of leprosy from that very moment. In the morning he went into the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e. \u010civa, the husband of P\u0101rvat\u012b.\n\\(^2\\) I have omitted the poetical effusions to which Vijay\u0101 gave vent on this particular occasion.\n\\(^3\\) This is probably an allusion to the fact that \u010civa wears the moon's crescent round or above his central eye. Cand\u012b = P\u0101rvat\u012b. The word translated by \"remains of the adornment\" is nirm\u0101ly\u0101\u1e25. The word that means \"ray,\" also means \"hand.\"\n\\(^4\\) Bh\u0101vuk\u0101lakau. It is clear that \u010d\u0101laka = sy\u0101la. It is probable that these two poets lived in the time of \u010crih\u0101r\u1e63a, 606 to 648 A.D.\nassembly-hall of the king, with his body covered with a rug. When May\u016bra, with a soft voice, like a peacock, said to him in the Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit language, \"Ten million blessings on you!\" the king, who was foremost among the discerning, looked at B\u0101na with astonishment, and thought in his own mind that B\u0101na would, on a future occasion, make use of some device for propitiating the deity; but B\u0101na rose up from his seat in the assembly-hall utterly abashed, and setting up a post on the border of the town, he placed under it a fire-pit, full of charcoal made of Khadira wood, himself mounted on a palanquin at the end of the post, and began uttering a hymn of praise to the sun-god. At the end of every stanza he cut away, with his knife, one support of the palanquin, and at the end of five stanzas five supports had been cut away by him, and he was left clinging to the end of the palanquin. While the sixth stanza was being recited, the sun-god appeared in visible form, and owing to his favour, B\u0101na at once acquired a body of the colour of pure gold. On a subsequent day he came with his body anointed with golden sandal-wood and clothed in a magnificent white garment. When the king saw the healthy condition of his body, May\u016bra represented that it was all due to the favour of the sun-god. Then B\u0101na pierced him in a vital spot with an arrow-like speech. \"If the propitiating of a god is an easy matter, then do you also display some wonderful performance in this line.\" When he said this, that May\u016bra aimed at him the following retort, \"What need has a healthy man of one skilled in the science of medicine? Nevertheless, so much I will do. You, after cutting your hands and feet with a knife to confirm your words, propitiated the sun with your sixth stanza, but I will propitiate Bhav\u0101ni with the sixth syllable of my first stanza.\"\n\nHaving made this promise, he entered the back part of the temple of Candik\u0101 sitting in a comfortable litter, and when he uttered the sixth syllable of the poem beginning, \"Do not interrupt your coquetry,\" by the favour of Candik\u0101 visibly manifested his tender body seemed to be entirely renewed, and then he looked at the temple of the goddess fronting it.\n\n1 May\u016bra means peacock. I read prati after ta\u1e45 with a, \u03b2 and P.\n2 Sanskrit sikkaka.\n3 May\u016bra, not B\u0101na, is the reputed author of the Surya\u00e7ataka, printed recently in the K\u0101vyam\u0101l\u0101 (No. 19, 1889), with the commentary of Tribhuvanap\u0101la. The poem will also be found in H\u00e4berlin's Anthology.\n4 In the Sanskrit sikkakapadam.\n5 I find in a and \u03b2, \"k\u0101jak\u0101nti\u1e25, the beauty of a body of pure gold.\n6 B\u0101na means arrow.\n7 Literally, \"put it on the string like an arrow.\"\n8 Ca should no doubt follow pa\u1e6di, as in a and \u03b2. The author seems to have followed here a different version of the story.\n9 This poem is called the Cand\u012b\u00e7ataka and is attributed to B\u0101na, not May\u016bra. It has been published in the K\u0101vyam\u0101l\u0101, beginning in No. 19 (Bombay, 1887).\n10 The reading of the text is supported here by P and a. It will be observed that the Jaina teacher afterwards faces the temple.\nthe courtiers, headed by the king, came to meet him, and uttered the cry of \"Bravo! bravo!\" and so with great jubilation he entered the city.\n\nAt this conjuncture, the law of the false believers being triumphant, some principal men, who hated the true religion, said to the king, \"If among the adherents of the Jaina system any such display of power takes place, then establish the white-robed Jainas in your territory, but if not, then banish them.\" No sooner had this been said than the king summoned the teacher, M\u0101natunga, and said, \"Show some miracle of your deities.\" He said, \"As our deities are emancipated from the bonds of existence, what miracle is possible for them here? Nevertheless, I will show you a manifestation of the power of their servants, the lower gods, that will astonish the universe.\" When he had said this, he caused himself to be bound with forty-four fetters, and placing himself in the back part of the temple of R\u0101bha, who was worshipped in that city, he composed a new hymn of praise, full of spells, beginning, \"Having duly worshipped the two feet of the Jina illuminating the brightness of the prostrate crest-jewels of devoted gods,\" and with each stanza of the hymn one fetter broke, until he had completed the hymn with a number of stanzas equal to the number of fetters. Then he faced the temple and preached the law.\n\nHere ends the story of the great teacher M\u0101natunga.\n\nThen, one day, the king began to praise the learning of the pandits of his country, and to blame the land of Gujar\u0101t for the stupidity of its people, when a representative of the king of Gujar\u0101t said to him, \"Not one of your distinguished pandits is fit to be weighed in the balance even with a man of our country who has been a cowherd from his childhood.\" Then king Bh\u012bma, having been informed of this occurrence, sent to king Bhoja's capital, once on a time, a pandit dressed as a cowherd, and a hetuera. When they arrived there, the cowherd was taken before the king in the early morning, and Bhoja ordered him to say something, so he said,\u2014Bhoja, tell me what kind of fitness has this ornament on your neck, Why do you place a barrier between Lak\u1e63mi on your breast and Sarasvat\u012b in your mouth?\n\nThis is what the Sarasvatik\u0101ntabhara\u1e47a cowherd said. Then the king\n\n1 Here P gives prabh\u0101vavibhava. I follow the text.\n2 This is the beginning of the Bhaktamaratotra. The feet of the Jina increase the brightness of the crest-jewels of the immortals. I have added a few words taken from the poem, to complete the sense. It contains forty-four stanzas.\n3 Sth\u0101napurus. Forbes (R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, p. 188) gives \"man of the country\" as the equivalent of this word. It is clear that this man was a native of Gujar\u0101t. Perhaps it might be translated \"consul.\"\n4 I read gop\u0101 for go with P and B.\n5 According to Hemacandra (iv. 352) Lacchih\u012b must be locative singular. In a and B I find uri Lacchih\u012b muhi Sarasatih\u012b. P gives nibaddhi k\u0101i\u1e25.\n6 These words are not in a and B.\nwas astonished at his speech. When the assembly-hall was adorned with visitors, king Bhoja, seeing in front of him the hetaera fully attired, addressed to her this unexpected speech, \"Why here?\" Then that fair one, being a storehouse of intellect, chosen by Sarasvati as a vessel of her favour, as if through partiality for her own kind, resembling incarnate cleverness, understood the real meaning of his remark though it was obscure, and returned this answer to the king, \"They are asking.\" The face of king Bhoja was expanded at her appropriate reply, and he ordered three lakhs to be given to her. Though he said it to the superintendent of the treasury three times, he, not understanding the real state of affairs, did not give the money. Then the king said out loud to him, \"Out of regard for the good of my country, and owing to the utter niggardliness of my character, I order only three lakhs to be given to her, but from the point of view of generosity even a kingdom would be too small a present.\" When the king said this, the superintendent of the treasury, at the instigation of all the courtiers, asked the king the connection between the two utterances, and received this answer, \"Observing that the two lines of collyrium applied to the outer corners of her two eyes had simultaneously extended themselves to her ears, I said, 'Why here?' But she, in accordance with the rule of the Prakrit grammar, that the plural should be used instead of the dual, answered, 'They are asking.' She, in fact, gave as her answer that her two eyes had gone disguised as collyrium-streaks to her ears, to inquire whether I was the very king Bhoja that the ears had previously heard about. So she is simply Sarasvati manifested in visible form. Accordingly, what are three lakhs by way of recompense to her?\" Then, as he had uttered the words \"three lakhs\" three times (in speaking to the superintendent of the treasury), he caused nine lakhs to be given to her.\n\nNow that king, even from his childhood, was unremitting in the practice of virtue, because he recognized the truth embodied in the following lines:\n\nIf these people only saw death, which is impending over their heads,\nEven their food would give them no pleasure, much less the doing what\nthey ought not to do.\n\nOne day, just after he had woke up from sleep, a learned man came to\n\n---\n\n1 I substitute with a and \u03b2 and P, \u00e7aririni for \u00e7iromani.\n2 I find in a, de\u00e7asamy\u0101t prakrtik\u0101rpany\u0101t laksatray\u0101m. I have followed the printed text.\n3 Even a rich kingdom according to a.\n4 I read with P, prcchannityabhidadhe. This gives a better sense than the printed text.\n5 P and \u03b2 insert s\u016btra between pr\u0101k\u1e5bta and l\u0101ksan\u0101t, \"according to the direction of the Pr\u0101k\u1e5bta S\u016btra.\" I find s\u016btra similarly inserted in a. The S\u016btra will be found on page 157 of Cowell's Edition of Vararuci's Pr\u0101k\u1e5bta Prak\u0101\u015ba.\nhim and said, \"The lord of the dead\\(^1\\) is approaching you mounted on a swift horse, consequently you must be prompt in the practice of virtue.\" Accordingly he gave every day an appropriate gift to the learned author of this speech. One day he sat down on the throne in the hall of audience in the afternoon, and he threw a p\u0101n-leaf into his mouth and devoured it, before the areca-nut and other ingredients were presented from the store in the betel-box. When those who knew the usual etiquette asked him why he did that, he said, \"As men are within the teeth of death, what they give and what they enjoy may be said to be their own, but about the rest there is a doubt, and so\u2014\n\nEvery day, when one gets up from one's bed, one must consider what good action is to be done to-day,\nThe sun will go to its setting, taking away a part of one's life.\nPeople ask what news there is with me, saying, 'Is there health in your body?'\nHow can health be ours? Life departs day by day.\nOne should do to-day the duty of to-morrow, and in the forenoon the duty of the afternoon,\nFor death will not consider whether one has done one's work or not.\\(^2\\)\nIs death dead, is old age decrepit, are disasters destroyed?\nAre diseases then arrested,\\(^3\\) that these people are so merry?\"\n\nHere ends the story of the four couplets on impermanence.\n\nThen, once on a time, king Bhoja asked king Bh\u012bma by the mouth of an ambassador, for four things. The first thing exists in this world and not in the next; the second thing exists in the next world and not in this; the third thing exists in both; the fourth thing is non-existent in both. The learned were puzzled about the matter. So a drum was beaten round the city, and by the advice of a hetaera, (who solved the problem), the four things were sent, in the shape of a hetaera, an ascetic, an exceedingly liberal man, and a gambler. Here ends the story about the four things.\n\nOn another occasion, king Bhoja, as he was roaming about at night in search of adventures, heard the following couplet being recited by a certain poor man's wife:\u2014\n\nTen conditions are allotted to every man, so runs the popular proverb that we hear,\nBut my husband has only one condition, the remaining nine have been obtained by others.\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Yama, the god of death, who generally rides on a buffalo.\n\\(^2\\) The first three couplets will be found in B\u00f6htlingk's Indische Spr\u00fcche with slight variations: 1 is No. 1204, 2 is No. 5897, 3 is No. 6596. B\u00f6htlingk translates k\u1e63ma adya suk\u1e5btai\u1e25 k\u1e5btam by \"welches gute Werk wird heute vollbracht?\"\n\\(^3\\) I follow the reading of the printed text. But perhaps vy\u0101dhi\u1e25, the reading of a, b, and apparently c, is better. This would mean, \"Are diseases diseased?\"\n\\(^4\\) I have endeavoured to translate the reading of the printed text, but I find that\nThe king, feeling pity for her miserable condition, summoned her husband to the court in the morning, and thinking of something that would be to her advantage in the long run, gave him two citrons, putting in each of them a jewel worth a lakh, in order to benefit him. He, not knowing that fact, sold them for a price in the vegetable market, and the man who bought them gave those two citrons to some one as a present, and he gave them to king Bhoja.\n\nEven if a jewel rolled about by the great waves of the tide has reached a mountain brook,\nIt again sets out on its journey and returns to the ocean, the home of jewels.\n\nConsidering this, king Bhoja came to the conclusion that fortune was right,\u00b9 for,\u2014\nEven when the rains gratify the whole world, the c\u0101taka will certainly not receive\nOne drop of water, for how is to be attained the unattainable?\n\nHere ends the story of the citrons.\n\nThen, on another occasion, the king, having secretly taught a pet parrot, during a certain night, the words, \"Alone is not becoming,\" instructed it that it was next morning to utter these words in the assembly of pandits.\u00b2 Accordingly, when the parrot said this, the king asked the pandits what the parrot meant, but they, not being able to solve the problem, asked for a term of six months. Then Vararuci, the head of them, wandering about in a foreign land, in order to discover the solution, was thus addressed by a certain herdsman, \"I will tell your master the answer to the puzzle, but I cannot on account of my age carry this dog,\u00b3 and on account of my affection for him I cannot leave him.\" When he said this, Vararuci put the dog upon his own shoulder, and taking the herdsman with him, went to the audience-hall of the king, and informed him that the herdsman would give him an answer to his riddle. Then the king asked the herdsman the meaning of that very utterance of the parrot. He answered, \"In this world of living creatures, O king, covetousness alone is not becoming.\" The king again\n\n\u00b9 The word \"fortune\" is omitted in \u03b1 and \u03b2. The passage will therefore mean, \"Reflecting on the case of the poor man, the king considered the statement in the above couplet to be true.\"\n\u00b2 I have adopted panditasabha\u1e0dy\u0101\u1e41 from \u03b1.\n\u00b3 I find in \u03b1 and \u03b2, \u1e63v\u0101na\u00e7vum, this puppy.\n\nin P the second line ends thus, avari te corhi\u1e41 liddha, those remaining ones have been taken by thieves. The reading of \u03b1 and \u03b2 gives the following sense, \"The gods have framed for men ten states apiece, but my husband has only one, the (other) nine have been stolen by thieves.\" I take atari as equivalent to upari.\nasked him, \"Why?\" He answered, \"That a Brahman carries on his shoulder a dog, which he ought not even to touch, is a manifestation of covetousness; therefore covetousness is not becoming.\"\n\nThen, on another occasion, the king, roaming about at night accompanied only by a friend, being afflicted with thirst, went to the house of a hetaera, and by the mouth of his friend asked for water. Then the gambh\u0101li with genuine affection, after some delay, brought a cocoanut-shell full of sugar-cane juice, not without distress. When the king's friend asked her the cause of her distress, she said, \"In old times a stalk of sugar-cane contained enough juice in all to fill a pitcher together with a v\u0101ha\u1e6dik\u0101, but now that the king's mind is evilly disposed towards his subjects, for a long time the stalk of a sugar-cane has yielded only enough juice to fill a v\u0101ha\u1e6dik\u0101; this is the cause of my distress.\" When the king heard that, he reflected that, when a certain merchant exhibited a great play in the temple of \u0100iva, he had formed the intention of plundering him, and that so the gambh\u0101li's speech was true; then he went back from that place, and after reaching his own palace, went to sleep. The next day the king, having become full of compassion for his subjects, went to the house of the hetaera; and then the gambh\u0101li said, \"It is evident from the sign, that there is abundance of sugar-cane juice, that the king is now loving to his subjects.\" So the king was pleased with her. Here ends the story of the sugar-cane juice.\n\nThen the king was in the habit of going continually to worship his family goddess that was set up in a temple in a suburb of the city of Dh\u0101r\u0101, and one day the goddess, who had been won over by his devotion, appearing in visible form, said to the king, \"The enemies' army has come near, so depart quickly.\" With these words she dismissed him. Immediately he saw that he was surrounded by the Gujar\u0101ti soldiers. He galloped off on his horse, which was of surpassing swiftness, and as he was entering the gate of the city of Dh\u0101r\u0101, two Gujar\u0101ti cavalry soldiers, named \u0100l\u016bya and Akol\u016bya, threw their bows over his neck and saying, \"So near have you come to being killed,\" let him go.\n\n---\n\n1 The covetousness of Brahmans is a perpetual subject of satire in Sanskrit literature. We learn from page 171 of the translation of the Har\u1e63a Carita by Cowell and Thomas, that a \"Brahman without greed\" is hard to find.\n\n2 i.q. kuffant.\n\n3 I presume that v\u0101ha\u1e6dik\u0101 is the Gujar\u0101ti \u1e6d\u0101\u1e6di, which has the following meanings: 1, a saucer-form vessel of metal; 2, a half of a cocoanut-shell; anything hollow like a cup.\n\n4 I find in a, viruddhe n\u1e5bpam\u0101nase, and in b, viruddham\u0101nase nrpe.

As the spectators were running in all directions, the vibration of the earth produced by their trampling threw down on the ground and broke the vessels of a woman who sold buttermilk; and the king, seeing that her face was as radiant as ever, though the milk was running like the stream of a river, said to her, \"What is the reason that you are not despondent?\" When the king asked her this question, she said,\u2014\nHaving slain a king, and having beheld my husband bitten\\footnote{I read d\u0101s\u0101n\u0101 with \\(P\\).} by a serpent,\nI became by the power of fate a hetaera in a foreign country,\nHaving married my own son, I then entered the funeral fire:\nBeing now the wife of a cowherd, how can I mourn for buttermilk.\n\nThey said that from that place a great river\\footnote{I think that we ought to read mah\u0101nadi.

At that moment the teacher Candana, wearing the dress of a \u0106vet\u0101mbara, came to have an interview with him, and as he was one who pleased by his ready wit, he uttered an appropriate saying,\u2014\nLet this rock be pierced again and again, but henceforth, king, be merciful,\nand abandon\nYour delight in the vicious custom of piercing stones by way of sport, with\nthe bow,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Asau guniti matveva Bhojah katham upeyus\u0101}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Dhanus\u0101 gu\u015bma yasya nacyanna\u1e0dan na p\u0101ti\u0101h.}\n\\]\n\nBy whose strung bow, though it reached his neck, Bhoja, when flying, was not hurled from his horse, as if supposing that he was virtuous (or strung). The bow belonged of course to Bh\u012bma. \\(P\\) reads ya\u010dca pa\u010dyannacv\u0101nnip\u0101tita.

This I have followed.}\nIf this amusement is allowed to extend further, you will make the family of principal mountains\\(^1\\) the butt of your archery,\n\nThen, O best of kings, the earth, losing its supports, will go to the bottom of Hades.\n\nThe king was astonished at the wonderful poetical ability displayed in this stanza, but, after reflecting a little, he said, \u201cThe fact that you, being one who has entirely mastered all the sacred books, have uttered a line beginning \u2018Dh\u0101r\u0101 is ruined,\u2019\u2014that forebodes some great misfortune.\u201d\n\nAnd thus it came to pass.\n\nThe queen of the country of D\u0101hala, Demati by name, was a great witch, and once on a time, when she was about to have a child, she kept continually asking the astrologers, \u201cIn what auspicious moment must a son be born in order to be lord of the whole earth?\u201d Then they carefully considered the matter, and said, \u201cWhen the benign planets are in the signs that contain their exaltation, and are at the same time in the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth houses, which are called centres, and the malign planets are in the third, sixth and eleventh houses,\\(^2\\)\u2014a son, that is born in such a moment, will be king of the whole earth.\u201d When she heard that response, she delayed, by employing magic arts, the birth of her child for sixteen watches beyond the natural day for her delivery, and in the moment fixed by the astrologers she gave birth to a son named Karna. But owing to the injury to her health produced by thus delaying the birth, she died in the eighth watch. Because Karna was born in an auspicious moment, he conquered by his valour the circle of the regions, he was obeyed by one hundred and thirty-six kings, he attained great excellence in the four royal sciences, and he was praised by Vidy\u0101pati and other great poets. Thus the stanzas ran:\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) There are seven principal mountains in India. The mountains are held to support the earth. But dhvast\u0101dh\u0101ra, if resolved into two words, means \u201cDh\u0101r\u0101 is ruined.\u201d\n\n\\(^2\\) I owe this translation to Professor Jacobi of Bonn. He thinks it impossible that the benign planets should stand in the ucca signs and at the same time in the \u201ccentres,\u201d since the former are so disposed that they could not well come into the position of the \u201ccentres.\u201d At the same time it appears that the horoscope under consideration is derived from the rules of the J\u0101taka. For in the Laghuj\u0101taka, ix. 23, it is said triprabh\u1e5btihi\u1e25 uccastha\u1e25 n\u1e5bpa\u015b\u0101nta\u1e25 bhavanti r\u0101j\u0101\u1e25.

Professor Jacobi refers me to his dissertation, \u201cDe astrologiae Indicis hor\u0101 appellate originibus.\u201d Bonn, 1872. I have translated his Latin into English.\nOn the face was the hanging of a necklace, on the two eyes the weight\na bracelet,\nOn the hips ornamental tattooing, and the two hands were marked with\nthe patch;\nIn the forest, O king Karna, why has this strange style of adornment\nNow, alas! befallen the wives of thy enemies, owing to the mighty\ndestiny?\u00b9\nAbandoning the breast of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u too much engrossed by the gop\u012bs,\nThe goddess of Fortune dwells in your eyes, mistaking them, I think, for\nlotuses,\nSince, O fortunate king Karna, wherever goes the spray of your eyebrows\nwavy like a creeper,\nThere is broken the seal of poverty, brittle through fear.\n\nIn this way was king Karna praised. One day that king sent a message\nto Bhoja by the mouth of an ambassador, \u201cIn your city there are 108\ntemples built by your orders, and even so many in number are your\npoetical compositions, and so many are your titles: therefore conquer me\nin battle with a force of four arms,\u00b2 or in single combat, or as a disputant\nin the four sciences, or in the faculty of munificence, and become\npossessor of 105 titles; otherwise, by conquering you, I shall become\nlord of 137 kings.\u201d When king Bhoja received this message, the lotus\nin his face became faded, and reflecting that the king of the city of Benares\nwas apt to be victorious in every way, and considering himself as good as\nconquered, he humbly solicited him, and got him to agree to the following\narrangement, \u201cI in Avanti, and Karna in Benares, shall, on the same day\nand at the same moment, select the sites\u00b3 of two temples fifty cubits in height, and begin to build them, running them up in rivalry with one another, and on whichever king\u2019s temple the finial\u2074 and the flag shall first be set up, on that day of festival the rival king must abandon his umbrella\n\n\u00b9 The expression translated \u201cornamental tattooing\u201d may also mean \u201ca row of leaves,\u201d and the word translated \u201cpatch\u201d may also refer to the Tilaka tree. The word k\u0101k\u0101ya, which means \u201cbracelet,\u201d may also, according to the smaller Petersburg Dictionary, mean \u201cdrops of water,\u201d and h\u0101ra, which means \u201cnecklace,\u201d may also mean \u201cdeprivation,\u201d \u201cremoving,\u201d \u201closs.\u201d\n\u00b2 i.e. elephants, chariots, cavalry and infantry. The four sciences are the triple Veda, logic and metaphysics, the science of government, and practical arts.\n\u00b3 See Hillebrandt, Ritual-Litteratur, p. 80. \u201cA trench is dug of the depth of the knee, and the earth taken out is shovelled in again. If the earth stands above the level of the ground, the site is good, if it is even with the surrounding soil, it is tolerable, if not, bad. Another method is to fill the trench with water overnight; if the water runs away, the site is bad.\u201d The authority will be found in \u0100\u015bval\u0101yana\u2019s G\u1e5bhya S\u016btra, ii. 8. It will be observed that \u0100\u015bval\u0101yana uses the words garta and parip\u0101rayet.\n\u2074 Dr. Burgess informs me that kala\u00e7a is really the finial of the spire, which is shaped like a vase or urn. The setting up of the flagstaff is sometimes a separate function from the setting up of the kala\u00e7a, according to Mr. Cousens.\nand chowries,\u00b9 and mount an elephant, and come in.\u201d When this agreement of king Bhoja, which was quite in accordance with Kar\u1e47a\u2019s wishes, reached that sovereign, he was eager to defeat king Bhoja in that very way, and so both temples were begun separately on the same day, in the same moment. Kar\u1e47a, who was having his own temple constructed\u00b2 with all diligence, asked his architect, \u201cTell me, in one day between the rising and the setting of the sun, how much work can be run up?\u201d\u00b3 Then that architect on the fourteenth day, which was a day on which the Vedas are not read,\u2074 began there eleven temples, seven cubits in height, at dawn, and had them finished by the end of the day, as far as the setting up of the finial, and showed them to the king. The king was delighted in his heart with all that despatch of work, and as the finishing touches\u2075 were being put to his temple, he diligently imposed the finial on his own temple, and ascertained a lucky moment for setting up the flag, and in accordance with that promise summoned king Bhoja by an ambassador. Then king Bhoja, sovereign of the country of M\u0101lava, being afraid of breaking his promise, and not being able to go in the required way, remained silent. Then king Kar\u1e47a, as soon as he had set up the flag on the temple, set out with the above-mentioned number of kings,\u2076 to make war on king Bhoja, and at the same time he invited Bh\u012bma to attack the country of M\u0101lava in the rear, promising him the half of Bhoja\u2019s kingdom. Then king Bhoja, being attacked by those two kings, lost his pride, as a snake, overcome with a charm, loses its poison. And then a sudden corporal malady took hold of Bhoja, and king Bh\u012bma, as all the mountain passes and fords were closed, and his own officers refused to allow any foreigners to approach him, applied by means of one of his servants to his own diplomatic agent D\u0101mara, who was in the court of king Kar\u1e47a, in order to ascertain the condition of Bhoja. D\u0101mara taught the servant a g\u0101th\u0101, and sent him off, and so he came to the assembly-hall of king Bh\u012bma. The g\u0101th\u0101 ran as follows:\u2014\n\nThe fruit of the mango is fully ripe; the stalk is loose; the wind is high;\nThe branch is withering; we do not know the end of the business.\n\nThis g\u0101th\u0101 induced king Bh\u012bma to remain quiet.\nThen Bhoja, as his journey to the other world drew nigh, performed the\n\n\u00b9 The distinctive emblems of a monarch.\n\u00b2 I read nirm\u0101payan with P; \u03b2 has nirm\u0101yayan; \u03b1, nirmapayan.

This might mean, \u201cas the construction of the dome of his temple was going on.\u201d I do not understand the printed text.\n\u2076 Viz. 136.\nreligious duties appropriate to the occasion, and gave the following order,\n\"After my death, my hands are to be placed outside my chariot,\" and then\nwent to heaven.\n\nWhose hand, O wife and son! Alas! whose hand, O all my house?\nAlone I come, alone I go, having rubbed my two hands and feet.\n\nThis speech of Bhoja's was repeated to the people by a het\u0101era, and\nKar\u1e47a, hearing of that occurrence, broke down the fort and took all the\nwealth of Bhoja. Then Bh\u012bma sent the following order to D\u0101mara, \"You\nmust either give me the half of the kingdom stipulated for by me, obtaining\nit from king Kar\u1e47a, or your own head.\" Accordingly, desirous of carry-\ning out the orders of his sovereign, he entered the royal pavilion with thirty-\ntwo foot-soldiers, and took Kar\u1e47a prisoner, when he was asleep in the\nmiddle of the day. Then he put in one division a shrine of gods, of which\nthe chief were \u010civa, the C\u0101l\u0101gr\u0101ma stone and Gane\u1e63a, and in the other he\nplaced all the property of the kingdom, and said to the king, \"Take which-\never half you please.\" Having said this, he kept quiet for sixteen watches,\nbut afterwards by order of king Bh\u012bma he took the shrine, and made a\npresent of it to king Bh\u012bma. Now the whole of the story is summed up in\nthe two following connected stanzas:\n\nTwo temples of a god, fifty cubits in height, having in the same auspicious\nmoment\nBeen previously begun, whichever of the monarchs first imposes the finial,\nto him\nThe other king must come without umbrella and chowries, this having been\nagreed,\nKing Bhoja, his mind being averse to expenditure, was conquered by king\nKar\u1e47a.\nKing Bhoja having gone to heaven, the very powerful Kar\u1e47a, while engaged\nIn sacking the town of Dh\u0101r\u0101, by solicitation made Bh\u012bma his ally,\nAnd Kar\u1e47a was taken prisoner by Bh\u012bma's servant D\u0101mara, and from him\nwere extracted\nA golden shrine, and the lord \u010civa associated with Gane\u1e63a.\n\n1 I read with \u03b1 and \u03b2, matparikalpita\u1e41 r\u0101jy\u0101rdha\u1e41 niya\u00e7iro v\u0101.\n2 For the ch\u0101ndy\u0101\u1e41 of the text \u03b1 has band\u0101hyai, \u03b2, ch\u0101ndye, P, b\u0101ndya\u1e41.

This I follow.\n5 Here we have bandik\u1e5btat\".\nThen the poet Karp\u016bra recited in the presence of Kar\u1e47a the poem beginning \"On the face was the hanging of a necklace.\" But as he used ungrammatical expressions, the king did not give anything to that poet. Then the poet N\u0101cir\u0101ja uttered the following stanza,\u2014\n\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u, the enemy of Kai\u1e6dabha, holds these three worlds in the hollow of his belly;\nThe king of the snakes joyfully supports him with this great weight inside him,\nAnd that king of the snakes was the necklace of \u00c7iva; bearing that god in your heart,\nYou, king Kar\u1e47a, have destroyed in your enemies even the mention of valour.\n\nThereupon the king recompensed him as follows,\u2014\n\nHe gave a crore of gold pieces and ten furious elephants,\nThis was given by king Kar\u1e47a in his joy to the poet N\u0101cir\u0101ja.\n\nThen the poet Karp\u016bra, incited by his wife, uttered this stanza in the road, in front of the poet N\u0101cir\u0101ja, as he was coming along,\u2014\n\nLady, who are you? Do you not know even me, poet Karp\u016bra? Are you Sarasvat\u012b?\nTell me truly, why are you sad? I have been robbed, my child. By what evil destiny, mother?\nHave your two eyes, Mu\u00f1ja and Bhoja, been taken? How do you subsist?\nThe long-lived poet N\u0101cir\u0101ja acts the part of a stick to the blind.\n\nThe poet N\u0101cir\u0101ja, being pleased, gave to the poet Karp\u016bra all that the king had given to himself.\n\nSuch are some of the various stories recorded about Bhoja, the rest must be considered to be based on oral tradition.\n\nKing, when the cloud of your hand had begun its auspicious ascent in the ten quarters of the heavens,\nAnd was raining the nectar-flood of gold, with the splendour of the trembling golden bracelet flickering like lightning,\nThe river of fame became swollen; all virtues were refreshed like the earth;\nThe lake of petitioners was filled, and the forest-fire of the poverty of the learned was extinguished.\nLike the wishing-tree, having frightened away by his munificent gifts all poverty on the earth,\nLike an incarnate Vrhaspati, having swiftly put together various compositions,\nIn R\u0101dh\u0101vedha like Arjuna, summoned speedily by the bands of immortals,\nWhose hearts were long ago made to wish for him by his glory, king Bhoja went to heaven.\n\nHere ends the second chapter in the Prabandhacint\u0101ma\u1e47i composed by the \u0101c\u0101rya Merutunga, entitled the description of the various achievements of the kings Bhoja and Bh\u012bma.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE HISTORY OF SIDDHAR\u0100JA.\n\nThen, once on a time, in the land of Gujar\u0101t, the rains having been checked by drought, the people of the country were unable to render to the king the share of the produce due to him, and so they were brought to Pattana by officers employed by him, and their presence was notified to him. Then, one day, in the early morning, prince M\u016blar\u0101ja, as he was wandering in that direction, saw all the people being harassed by the king's officers, in connection with the king's share that was to be deducted from the grain, and having heard all the circumstances from his attendants, he had his eyes slightly suffused with tears from compassion. He pleased the king by his unequalled skill in the man\u1e0de\u015ba, and having been commanded by the king to choose some boon, he requested that it might be laid up in store. The king said to him, \"Why do you not ask for something?\" He answered, \"Because I do not feel certain that I shall obtain what I want.\" Then, as the king pressed him exceedingly, he asked him, by way of boon, that those heads of families might be relieved from payment of the king's share. Then the king's eyes were filled with tears of joy, and he consented, saying, \"So be it;\" and said to him, \"Make another request.\" But the prince remembered the stanza,\n\n1 I read jav\u0101dd\u1e5bbdha with \u03b2: a has jav\u0101; P has jav\u0101t or jav\u0101n.\n2 I read er\u0101g: B gives dr\u0101g.\n3 I follow P which gives sasya-nid\u0101nt-bh\u016bta-d\u0101nt-sambandha: a gives \"d\u0101na\", \u03b2, \"d\u0101nta\". It is evident from line 12 of page 129, and the first line of page 131 that d\u0101nta means the king's share.\n4 Cp. Chalmers's translation of the J\u0101takas, Vol. I., p. 24, and my translation of the Kath\u0101 Ko\u1e63a, p. 48.\n5 Or perhaps simply Koonbees.

He finds it in the Vikram\u0101\u00f1kacarita, and C\u0101ryagadharapaddhati.}\n\nBy the help of the teaching of this stanza, the prince restrained excessive greed, and owing to his soul being elevated by pride, he simply returned to his palace without asking for anything.\\footnote{Here I follow P which reads tata\u1e25 kimapyath\u0101narthya ma\u1e47onnataya, omitting bh\u0101s\u0101.} Then, on the third day after, being praised by the heads of families,\\footnote{Or Koonbee folk (?).} that prince M\u016blar\u0101ja went to the heavenly world. The king and the courtiers and the people, who were previously begged off by him, were for a long time plunged in a sea of grief on that account, but at length wise men, by dint of various admonitions, extracted their dart of grief. Then, as in the next year, all the corn grew up successfully, thanks to the rain, the cultivators offered to pay the share due to the king for two years, the past as well as the present year,\\footnote{For prad\u012bpyamane, P, a and \u03b2 give pravicyamane.} but the king refused to receive it. Thereupon they convoked a court of appeal, and of the members of that court the characteristics were as follows,\u2014\nThat is not a court in which there are not elders,\nThose are not elders who do not utter justice,\nAnd that is not justice in which there is not truth,\nThat is not truth which is pervaded by fiction.\\footnote{This is No. 9488 in B\u00f6htlingk's Indische Spr\u00fcche. He finds it in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, the Hitopade\u1e63a, and the C\u0101ryagadharapaddhati.}\n\nIn accordance with these principles the members of the court decided the matter, and made the king take his share for the previous year and that year. Then, with that money, and other money contributed from the treasury, king Bh\u012bma caused to be built a new temple, called Tripurusa\u1e43pr\u0101\u015b\u0101da, for the welfare of prince M\u016blar\u0101ja. He also caused to be built in Pattana the temples of Bh\u012bme\u015bvaradeva and the goddess Bh\u012bru\u1e47i. He began to reign in 1077 V.S. and reigned forty-two years, ten months, and nine days. His queen, named Udayamati, caused to be made in Pattana a new reservoir, surpassing even the Sahasralinga lake. Then king Karn\u0101's coronation took place in 1120 V.S., on the seventh day of\nthe black fortnight of Caitra, on a Monday, in the nak\u1e63atra of Hasta, in the lagna of Pisces.\n\nNow it happened that a king of Karn\u0101\u1e6da, named \u00c7ubhake\u00e7in, was run away with by his horse and carried into a forest, and while he was enjoying in some part of it the shade of a leafy tree, a forest conflagration approached him. Owing to a sense of gratitude, he did not like to leave that tree that had benefited him by giving him rest, and so he made his life a burnt-offering in that fire, together with the tree. Then his son, named Jayake\u00e7in, was placed on his throne by his ministers, and in course of time he had born to him a daughter, named Mayapalladevi. And she, merely on hearing the name of Some\u00e7vara mentioned by some votaries of \u00c7iva, remembered her former birth. She said to herself, \"In a former life I was a Br\u0101hma\u1e47i, and I performed twelve fasts of a month's duration, and on the completion of each fast I gave away twelve things, and then I set out to worship Some\u00e7vara, and I reached the town of B\u0101huloda,\\(^1\\) but not being able to pay the duty levied there, I was not allowed to proceed further, and in despair thereat I made an earnest aspiration that in my next birth I might bring about the remission of that duty, and then I died and was born in this family.\" This was her recollection with regard to her former birth. Then, in order that she might procure the remission of the tax at B\u0101huloda, she longed for the king of Gujar\u0101t as an eligible bridegroom, and told the whole story to her father. Then king Jayake\u00e7in, hearing of that circumstance, asked Karna through his ministers, to accept the gift of his daughter Mayapalladevi's hand.\\(^2\\) But king Karna, having heard of her plainness, was indifferent to her, so at last, as Mayanalladevi was obstinately determined on marrying him, her father sent her to king Karna, as a maiden choosing her own husband. Then king Karna, having himself secretly observed the fact of her ugliness, became altogether neglectful of her. Accordingly Mayanalladevi and her eight companions made up their minds to sacrifice their lives in order to compass the death of the king; but Karna's mother Udayamati,\\(^3\\) hearing of this intention of theirs, and not being able to witness their death, made a vow to live or die with them, for\u2014\n\nThe great are not as much afflicted in their own calamity, as in the calamities of others,\n\nThe earth, which is immovable in its own shocks, trembles in the woes of others.\n\n\\(^1\\) Now Bh\u0101lod, a ford of the Nerbudda river a little above Shookulteerth.

There seems to be a misprint in the text.\n\n\\(^3\\) Deyamati in the printed text is clearly a misprint. The MSS. give Udayamati.\nThen king Karna, discovering that a great calamity was at hand, married Mayanalladevi out of regard for his mother, and afterwards did not honour her even with a look. One day the minister Mu\u00f1j\u0101la, finding out by means of the chamberlain, that the king was in love with a woman of low rank, dressed up Mayanalladevi in her clothes and ornaments, and sent her, after the usual monthly ablution, to secretly take the place of that woman. As the king supposed that she was that very woman, he received her ardently and she became pregnant. Then she, by way of a convincing proof of the interview, took from the king's hand a ring marked with his name and placed it on her own hand. Then, the next morning, the king was prepared to forfeit his life on account of that sinful deed, and asked the doctors of canonical law the proper expiation for it. They informed him that he must embrace a red-hot copper image, but when he was about to comply with their command in order to expiate his sin, the minister told him the real facts of the case. To that son, who was born in an auspicious moment, the king gave the name of Jayasimha. He, when a child of three years old, as he was playing with some young princes of the same age, adorned the throne, by sitting down on it. As the astrologers said that that very moment was one likely to bring about prosperity, the king performed then and there the coronation of that son. In 1150 V.S. on the third day of the dark fortnight of Pau\u1e63a, on a Saturday, in the nak\u1e63atra of \u00c7rava\u1e47a, in the lagna of Taurus, the coronation of Siddhar\u0101ja took place. But Karna himself went to attack a Bhilla named \u0100\u00e7\u0101 dwelling in \u0100\u00e7\u0101palli, and an omen of Bhairavadevi having taken place, he built there a temple to the goddess named Kocharaba, and after conquering the Bhilla, who was king over six lakhs, he established there in a temple the goddess Jayanti, and also he made the temple of Kar\u1e47e\u00e7vara, adorned with the lake of Karnas\u0101gara. He founded the city of Karn\u0101vati and reigned there himself. In Pattana he caused to be built the temple of Karnameru. This king began to reign in 1120 V.S., on the seventh day of the white fortnight of Caitra, and he reigned till the second day of the black fortnight of Pau\u1e63a in 1150 V.S., a\n\nJinamandana, the author of the Kum\u0101rak\u0101lacakita, tells us that the object of Mayanalladevi and her companions was to throw on the king the guilt of their death. I do not see how this meaning can be obtained from Merutunga's words.\n\n1 This story reminds one of Shakespeare's play, All's Well that Ends Well.\n2 Bhairava is omitted in a and B. Probably the reference is to an owl.\n3 According to Forbes this name is still preserved in that of a locality on the bank of the river immediately contiguous to Ahmedabad. \u0100\u00e7\u0101palli is now Ashawul. (Forbes's R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, p. 9.)\n4 In the R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, p. 80, we learn that this lake was made by damming up the river Roopeyn. The river broke through the embankment in 1814. The remains of the reservoir are known as the \"ten mile tank.\"\n5 This word appears to mean \"the Meru of Karna.\" According to the Brhat Samhita LVI, 20, quoted by B\u00fchler in his article, \"On the origin of the town of Ajmer and its name,\" Vienna Oriental Journal, 1897, p. 56, Meru in this connection means \"a large temple with six towers, twelve storeys and wonderful vaults.\"\nperiod of twenty-nine years, eight months and twenty-one days. Then, Karna having gone to heaven, Madanap\u0101la, the brother of queen Udayamati, behaved in an unbecoming way. One day he enticed into his own palace the royal physician named L\u012bl\u0101, who had gained favour by a boon of a deity, and was continually being honoured with gifts of gold by all the citizens, whose minds were astonished at his skill. The disease being a purely fictitious one, L\u012bl\u0101 examined his pulse and said that he did not require treatment. Madanap\u0101la said to him, \"You have misunderstood the case; the fact is that you were not called in by me to heal a bodily disease, but to cure my covetousness by administering a medicine to that, so hand over thirty-two thousand.\" Being imprisoned by Madanap\u0101la, he consented to do it. But he took a vow to the following effect, that from henceforth he would visit no house, with the single exception of the king's palace, for the purpose of curing disease, and so from that time forth he treated cases pathologically by examining the urine of patients. One day, a practical joker, wishing to test his skill in dealing with a fictitious complaint, showed him some bull's urine. The physician understood the matter thoroughly and shaking his head, he said, \"That bull is broken down in health from over-eating, and you must give him a clyster of oil immediately, otherwise he will die.\" By this sagacity he produced astonishment in the mind of the practical joker. One day the king asked him for a remedy for a pain in his neck. The physician said, \"By anointing with ointment made of two palas of musk, pain in the head is allayed.\" The prescription was followed and the king's neck was cured. Then a man of low caste, who was one of the bearers of the king's litter, asked him for a remedy for headache. He said, \"Make an ointment out of the juice of the root of a full-grown kavira, together with the earth attaching to it.\" Then the king said to him, \"What is the meaning of this?\" The physician answered, \"A man, who knows the science of healing, takes into consideration, in treating a patient, place and time, and strength, and the peculiarities of a man's constitution.\" On another occasion, some rogues conspired together, and formed themselves into separate couples, and the first couple said to him on the road to the market, \"Why are you in such feeble bodily health to-day?\" The second couple addressed the same question to him on the steps of the temple of Mu\u00f1j\u0101lasv\u0101min, the third couple at the gate of the palace, the fourth couple under the arch of the doorway, and so over and over again the same question was addressed to him; and owing to the shock\n\n1 I find in a and P, pathyasajjat\u0101muce. As griva sajjibh\u0101ta, on the same page of the printed text, means \"His neck was cured,\" we should perhaps have to translate this \"told him that he might be cured by treatment.\" But it is improbable that our author would represent L\u012bl\u0101 as making a mistake.\n\n2 P omits vaddha.\nto his system, brought about by the fear that these repeated questions produced, he immediately contracted a m\u0101hendra fever, and on the thirteenth day that physician died. Here ends the story of the physician Lil\u0101.\n\nThen the son of Karna, by a device of the minister S\u0101nt\u016b, killed the tyrannical Madanap\u0101la, on pretence of going round on a royal circuit. Then a certain man residing in the country of Marwar, of the \u010cr\u012bm\u0101la tribe, a merchant, of the name of Uda, was going out at night in the rainy season, to buy a quantity of clarified butter, and seeing a field being flooded by workmen, with water from another field, he said to them, \"Who are you?\" They said, \"We are the well-wishers of So and So.\" He then asked, \"Have I also any well-wishers anywhere?\" They answered, \"You have some in Karn\u0101vati.\" Thereupon he went there with his family. He was worshipping the gods according to the prescribed custom in the V\u0101yatiya temple of the Jina, when a female dyer, a lay sister of the Jaina persuasion, named L\u0101chi, expressed her respect for him, on the ground of his being of the same creed as herself. She said to him, \"Whose guest are you, honoured Sir?\" He answered, \"I am a foreigner and your guest.\" So she took him with her, and had him fed with food which she caused to be cooked in the house of a certain merchant, and lodged him in a certain house on her own land. In course of time he acquired wealth, and being desirous of building an edifice of brick, he proceeded to dig the foundation, but in the process he discovered an enormous treasure. So he sent for that very lady, and wished to make the treasure over to her, but she declined to receive it. In virtue of his having acquired the treasure, he was henceforth known by the name of the minister Udayana. He caused to be built in the city of Karn\u0101vati the temple of Udayana, adorned with the images of the twenty-four Jinas of the past, present and future. He had four sons by different wives, C\u0101ha\u1e0dadeva, Amb\u0101ja, Boha\u1e0da, and Solaka.\n\nThen, on another occasion, the great minister, named S\u0101nt\u016b, as he was going in the royal circuit, mounted on the back of an elephant, was desirous on his return, of worshipping the god in the S\u0101nt\u016b temple, founded by\n\n1 According to Forbes, the minister conveyed the young prince to his own house, and caused Madanap\u0101la to be put to death by the hands of his soldiers.\n2 I read with \u03b1, \u03b2 and P, \u010cr\u012bm\u0101lavai\u1e47ya. I have translated Marumandala by Marwar. Maru means desert.\n3 I find that in the P\u0101iy\u0101lacch\u012b (ed. B\u00fchler), chimpao is said to mean a dyer. But the Gujar\u0101ti chipo is said to mean \"a cloth-printer, a stamper,\" and Sir Charles Lyall has pointed out to me that the Hindustani chipi means a cloth-printer.\n4 I find in \u03b1 and P, njatalake. This I have attempted to translate. In \u03b1, I find njatalake niv\u0101sya; \u03b2 has njatalpe t\u0101m niv\u0101sya.\n5 It appears from P, \u03b1 and \u03b2 that \"Ud\u0101na\" in the printed text is a misprint.\n6 Here we are directed by the Errata to read C\u0101ha\u1e0da. I find this in \u03b1, \u03b2 and P. For Boha\u1e0da, \u03b2 and P give B\u0101ha\u1e0da.\n7 The word vasahik\u0101 is here used. It means an aggregate of buildings, including a temple and monastery. (B\u00fchler's H.C. p. 57.)\nhimself, and as he was entering it with that object, he saw a certain \u0106vet\u0101mbara, who lived in the Jaina temple, with his hand placed on the shoulder of a hetaera. Then he descended from the elephant, and covering his face with his outer garment, he saluted him by prostrating himself before him, with five limbs on the ground. Then he waited a moment, and after prostrating himself before him again, he went on his way. Then that \u0106vet\u0101mbara, with his face cast down from shame, as if desirous of entering Hades, immediately renounced everything, and received ordination at the hands of the holy teacher, Maladh\u0101ri-Hemacandra, and filled with a spirit of religious fervour, went to \u0106atrunjaya, and performed asceticism for twelve years. Moreover, other men, similar to himself, were converted by him.\n\nThat hermit said to himself,\n\nO my soul, how dost thou, O my brother, run to and fro like a Pi\u00e7\u0101ca? Look on the indivisible Self, and become happy by abandoning passion. O mind, why dost thou fruitlessly run in the mirages of worldly existence? Why dost thou not step down into this ambrosial lake of Brahma?\n\nOnce on a time, that minister went to \u0106atrunjaya to worship the feet of the god, and prostrated himself before that hermit, as if he had never seen him before; and as his mind was delighted with his devout walk, he asked him about his teacher, his family, and so on. The hermit replied, \"You, sir, are in reality my teacher.\" When the hermit said that, the minister, in his ignorance of the facts, covered his ears with his hands, and said, \"Do not say so,\" but the hermit replied to him,\n\nHe who, whether he be under vows or a householder, establishes another in the pure religion,\nBecomes the religious teacher of that man, because he imparts to him religious truth.\n\nIn these words he informed the minister of the fundamental facts of the case, and brought about his confirmation in the faith.\n\nHere ends the story of the minister S\u0101ntu's confirmation in the faith.\n\nThen, immediately, Mayanalladevi, having told the circumstances of her\n\n---\n\n1 A pupil of that Abhayadevas\u016bri who received the title of Maladh\u0101rin from Karna, king of Gujar\u0101t (Sahvat 1120-1150).

When she reached the city of B\u0101huloda, the pa\u00f1cakula began to torment the pilgrims on account of his not having received the tax due to the king, and the pilgrims were made to return weeping. Thereupon, Mayanalladevi, on the mirror of whose heart their sorrow was reflected, herself turned back. Siddhar\u0101ja met her on the way, and said to her, \"Lady, away with this agitation! Why do you turn back?\" She answered, \"When this tax is altogether remitted, I will prostrate myself before the god Some\u00e7vara, and take food, but on no other condition.\" When the king heard this, he summoned the pa\u00f1cakula, and finding it stated in the numerical statement of the patent that the tax produced seventy-two lakhs, he tore up the patent, and giving up the tax for the spiritual welfare of his mother, he poured into her hand a handful of water. Then she went to Some\u00e7vara and solemnly offered before the god that offering of gold, and gave away her own weight in gold and many other gifts.\n\nEven the sea, being intent on accumulation only, has sunk to the lower parts of the earth,\nBut, observe, the cloud, which is a giver, roars above the heaven.\nArmy and retinue and all other appurtenances perish,\nFame alone remains, in the case of one who has produced joy by giving.\nThe giver has no friend like a petitioner, who relieves him of a burden,\nand, in truth,\nDelivers him, without his dying, from an enemy in the form of wealth.\n\nThen Mayanalladevi, having her head inflated with pride on account of her notion that no woman equal to her, in respect of great gifts, ever had existed or would exist, slept soundly. That very god Soman\u0101tha appeared to her, wearing the guise of an ascetic, and said to her, \"Here, in this very temple of mine, is a female pilgrim, who has come on a devotional visit to my shrine; you must ask her to transfer her merit to you.\" Having given this command, the god disappeared, and the woman was discovered after a\n\n1 It is clear from what precedes that Mayanalladevi married Karna in order to put an end to the dues levied at B\u0101huloda.\n2 P has nivarttayam\u0101nesu.

The female pilgrim, when she was asked to transfer her merit, refused to do so on any account, and when the queen asked her what she had spent on the pilgrimage, she answered, \"I travelled one hundred yojanas across a foreign country, begging my way, and yesterday I performed the fast usual on reaching a sacred spot, and on the day of breaking the fast, having obtained an oilcake from some charitable man, I offered a piece of it in worship to the god Some\u00e7vara, and gave a fragment to a guest, and with the rest I broke my own fast. Your Highness is one who must have accumulated merit in previous existences, as your father and brother on the one hand, and your husband and son on the other, were, or are kings. When you have brought about the remission of the tax levied on pilgrims at B\u0101hulodja, and have offered to Some\u00e7vara an offering of gold worth a lakh and a quarter, how comes it to pass that you are desirous of obtaining my merit? But if you will not be angry, I will say something:\u2014my merit is in reality greater than yours on the earth, for\u2014\n\nIn prosperity self-restraint, in power meekness, in youth austerity,\nIn poverty a gift, though very small, conduces to great gain.\"\n\nBy this appropriate speech she humbled the pride of the queen.\n\nBut Siddhar\u0101ja, being on the shore of the sea, was being praised by a bard with verses, of which the following couplet is a specimen:\u2014\n\nWho knows your mind, O sovereign? You have obtained the position of emperor,\nNow the son of Kar\u1e47a is looking for a practicable way to obtain the fruits of La\u1e45k\u0101.\n\nWhile the king was thus absent from his capital on this pilgrimage Ya\u00e7ovarman, the king of M\u0101lava, being on the look-out for an opportunity of carrying out a stratagem, began to overrun Gujar\u0101t, and when the minister S\u0101nt\u016b said to him, \"On what condition will you turn back?\" he said, \"I will do so if you will make over to me the merit which your master has gained by his pilgrimage to the shrine of the god Some\u00e7vara.\" When the minister received this answer, he washed the king's feet, and threw into the hollow of his hand a handful of water, as a sign of the transference of\n\n---\n\n1 I follow P which gives yojanacatantam de\u00e7antaram atikramya; a has yojanacatantam de\u00e7antaram.\n2 P inserts param before yadi.\n3 I find in P, yuktiyuktena, which is, probably, correct.\n4 I have followed the explanation given by the editor. All the three MSS. read lahu for lau. In other respects they differ much.\n5 P gives yatr\u0101v\u0101ryte which may mean \"returned from his pilgrimage.\" But it appears from a reading in P, which will be shortly referred to, that Siddhar\u0101ja was really absent.\nthat merit, and so he induced the king to turn back. Then Siddhar\u0101ja was angry when he heard of that occurrence, but the minister said to him, \"Your Majesty, your merit, which I have given away, goes, but, on the other hand, by what I have done I have given you his merit, and the merit of other people, who have accumulated great store of good deeds. When an enemy's army is entering one's country, it must be kept out by any artifice.\" By saying this he propitiated the king. Then the king, enraged on account of that inroad, was desirous of marching against the country of M\u0101lava, so he appointed ministers and craftsmen to superintend the construction of the holy place called Sahasralinga, and while this work was being rapidly hurried forward, the king started on his expedition to that country. There a war of twelve years' duration took place, in which the king was victorious, and he took this vow, \"I will not eat to-day until I have captured the fort of Dh\u0101r\u0101.\" The ministers and foot-soldiers killed the Param\u0101ra Rajputs by five hundred at a time, but still were unable to fulfil the king's vow by the end of the day; so he had to fulfil it in an equivocal manner by breaking into a Dh\u0101r\u0101 made of meal. Then the king was desirous of turning back, and he spoke to the minister Mu\u1e47\u1e0dj\u0101la. But he stationed his confidential emissaries in places where three roads met, in places where four roads met, in squares and temples, and they began to talk on the subject of the capture of the fort of Dh\u0101r\u0101. Thereupon a certain native of the city said, \"If the hostile force approaches the southern gate-tower, it will be possible to take the fort, but not otherwise.\" When the emissary heard this man's speech he informed that minister, who secretly communicated that fact to the king. The king, knowing that fact, brought his army to the southern gate-tower of the fort, and reckless of the fact that the fort was hard to enter, a mahout, named S\u0101mala, made a mighty elephant, named Yacalpataha, on which he was mounted, batter the two\n\n1 But P has C\u012bpattan\u0101gatam C\u012bt-Biddhar\u0101j\u0101n\u016b tadv\u1e5btt\u0101nt\u0101vagamanena kruddh\u0101n mantryevamar\u0101\u015bit, \"When Siddhar\u0101ja returned to Pattana, he was angry on hearing of that occurrence, but the minister said to him.\" I find in a C\u012bt-Siddhar\u0101ja C\u012bt-Pattanamupetya \u015a\u0101nt\u0101m (sic) M\u0101lacakarpayos tain v\u1e5btt\u0101ntam avabudhy\u0101 kruddh\u0101n ap\u0101ni mantri evam av\u0101dit; the same reading is found in b, but avabudhy\u0101.\n\n2 Probably the tank of this name. Forbes thus describes it\u2014\n\n\"It was one of the circular, or rather multilateral tanks, of which many examples, more or less perfect, are to be seen in Gujarat, and its name (which may be rendered 'the reservoir of the thousand temples of Shiva') was probably derived from numerous shrines of Muh\u0101 Dev encircling it.\" (Forbes's R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, p. 85.)\n\n3 Some MSS. insert durg\u0101 after Dh\u0101r\u0101. It would appear that the open part of the city was already captured.\n\n4 A somewhat similar story is told of the Queen of Spain with reference to the siege of Gibraltar.\n\n5 I have inserted the word daks\u012bna from \u03b2; a has dak\u1e63aya.\n\n6 But P has adhir\u016bdh\u0101\u1e25. Anyhow it is clear that the king also was mounted on the elephant.\npanels of the tripolika\\(^1\\) with its hind quarters, and break the iron bar. The elephant produced an internal rupture by its great exertion, and so the mahout made the son of Karna descend from it; but while he was getting down, himself, the elephant fell dead on the earth. Having lost its life by its martial valour, it returned to earth in the form of a Gane\u1e63a, named Ya\u1e0dodhavala, in the village of Ba\u1e0dasara, being white with its own glory.\\(^2\\)\n\nMay the elephant-faced Gane\u1e63a bestow on you prosperity, bearing but one tusk,\n\nAs if his other tusk had been broken on the full breast of Siddhi,\\(^3\\) as on the side of a mountain.\n\nIn these words is he praised. When Siddhar\u0101ja had thus accomplished the taking of the fort, and had bound Ya\u1e0dovarman, who had embarked on the war, with six cords, and had established there his sovereignty, respected by all men, he returned to Pattana, illustrious by having brought Ya\u1e0dovarman as a visible symbol of glory. Representatives of all the sects were summoned on separate days to utter blessings; and so, when the time came, the Jaina teachers, with Hemacandra at their head, having been invited, presented themselves before Siddhar\u0101ja, and were conciliated by the king with presents of clothes and other gifts. Though they were all charming by their incomparable readiness of intellect, they put Hemacandra in front of themselves in two senses, and he recited to the king the following blessing:\n\nO wishing-cow, sprinkle the earth with streams of thy products! O jewel-mines,\nMake a svastika of pearls! O moon, become a full pitcher!\nO elephants of the quarters, take leaves of the wishing-tree, and with your erected trunks\nMake temporary arches of foliage! For truly Siddhar\u0101ja is coming, having conquered the world.\\(^4\\)\n\nWhen this plain and sincere stanza was explained, the king's mind was\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Tripolika would appear to be the same word as the Urdu tripaliy\u0101 or tirpau-kiy\u0101, which Platts renders \"a building with three doors or gates.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) Glory is conceived of as white. Ya\u1e0dodhavala means \"white with glory.\"\n\n\\(^3\\) According to a note in s, Siddhi and Buddhi (Success and Wisdom) are the two wives of Gane\u1e63a. Probably the myth is to be interpreted allegorically on Bacon's principle.\n\n\\(^4\\) Forbes remarks (R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, p. 87, note), \"The allusion is to the usual decoration of houses at times of rejoicing, viz. purifying with cow-dung, painting swasteeks on the walls with vermillion, or forming them with jewels or grains on a table, and hanging garlands at the door.\" Full vessels are fortunate. The \"jewel-mines\" are the oceans. B\u00fchler tells us (H.C. p. 13) that these lines are found at the end of the 24th P\u0101da of Hemacandra's grammar.\nastonished at the ingenuity of Hemacandra's speech, and he praised him, but some envious persons said, \"These people acquire their literary power by means of reading our treatises.\" Then the king questioned Hemacandra, and he said, \"We read that Jaina grammar which the great Jina, the blessed Mah\u0101v\u012bra, long ago in his childhood, explained to Indra.\" As soon as he had said this, they rejoined, \"Never mind this antiquated story! Mention some writer on grammar not far removed from our own time.\" After this malignant speech, Hemacandra said, \"If king Siddhar\u0101ja will assist me, I will compile in a few days a new grammar consisting of fully five sections.\" Then the king said, \"This has been undertaken and it must be carried out;\" so he dismissed the sage, and he returned to his own place.\n\nThen the king made a promise that he would put an unsheathed knife in the hand of Ya\u00e7ovarman, and enter the city mounted on an elephant, sitting on the front seat, with Ya\u00e7ovarman on the back seat. When the minister Mu\u00f1j\u0101la heard of this promise, he wished to resign his appointment as premier, and when the king earnestly inquired for what reason, he quoted the couplet,\u2014 \n\nEven if kings do not understand peace, and do not comprehend war,\nYet, if they attend to what is told them, by that alone they are wise.\n\nThus he instructed the king from a treatise on policy, and showed him that this proceeding, which he had undertaken purely out of his own head, was not at all likely to prove beneficial in the long run. Then the king said, \"It is better far that I should lose my life than that I should go back from a promise, which I have once made, and which is generally known.\" So the minister placed in the hand of Ya\u00e7ovarman, who was seated on the back seat of the howdah, a knife of wood covered with the white exudation of the \u00c7il tree, and king Siddhar\u0101ja sat on the front seat, and entered in great triumph the glorious Anahillapura. After the auspicious ceremony of entering the city was completed, the king reminded Hemacandra of the episode of the grammar, and then that teacher brought from many countries all the grammars, together with learned men versed in them, and compiled in a year the grammar called Siddhahema in as many as five sections, consisting of 125,000 \u00e7lokas. That book was placed by the king's orders on the forehead of the state elephant, and a white umbrella was held over it, and it was fanned with two chowries by female chowrie-bearers, and so it was\n\n---\n\n1 P, a, and \u03b2 omit n\u1e5bpam.\n2 B\u00fchler (H.C. p. 16) tells us that, besides the S\u016btras, there are separate sections on the Up\u0101di suffixes, the Ganas, the roots and the gender of nouns.\n3 P inserts karasa, \"the question of making a grammar.\"\n4 Or, more literally, prose equivalents of a \u00e7loka.\nbrought to the king's palace, and with great and distinguished honour was deposited in the royal treasury. Then by the king's order all other grammars were discarded, and that grammar was read everywhere. But a certain envious person pointed out to the king that the grammar contained no description of his Majesty's lineage, and thereupon the king was angry. The teacher Hemacandra, hearing of this from a courtier, made thirty-two new \u0101lokas, and had them copied out, so as to form a connection with the thirty-two P\u0101das\\(^1\\) that had been already composed, and next morning, when the grammar was being read out, he recited also the \u0101lokas in praise\\(^2\\) of the Cau\u0142ukya race, and so propitiated the king. These were,\u2014\nLike Vi\u1e63\u1e47u fettering Bali, like Ci\u015ba, the wielder of the trident, accompanied by Tri\u00e7akti,\nAnd like Brahm\u0101 kamal\u0101-throned, victorious is the king, great M\u016blar\u0101ja:\\(^3\\)\nand so on. Moreover, Hemacandra composed the book called Dvy\u0101craya, to describe Siddhar\u0101ja's conquest of various countries in all directions.\nBrother P\u0101\u1e47ini, restrain your babbling, fruitless is the patched K\u0101tantra garment,\nCi\u015ba\u1e6d\u0101yana, do not utter a bitter speech, what profits the mean work of Candra?\nWho befools himself with the Kanth\u0101bhara\u1e47a and so on, or with other similar works,\nIf the phrases of Hemacandra, sweet with meaning, are only heard?\\(^4\\)\n\nThen Siddhar\u0101ja showed to king Ya\u00e7ovarman in Pattana, all the royal temples, beginning with the Tripurusapras\u0101da, and all the pious works beginning with the Sahasrali\u1e45ga tank, and told him that ten millions of money were spent every year on the grant for religious purposes, and asked him if this was creditable or the reverse. He answered, \"I was the king of M\u0101lava, a territory of the measure of eighteen lakhs,\\(^5\\) and how could I have experienced defeat at your hands?\" But the fact is, M\u0101lavaka\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Siddhahemacandra contains eight Adhy\u0101yas, and thirty-two P\u0101das, and at the end of each P\u0101da stands a verse in honour of one of the first seven Cau\u0142ukya kings, and at the end of the work four verses. (B\u00fchler's H.C. p. 16.)\n\\(^2\\) Here I follow the printed text, which gives upa\u00e7lokakena. But \u03b1 and \u03b2 have *opaclok\u0101n*. This would mean, additional \u0101lokas about the Cau\u0142ukya race.\n\\(^3\\) This couplet is loaded with puns. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u fettered Bali, but M\u016blar\u0101ja fixed the taxes; Ci\u015ba is accompanied by the goddess Tri\u00e7akti, but M\u016blar\u0101ja by the three kingly powers arising from his majesty, from his energy, and from charms. M\u016blar\u0101ja was a dwelling-place of the goddess of good fortune (Kamal\u0101), but Brahm\u0101 sits on the lotus (Kamala). (B\u00fchler's H.C. p. 88.)\n\\(^4\\) The K\u0101tantra or Kal\u0101pa grammar is supposed to have been revealed by the god Kum\u0101ra or K\u0101rtikeya to Sarvavarman. Ci\u015ba\u1e6d\u0101yana and Candra were grammarians.\n\\(^5\\) According to Forbes, producing eighteen hundreds of thousands of treasure. I should suppose the word rather to refer to the number of villages.\nis the property of the god Mah\u0101k\u0101la, having been long ago given to him. We have been the enjoyers\\(^1\\) of it, and by his power we have risen and set. In the same way, succeeding kings of your line will not be able to keep up the expenditure of so much treasure on the gods, and will retrench all the grant for religious purposes, and will so become the victims of calamity.\"\n\nThen, once on a time, Siddhar\u0101ja, being desirous of building the temple of Rudramah\u0101k\u0101la in Siddhapura, established a certain architect in his entourage, and when the auspicious moment for commencing the temple arrived, he redeemed his finial,\\(^2\\) which a creditor had seized for a debt of a lakh. When the king saw that it was made of strips of bamboo, he said, \"What is the meaning of this?\" Then the architect said, \"This was done by me in order to test your Majesty's generosity.\" Thereupon the king gave him that money, though he was unwilling to receive it. Then, in course of time, the temple, twenty-three cubits in height, was completed, and the king caused to be made figures of distinguished kings, lords of horses, lords of elephants, and lords of men, and so on, and caused to be placed in front of them his own statue, with his hands joined in an attitude of supplication, and so entreated that, even if the country were laid waste, this temple might not be destroyed. On the occasion of setting up the flag on that temple, he had the flags of all the Jaina temples lowered, as in the country of M\u0101lava when the banner of Mah\u0101k\u0101la is displayed, no flag is hoisted on any Jaina temple. On another occasion, as Siddhar\u0101ja was about to go to the land of M\u0101lava, a certain merchant begged that he might be allowed to take a share in defraying the expenses of the Sahasralinga tank,\\(^3\\) but that was refused point blank by the king. However, some days after the king had departed, that merchant, hearing that, on account of deficiency of funds, there was some delay in carrying out that work, gave on behalf of his son, whom he represented as having stolen the earring of the daughter-in-law of a rich man, a sum of three lakhs by way of fine. By means of this contribution the work was brought to completion. When the king, who was spending the rainy season in the country of M\u0101lava, heard this news, he was delighted beyond description. Then the cloud of the rainy season made the earth one sea with abundant rain, and a man of the desert-land\\(^4\\) was sent by the ministers to announce the good news, and he proceeded to detail at length the character of the rains in the presence of the king. But at that very moment a cunning man\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The idea seems to be that the kings of M\u0101lava had the usufruct of the country.\n\n\\(^2\\) I have taken kaldaik\u0101 as equivalent to kal\u0101ga, which Dr. Burgess tells me is the urn-shaped finial of a spire. These finials are often made of metal.\n\n\\(^3\\) The reading in P is simple. Sahasralinga-karmasth\u0101ya-vih\u0101g\u0101mi y\u0101cito r\u0101j\u0101 tadadaitvaiva M\u0101lavak\u0101m prat\u012b pray\u0101yam akarot. Tatas ko\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101v\u0101t karmasth\u0101yam vilambitam avag\u0101nya, &c.\n\n\\(^4\\) Probably Marwar.\nfrom Gujar\u0101t came in, and said, \"Your Majesty is fortunate; the Sahasralinga tank is full.\" When he had said this, the king gave that man of Gujar\u0101t the ornaments that he wore on every part of his body, while the old man from the desert-land was looking on like a cat fallen from a palanquin. Then the king returned after the rains, and stayed in \u010crinagara, a great city; and when he saw flags flying on the temples of the town, he asked the Brahmans, \"What are these temples?\" When they told him that the temples were dedicated to the Jina and Brahm\u0101 and other deities, the king was enraged, and said, \"I have forbidden the erection of flags on the Jaina temples in the country of Gujar\u0101t; so why is a temple of the Jina allowed to hoist a flag in this city of yours?\" When he said this, he was thus informed by those men who were thoroughly acquainted with the matter.\n\n\"Listen! When the auspicious Mah\u0101deva, at the beginning of the K\u1e5bta Yuga, was establishing this great city, he himself built temples to the Lord R\u0101shba and to Brahm\u0101, and bestowed on them flags. Then these temples were from time to time restored by pious people, and in this way four yugas passed. Moreover, this town is part of the outskirts of the great mountain \u010catru\u00f1jaya, for it is said in the Nagarapur\u0101\u1e47a,\u2014\n\nThey say that this is here the measure of the mountain of the lord of Jinas,\nIn the first place fifty yojanas of land at its roots,\nTen yojanas of upland is its breadth,\nBut its height is eight yojanas.\n\nThus in the K\u1e5bta Yuga there was the primeval deity R\u0101shba; his son was Bharata; this Bharatakha\u1e47\u1e0da is called after his name.\n\nThat V\u1e5b\u1e63abha is the son of N\u0101bhi and Marudevi,\nWho, regarding all things with impartial gaze, walked the hermit's self-mortifying walk,\nAnd the hermits record his rank as worthy and true,\nHe was pure, of restrained senses, impartial and wise.\n\n1 I read var\u1e63\u0101nantaram with \u03b1, \u03b2 and P.\n2 I insert vij\u00f1\u0101nair after ta\u015bv with \u03b1 and \u03b2.\n3 I read with P, \u03b1 and \u03b2, sth\u0101payat\u0113 \u010criR\u0101shban\u0101tha\u015br\u012b Brahm\u0101pr\u0101s\u0101dau stya\u1e47m sth\u0101pitau pradatta-dhvajau tadanayoh pr\u0101\u015b\u0101dayoh, &c. Apparently, some words have been omitted by the printers.\n4 P gives \u0101rhat\u0101dyam for the \u0101rhasatyam of the text. Hofrat B\u00fchler has suggested to me that \u0101rhat\u0101dyam might be the right reading. This would mean, \"record his rank as that of the founder of the Jaina sect.\" I find in \u03b1, tas\u0101rhatyam; \u03b2 agrees with the printed text.\n5 The Bombay editor points out that these lines are found with slight variations in the Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a. I find in Burnouf's edition, II. 7, 10:\u2014\n\nN\u0101bheras\u0101vrasabha \u0101sa Sudervis\u016bnur,\nYo vai ca c\u0101ra samadry jadayogacaryam,\nYat p\u0101rah\u0101\u1e41sasyampr\u0101yay\u0101 padam\u0101nananti,\nSvasthah pra\u00e7\u0101ntakaranah parimuktasayyah.\nBut the eighth was born to N\u0101bhi by Marudevi, a man of wide sway,\nShowing the path of the self-restrained, which is honoured by every stage\nof life.\n\nAfter they had quoted these and similar sayings of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, the\nBrahmans, by way of special confirmation of these assertions, brought a\ncymbal out of the treasury in the temple of V\u1e5b\u1e63abhadeva, marked with the\nname of king Bharata, requiring five men to carry it, and showing it to the\nking established the primeval character of the Jaina religion. Then the king's\nmind was full of regret, and at the end of the year he gave orders to have\nthe flags hoisted on the Jaina temples. Then the king arrived in Pattana.\nOn a certain occasion, when the accounts of the construction of the tank\nwere being read out,\u00b9 the king, hearing that three lakhs had been deducted\nfrom the cost of the work under the head of the fine of the merchant's\ncriminal son, sent three lakhs to the merchant's house.\u00b2 Then that merchant\ncame to the king with a present in his hand, and said humbly, \"What is\nthe meaning of this?\" The king answered him, \"How could a merchant,\nwho has hoisted the ten-million banner,\u00b3 be a thief of earrings? When\nyou asked for a share in the merit of that religious construction, and did\nnot obtain it, then being versed in wiles, a tiger with the face of a deer,\noutwardly simple, but inwardly perfidious, you took this step.

One day,\nSiddhar\u0101ja asked R\u0101macandra, \"How comes it that the days are longer in\nthe hot weather?\" He replied,\u2014\nO king, conqueror of mountain fortresses, in the triumph of thy victorious\nprogress through the world,\nThe circle of the earth is pulverized with hoofs by means of the prancings of\ngalloping heroes' horses,\n\n\u00b9 P gives sarovaravayayapade v\u0101cyam\u0101ne.\n\u00b2 Forbes's R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, p. 189.\n\u00b3 No. 3979 in B\u00f6htlingk's Indische Spr\u00fcche. It seems to be ascribed to C\u0101nakya.\n\u2074 No. 4882 in B\u00f6htlingk's Indische Spr\u00fcche. This also is ascribed to C\u0101nakya.\n\u2075 This is found in the Kirtikanmudi of Some\u00e7vara (ed. K\u0101thavate). There it is\ndescriptive of the tank at Anahillapattana, no doubt the Sahasralinga tank. But\nSome\u00e7vara probably uses Giri\u00e7\u0101g\u0101ra in the sense of temples of \u010civa. (See K. K. I. 74.)\nAnd by means of the dust thereof uplifted by the wind, with which is mingled the river of the gods,\nSwamps arise, and the horses of the sun are forever kissing the bent-grass that grows on them, hence the day is long.\nThe seekers\\(^1\\) that hit the mark in thy enemies, miss their mark in thee,\nNevertheless, thy fame as a giver, O king Siddha, still uplifts its neck.\n\nThen, one day, the crazy teacher, the Jaina doctor Jayamangala, being asked by the king to describe the city, said,\u2014\nVanquished by the cleverness of the wives of the citizens of this very city,\nSarasvati indeed, I ween, out of dulness remains carrying water,\nHaving dropped from her arm her own tortoise-shaped lute to be the gourd-like lake of great king Siddha,\nSplendid with a lofty handle in the form of a triumphal pillar, furnished with strings by means of bal\u0101-plants.\\(^2\\)\n\nMoreover,\nA great temple, a great pilgrimage, a great city, a great reservoir,\nWho on the earth could make these which king Siddha has made?\n\nThen the poet \u00c7rip\u0101la engraved verses on a laudatory plate of metal which had been prepared for the Sahasralinga tank. A stanza on it ran as follows\\(^3\\) :\u2014\n\nMy mind does not delight in the M\u0101nasa lake,\nPamp\u0101 does not produce joy in me,\nHere pure water, pure as that of the Acchodaka lake,\nShines as its very essence proclaiming the success of the king.\n\nRepresentatives of all sects were summoned to revise the panegyric, and the teacher Hemacandra sent there his subordinate disciple the pandit R\u0101macandra, and said to him, \u201cWhen a stanza of the panegyric is approved by all the learned men present, you must not exhibit any cleverness.\u201d\n\n\\(^1\\) The word m\u0101rga\u1e47a (seeker) means \u201cpetitioner\u201d and \u201carrow.\u201d\n\\(^2\\) I read bal\u0101-tantrik\u0101\u1e41 for bal\u0101t-tantrik\u0101\u1e41. I owe this emendation to Hofrat B\u00fchler. The Sarasvati is, of course, \u201cthe small but translucent river Suruswatee,\u201d which, according to Forbes, \u201cruns westward towards the Runn of Kutch from the celebrated shrine of Kotheshwur Mu\u1e25\u0101 Dev, in the marble hills of Arasoor\u201d (R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, p. 47). The \u201ctriumphal pillar\u201d is mentioned in the Kirtikaumudi, II. 75.\n\\(^3\\) This stanza is omitted in P. P gives pr\u0101castau for pr\u0101casti in line 1, omits lines 2\u20136, and pr\u0101casti in line 7. The stanza itself is found in the Kirtikaumudi, I. 78. The third and fourth lines are\u2014\n\nAcchodakam acchodakam apyas\u0101ra\u1e41\nSarvare r\u0101jati Siddhabhartu\u1e25.\n\nThe Acchodaka lake, though containing pure water, is valueless while the lake of king Siddha gleams. In the first line medya\u1e6di is read for m\u0101dyati. It appears that our author has again quoted from memory, unless the stanza has been foisted into the text by a copyist.\nThen all the learned men began to examine the panegyric, and all the stanzas were considered with a view to please the king, and to show complaisance to the skill \\(^1\\) of \u00c7rip\u0101la, and the following stanza was singled out for special laudation:\n\nTo whose sword the goddess of Fortune resorted, deserting the lotus, thinking thus,\nThough furnished with a sheath and abundantly supplied with leaves, this lotus is not able to extirpate,\nAnd it does not possess masculine nature, for it is clear that it tolerates thorns in its domain;\nBut this sword, unaided, makes, being unsheathed, the earth free from thorns.\\(^2\\)\n\nWhile this stanza was being so specially praised, Siddhar\u0101ja asked R\u0101macandra what he thought of it, and he said, \u201cIt is questionable.\u201d Then, being attacked by them all, he continued, \u201cIn this stanza the word dala is used to denote an army, and it is assumed that the word kamala is always neuter; these two blemishes are questionable.\u201d Then the king appealed to all the learned men, and got them to approve the use of the word dala in the sense of royal army, but they said, \u201cAs the doctrine that the word kamala is always neuter is not supported\\(^3\\) by the Ling\u0101nu\u00e7\u0101sana, by what can it be decided!\u201d So they had one syllable changed, writing punstv\u0101m ca dhatte na v\u0101 (it possesses or does not possess masculine nature). Then, as pandit R\u0101macandra was entering his house, one of his eyes burst, because he had brought home an oversight to king Siddhar\u0101ja.\n\nThen the king of the country of D\u0101hala wrote at the end of a letter of alliance, the following couplet:\n\nJoined with \u0101 it gives life in the world, joined with vi it is dear to hermits,\nJoined with sa\u1e41\\(^4\\) it is altogether undesirable, alone it is cherished by women.\n\nWhen the time came to explain this couplet, the learned were silent, but when the king asked Hemacandra, he explained it by supplying the word h\u0101ra. On another occasion the king of the country of a lakh and a quarter,\\(^5\\) sent the following half dodhaka to be filled up:\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) P has d\u0101ksy\u0101d\u0101ksin\u0101yacca; B, d\u0101ksy\u0101d\u0101ksin\u0101yacca.\n\\(^2\\) In this punning stanza, koc\u0101 means \u201csheath\u201d and \u201ccalyx\u201d; dala, \u201cleaf\u201d and \u201carmy\u201d; thorns are used to denote the enemies that a king is bound to extirpate.\n\\(^3\\) I read with a and B, liyganu\u00e7asan\u0101sidham, as the sense seems to require it.\n\\(^4\\) P reads here pra\\(^6\\), which gives a good sense.\n\\(^5\\) Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a\u015biti, the country of \u00c7\u0101kambhari-S\u0101mbhar, in eastern Rajputana. (B\u00fchler, H.C. p. 31.) These lines bear a slight resemblance to two lines found on page 115 of the Bhojaprabandha (Bombay edition of 1895).\nThe new moon of the first night does not imitate the lotus of Gauri's face.\n\nWhen those poets were unable to complete it, the great hermit Hemacandra completed it as follows:\n\nBut though unseen, the remaining portion of the moon's disk is always inferred.\n\nOn another occasion, Siddhar\u0101ja, being desirous of executing the king of Abhiras, named Navaghana, his army having been before, eleven times defeated by that chieftain, who had caused to be thrown up ramparts round Vardham\u0101na and other cities, himself marched in person against him. Navaghana's sister's son had made an agreement that Navaghana, when the rampart was overturned, was to be killed with dravya, not with weapons and things of that kind. Accordingly, the attendants made this stipulation with regard to him, but he was dragged out of the large hall and beaten to death with boxes full of dravya. And the attendants were informed that he was actually killed with dravya, this word being used.\n\nThese are the words of his queen, when she had fallen into affliction on account of his death:\n\nMy friends, that king is no longer, and his family is no longer a family; I myself will sacrifice my life in the fire with Khang\u0101ra.\n\nAll kings are merchants, Jesala is a great trader;\n\nHow is the merchants' profession adorned? Our fort is down.\n\nHow didst thou, O venerable Girn\u0101r, come to bear envy in thy mind?\n\nWhen Khang\u0101ra was slain, thou didst not throw down one peak.\n\nO Jesala, do not shed tears again and again. It is considered unbecoming.\n\nAs in a river a new flood does not come without a new cloud.\n\n---\n\n1 I read nijasainya with P, a and B. The reading nijasainyaih would mean that Navaghana had been defeated by the troops of Siddhar\u0101ja. But Forbes takes the view that Siddhar\u0101ja's army \"laid siege to Wurdhum\u0101n, now Wundw\u0101n, and other towns, but sustained many repulses.\" The same writer tells us that in the Prabandhascint\u0101ma\u1e47i there is a confusion between the names of Nowghun and Kheng\u0101r, who were father and son. This explains one of the Pr\u0101krit lines that follow. The reading of B, pr\u0101k\u0101rapar\u0101vartam nir\u016bpya seems to deserve attention.\n\n2 On page 241 the words pr\u0101k\u0101rapar\u0101vartam cak\u0101ra are found. They apparently mean overturned the rampart or wall of the city.\n\n3 According to P the attendants of the sister's son were so informed. It would appear that the sister's son wished to have him poisoned. Perhaps the boxes were full of money. The passage runs thus in P: tadbh\u0101jineyena vaprapar\u0101vartitakale 'yam dravyav\u0101p\u0101dita eva karaniyo Navaghanah, na punarastr\u0101d\u012bbh\u012br iti y\u0101cete r\u0101j\u0101 Jaya\u015bimha devena sa p\u0101l\u0101d bahir \u0101kri\u1e63ya dravyav\u0101sanair eva t\u0101dayitv\u0101 vy\u0101p\u0101d\u012btah ayam dravyav\u0101p\u0101dita eva k\u1e5bta\u1e25 iti vacanabali tadbh\u0101jineyaparigraho bodhit\u0101\u1e25. This is simpler than the printed text.\n\n4 It appears from Forbes's R\u0101s M\u0101la, p. 136, that Jesala means Jayasinha or Siddhar\u0101ja.\n\n5 Navaghana means \"new cloud.\"\nHaving prospered by him, Vardham\u0101na will not forget, though urged to forget;\nBhog\u0101varatta, I will cause my life, dear as gold, to be enjoyed by thee.\n\nThese and many similar utterances must be considered as appropriate to the occasion.\n\nThen Siddhar\u0101ja appointed the police magister Sajjana, of the race of the great minister Jamb\u0101,\u00b9 to superintend the affairs of Sur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, on account of his fitness for the post. He, without informing the king, devoted the proceeds of the taxes for three years, to building on the holy mountain Ujjayanta a new stone temple to Nemin\u0101tha in place of the wooden one which he took away. In the fourth year the king sent four military officers, and summoned to Pattana the police magistrate\u00b2 Sajjana, and asked him for the money collected in three years. He offered the king money equal in amount to the proceeds of three years\u2019 taxes, which he had obtained from the merchants of that country, and said, \u201cLet your Majesty take one of these two, either the merit of restoring the dilapidations of the temples of Ujjayanta or the money collected in taxes.\u201d When he said this, Siddhar\u0101ja was astonished at the cleverness of his intellect, and chose the merit of restoring the buildings of that holy place.\n\nBut Sajjana again obtained the government of that country, and he presented silken banners to the temples in the two holy places \u010catru\u00f1jaya and Ujjayanta, each of which extended over twelve yojanas.\u00b3\n\nHere ends the story of the restoration of Raivataka.\n\nThen king Siddha, having again returned from his pilgrimage to Some\u00e7vara, encamped at the foot of Raivata, and being desirous of seeing on that occasion the temple\u2074 that he had built there, was dissuaded by means of false representations by the Brahmans, who were filled with excessive envy, and said, \u201cThis mountain is in shape like a liyga with the water-basin surrounding it, and therefore ought not to be touched with the foot.\u201d So he sent an offering there, and himself pitched his camp in the neighbourhood of the famous holy place \u010catru\u00f1jaya. There these same men, who were treacherous, like all their caste, and merciless, barred his way to the holy place, sword in hand. So king Siddha, at nightfall, assumed the dress of a pilgrim, and put a yoke on his shoulder, at the two ends of which he suspended vessels full of Ganges water, and mingled with them, and so\n\n\u00b9 The merchant who became prime minister to Vanar\u0101ja.\n\u00b2 P reads dand\u0101dhipati\u1e25, which seems to be correct.\n\u00b3 But P, with a and \u03b2, gives dv\u0101da\u00e7ayojan\u0101y\u0101nam.\n\u2074 Kirttana here means monument, Denkmal (B and R in their shorter Dictionary). I read with a, tad\u0101iva svam kirttana\u1e41. For this meaning of kirttana, Hofrath B\u00fchler refers me to Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, III. p. 212, note 6.\nascended the hill without being recognized, and bathed R\u0101bha, the first lord of a yuga, in Ganges water, and bestowed on the image of the great god a grant of twelve villages in the neighbourhood of the hill. And after he had seen the holy place he was, so to speak, like one who had had his eyes opened, like one bathed in nectar. He made a vow, being one who fulfilled his vows, that he would make a Vindhya forest in that very place, on that mountain, which was filled with gum olibanum and with the\n\nADDENDA AND CORRIGENDA.\n\nPage 45, note 2. Professor Leumann writes as follows:\u2014\"R\u0101dh\u0101 denotes the butt or mark; R\u0101dh\u0101 is, after all, 'the aim' personified. In Pr\u0101krit the r\u0101dh\u0101 is generally called putaliya, literally, 'a little figure,' as apparently a little human figure was painted in the midst of the butt.\"\n\nIbid. For \"B\u00f6htlingk and Roth\" read \"B\u00f6htlingk.\"\n\nPage 60. Add to note 1.\u2014These lines are also found in the Hanumann\u0101\u1e6daka or Mah\u0101n\u0101\u1e6daka, 14th Act v. 49. (Bombay edition of 1886.) There also we read \u010civa, \u010civa, t\u0101ni, &c.\n\nPage 98, note 4. For \"B. and R. in their shorter Dictionary\" read \"B\u00f6htlingk in his shorter Dictionary.\"\n\nWhen I will hold a disputation with you before the king's court.\" When the doctor \u010crideva said this, the Digambara, think-\n\n1 Here P and a give simply \u010cridev\u0101ya.\n2 \u010crideva is sometimes called \u010cridevas\u016bri and sometimes \u010cridev\u0101c\u0101rya. I have rendered the text by \"the doctor \u010crideva.\" Here \u010crideva might possibly refer to the god as in the second line of this page of the printed text. It is curious that twelve villages are bestowed on the teacher \u010crideva on page 170.\n3 The Carnatic.\n4 But P gives y\u0101tuk\u0101ma\u1e25, eager to go from the Carnatic to Gujar\u0101t.\n5 According to Forbes, the modern Ahmadabad (B\u00fchler, H.C. 9).\n6 Up\u0101d\u0113ya. I take it that this was attached to the temple. The custom of throwing grass and water by way of challenge is again found on page 279 of the printed text. It therefore seems probable that \u010crideva was acquainted with it. But P gives an\u0101karmitakay\u0101, which perhaps means \"pretending not to have heard of it.\" The passage is wanting in a and b.\n7 I find in P, devad\u0101ry\u0101m j\u0101mi\u1e41. The letter r is not quite clear. I have followed the text.\ning that he had gained his end, arrived in the neighbourhood of Pattana. Siddhar\u0101ja honoured him by going to meet him and other attentions, on account of his being the spiritual preceptor of his maternal grandfather; so he took up his quarters there. Then Siddhar\u0101ja questioned Hemacandra about the skill in disputation of the various pandits of his realm, and Hemacandra said that the teacher \u0106rideva, at that time in Karn\u0101vati, a man possessed of great skill in the four branches of knowledge,\\(^1\\) the leader of the elephant-herd of Jaina hermits, the adamantine rampart of the \u0106vet\u0101mbara faith, the charming necklace of the king's court, was expert in the science of disputation, and a very lion to controversial elephants. Then the king sent a royal rescript to summon him, and it arrived at the same time as a letter from the congregation. So the doctor \u0106rideva reached Pattana, and at the king's request he proceeded to propitiate the goddess of speech. But she said to him, \"If you put forward as a net, an introduction of the eighty-four ensnaring dilemmas in the section dealing with the controversy with the Digambaras of the great commentary on the Uttar\u0101dhyayana, composed by \u0106\u0101ntis\u016bri,\\(^2\\) terrible to disputants as a vampire, you will close the mouth\\(^3\\) of the Digambara.\" After he had received this command, he secretly sent pandits to Kumudacandra, and so took steps to inquire in what department of learning he was especially skilled. They brought back this,\u2014\n\nKing, give command, what am I to do? Am I immediately to bring Lajk\u0101 here?\nShall I carry off Jamb\u016bdv\u012bpa hence, or dry up the receptacle of waters?\nOr am I to make a dam across the sea, increasing its volume by the swell produced by throwing into it\nThe mountain of the three-eyed god,\\(^4\\) and by way of pebbles the heads of lofty hills rooted up with ease?\n\nWhen the teacher \u0106rideva and Hemacandra heard this saying of his, they saw that his knowledge of authoritative text-books was very small, and they rejoiced, considering that he was as good as vanquished. Then the head pupil of the reverend doctor \u0106rideva, named Ratnaprabha, went at nightfall, disguised, to Kumudacandra's pavilion. Then Kumudacandra\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Perhaps tr\u0101yi, the triple Veda; \u0101nvik\u1e63iki, logic and metaphysics; d\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dan\u012bti, the science of government; and p\u0101r\u0101\u1e6da, practical arts.\n\n\\(^2\\) According to Professor Lenmann, the passage referred to is found in \u0106\u0101ntis\u016bri's commentary on Uttar\u0101dhyayana, III. 9. (See Weber's Indische Studien, Vol. XVII., 97, No. 1.) The corresponding passage in Devendra's Uttar\u0101dhyayana commentary has been published and translated by Jacobi in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, Vol. XXXVIII. pp. 2-7.\n\n\\(^3\\) The reading of T, mudr\u0101 pati\u1e63yati, seems preferable to that of the printed text.\n\n\\(^4\\) i.e. Him\u0101laya.\nsaid, \"Who are you?\" The answer was, \"I am a god.\" \"What is meant by god?\" \"I.\" \"Who am I?\" \"You.\" \"What is meant by 'You?'\" \"A dog.\" \"Who is a dog?\" \"You.\" \"Who am I?\" \"I am a god.\"\n\nSo their game of question and answer revolved in a circle, and Ratnaprabha came back again, having made himself out to be a god and the Digambara to be a dog. When the mistake of the \"vicious circle\" was thus made manifest, Kumudacandra felt himself touched by the outcast of despondency, and he had the following stanza composed:\n\nO white-robed ones, why, with phrases composed of great swelling words of vanity,\nDo you fling these foolish people into the gaping gulf of the pit of this transmigrating world?\nIf you have indeed the slightest longing for discrimination between truth and untruth,\nMeditate day and night on the two truthful feet of Kumudacandra.\n\nHaving had this stanza, which was eminently characteristic of him, composed, he adopted it and sent it to the doctor \u00c7rideva. Thereupon that ruby of pandits, the most subtle quintessence of his sect, surpassing C\u0101\u1e47akya in power of intellect, indited the following stanza:\n\nWho touches with his foot the dense mane of hair on the neck of the lion?\nWho desires to be scratched with a sharp spear in the hollow of the eye?\nWho prepares for battle with him who is adorned with the crest-jewel of the king of snakes as with an earring?\nWhy he who brings this charge against the revered creed of the \u00c7vet\u0101mbaras.\n\nThen the pandit Ratn\u0101kara wrote:\n\nThis truth is clear that the naked ones\nRefuse here release to young women;\nThen why have you this foolish longing, coming of evil,\nThis longing for the rough game of logic?\n\nThese stanzas the doctor \u00c7rideva sent to Kumudacandra by way of mockery.\n\n1 N\u012b\u015b\u0101da, a member of a wild tribe outside the Aryan pale. These people were sometimes employed as executioners. P omits n\u012b\u015b\u0101da.\n2 But P gives nirm\u0101ya samaye, he composed and sent it in due time.\n3 P and B give paramaparam\u0101sura.\nNow the august Mayanalladevi was favouring Kumudacandra, and always bringing pressure to bear on those members of the court with whom she came in contact, in order to ensure his triumph. But Hemacandra, hearing of this, let her know that in the controversial disputation the Digambaras would deny the validity of good deeds performed by women, whereas the \u0106vet\u0101mbaras would uphold it. When this fact was intimated to her by Hemacandra, through the instrumentality of those very members of the court, the queen-mother ceased to favour the Digambara, as a man utterly unacquainted with the usages of society.\n\nThen Kumudacandra, seated in a litter, and the pandit Ratnaprabha on foot, came into the Record Office,\u00b9 to write down the thesis and the counterstatement. Kumudacandra had his thesis taken down by the officials of the Record Office in the following words:\n\nA man, that \u00b2 has attained unlimited knowledge, does not eat, there is no salvation for any one that wears clothes,\nOne born as a woman does not attain perfection; this is the opinion of Kumudacandra.\n\nNow follows the counterstatement of the \u0106vet\u0101mbaras:\n\nEven after attaining unlimited knowledge a man eats, one that wears clothes can attain salvation,\nThough one be a woman, one may attain perfection; this is the opinion of the doctor \u0106r\u012bdeva.\n\nAfter the thesis and the counterstatement had been written down in these words, and Siddhar\u0101ja had come to the meeting on the day fixed for the disputation, and the members of the court, men versed in the means of proof acknowledged by the six schools of philosophy,\u00b3 had assembled, the disputant Kumudacandra entered the court of the king Siddhar\u0101ja, seated in a litter, with drums of triumph beating in front of him, having a white umbrella held over him, and a support for papers dangling in front of him at the end of a bamboo, and took his seat on a throne graciously put at his disposal by the sovereign. The reverend doctor \u0106r\u012bdeva, also, and the great hermit Hemacandra who accompanied him, adorned one throne between them in the court. Then the disputant\n\n\u00b9 Ak\u1e63ap\u0101\u1e6dala is said by Cowell and Thomas in their translation of the \u0106r\u012b Har\u1e63a Carita (p. 278) to mean document, and ak\u1e63ap\u0101\u1e6dalika, \"one in charge of documents.\" They refer to C.I.I., III. p. 180, line 76, and p. 190, n. 2. Sir Monier Monier-Williams gives \"depository of legal documents\" (as Mr. Fleet points out) as one meaning of ak\u1e63ap\u0101\u1e6dala.\n\u00b2 P given kevalik\u0101u; B, kevalik\u0101o.\n\u00b3 Pitravimim\u0101\u1e41s\u0101, Uttaramimim\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 or Ved\u0101nta, Ny\u0101ya, Va\u012bc\u0113\u015bika, S\u0101\u1e45khya, Yoga.\nKumudacandra, being himself advanced in years, said to Hemacandra, who was somewhat above the age of boyhood, \"You have drunk buttermilk.\" But Hemacandra put him down by replying, \"You drivelling old dotard, why do you talk in this absurd way? Buttermilk is white; turmeric is yellow.\" Then Kumudacandra said, \"Which of you two is the disputant?\" The doctor \u00c7rideva, in order to give him a rebuff, said, \"This gentleman is your opponent in the disputation.\" Then Kumudacandra said, \"How can I, an old man, dispute with this child?\" Hemacandra, overhearing his remark, said, \"I am your senior; you are a mere child, since you have not, as yet, been promoted to a loin-string and a garment.\" The king then put a stop to this wrangling between the two, and they made this mutual agreement that, if the \u00c7vet\u0101maras were vanquished, they should adopt the views and practices of the Digambaras, but if the Digambaras were beaten, they should leave the country. After this stipulation had been made, the teacher \u00c7rideva, who was afraid that his country might be disgraced, and who wished to cut away every ground for imputation, being alive to the possibility of imputations being cast on his country, said to Kumudacandra, \"Please consent, sir, to bring forward your thesis first.\" Then Kumudacandra bestowed the following blessing on the king:\n\n\"The sun sheds in it the light of a firefly, the moon repairs to the shade Of an old spider's hole, and the mountains are in it but gnats,\" While describing the heaven in these words, thy glory came to my recollection, That buzzes in it like a humble-bee, henceforth my words are sealed up.\n\nWhen the members of the court heard this barbarous phrase, \"Henceforth my words are sealed up,\" they rejoiced, thinking that by it he had tied his own hands. Then the teacher \u00c7rideva gave the king this blessing:\n\nLong may thy reign prosper, O Caulukya, and that Jaina religion of thine, In the former of which the winding groove of development of the path of thy policy, Charming from the growth of its white-robed glittering glory, gives no room for joy to thy enemies, And all mighty men and elephants have always their exceeding haughtiness subdued; In the second of which the seven modes of assertion developed in a logical way,\n\n1 This quibble depends upon the two meanings of p\u012bta, \"drunk\" and \"yellow.\"\n2 Or perhaps it means, \"being anxious to avoid all repetition.\" He did not wish his adversary to reply. I find in \u03b2, da\u00e7a\u00f1vadda-par\u0101yana\u1e25.\nCharming from the growth of the glittering glory of the \u00c7vet\u0101mbaras,\nestablishes for women possibility of salvation,\nAnd Kevalins, conquering the haughtiness of their enemies, are always\nallowed to eat!\u00b9\n\nThen the disputant Kumudacandra began to introduce his thesis\ndirected against the eating of Kevalins, the salvation of women, and the\nwearing of clothes, with a faltering voice resembling that of the bird\ncalled a pigeon, being honoured by the members of the court, who praised\nhim openly, while laughing at him in their hearts. After he had ended\na sort of introduction, they said to the teacher \u00c7rideva, \"Speak!\" Then\nhe began to set forth eighty-four ensnaring dilemmas of the great com-\nmentary on the Uttar\u0101dhyayana, in words resembling the piled-up waves\nof the sea agitated by the fierce winds developed at the time of the\ndestruction of the world, and the lotus of Kumudacandra's countenance\nbegan to wither, as his adversary's splendid readiness of intellect developed\nitself, and his mind being confused with bewilderment, he was not able to\ngrasp thoroughly the words spoken by \u00c7rideva; so he requested that that\nintroduction might be repeated, though the members of Siddhar\u0101ja's\ncourt were disposed to forbid it. Then the doctor \u00c7rideva began to\nwhelm\u00b2 Kumudacandra in a sea of argument with waves of countless\ntopics, but on the beginning of the sixteenth day he was attacked by a\nsudden choking in the throat. Then Ya\u00e7obhadras\u016bri, who was skilled in\ncharms, and had obtained a boon through the unexampled favour of the\ngoddess Kurukull\u0101, removed in a moment from the surface of the doctor\n\u00c7rideva's throat a ball of hair, that had been produced there by the power\nof the incantations performed by the naked mendicant. When the\ndexterous Ya\u00e7obhadras\u016bri beheld that strange sight, he praised the doctor\n\u00c7rideva\u00b3 who was highly elated, and denounced with great severity\nKumudacandra, who was proportionately depressed. Now it happened\nthat the doctor \u00c7rideva, when beginning to set forth his thesis, used the\nexpression k\u014dt\u0101k\u014dti. Kumudacandra asked for the origin of that phrase.\nThereupon the learned K\u0101kala, who had the eight grammars at his fingers'\nends,\u2074 said that the justification of the three words, k\u014dt\u0101k\u014dti, k\u014dtik\u014dti and\n\n\u00b9 I have had to use seven lines to translate four, as a double meaning runs\nthrough the first three. The subject of the Saptabha\u1e45ga\u1e47aya, or seven modes of\nassertion, is clearly explained by Bhandarkar in his report on Sanskrit MSS. for\nthe year 1883-84, pp. 95, 96.

In this way the king escorted the teacher \u010crideva to his house, after he had performed his adorations to the blessed Mah\u0101v\u012bra in a temple built by that very Th\u0101ha\u1e0da, and he gave the learned doctor, by way of reward, twelve villages and a shawl and other presents, though he was very unwilling to receive them. The verses written in his praise are as follows:\n\nHonour to great Devas\u016bri, the teacher who upheld the cause of clothes,\nWhose favour his appearance seems to indicate, when questions are asked about his welfare!\n\nThis was the composition of Pradyumn\u0101c\u0101rya.\n\nIf truly the snowbright\u00b3 Devas\u016bri had not conquered Kumudacandra,\nNot a single \u010cvet\u0101mbara in the world would have worn a covering on his loins.\n\nThis was the composition of Hem\u0101c\u0101rya.\n\n\u00b9 I have borrowed this from Forbes, who quotes from Jeremy Taylor, \u201cPlutarch rarely well compares curious and inquisitive ears to the execrable gates of cities, out of which only malefactors and hangmen and tragedies pass, nothing that is chaste or holy.\u201d This may be illustrated from J\u0101taka 194, (p. 86 of Rouse\u2019s translation), \u201cThey scourged him with whips, and tormented him at every street corner, and cast him out of the city by the south gates.\u201d The south is the quarter of Yama.\n\n\u00b2 This phrase is borrowed from King Lear III. 2, 14.

On a certain occasion he was desirous of going to a certain village, and on the way he saw a herd of she-goats going along, and in a piece of stone that was upon the neck of one of the she-goats, he detected, thanks to his discernment of gems, the nature of a jewel.\\(^1\\) So, in his desire to obtain it, he bought the she-goat for a sum of money, and he had the jewel polished by a jeweller, and, on the occasion of a diadem being made for Siddhar\u0101ja, he sold it to the king for money amounting to a lakh. With the help of that capital he bought, on one occasion, some sacks of madder that had come, and when he came to sell them, he saw some spoons of gold that had been hidden in them by merchants, for fear of water-thieves, so he took them out from all the sacks. After that he became the principal man of the whole town, honoured by king Siddha, and he was, as a Jaina layman, a zealous propagator of the Jaina faith. Every day and every year he gave at will to Jaina hermits, food, garments and other requisites, and in a secret way he built new religious foundations, and restored dilapidated ones wanting in splendour, in his own country and foreign countries.\n\nLike a tree hidden by a creeper, like every seed concealed by the earth,\nGenerally a good deed done secretly comes to hundred-fold ramification.\n\nHere ends the story of S\u0101ha \u0100bh\u0101da.\n\nThen, on another occasion, Siddhar\u0101ja, who was eager to traverse the ocean of transmigratory existence, and kept questioning\\(^2\\) singly all sects in all countries from a desire to know the truth about God, religion, and the proper object of veneration, and discovered that they all exalted their own systems and spoke evil of rival systems, finding that his mind was placed upon the swing of doubt, summoned Hemacandra, and asked him his opinion on this knotty point. But Hemacandra, after considering the mysteries of the fourteen divisions of knowledge,\\(^3\\) began in the following words to set forth a decision based on a narrative in a Pur\u0101\u1e47a. \"Long ago, a certain merchant deserted the wife he had married in his youth, and lavished all his wealth on a hetaera. The wife of his youth was for ever applying to people, who understood such matters, to tell her a process of incantation by which she might recover her influence over her husband. At last a man from the country of Gau\u1e0da said, 'I will put your husband into such a state that you can lead him about with a string.' So he gave\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Probably we ought to read kha\u1e47\u1e0dam. Perhaps also j\u0101\u1e6dyaratnam.\n\n\\(^2\\) P gives prcchya\". There is a misprint in the text.\n\n\\(^3\\) \"According to others vidy\u0101 has fourteen divisions, viz. the four Vedas, the six Ved\u0101\u1e45gas, the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101, Ny\u0101ya and Dharma.\" (Monier-Williams, s.v. vidy\u0101.)\nher a certain drug of inconceivable potency, and departed, telling her to give it him in his food. After the lapse of some days, when the omitted lunar day\\(^1\\) arrived, she carried out his instructions, and her husband became a bull before her eyes; and as she did not know how to remedy that misfortune, she had to bear the reproaches of the whole world, and spent the time in lamenting over her evil deed. One noon, though scorched by the shooting forth of a shower of unusually fierce rays by the lord of day, she led her husband, transformed into a bull, to graze in green pasture-lands, and she was resting at the foot of a certain tree, wailing bitterly, when she suddenly heard a conversation above her in the air.\n\n\"At that moment Ciiva had come there in his sky-going chariot, and, having been questioned by Bhav\u0101n\u012b as to the cause of the woman's grief, he told her how matters stood, and when she pressed him further, he declared that in the shadow of that very tree there was a simple, which would confer on any creature the nature of a man. Then he disappeared. Thereupon the woman marked out with a line the shadow of the tree, and picked all the plants growing within it, and threw these plant-growths into the mouth of the bull. The bull, by means of that plant placed in its mouth, though it was never known which particular plant it was that produced the effect, recovered its human nature. As that medicinal plant, though its precise nature was never discovered, brought about the desired result, so that discrimination of the right object of veneration, having become obscured by delusion in this Kali age, brings about salvation by the devout cultivation of all systems, though its precise nature is unknown.\\(^2\\) This is my decision.\"\n\nWhen Hemacandra had in these words recommended the honouring of all systems, Siddhar\u0101ja began to cultivate all religions.\n\nHere ends the story about the claims to veneration of all religions.\n\nThen, one night, the king was looking at a play in the temple of Karnameru, when a certain ordinary trader, a seller of gram, placed his hand on his shoulder.\\(^3\\) The king's mind was astonished at his sportive familiarity, but he again and again accepted with satisfaction\\(^4\\) the betel and camphor which the trader offered him, and when the play was dismissed, he found out, by means of his attendants, the house of the trader and other particulars in the fullest detail, and then, returning to his palace, he went to sleep. In the morning the king, after he had performed the duties incumbent on\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I have taken ksay\u0101h\u0101ni as equivalent to ksay\u0101he.

It is found in P but not in a and B.\n\n\\(^4\\) I find in a and P, paritosit\u014d, and in B, paritosit\u014d. Either reading seems preferable to that in the printed text.\nhim at the beginning of the day, adorned the assembly pavilion with his presence, giving general audience to the people, and summoned the trader that sold gram, and said to him, \"My neck is aching from the weight of the hand that you rested on it last night.\" But he, with prompt readiness of invention, replied, \"If your Majesty's shoulder does not feel pain from bearing the weight of the whole earth, even to the verge of ocean, what pain can it feel from the weight of me, a mere lifeless man of straw, that subsists by trade?\" The king was delighted by this speech of his, which put matters in their true light, and gave him a present. Here ends the story of the seller of gram.\n\nThen, on another night, the king returned from the Karnameru temple, after seeing a play, and remarking many lights in the mansion of a certain merchant, he asked what it meant. The merchant answered that they were lakh-lights. The king said to himself, \"The man must be rich.\"\n\nHaving gone into the middle of his palace, and passed the moments of the night, thinking himself lucky, he summoned the merchant to his palace and said to him, \"By always burning these lights you have perpetual illumination, so how many lakhs are there in your fortune?\" Being thus addressed, the merchant said that he actually possessed eighty-four lakhs. The king, as his mind was moved with compassion for him, gave him sixteen lakhs from his treasury, and put it in his power to hoist over his mansion the banner of a crore.\n\nHere ends the story of the sixteen lakhs.\n\nThen, on another occasion, the king once established in the country of B\u0101l\u0101ka, in an inaccessible region, a royal grant to Brahmans, named Sinhapura. In the charter of that grant there were one hundred and six villages. Then, one day, the Brahmans, terrified by the roaring of the lions, asked Siddhar\u0101ja to give them a residence in the middle of the country. He gave them the village of \u0100c\u0101mbili on the banks of the S\u0101hbranati. And when they were going backwards and forwards carrying their grain from Sinhapura, he excused them from paying their dues.\n\nThen the king Siddhar\u0101ja, having made an expedition to M\u0101lavaka, and having come into the vicinity of the village of V\u0101r\u0101hi, summoned the headmen of the village, and in order to test their cleverness, made over to them his own principal state litter to keep for him. Then, when the king had gone further, they all met together, and took the litter to pieces, and stored up the parts of it according to choice in their several homes. Then,\n\n1 I have already given my opinion that sarv\u0101vasara corresponds to the Hindustani diw\u0101n-i-\u0101mm, as opposed to diw\u0101n-i-kh\u0101s.\n2 Hofrath B\u00fchler suggests that we might perhaps read dhanyam\u0101nin\u0101m tan, that man who thought himself rich or fortunate.\n3 P gives n\u012bj\u0101 sejab\u0101ll samarpit\u0101, which gives a better sense. But pradh\u0101n\u0101m must, of course, be changed to pradh\u0101na.\nwhen the king returned, he asked them for that deposit, and when he saw\nthe pieces of the litter, which they brought him separately, he asked with\nastonishment, \"What is the meaning of this?\" They represented, \"Sir,\nno single man of us was sufficient for the duty of protecting this thing\nfrom robbers and other dangers, so we reflected, 'If any misfortune should\nhappen to it, who will be able to give an answer to the king?' Accordingly\nwe determined on the course that we have taken.\" Then the mind of\nthe king was astonished and amused, and he gave them the title of\nBr\u016bca.\u00b9\n\nHere ends the story of the Br\u016bcas of V\u0101r\u0101hi.\n\nThen, once on a time, king Jayasinhadeva returned from conquering\nM\u0101lavaka, and pitched his camp in the village of Unjh\u0101. He was\nhonoured by the people of the village, whom he had adopted as his\nmaternal uncles,\u00b2 with full streams of milk, and abundance of other suitable\nthings, and that very night, wishing to know their joys and sorrows, he\nwent disguised into the house of a certain villager.\u00b3 Though the villager\nwas busied with milking the cows and other things, he said to the king,\n\"Who are you?\" The king informed him that he was a pilgrim, belong-\ning to the country of Mah\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, going to the shrine of Some\u00e7vara. Then\nthe villager asked the king what were the facts about the good and bad\npoints of the country of Mah\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and its king. The king praised the\nninety-six royal virtues of that king, and asked the villager about the\nvirtues and failings of the king of Gujar\u0101t. The villager described the\nskill of Siddhar\u0101ja in providing for the welfare of his subjects, and his\nexceeding tenderness towards his employ\u00e9s, and his other good points.\nThe king brought forward an imaginary fault; whereupon the villager said,\n\"Owing to our evil fortune, our king has one fault, namely, the having no\nson to succeed him.\" Thereupon he shed tears and pleased the king by his\nevidently sincere attitude. Then the next morning at daybreak they all\nassembled together, eager to behold the king, and repaired in a body to his\npavilion, and after respectfully saluting him, they sat down on his peerless\nsofa, and though the officials, whose business it was to assign seats, offered\nthem a seat apart, they said, after testing the sofa's softness by feeling it\n\n\u00b9 Forbes (R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, p. 135) writes: \"Sidh R\u0101j, however, resented the loss of his\nchariot only by giving the headmen the title of the Booches or simpletons of\nV\u0101r\u0101hi, which they long retained.\" I find in B, B\u0101ca for Br\u016bca.\n\n\u00b2 Forbes remarks l.c.:\u2014\n\n\"Merootoong mentions that the head of the village bore the title of the king's\nuncle, a circumstance which may be connected with the local tradition still pre-\nserved that Myenul Devee was sheltered before her marriage by Hem\u0101lu, the head-\nman of Oonja.\" In this story the king is called Jayasinh\u0101, in the previous story\nhe was Siddhar\u0101ja. No doubt the stories were taken by Merutuyga from different\nbooks.\n\n\u00b3 P gives gr\u0101ma\u00f1yo, which would mean \"head of a village.\"\nwith their hands, \"We find we can remain seated here very comfortably;\" and so remain they did, while a smile diffused itself over the lotus of the monarch's face.\n\nHere ends the story of the villagers\u00b9 that lived at Unjh\u0101.\n\nThen, once on a time, a K\u1e63atriya of the Jh\u0101l\u0101 family,\u00b2 named M\u0101ng\u016b, was in the habit, in his daily visits to the court, for the purpose of paying his respects to Siddharaja, of flinging down on the ground a couple of crowbars before he sat down, and of taking them both up, when he rose. Now, when he took food, he consumed an oil-bottle\u00b3 full of ghi, and when he wiped his beard smeared with ghi, the sixteenth part of the ghi remained on it. Once on a time he was ill, and when he was put on diet, at the end of the prescribed allowance of rice-gruel, that was restricted to five m\u0101nas, the physician scolded him, saying, \"Why did you not drink water of immortality in the middle of your meal? For\n\nOne should drink a thousand pitchers before the sun arises,\nBut, when the thousand-rayed one has risen, one drop is equal to a pitcher.\n\nIn the four last gha\u1e6dik\u0101s of the night, until the sun arises, whatever water is drunk or water-regimen employed, is called diamond water, and water of immortality, but the water that is drunk in the morning on an empty stomach, when the sun has risen, is poison; therefore a drop of that is equal to a hundred pitchers. The water that is drunk in the middle of a meal is water of immortality, but the water that is drunk at the end of a meal\u2014water drunk at that time, I say, is called umbrella or umbrella-water.\"\u2074 But M\u0101ng\u016b said, \"I will consider what I have already taken as half my meal, and I will now drink water, and take as much again.\" But, when he was proceeding to do this, that same physician forbade him.\n\nOnce the king asked him why he was unarmed. He answered, \"My weapon is whatever comes handy at the moment;\" and on another occasion, at the time of bathing, he saw an elephant being driven on by its driver; so he struck the animal on its uplifted trunk with a dog that was near him, and when the elephant was thus wounded in a tender place, he seized its tail, and by his peerless strength the elephant was internally ruptured, and the driver was compelled to alight, and then the elephant, falling on the ground, was deprived of life. The same man, when the king of Gujar\u0101t had fled, cut down in battle the invading Mlecchas\u2075 as he pleased, and the\n\n\u00b9 P gives gr\u0101ma\u1e47in\u0101v\u012b, which means headmen of a village.\n\u00b2 See p. 229 and ft. of Forbes's R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101.\n\u00b3 P gives kumbha, a pitcher, which is perhaps better, as the author evidently wishes to represent that M\u0101ng\u016b consumed a great deal of ghi.\n\u2074 According to another reading, \"concealed, or concealed water.\"\n\u2075 i.e. Muhammadans.\nplace where so fighting he went to heaven, is generally known in Pattana as the plot of M\u0101ng\u016b.\n\nHere ends the story of M\u0101ng\u016b, of the family of Jh\u0101l\u0101.\n\nAnother time, some ministers of a Mlecha king having arrived, the king summoned certain makers of costumes that had come from Madhyade\u015ba, and after giving them some secret orders dismissed them. Then, when the next evening had come, and a violent wind had sprung up, resembling that which blows at the time of the destruction of the world, the king repaired to his hall of audience that resembled Sudharman, and looked at the sky. Suddenly he beheld descending from the sky a couple of R\u0101k\u1e63asas illuminated with the gleam of gold by a couple of gold bricks, one of which was placed on the head of each. The people present in court were bewildered with fear, but the two R\u0101k\u1e63asas laid that present on the footstool of the king, and bowed before rolling on the ground, and then made this representation: \"To-day the great king of kings Vibh\u012b\u1e63a\u1e47a, in the city of L\u0101\u1e45k\u0101, at the time of worshipping the gods, remembered the blessed R\u0101ma, the authority that established him on his throne, the flower of the race of Raghu, charming all by his many attractive qualities, and himself perceiving by the eye of knowledge, that his master had now become incarnate as the flower of the C\u0101lukya race in Siddhar\u0101ja, felt his mind excited with longing for him, and sent us, commissioning us to inquire whether he should come here to pay his respects, or whether your Majesty would honour him by going to L\u0101\u1e45k\u0101. So we hope that your Highness will announce by your royal mouth your decision on this point.\" When the two R\u0101k\u1e63asas had uttered this speech, the king reflected a little in his mind, and gave them this answer, \"We ourselves, borne on by a wave of full-blown wonder, will come in due time to visit Vibh\u012b\u1e63a\u1e47a.\" After saying this, he gave them as a return present, a chain consisting of a single string, that adorned his own neck. The two R\u0101k\u1e63asas made this special request, \"May I and this man not be forgotten when you send your servants!\" With these words they departed through the air, and were lost to view. Immediately those Mleecha ministers were bewildered with fear, and abandoned their bold attitude, and being summoned before the king, they uttered words distinguished by a profusion of devotion, and after offering a suitable present to that sovereign, were dismissed by king Siddha.\n\n1 P gives Mlechchop. This I translate. Sam\u0101yatesu in the same line is a misprint for som\u0101yatesu.\n2 Raj\u0101sth\u0101pan\u0101c\u0101ryasya.

This would make Siddhar\u0101ja ask that he might not be forgotten when the king of L\u0101\u1e45k\u0101 sent his servants another time. The B\u00fchler MSS. \u03b1 and \u03b2 agree with P, but give rightly pras\u0101dik\u1e5btya; \u03b1 has vism\u0101r\u0101\u1e47y\u0101\u1e25.\nHere ends the story showing how king Siddha prevented a Mleccha invasion.\n\nThen, shortly afterwards, some bards were celebrating, in the court of the king of the city of Kolliapura, the glory of Siddhar\u0101ja, when the king exclaimed, \"We will believe in Siddhar\u0101ja as a king really skilled in magic arts, when he shows us some manifest wonder.\" The bards, having been thus snubbed by that king, reported the matter to Siddhar\u0101ja. Then the king looked round his court, and a certain officer, who knew his mind, placed his hands in an attitude of supplication, and thus manifested his own wish. The king asked him in secret the reason of his behaviour, whereupon he told the king what the king's desire was, and said in so many words, \"This matter can be arranged at the cost of three lakhs.\" Without any delay, having obtained the three lakhs from the king, in a moment indicated by the astrologers, he disguised himself as a merchant, collected all his merchandise, and took with him, to keep up the character of a magician, a couple of golden shoes studded with jewels, and a magnificent magician's wand, and a couple of jewelled earrings, and a magic garment characteristic of that kind of magic, and a short petticoat, bright as the sun, and after completing the journey in a few days, he took up his abode in that city. When the night of the Diwali festival was near, and the wives of the king of that city came to his palace, in order to worship the goddess Mah\u0101lak\u1e63mi, that officer, having assumed the disguise of a magician, adorned with all those paraphernalia, and being accompanied by a certain Barbara, who had carefully practised flying in the air, suddenly appeared on the pedestal of the goddess. He offered an oblation of gold, jewels, and camphor to the goddesses, and distributed to the king's wives betel similarly adorned, and left there a magic garment marked with the name of king Siddha, pretending that it was a religious gift, and mounting on the back of Barbara, flew up into the air, and so returned as he came. When the night came to an end, the king was informed by his wives of this act of the hostile monarch, and being bewildered with fear, he sent back that present to king Siddha by the hands of his ministers. Then that officer quickly hurried through the business of buying and selling his wares, and so on, and sent a message to his king by a swift runner, that he was not to grant an audience to those ministers until his arrival. After that, he arrived\n\n1 Siddha often means \"an adept in magic arts.\"\n2 P has sabbh\u0101m.\n3 I read with a and P, taccittav\u0113dina.\n4 Here a and \u03b2 give siddhasagketa\u1e41 for siddhapaykeva.

The king, having been informed of the real state of the case, took such steps to win over those ministers as the occasion demanded.\n\nHere ends the story of the king of Koll\u0101pura.\n\nKing Siddhar\u0101ja brought back king Ya\u00e7ovarman as a captive from the country of M\u0101lava. While a general audience was being given, a jester, named Silana, sang behind the king, \"The sea is drowned in the boat.\" The king rebuked him, saying, \"You are talking incongruous nonsense.\" But he said, \"The sea of M\u0101lava is drowned in the land of Gujar\u0101t, which resembles a boat.\" Thus he explained away the ornament of contradiction by the ornament of the necessary conclusion, and received a golden tongue from the king.\n\nHere ends the story of Silana the jester.\n\nOnce on a time an eloquent diplomatic agent of Siddhar\u0101ja was questioned by a king of Benares, named Jayacandra, about the nature of the temples, cisterns, reservoirs, and so on of Anahillapura, and the king made to him this severe reflection on the city:\u2014\"The water of the Sahasralinga tank is the remains of an offering to \u0106iva, and since it ought not to be touched, those who use it are therefore hostile to both worlds; how then can the people of that place increase in power? So king Siddha acted very improperly in having the tank constructed.\" The diplomatic agent was inwardly irritated by the king's speech, and asked him this question, \"Where does the water come from that is drunk in this city of Benares?\" The king answered, \"We drink the water of the Ganges.\" The diplomatic agent rejoined, \"Is not the water of the river of the gods the remains of an offering to \u0106iva, since \u0106iva's head is the abiding-place of the Ganges?\"\n\nHere ends the story of the Gujar\u0101ti minister's conversation with king Jayacandra.\n\nOnce on a time a diplomatic agent came from the land of Kar\u1e47\u0101\u1e6da, and when queen Mayanalladevi asked him for news of the health of her father, king Jayakecin, he gave her, with eyes suffused with tears, the following report:\u2014\"My lady, the great king Jayakecin, whose name is invoked auspiciously, at the time of taking his meal called a pet parrot to come out of its cage. The parrot uttered the word 'Pusa,' but the king looked round, and not seeing the cat, which was hiding under the vessel containing\n\n---\n\n1 Avasara is probably equivalent here to sarv\u0101vasara.\n2 For \"contradiction\" (vivaha) see S\u0101hitya Darpana, 718; for \"necessary conclusion\" (arthapatti) see ibid. 737.\n3 P, a, and B give ukta\u1e41, which appears to be ungrammatical.\n4 I find in a, \u0106it\u0101ntam\u0101l\u0101yata \u0101sryayataya tatasvam\u0101no lokadvayavirodhena tatra v\u0101stavyo lokah. The reading of B is almost identical.

Thereupon the parrot flew out of the cage, and perched on that golden vessel, and was immediately killed by that cruel monster. When the king saw that his pet was killed, he put down the mouthful of food that he was about to eat, and though he was dissuaded by his courtiers, who knew how to put the matter suitably in words, he replied,\u2014\n\n'Let my kingdom depart, let my prosperity depart, let even my life depart immediately,\nBut let not the promise, which I myself gave, ever be broken!'\n\n\"Repeating this sentence over to himself, as if it were the name of a favourite divinity, he ascended, together with that parrot, a funeral pyre piled up with wood.\"\n\nWhen Mayanalladevi heard this speech, she was plunged in a lake of grief, but wise men drew her out of it, by extending to her the supporting hand of eminent religious counsel. Then she went on a pilgrimage to Some\u00e7vara Pattana for the good of her father's soul, and summoned a certain Brahman who knew the three Vedas, and at the time of placing the water donation in his hand, she said, \"If you will take my sins in three lives, I will give you the gift, but not otherwise.\" He exhibited special satisfaction at that offer of hers, and received from her a pitcher full of sins, accompanied by elephants, horses, gold, and so on. Then he gave all that away to Brahmins. The queen asked him, \"What is the meaning of this proceeding?\" He answered, \"I took over your sins in three lives, because I reflected that it was owing to your merit in a former existence, that you had been in this life the wife of a king and the mother of a king; and, moreover, that your next life would be one ensuring felicity, owing to these your transcendent gifts and good deeds.\" I thought that, when you had once undertaken to make over a pitcher full of sins, some low Brahman would take it, and plunge himself and you in the sea of successive births, whereas I, who have renounced all property, by receiving all this wealth, and giving it away again, have obtained merit containing all the qualities of the conduct that I took over: and this is the preferable alternative. This is why I took that pitcher.\"\n\n1 I read bhojanabhdjanadbdhagavartinam, which I find in a and B. The text probably means \"hiding under the boiled rice provided for the king's meal.\"\n2 The word used in the original is saha\u00e7amana, which is used in the case of a widow who is burned with her husband's corpse.\n3 Apparently the present life, the life immediately preceding it, and that immediately succeeding it.\n4 P appears to give d\u00e3nasukrtaih.\n5 For labdh\u00e3sagunah P and a give labdh\u00e3sagunam. P, a and B omit labdham before iti. The reading of a and P probably means \"I now possess merit eight times as great as that which I took over.\" I find in B, labdh\u00e3sagunam.\nHere ends the story of the pitcher of sins.\n\nThen, once on a time, Siddhar\u0101ja, having warred against the land of M\u0101lava, was returning to his camp in his own country, when he perceived that the road was blocked in midway by an irresistible force of Bhillas. That fact having become known, the minister, named S\u0101nt\u016b, took horses from every town and every village, and put litters on every bullock, and by thus assembling a superior force,\u00b9 he frightened away the Bhillas, and brought back Siddhar\u0101ja without any difficulty.\n\nHere ends the story of S\u0101nt\u016b, the minister, also called the story of intellectual resource.\u00b2\n\nThen, on a certain night, two truly sharp-witted servants were engaged in shampooing the feet of Siddhar\u0101ja. The first, thinking that his eyes were closed in sleep, praised Siddhar\u0101ja as able to administer punishment and favours, as the wishing-tree of his servants, and the home of all kingly virtues. But the other, under the same impression, praised that monarch's actions in former births, which had given him the throne of a mighty kingdom. That king, as he had overheard this conversation,\u00b3 was determined to render nugatory the praise of his previous actions, and the next day he gave to the servant who had praised himself, a promotion letter, without informing him what its contents were. He wrote in it, \"You must give this servant the post of commander of a hundred horse,\" and ordered the servant to take it to the prime minister S\u0101nt\u016b. Then, as the servant was going down the staircase leading from the upper room, his foot slipped, and he fell on the floor, and was obliged to admit that he had slightly injured his limbs. The other servant, who was coming behind him, said to him, \"What is the meaning of this?\" The first told him of his condition, and made over to him the letter, and was placed in a litter and carried home. The prime minister, in accordance with the letter, gave to the servant who brought it, the post of commander of a hundred horse.\n\nThen the king, reflecting on what actually befell the two servants, believed thenceforth that actions performed in a previous state of existence are more powerful than anything else.\n\nPersonal appearance does not produce fruit, nor family, nor character,\nNor knowledge, nor service performed to men,\nTruly merits accumulated by previous penance\nIn due time produce fruit for a man, even as trees.\u2074\n\n\u00b9 I find in a, melit\u0101tidalastadbalena.\n\u00b2 The reading of a and b may be thus translated, \"the story of the intellectual resource of the minister S\u0101nt\u016b.\"\n\u00b3 Akar\u1e47itena should probably be akarnite, the reading of b.\n\u2074 This is No. 3825 in B\u00f6htlingk's Indische Spr\u00fcche. He finds it in Bhar\u1e6d\u1e6dhari. He reads in the second line na ca patnak\u1e5bt\u0101pi sev\u0101. The Bombay editor gives a various reading from the Subh\u0101sit\u0101val\u012b.\nHere ends the story of the predominance of the servant's merit in a previous state of existence.\n\nVictory to that lopper of eminences in the three worlds, king Jesala,\nWho, by extirpating the race of kings, made one umbrella in the earth!\nMen intent on conquest do not brook that anything should be superior even\nby a m\u0101\u1e6dr\u0101,\nTherefore thou, the lord of the earth, didst sweep away the lord of Dh\u0101r\u0101.\u00b9\nAbandon thy pride, O Sarasvat\u012b; leave off, O Ganges, the adornments of\nthy good fortune;\nO Yamun\u0101, fruitless are thy meanderings; O Rev\u0101, cease thy rapid\nrace!\nThe sea is now in love\u00b2 with a new bride, even the river produced by the\nflow\nOf blood spouting from the enemies' shoulders cleft by the sword of\nSiddhe\u00e7a.\nO victorious royal lion-king, truly, when thy triumphant march begins,\nOn account of the drying up of the beds of waters by the cheeks of elephants,\nand in the expectation of the wounds of heroes,\nConsidering that the time has come for the destruction of their several\nlords, afflicted with anxiety,\nThe female fish weeps, and the female gnat laughs, women think of the\nthrobbing of their left limbs.\u00b3\nThe land of a lakh and a quarter, with many lakhs,\nWas given to king \u0100n\u0101ka, who bent in submission,\nBut thou didst not suffer even M\u0101lava\u2074 to remain\nWith the defiant enemy Ya\u00e7ovarman, O Siddhar\u0101ja.\n\nMany other panegyrics and stories, like these, are recorded of him.\nKing Jayasinha ascended the throne in the year 1150\u2075 of the Vikrama\nera; so he reigned forty-nine years.\n\nHere ends the third chapter of the Prabandhacint\u0101ma\u1e47i compiled by the\nteacher Merutunga, entitled the description of the various exploits and\nmanifold achievements of the two kings Kar\u1e47a and Siddhar\u0101ja.\n\n\u00b9 Dh\u0101r\u0101n\u0101tha, lord of Dh\u0101r\u0101, is longer by a m\u0101\u1e6dr\u0101 than Dh\u0101r\u0101n\u0101tha, which means\n\"lord of earth.\"\n\u00b2 Or \"dyed red with.\" The sea is looked upon as the husband of the rivers.\nRev\u0101 is another name for the Narmad\u0101 (Nerbudda).

Mabel Duff (Mrs. Rickmers); Indian\nChronology, p. 134.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE HISTORY OF KUM\u0100RAP\u0100LA.\n\nNow begins the history of Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, that most excellent follower of the Jina.\n\nWhen the greater Bh\u012bm\u0101deva was ruling as emperor in the glorious Anahillapupattana, there was in the city of king Bh\u012bma a het\u0101ra of the name of C\u0101ul\u0101devi, who was in Pattana a famous vessel of beauty and merit, excelling even matrons of good family. The king, considering that she was a person of eminent rectitude, in order to test that disposition of hers, caused to be deposited with her by his servants, as a retaining fee, a dagger worth a lakh and a quarter. And in his eagerness, that very night, he seized the auspicious moment for setting out on an expedition to a foreign land. The king remained two years in the country of M\u0101lava, intently engaged in war. That C\u0101ul\u0101devi, on the strength of the retaining fee given by the king, avoided all men, and lived in a state of perfect chastity. Bh\u012bma of boundless valour returned home victorious, and having heard of that behaviour of hers, which was repeated from man to man, and so came to his ears, placed her in his harem. Her son was Harip\u0101la, his son was Tribhuvanap\u0101la, and his son was the king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la. Now Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, though he did not know the true faith, was compassionate, and behaved like a brother to the wives of others. But Siddhar\u0101ja was told by those who knew the science of foretelling men's careers by marks on their bodies, that Kum\u0101rap\u0101la should be king immediately after him. As Kum\u0101rap\u0101la was of low birth, Siddhar\u0101ja could not bear the idea of his inheriting the throne, and was always on the look-out for an opportunity of compassing his destruction. Kum\u0101rap\u0101la suspected that fact, and having his mind filled with fear of that king, wandered round many and various foreign countries disguised as an ascetic, and after he had spent many years in this way, he returned to Pattana and lived in a certain monastery. Then, on the occasion of the gr\u0101dha of king Karna, king Siddhar\u0101ja invited, out of religious zeal, all hermits, and as he was himself washing the feet of them all, one by one, he touched\n\n1 I take it that what is used to denote Bh\u012bma I. as opposed to Bh\u012bma II., who would probably be called laghu. (See B\u00fchler's Arisimha, pp. 11 and 18.)\n2 Or Cakul\u0101devi.\n3 Here P gives atic\u0101yin\u012bn.\n4 I read with P, a and \u03b2, ta\u1e0dlatta for tadvi\u1e6d\u1e6da. For the circumstance, cp. Fick, Die Sociale Gliederung zu Buddha's Zeit, p. 96.\n5 For other accounts see B\u00fchler's H.C. p. 23, and note 55.\n6 I read aviditadharma'pi with a and \u03b2. Kum\u0101rap\u0101la's conversion apparently took place after he had ascended the throne.\nwith the palm of his hand the feet of the hermit named Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, which were soft as a lotus; thereupon he recognized by the upward lines on them and other signs, that the hermit was worthy of a throne, and he looked upon him with fixed gaze. The hermit knew by his gestures that he was hostile to him, so he immediately changed his clothes, and fled with the rapidity of a crow. A potter, named \u0100linga, in whose shop earthenware vessels were being baked, hid him among them, and so saved him from the king's officers, who were on his track. In due course he went on from that place, and having been chased by the king's men, who were busily engaged in looking for him, and not seeing any difficult ground near, that would serve as a refuge, he fled into a certain field, where the watchers of the field piled up higher a heap that they were making with lopped-off boughs of a thorny tree, and hid him in it, and then went back to their places. The tracker followed the track to that place, but the king's soldiers, thinking that it was altogether improbable that he would be there, turned back, after probing that heap of boughs with the point of a lance, and not finding him after all. Those who were looking after the field took him out of that heap on the second day, and thence he went on along a certain tedious desolate road, and on the way rested under the shade of a tree. There he saw with furtive glance a mouse bringing a silver coin in its mouth out of a hole, and watched till it brought out as many as twenty-one silver coins, then it took one back and entered its hole. But he seized all the coins that were left behind and hid himself. In the meanwhile the mouse came back, and not seeing them, died of grief on that account. His mind was afflicted with sorrow for that occurrence, and he remained plunged in grief for a long time; then he went on, and as he had been without food on the journey for three days, his belly was pinched with hunger. Then a certain daughter-in-law of a rich man, who was returning from her father-in-law's house to the house of her father, refreshed him with a dish of ground rice mixed with curds, perfumed with camphor, treating him as kindly as if he had been her brother. After that, he wandered through many foreign countries, and when he reached Cambay, he went to the great minister Udayana to ask for provision for his journey. Hearing that he had gone to his pa\u1e47\u1e0dadha-house, he went there,\n\n1 I read r\u0101japurusebhyo after tad\u0101nupadikebhyo with \u03b1, \u03b2 and P.\n2 I read with \u03b1 and \u03b2, anav\u0101lokya. P has a letter m which no doubt stands for n. The text means that Kum\u0101rap\u0101la did see difficult ground near.\n3 I read pr\u0101ntar\u016bntaravajon with \u03b1, and \"ch\u0101y\u0101y\u0101m\" with \u03b1, \u03b2 and P.\n4 This represents the Jaina Prakrit word posaha, Pali, uposatha. The proper Sanskrit word is upavasatha. See Hoernle's translation of the Uv\u0101saga Dasa\u1e45ga, page 32. On page 42 Ananda cleans \"a house for keeping the posaha observances.\" He devotes \"himself in his posaha-house to the self-mortification by the last mortal emaciation\" (p. 54). Perhaps it is here equivalent to \"monastery.\" Hofrath B\u00fchler uses \"Jaina-Kloster\" as an equivalent (H.C. p. 25).\nand Udayana questioned the teacher Hemacandra about him. Hemacandra replied as follows. Observing the extraordinary marks on his body, Hemacandra gave it as his opinion that Kum\u0101rap\u0101la would be a universal monarch. That K\u1e63atriya, as he had been afflicted with poverty from his birth, considered that speech very doubtful, and remarked, \"This is impossible.\"\u00b9 The sage said, \"If in the 1199th year of the era of Vikram\u0101ditya, on the second day of the dark fortnight of K\u0101rtika, on a Sunday, in the nak\u1e63atra of Hasta, you are not solemnly installed as king, I will thenceforth renounce all observation of prognostics.\" With these words he wrote down his prediction on paper, and gave one copy to the minister and another to Kum\u0101rap\u0101la. Then that K\u1e63atriya, as his mind was full of astonishment at the skill which Hemacandra possessed in the arts, said, \"If this is true, then you shall be king, and I will be the dust of your feet.\" When that Kum\u0101rap\u0101la made this promise, the hermit exclaimed, \"What have I to do with desire for a kingdom that leads to hell? Let that be! But you must be grateful, and must not forget this speech, and must always be devoted to the law of the Jina.\" Kum\u0101rap\u0101la reverently accepted this admonition, and taking leave of him, went home with the minister. The minister refreshed him with a bath and food and drink, and gave him the supplies for the journey that he asked for, and sent him on his way, and so he went to the country of M\u0101lava. He saw on a laudatory tablet in the temple of Ku\u1e0dange\u00e7vara\u2014\n\nWhen one thousand, one hundred and ninety-nine years are completed,\nThere shall arise Kum\u0101ra the king, like you, O king Vikrama.\n\nWhen he saw this g\u0101th\u0101, his mind was filled with astonishment, and hearing that king Siddha, lord of Gujar\u0101t, had gone to the next world, he returned from M\u0101lava, and as his supplies for the journey were exhausted, he took food from the shop of some shopkeeper in that\u00b2 city, and fled and came to Anahillapura, and in the night, as he had no money, he went to the shop of a baker and ate his food, and reached the mansion of his sister's husband, R\u0101ja K\u0101nhdad\u0113va. He, having just returned from the king's palace, treated him with respect, and took him in, and he slept there after he had been refreshed with good food and other luxuries. Early next morning that brother-in-law\u00b3 of his made his forces ready for battle, and took Kum\u0101rap\u0101la with him, and in order to see who ought to be installed as\n\n\u00b9 I read k\u1e63atryen\u0101sambh\u0101vyametad, which I find in P and a; \u03b2 has k\u1e63atryena asambh\u0101vyam without sandhi.\n\u00b2 I read with a and \u03b2,\u00b0 rambalastasmin. There is a great divergence of reading in this passage.\n\u00b3 More literally \"sister's husband.\"\nsovereign, he first placed a prince on the cloth of state,\u00b9 and seeing that he did not cover himself even with the border of his upper garment, he put another in his place. As he saw that the second prince folded his hands together, he also was rejected. Then by the order of K\u0101nha\u1e0dadeva, Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, folding his garment tightly round him, snuffing up the air, sat down on the throne, brandishing his sword in his hand. He was at this time of the age of fifty years. The family chaplain bestowed a blessing on him, while drums and other musical instruments sounded, and K\u0101nha\u1e0dadeva prostrated himself before him, touching the earth with five limbs. Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, on account of his mature age, and the discernment that he had acquired by wandering about in foreign countries, himself held the reins of government, and thereby gave offence to the old royal servants, who banded themselves together, and determined to kill him. They placed assassins in dark gateways, but the king was informed of that circumstance by a certain trustworthy servant, who was impelled to do this by the king's merits in a previous state of existence, so he avoided the entrance\u00b2 where they were posted, and entered the fort by another gate, and then dismissed those ministers to the city of Yama. That provincial governor, his sister's husband, presuming on his connection with him by being his brother-in-law, and on the fact of his having been the authority that established him on his throne, began babbling about the secrets of his former depressed condition. Afterwards the king said to him, \"Come, my brother-in-law, you must not, on the royal circuit and in the public hall of audience, make jokes about the secrets of my former depressed condition; henceforth you must not say such things before the court, but whenever we are alone you may say what you please.\" This request the king made to him. But owing to his haughtiness and contemptuous spirit, he rejected his speech, though salutary, as one who longs for death rejects medicine, and said, \"Foolish man, are you at this early stage abandoning your feet?\" The king dissimulated his real feelings by disguising the expression of his face; but next day he had his brother-in-law's limbs paralyzed\u00b3 by wrestlers, to whom the royal orders had been conveyed, and after putting out both his eyes, he sent him to his house.\n\n\u00b9 Patte. So on page 38 of the text, patte samupavistab means \"ascended the throne.\"\n\u00b2 I follow P and the printed text, but the editor in his Errata gives prade\u015bam with a; B has deca\u1e25. This would mean, \"he avoided the place where the assassins were posted.\"\n\u00b3 In the Kath\u0101 Ko\u1e47a the phrase g\u0101trabhayga\u1e41 k\u1e5btv\u0101 is used in a similar sense, p. 120 of my translation. Here we have aggabhayga\u1e41 k\u1e5btv\u0101. In the Kath\u0101 Ko\u1e47a the persons so victimized have the use of their limbs restored to them. On page 188 of the text, aggabhayga is used with regard to the servant who was disabled by falling down the staircase. The word is explained in Molesworth's Marathi Dictionary as \"a feeling of luxation in the joints, of shatteredness or great relaxation and lassitude.\" It is unnecessary to remind readers of Indian history of the blinding of K\u0101mr\u0101n by Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\nIn the beginning this truly was kindled by me,\nAnd will therefore not burn me, even though treated with disrepect,\nUnder this delusion, even with the joint of the finger\nOne should not touch a candle, likewise not a king.\\footnote{I find in \\(a\\), \\(spri\u1e63eta ko dipam iv\u0101vani\u00e7\u0101\u1e41\\).}\n\nReflecting on this maxim, the military officers in every direction, having\ntheir minds bewildered with fear, from that time forward treated the king\nwith respect on every occasion. That king made the son of Udayana, who\nwas his benefactor in time past, named V\u0101gbha\u1e6dadeva, his prime minister.\nHe made a man named \u0100lingga\\footnote{This Ali\u1e45ga is mentioned again on page 233 of the printed text. He is clearly not the same man as Ali\u1e45ga the potter.} the chief member of his council. But the\nprince named B\u0101hada, the son of the prime minister, Udayanadeva, whom\nSiddhar\u0101ja had adopted as his son, despising Kum\u0101rap\u0101ladeva, made\nhimself the soldier of the king of the Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a\\footnote{B\u00fchler tells us that this is identical with \u00c7\u0101kambhari, the modern S\u0101mbhar, in Eastern Rajputana. (H.C. p. 31.)} country. He, desiring\nto make war on Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, having won over to his side all the officers in\nthose parts with bribes, attentions and gifts, bringing with him the king\nof the Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a country, surrounded with a formidable army, arrived on\nthe borders of Gujar\u0101t. Then the emperor of the Caulukya race encamped\nhis own military force in a defiant attitude near the camp of the enemy.\nWhen a day for battle had been fixed, and the border\\footnote{Siman in the sense of \"border\" is said to be usually feminine.} was being cleared of\nenemies, while the force of all four arms was being made ready, the driver\nof the royal elephant, C\u0101ulinga by name, being reprimanded by the king\nfor some offence, threw down his elephant-hook in a rage. Then the king\nappointed to his post an elephant-driver named S\u0101mala, a man of incalculable merit, giving him at the same time very much wealth.\\footnote{But I find in \\(a\\), \\(\u03b2\\) and \\(P\\), \\(duk\u0101lavastrad\u0101nap\u016brvak\u0101\u1e41\\), which would mean that\nthe king gave him a splendid set of garments.} So he put\narmour on his own elephant, named Kalahapa\u00f1c\u0101nana,\\footnote{This probably means \"the lion of strife.\" But pa\u00f1c\u0101nana (five-faced) often means the god Ci\u015bva.} and placed the\nking's seat upon him, and there he put thirty-six weapons, and he himself,\na man filled with the whole circle of arts,\\footnote{This appears to be introduced for the sake of a pun.} placed his feet in the neck-rope\nand mounted. When the Caulukya king was in his seat on the elephant,\nseeing that the men, who were ordered by the generals commanding in the\nbattle to make the soldiers charge, disobeyed the order, owing to prince\nB\u0101hada's having sown the seeds of disaffection in the army, he came to the\nconclusion that his army was corrupted. So he ordered the elephant-driver\nto advance, recognizing in the force opposed to him the elephant of the\nking of the Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a land by the insignia of the umbrella and chowries.\n\n1 I find in \\(a\\), \\(spri\u1e63eta ko dipam iv\u0101vani\u00e7\u0101\u1e41\\).\n2 This Ali\u1e45ga is mentioned again on page 233 of the printed text. He is clearly not the same man as Ali\u1e45ga the potter.\n3 B\u00fchler tells us that this is identical with \u00c7\u0101kambhari, the modern S\u0101mbhar, in Eastern Rajputana. (H.C. p. 31.)\n4 Siman in the sense of \"border\" is said to be usually feminine.\n5 But I find in \\(a\\), \\(\u03b2\\) and \\(P\\), \\(duk\u0101lavastrad\u0101nap\u016brvak\u0101\u1e41\\), which would mean that\nthe king gave him a splendid set of garments.\n6 This probably means \"the lion of strife.\" But pa\u00f1c\u0101nana (five-faced) often means the god Ci\u015bva.\n7 This appears to be introduced for the sake of a pun.\nAs the solidarity of his army was broken, he made up his mind that he would have to fight alone, and he ordered his elephant-driver to take his elephant near the hostile monarch. When he saw that even that elephant-driver hesitated to do what he was ordered, he said, \"Have you also fallen away?\" But the elephant-driver answered, \"Your Majesty, these two, the elephant Kalahapa\u00f1c\u0101nana and the elephant-driver, named \u015aim\u0101la, do not fall away even in the destruction of the world at the end of a Yuga, but on the forehead of the hostile elephant is mounted the shrill-voiced prince B\u0101ha\u1e0da, at whose shout even elephants take to flight.\" After saying this, he covered the ears of his elephant with the two ends of his upper garment, and brought his elephant into contact with the hostile elephant. Then B\u0101ha\u1e0da, knowing that he had previously secured the driver named C\u0101uli, stepping forward from his own elephant, sword in hand, put his foot on the forehead of Kalahapa\u00f1c\u0101nana, with the hope of killing Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, but that driver withdrew his elephant, so B\u0101ha\u1e0da fell on the ground, and was captured by the soldiers of the infantry corps. Then the Caulukya king said to the king of the Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a country, named \u0100n\u0101ka, \"Make ready to use your weapons,\" and skilfully directed an arrow straight towards the lotus of his face. Then he deceived him with sarcastic praise, saying, \"You are an eminent K\u1e63atriya,\" and piercing him with that iron dart, struck him down on the forehead of his elephant, and exclaiming, \"Victory! Victory!\" that king waved a garment in the air, and attacking all the horses of all the chieftains, captured them.\n\nHere ends the story of prince B\u0101ha\u1e0da.\n\nAfter that, the Caulukya king, being a very emperor among the grateful, gave to \u0100linga the potter the splendid grant of Citrak\u016b\u1e6da, containing seven hundred villages. But his descendants, being ashamed of their pedigree, are even now called Sagaras. Those men, who rescued the king by placing him in the middle of the thorn-branches that they had cut, were appointed to the post of guards.\n\nThen a musician, named Sol\u0101ka, having on a certain occasion pleased the king by his skill in singing, received from him a hundred and sixteen dramm\u0101s; but, as he procured with them some confectionery and gave a treat to children, the king was angry and banished him. Then he went to a foreign country, and having delighted the king of it by his skill in singing, he received from him as a mark of favour two elephants, which he brought and presented to the Caulukya monarch, and was therefore honoured by him. Once on a time, a certain foreign musician was making\n\n---\n\n1 P, \u03b1 and \u03b2 read ata for ityuktv\u0101.\n2 I find vicitr\u0101 in \u03b1, \u03b2 and P.\n3 We learn from page 234 of the printed text that Kum\u0101rap\u0101la was considered to be niggardly.\na loud noise of lamentation, saying, \"I have been robbed, I have been robbed.\" Thereupon the king said to him, \"By whom have you been robbed?\" Then the musician answered, \"By a deer. It came near me, attracted by my skill in singing, and I sportively placed a gold chain on its neck, and then it ran away, frightened by a lion.\" Then the king commissioned that king of musicians, named Sol\u0101ka, to recover it, and accordingly he wandered through the forest, and thanks to his great skill in attracting by means of song, led back with him into the city the deer that had its neck adorned with a golden chain, and showed it to that king. Then the lord, the great teacher Hemacandra, who was astonished in his mind at Sol\u0101ka's proficiency in accomplishments, asked him the limit of his skill in song, and he said that the most difficult thing he could accomplish was to make a dry piece of wood put forth shoots. He was then called upon to exhibit that marvellous feat. So he caused to be rooted up and brought from Mount Abu a tree called virahaka, and placed a piece of wood from a dry branch of it in a trench made of earth from Kum\u0101ra, in the king's courtyard, and by his skill in a new song, immediately showed it bursting forth into buds, and so delighted the reverend lord, the sage Hemacandra, and also the king.\n\nHere ends the story of Sol\u0101ka, the worker of wonders.\n\nThen, one day, as the Caulukya emperor was giving a general audience to the people, he heard a bard bestowing on the king of the country of Kukkupa, named Mallik\u0101rjuna, the title of \"grandfather of kings,\" and as he looked round the assembly, deeply indignant at it, he was surprised to see that a minister named \u0100mb\u0101da, knowing the royal mind, showed the palms of his hands joined in a suppliant attitude. Immediately after dismissing the assembly, he asked the minister why he joined the palms of his hands in a suppliant attitude. The minister gave him this answer, \"I joined the palms of my hands in a suppliant attitude, because I knew that your Majesty was thinking whether there was any brave warrior in the assembly that you might send to destroy that semblance of a king, Mallik\u0101rjuna, who falsely prides himself as if he were a king with a complete army of all four arms, and also because I thought myself a fit person to be commissioned by you to do it.\" As soon as \u0100mb\u0101da had made this petition, Kum\u0101rap\u0101la made him commander of an army to march against that king, and gave him a present of five things, and sent him off with all the chieftains. And he, by a continuous series of marches, reached the Kukkupa country, and while he was crossing the river named Kalavini,\n\n---\n\n1 The lion is omitted in \u03b1 and P, and seems unnecessary.\n2 Cp. my translation of the Kath\u0101 Ko\u1e63a, p. 68.\n3 Now called \"the Concan.\"\n4 I adopt the reading of P, \u03b1 and \u03b2, dalan\u0101yakik\u1e5btya.\nthe swollen stream of which was flowing impetuously, and encamping on\nthe further bank, that king Mallik\u0101rjuna, thinking that he was ready for\nbattle, attacked him, and put his army to flight. Then that general,\nhaving been conquered by Mallik\u0101rjuna, and having his face blackened,\nput on black clothes, adorned his crest with a black umbrella, and lived in\na black tent. The Caulukya king, seeing all this, said, \"Whose is this\nencampment?\" They answered, \"This is the encampment of the defeated\ngeneral \u0100mb\u0101da, who has returned from Kukkuna. The king was\nastonished in his mind at his sense of shame, and greeted him graciously\nwith a kind countenance, and sent him once more with other powerful\nchieftains to conquer Mallik\u0101rjuna. But he, when he reached the country\nof Kukkuna, and came face to face with that river, made a bridge across it,\nand carefully transported his army across the river by that way, and at the\nbeginning of the desperate battle, that brave warrior \u0100mb\u0101da, arresting,\nby his gallant behaviour, Mallik\u0101rjuna, who was mounted on the back of\nan elephant, climbed up by the elephant's club-like tusks, as by a ladder,\nand mounting on his forehead, with the wild joy of battle raging in his\nveins, he exclaimed, \"Strike first! call to mind your favourite deity!\"\nand with a blow of his sharp terrible sword he struck down Mallik\u0101rjuna\nto the earth, and while the chieftains were engaged in plundering his town,\nhe slew him with ease, as a lion's whelp slays an elephant. He had Malli-\nk\u0101rjuna's head set in gold, and after establishing in that country the\nauthority\u00b9 of the Caulukya sovereign, he reached Anahillapura, and while\nseventy-two chieftains were sitting in court, he did obeisance\u00b2 to the feet\nof king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, presenting at the same time the head of Mallik\u0101r-\njuna, the king of the Kukkuna country.\n\nThe king was presented by \u0100mb\u0101da with the following articles, together\nwith the lotus-like head of Mallik\u0101rjuna:\u2014\n\nOne highly-ornamented gown, two jewelled wrappers,\u00b3 three necklaces\nthat were talismans against misfortune, four zones that were charms to\nbring about union, also thirty-two golden ewers, also six sere\u2074 of pearls, one\nfour-tusked elephant, 120 bowls, fourteen crores and a half of money by\nway of fine.\n\nThe king was so pleased with \u0100mb\u0101da's exploit, that he gave that great\nprovincial governor the title of \"King's grandfather\" with his own royal\nmouth. Here ends the story of \u0100mb\u0101da.\n\nThen, once on a time, in Anahillapura, the joyous\u2075 funeral ceremony of\nthe mother of the Jaina doctor Hemacandra, named P\u0101hi\u1e47\u012b, to whom he\n\n\u00b9 P, a and \u03b2 give aj\u00f1\u0101m.\n\u00b2 But P, a and \u03b2 give vastu for vavande.\n\u00b3 I find in a and \u03b2, pa\u010dhevadau.\n\u2074 Probably, as Forbes points out, the funeral ceremony is called joyous, because\nthe lady was a devotee.\n\u2075 Probably, as Forbes points out, the funeral ceremony is called joyous, because\nthe lady was a devotee.\nhad administered a vow, and at the time of her going to the other world had given the merit of ten million of Namask\u0101ra formulas, was being performed after her decease, and in the neighbourhood of the Tripurusa temple, the ascetics of that institution, out of their innate spitefulness, insulted him by breaking the car in which her body was being carried. Enraged at that insult, as soon as he had performed her obsequies, he honoured with his presence the camp of king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, who had gone to M\u0101lava; for\u2014\n\nA man must be a king in his own right, or he must get some king under his influence,\nBut there is no other way by which human beings can attain their ends.\n\nConsidering that this saying is true, he had his arrival notified by the minister Udayana to the king, and as the king was the very crest-jewel of grateful men, he had him conducted to his palace with great attention. The king reminded him of the fact that he had discerned the indications that he himself would obtain the crown, and pressed him, saying, \"You must always come to me at the time of worshipping the gods.\" The sage said,\u2014\nWe eat what we receive as alms; we wear old garments,\nWe sleep on the bare earth, what have we to do with kings?\n\nThe king answered,\u2014\n\"It matters not whether one's friend be a king or a hermit;\nIt matters not whether one's wife be a fair woman or a cave;\nIt matters not whether one's guiding book be the Veda or a treatise on the Supreme Soul;\nIt matters not whether one's god be Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or the Jina.\"\n\nIn accordance with this composition of the great poet, I desire friendship with you, in order to provide for the next world.\" Then the king, considering that silence implies consent, and having ascertained so far the real sentiments of the great sage, with his own royal mouth informed the door-keepers, who were for raising obstruction, that the sage was to be admitted at all times. So the sage Hemacandra came and went when he pleased;\n\n1 I find in a, manusahain. (See Pischel's H.C.G. IV. 339.)\n2 I read v\u012bmrcnta with a and \u03b2.\n3 This stanza is given in B\u00f6htlingk's Indische Spruche as follows, \"It matters not whether one's god be Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or \u015aiva; it matters not whether one's friend be a king or a hermit; it matters not whether one dwells in a city or a wood; it matters not whether one's wife be a fair woman or a cave.\" The stanza is attributed by B\u00f6htlingk to Bhar\u1e6d\u1e5bhari. For the vedam of the printed text a reads vaidya\u1e41. Vaidya\u1e41 probably means a treatise on medicine.\nbut when the king praised his many good qualities, the royal chaplain Amiga said out of enmity,\u2014\nVi\u00e7v\u0101mitra and Par\u0101\u00e7ara and others who lived on water and leaves,\u00b9\nThese even were fascinated when they beheld the charming lotus of the female face,\nAs for men who live on food blended with ghi,\u00b2 and accompanied with milk and curds,\nHow can they restrain their senses? Only consider the hypocrisy of it!\nAs soon as the chaplain had said this, Hemacandra answered,\u2014\nThe mighty lion, that devours the flesh of elephants and wild boars,\nTruly visits the lioness once in a year,\nThe dove, though it lives on hard fragments of stone,\nIs every day in love: tell me, what is the reason of this?\nWhen this answer, that closed the chaplain\u2019s mouth, had been given,\nsome envious person said, in the presence of the king, \u201cThese \u00c7vet\u0101mbaras do not even believe in the sun.\u201d Then Hemacandra said, \u201cThe proof that we do, is that\u2014\nWe possess the sun, the abode of splendour, enshrined in our hearts,\nAnd when we know that the calamity of setting has overtaken him, we abandon food.\u201d\u00b3\nThus by dexterity in argument the sage closed the mouth of the objector, establishing this principle, \u201cWe Jainas are the true worshippers of the sun, not these people.\u201d Then, one day, Hemacandra, the moon,\u2074 that dispelled the darkness of delusion, came to the palace, at the time of worshipping the gods, and the Ga\u00f1in Ya\u00e7a\u00e7andra swept the place where he was to sit, with a brush, and then placed on it a woollen rug.\u2075 The king, as he did not know the truth, asked Hemacandra what was the meaning of this proceeding. He answered, \u201cPerhaps there is some living creature here, and this trouble is taken to prevent its being injured.\u201d The king remarked, \u201cWhen a living creature is actually seen, this proceeding is appropriate, but not otherwise, as it involves a great deal of useless exertion.\u201d\nWhen that Jaina doctor heard that reasonable remark of the king\u2019s, he answered, \u201cDo you get ready an army, consisting of elephants, horses, and\n\n\u00b9 P gives ye c\u00e2mbupattr\u0101\u00e7inas. This I follow.\n\u00b2 P gives suk\u1e5btam, well cooked.\n\u00b3 The followers of the Jaina religion are not allowed to eat at night.\n\u2074 Candra means moon; Hemacandra means \u201cmoon of gold\u201d; while Ya\u00e7a\u00e7andra means \u201cmoon of fame.\u201d\n\u2075 I read kambale with a and \u03b2.\nso on, when your enemy, the rival king, arrives, or beforehand? Our religious practice is in accordance with this system which kings follow in their foreign policy.\" The king thereupon, as his heart was charmed by his merits, offered him the kingdom which he had previously promised to him. But the sage refused it, because such a proceeding was contrary to all authoritative treatises, for he said,\u2014\nOf those Brahmans who are burnt by receiving from a king,\\(^1\\) O Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira,\nAs of seeds that are burnt, no second birth is known.\nThis is a Pauranic saying, and the scripture of the Jainas speaks to the same effect,\u2014\nStore, household furniture, food of kings, and what one fancies as one's favourite dish.\\(^2\\)\nAstonished in his mind by the above admonition the king reached Pattana.\nOn another occasion the king asked the hermit, \"Can the diffusion of my fame be made to last till the end of the Kalpa by any contrivance?\" When Hemacandra heard this speech of the king's, he answered, \"By relieving the whole world from debt as Vikram\u0101ditya did;\u2014or restore the wooden temple of Some\u00e7vara, which is almost destroyed by the neighbouring sea, owing to the showers of ocean spray that fall over it, in order that you may attain glory enduring to the end of the present Yuga.\" By this utterance of Hemacandra, which resembled the rays of the moon, the sea of the king's joy surged up, and he discerned the real character of that great hermit, looking upon him as a father, a teacher, and a god.\\(^3\\) Immediately, without blaming the Brahmans, he had the favourable moment for restoring the temple indicated by the astrologers, and sent a pa\u00f1cakula there, and had the building of the temple commenced.\nOn another occasion the king's heart was so charmed with the world-surpassing virtues of Hemacandra, that he asked the minister Udayana this question, \"In what race the ornament of all races, and in what country\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) But \\(a\\) has r\u0101jya; \\(\u03b2\\) and \\(P\\) support the printed text.\n\\(^2\\) Professor Leumann points out that this is found in the Daqavaiik\u0101lika S\u016btras. See page 614 of his edition. I adopt his translation given on page 598. Of course I read san\u00f1ihi with Professor Leumann and \\(\u03b2\\). MS. \\(a\\) reads san\u00f1ihi. The line is an extract from an enumeration of the things which a Jaina monk must reject.\n\\(^3\\) The reading of \\(a\\) would give a different sense, \"The sea of the king's joy surged up, and looking upon that great hermit as a father, a teacher, and a god, and blaming other twice-born as spurious, he had the favourable, &c.\" But \\(\u03b2\\) omits the word \"twice-born,\" giving vij\u0101t\u012bn star\u0101n nindan, while \\(a\\) has vij\u0101t\u012b star\u0101vij\u0101n nindan; \\(P\\) agrees with \\(a\\), but gives anindan. Probably vij\u0101t\u012b has the sense assigned to it by Finot, Lapidaires Indiens, p. xxiv. But it may mean merely \"people of different castes.\"\nthe resort of all merit, and in what city the mine of all virtue, was such a gem of men produced?\" When the king was pleased to ask this question, the minister related Hemacandra's pure history from his birth in the following words. \"In the country named Ardha\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ma, in the city of Dhundukka, there were, of the \u010cr\u012bmo\u1e0dha race, a merchant named C\u0101c\u012bga, and his partner in religion, a very paragon of virtuous women, like the goddess that executes the orders of the Jina, like the goddess of Fortune incarnate, P\u0101hipi by name, and their son was called C\u0101\u1e45gadeva, having his name distinguished by the first letters of C\u0101mund\u0101 and the Yak\u1e63a Gona\u00e7a. Now, when he was of the age of eight years, the teacher Devacandra set out from Pattana on a pilgrimage to holy places, and came to the \u010cr\u012bmo\u1e0dha temple, in the city of Dhundukka, to worship the god. On this occasion C\u0101\u1e45gadeva, while playing with some boys of like age, suddenly sat down on the cushion of Devacandra, that was placed on the throne. When Devacandra saw the world-surpassing marks on the greater and lesser limbs of the boy, he came to the conclusion that, if he were born in the K\u1e63atriya race, he would be a universal emperor, if he were born in a family of merchants or Brahmins, he would be a great minister, but if he adopted the true faith, he would, like the chief saint of a Yuga, bring back the K\u1e5bta age even in the Kali age. Having formed this opinion, that teacher, in his desire to gain possession of the boy, went with the merchants of that city to the house of C\u0101c\u012bga. When they reached it, they found that C\u0101c\u012bga had gone to another village, but they were hospitably received by his wife, who was a discerning woman, with expressions of welcome, and other marks of respect, and they said to her, 'The worshipful congregation has come here to ask for your son.' She shed tears of joy, and considered herself a fortunate mother, rejoicing because the worshipful congregation, an object of respect even to T\u012brtha\u1e45karas, asked for the gift of her son. But though she felt joy on this account, she was not free from despondency,\n\n1 I read here with the help of P, a and \u03b2, samastava\u1e47\u1e0davata\u1e41se va\u1e47\u1e0de, de\u1e63e ca samastapu\u1e47yaprave\u1e63e, ni\u1e25ce\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0davakare na\u1e45are ca. For prave\u1e63e a reads pr\u0101ve\u1e63e and \u03b2 pravesini. Va\u1e47\u1e0de is clearly wanted.\n\n2 So called, as containing twelve villages or towns. (B\u00fchler's H.C. p. 66.)\n\n3 Now Dhanduka. (B\u00fchler's H.C. ibid.) P. has Dhandukka.\n\n4 So B\u00fchler with a and \u03b2. The text gives C\u0101v\u012bga. I have represented \u010cr\u012bman-mo\u1e0dha by \u010cr\u012bmo\u1e0dha, as it appears from B\u00fchler's H.C. p. 7 and note, that these merchants are now called \u010cr\u012bmo\u1e0dha V\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u015b from Moher\u0101 their original settlement.\n\n5 MS. a reads C\u0101mund\u0101-n\u0101ma-gotraj\u0101y\u0101; \u03b2 has gotraj\u0101y\u0101m. The sense would be \"the first letter of the name of C\u0101mund\u0101, the family goddess.\"\n\n6 The word vasahik\u0101 denotes a temple with a monastery, &c., attached to it.\n\n7 Yugapradh\u0101na. Professor Leumann says \"a person whose fame extends over a whole age (as over the Kali age or the Dv\u0101para age, &c.). The word is applied to the leaders or heroes of Jaina tradition.\"\n\n8 I read with a and \u03b2, pr\u012b\u1e63ayha\u015bvatpura\u1e41 y\u0101citum iha\u1e45ata. This is the reading of P also, but the gh is imperfectly formed.\nfor she had to tell her visitors that his father was exceedingly heretical, and such as he was, he was not at the time in the village. Then those merchants said, 'Give your son yourself.' When they said this, that mother, in order to atone for her sins, piously gave to that teacher her son, who was possessed of infinite merits. Immediately she learnt that the teacher's name was Devacandra\u015b\u016bri. He asked the boy if he would become a disciple, and he answered 'Yea'; so, when the teacher returned, he went with him to Karn\u0101vati. He began to be brought up by tutors, in the house of the minister Udayana, with his sons. In the meanwhile C\u0101ciga returned from another village, and hearing what had taken place, he took a vow not to take any food until he saw his son, and having found out the name of that religious teacher, he arrived in Karn\u0101vati. When the father reached the teacher's house, being angry, he saluted the teacher with scant respect. The teacher, perceiving that C\u0101ciga was in quest of his son, skilfully endeavoured to win him over by all kinds of persuasions, and brought there the minister Udayana, who, regarding him as a brother in the faith, took him to his own house, and feasted him there with as much attention as if he had been his elder brother. After that, he put his son C\u0101ngadeva in his lap, with a gift of five things, and offering him three garments of fine cloth, and three lakhs, which he placed before him, he endeavoured to win him over by his affectionate attentions. C\u0101ciga said to him, 'The price of a K\u1e63atriya is one thousand and eighty; the price of a horse is seventeen hundred and fifty; the price of even a worthless merchant is ninety-nine elephants; that is equal to ninety-nine lakhs; but you, by offering me three lakhs, are really betraying niggardliness under the veil of generosity. The fact is that my son is invaluable, and your kindness is most invaluable. Let that kindness be the price to buy my son. But your heap of money is not to be touched by me, like the remnant of an offering to \u010civa.'\n\n1 This means probably that he felt, with the majority of his countrymen, that his happiness in a future state depended upon the regular presentation of the funeral oblation by his son. (See B\u00fchlcr's H.C. p. 9.)

Strictly speaking, a Jaina monk must join the order of his own accord. But Hofrat B\u00fchlcr points out that, in practice, the order of Jaina Yatis is not recruited by voluntary enlistment, but the rich members of the Jaina community buy boys from their parents. These boys are often the illegitimate sons of Hindu widows.\n\n5 So in the Pari\u00e7itaparvan (ed. Jacobi), p. 280, l. 16, prince Kun\u0101la, at the age of eight years, is taken care of at Ujjayini by b\u0101l\u0101dh\u0101raka\u015b\u0101h, the very word used here. B\u00fchlcr (H.C. p. 10) shows that the place where these occurrences took place was probably Cambay, not Karn\u0101vati.\n\n6 This looks as if C\u0101ciga, like his king, wavered between \u010caivism and Jainism. Therein, perhaps, consisted his heresy, in the eyes of his wife. The Sanskrit word is nirm\u0101lyam, which is specially applied to flowers offered to a god.\naffairs with regard to his son in these words, the mind of that famous minister Udayana was filled with joy, and he embraced him with eager cordiality, and exclaiming, 'Bravo! bravo!' spoke as follows, 'If he is made over to me as an adopted son, he will have, like a magician's monkey,\\(^1\\) to make bows to all men, and will be merely an object of contempt, but if he is made over to this religious teacher, he will himself attain the position of a religious teacher, and will, like the new moon, become an object of adoration to the three worlds. Therefore judge the matter aright and speak.' When the minister said this to him, he answered, 'Your judgment is final,' and so he was conducted to the religious teacher and caused his son to be given to him. After that, C\u00e1\u00e7iga celebrated the festival of his son's renouncing the world. Then, like Agastya, by means of the attractive character of his unequalled intelligence, that son sucked up the whole ocean\\(^2\\) of language as a child sucks its fist, and having thoroughly learnt every point of knowledge, he became famous by the name of Hemacandra, which was given to him by his teacher. Inasmuch as his mind was grounded in all the received religious treatises\\(^3\\) and Upani\u015bads, and his body was adorned with the thirty-six good points of a Jaina doctor,\\(^4\\) his religious teacher formally conferred on him that dignity.\\(^5\\) When the king heard this account of the birth of the teacher Hem\u0101c\u0101rya, he rejoiced still more than before. Then, in the commencement of the building of the temple of Soman\u0101tha, the putting down of rough stones\\(^6\\) having taken place, the king showed to the teacher Hemacandra the letter of the pa\u00f1cakula announcing the auspicious news, and said, \"How is the commencement of this temple to attain its due proportions without impediment?\" When thus questioned by the foremost man of the country, the worshipful teacher thought of some appropriate course, and replied, \"In order to remove all impediments to this pious work, let the king either observe strict chastity or abstinence from wine and flesh, one of the two, until the flag is set up on the temple.\" When the king heard this speech, he chose the self-denial of abstinence from wine and flesh, and throwing water on the image of \u00c7iva, he took that vow. When, after the lapse of two years, that temple was completed as far as the setting up of the finial and flag, the king wished to put an end to his vow, and requested the permission of the teacher; but he replied, \"If you desire to visit this temple, which is a memorial of your glory, and the god, who wears a half-moon for his crest,\\(^7\\) at the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Yogimarka\u1e6da.\n\n\\(^2\\) Agastya drank up the ocean.\n\n\\(^3\\) Siddh\u0101nta.\n\n\\(^4\\) \u015a\u016bri.\n\n\\(^5\\) I read khara\\(^8\\) with P, a and B, because I do not understand the \u00e7ikhara\\(^9\\) of the printed text.\n\n\\(^6\\) i.e. \u00c7iva.\n\n\\(^7\\) i.e. \u00c7iva.\n\n\\(^8\\) i.e. \u00c7iva.\n\n\\(^9\\) i.e. \u00c7iva.\nsame time, the proper time to put an end to the vow is at the end of the pilgrimage to that shrine.\" When the great hermit Hemacandra had said this, he rose up, and as the king's heart was filled with changeless affection called forth by his thirty-six good points, he praised him only in the meeting. His courtiers, who were without cause hostile to Hemacandra, could not endure the accumulation of his glory:\n\nThe mean man cannot anyhow endure to behold the exaltation of the man of radiant merit,\nThe moth even burns its own body to extinguish the bright flame of the candle.\n\nOn this principle, they did not even scruple to commit the crime of backbiting, and they uttered calumnies against him, to the effect that he was addicted to excessive complaisance, and said only what the king approved, being skilled in the arts of a courtier. \"If this is the case,\" said they, \"when he comes to-morrow, entreat him earnestly to join in the pilgrimage to the temple of Soman\u0101tha.\" The king did so, and the Jaina doctor said, \"What need is there to show much zeal about inviting one who is hungry? Why make one who is longing, listen to the cry of the peacock?\" So runs the popular proverb, and in accordance with it, I ask, why does your Majesty exert yourself to press hermits, whose very profession is the visiting of sacred places?\" When the teacher accepted in these words, the king continued, \"Will you take a litter suitable to you and so on, and, other conveyances and requisites?\" Hemacandra answered, \"We will go on foot and so acquire merit, but we will take leave of you immediately, and, proceeding by short stages, will pay our adorations to \u010catru\u00f1jaya, Ujjayanta, and other famous holy places, and will meet you when you enter Pattana.\" He said this and acted accordingly. The king, travelling with all his equipage, reached Pattana in a few marches, and was very much delighted at meeting the great hermit Hemacandra, and being accompanied by the Gand\u0101 Brhaspati, who advanced to receive him, he entered the city with great rejoicing. He mounted the steps of Soman\u0101tha's temple, and after showing his respect by grovelling on the earth, he ardently embraced the liyga of \u010civa, in accordance with his long-protracted unparalleled impatience to behold it; then, having his mind bewildered by the saying of the votaries of false religions, \"These\n\n1 A gloss in a gives khadyota, fire-fly.

According to the Bombay editor the word Gand\u0101 means ascetic.\nJainas worship no other god but the Jina,\u201d he spoke to Hemacandra as follows, \u201cIf it is seemly for you, then worship Some\u00e7vara with these pleasing offerings.\u201d Hemacandra consented to do so, and after adorning his body with a pair of charming bleached garments that were brought from the king\u2019s treasury, he ascended the threshold of the temple, while Bhrhaspati, by the king\u2019s orders, gave him his hand to lean on, and, after reflecting a little, he said aloud, \u201cSince Mah\u00e2deva, the dweller in Kail\u00e2sa, is really and actually present in this temple, wearing a body covered with erect hairs, as if with armour, double your offering.\u201d When he had said this, he worshipped \u00c7iva with the five ceremonies of worship, according to the ritual of initiation prescribed in the \u00c7iva Pur\u00e2na, namely, the rites of inviting\u00b9 the god, veiling the head, bodily contortions, inscribing mantras, throwing them away, and so on; and at the end he recited the following stanzas:\n\nAt whatever time, under whatever conditions,\nWhoever thou art, by whatever name known,\nIf thou art that one free from the stain of sin,\nThat only one,\u2014honour to thee, O adorable being!\nWhether he be Brahm\u00e2 or Vi\u00f1u or \u00c7iva, honour to that being,\nIn whom passion, and the other feelings that produce the germination of the seed of birth, are extinguished!\n\nWith these and other hymns of praise Hemacandra praised the god, making at the same time a profound obeisance, while the king, accompanied by all the courtiers, looked on with astonishment, and when he had ceased, the king himself, having been instructed in the ceremonial of worship by Bhrhaspati, worshipped \u00c7iva with the utmost faith, and afterwards offered on the stone of piety his own weight in gold, and elephants and other great gifts, and performed the ceremony of waving lights in front of the idol with camphor incense. Then he dismissed all his courtiers, and entered the inner sanctuary of the temple, and said to Hemacandra, \u201cThere is no god like \u00c7iva, there is no king equal to me, there is no great hermit that can be compared with you, and since, owing to the power of supremely auspicious fortune, the conjunction of these three has been brought about here, and since it is doubtful who is the real god, inasmuch as various gods are established by the arguments of various sects, do you now in this holy place declare to me with true speech who is the god that can give salvation.\u201d\n\nWhen the king addressed the teacher Hemacandra in these words, he reflected a little in his mind, and said to the king, \u201cLet us trouble ourselves\n\n\u00b9 In the \u00c7iva Pur\u00e2na the word \u0101v\u00e2hana is used.\n\u00b2 I read with P, muktiprad\u00e2m.\nno further about the sayings of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and the systems! I will exhibit to you Some\u00e7vara, present in bodily form, in order that from his mouth you may learn the way of salvation.\" When he said this, the king's mind was filled with astonishment, and he said to himself, \"What can he be planning that he says this?\" Hemacandra continued, \"Undoubtedly the god is hidden here, and we are here motionless worshippers in accordance with the instructions of the priest; so, if we both do our parts thoroughly, it will be easy to make the god appear: I will meditate, and you must throw on incense of black aloe wood, and must not desist until the three-eyed god himself appears, and puts a stop to it.\" Then both of them did as arranged, and the inner sanctuary of the temple was darkened with the thick smoke of incense, and the candles representing the circle of the asterisms were extinguished; when suddenly a light was diffused resembling the brightness of the sun, and as the king in his bewilderment rubbed his eyes and gazed, he beheld over the water-receptacle of the Linga, an ascetic gleaming like pure gold, of incomparable shape and unfathomable nature, hard to behold by mortal eyes. The king felt the shape with the palm of his hand from his toe to his matted hair, and having ascertained that it was a manifestation of the god, in his devotion he prostrated himself so as to touch the surface of the earth with five limbs, and humbly said, \"O lord of the world, my eyes have been satisfied by beholding thee; satisfy with the favour of thy commands my two ears.\" When he had made this petition, he remained silent, and then from the mouth of the god, which was a sun to illumine the darkness of delusion, a divine speech was revealed, \"King, this great hermit is an incarnation of all the gods; he knows the nature of all the three times, because he holds them in his hand like pearls, owing to his direct intuition of the supreme Brahma. The way of salvation taught by him admits of no doubt.\" When \u00c7iva had said this, he disappeared; and the king was in a state of great excitement; the teacher Hemacandra exhaled the breath that he had been keeping in, and relaxed the forced posture in which he had been sitting, and exclaimed, \"King!\" and was intending to say, \"Live long! advance thy foot!\" when the monarch, abandoning his kingly pride owing to his interview with his favourite deity, and modestly inclining his crest, said, \"Tell me what I am to do.\" Thereupon Hemacandra administered to him on the spot a vow to abstain from flesh and wine till the close of his\n\n---\n\n1 I think that dvandva refers to the two performances, not to the two performers.\n2 I omit devam, which is not found in P, a and B.

The king was entirely converted by the words\nof the pure religious treatises, of sanctifying virtue, because they pro-\nceeded from the mouth of the Jina, and obtained the title of \"Chief of\nJainas.\" At his request the lord composed the \"History of the sixty-three\ngreat men,\" and the purifying \"Yoga\u015b\u0101stra,\" together with the \"Praises\nof the twenty Vitar\u0101gas.\" Moreover, at the lord's suggestion, the king\nforbade the slaughter of living creatures for fourteen years in all the\neighteen countries subject to him: and he caused to be built in various\nplaces 1440 temples. He accepted the twelve vows, the foundation of all\ntrue piety, and when the third vow, involving the abstinence from the\nreceiving of things not given, was being explained, the king, having been\ninformed that the crimes of taking the property of weeping widows were a\nspecial cause of guilt, summoned the officer who presided over that\ndepartment, and tore up his estimate of income from that source amount-\ning to seventy-two lakhs, and remitted the claims. When they were\nremitted, the king was praised by the learned in the following stanza:\n\nWhat previous lords of earth, Raghu, Nahu\u1e63a, N\u0101bh\u0101ga, Bharata and others\ndid not relinquish,\nThough they were born in the Krta age,\nThat very wealth of weeping widows thou relinquishing now out of pity,\nArt, O king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, the very crest-jewel of great ones.\n\nThe lord Hemacandra also congratulated the king in the following\ncouplet,\u2014\n1 The Bombay editor has a note: ekah k\u1e63am\u0101y\u0101\u1e25 prthivy\u0101 anyah k\u1e63\u0101ntek patibh.\nThis evidently refers to the reading k\u1e63am\u0101pati.\n2 Tr\u012bc\u0101\u1e63\u1e6di\u00e7\u0101l\u0101k\u0101purusacaritai\u1e25. Professor Jacobi, in the preface to his edition of\nthe Pari\u00e7\u0101taparvan, an appendix to this work, remarks, \"The sixty-three \u00e7\u0101l\u0101k\u0101-\npurusas are the great personages divine or human, who, according to the belief of\nthe Jainas, have, since the present order of things, risen in the history of the\nworld, and directed or influenced its course; they comprise the twenty-four\nT\u012brthakaras or prophets, the twelve Cakravartins or universal monarchs, the nine\nV\u0101sudevas, the nine Balad\u0113vas, and the nine Prat\u012bv\u0101sudevas. With the exception\nof the last two T\u012brthakaras, P\u0101r\u1e47avan\u0101tha and Mah\u0101v\u012bra, all these great men\nmust be regarded as belonging not to history but to mythology or epical\nfiction.\"\n3 For an account of the books referred to, see B\u00fchler's H.C. pp. 83-85.\n4 Or according to B, 1444.\n5 The five \"lesser\" and the seven \"disciplinary\" vows. The latter comprise\ntwo classes, viz. the three \"meritorious\" vows, and the four proper \"disciplinary\"\nvows.

B\u00fchler (H.C. p. 39) shows from the \u00c7akuntal\u0101 that this custom was\nprevalent in M\u0101lw\u0101. (See also Forbes's R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, p. 150.) B\u00fchler also tells us that\nit was contrary to the Sm\u1e5bti.\nA king, by taking the wealth of those that have no sons, constitutes himself a son,\nBut thou, contentedly relinquishing it, art become in truth the grandfather of kings.\n\nThen the king appointed the noble minister Udayana leader of an army to make war on a chief of Sur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, named Sumvara,\u00b9 and sent him off with all necessary forces. But he, when he reached the city of Vardham\u0101na, being desirous of prostrating himself before the feet of R\u1e63abha, asked \u00b2 all the heads of provinces to march on in front of him, and went himself to the Vimala\u00b3 mountain, and with pure faith worshipped with all appropriate observances the feet of the god. When he went on to adore, in accordance with prescribed ritual, the caityas, a mouse seized a taper, which was one of the series of lights called asterisms, when it was all blazing, and ran into a hole in the wooden temple.\u2074 The god\u2019s bodyguard made the mouse drop the taper, but after that, the minister, as his meditations had been disturbed by the incident, and he was afraid that the god\u2019s wooden temple would be destroyed, conceived a desire to restore the dilapidated temple; and therefore took before the feet of the god the vow to eat only one meal every day and other vows of the kind. After that, he marched on, and reached the encampment of his army, and an engagement took place with that hostile chief. As the king\u2019s force was defeated by his enemies, the great Udayana himself rose up to fight. Then his body was mangled by the blows of the enemy, and he was carried \u2074 to his quarters weeping bitterly. When his followers asked the cause of his lamentation, the minister told them, as his death was near, that in his desire to restore the ruined \u010catru\u1e47\u1e0djaya temple and \u010cakunik\u0101 temple, he had laid on his back a debt to the deity. Then they said, \u201cYour sons, named V\u0101gbhata and \u0100mrabhata, will take a vow and restore these two holy places, and to this effect we will be their sureties.\u201d When they gave this guarantee, the minister thought himself fortunate, and the hairs on his body stood erect from joy, and he sought for a certain man of pious conversation to aid him in making his final act of faith.\u2075\n\nAs he could not be found, they brought a certain servant disguised as the man wanted, and when he was announced, the minister rubbed his feet against his own forehead, and made his final act of faith under ten heads,\n\n\u00b9 Or Sa\u1e41sara.\n\u00b2 All three MSS. give abhyarthy\u0101. I follow them.\n\u00b3 The pure mountain. It appears to mean the \u010catru\u1e47\u1e0djaya mountain.\n\u2074 I read vit\u0101\u1e25 with a and B.\n\u2075 Anty\u0101r\u0101dhana. The word \u0101r\u0101dhana is translated on page 20 of my Kath\u0101 Ko\u015ba, \u201creconciliation with all.\u201d This is probably incorrect. The \u0101r\u0101dhana there found seems to contain ten parts. The reference is, as Professor Leumann points out, to the ten Jaina commandments.\nand so the blessed Udayana passed to the next world. But the servant, perfumed with the sweet savour of the minister's pious aspirations, as a mean tree by the proximity of a sandal-wood tree, took a vow of starvation, and brought his life to an end on mount Raivataka. Then those followers of his reached the city of Anahilla, and informed V\u0101gbha\u1e6da and \u0100mrabha\u1e6da of what had occurred, and they took the very same vows, and began the restoration of the dilapidated temples. In two years the temple on the holy \u00c7atru\u00f1jaya was finished, and a man who had arrived from that place, came to the brothers and announced the good news, and even while he was announcing it, another man arrived, and said, \"The temple is cracked.\" Then, on hearing that speech, which was like boiling lead, V\u0101gbha\u1e6da took leave of king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, making over his seal of office to the great minister Kapardin, and with four thousand horse reached the plain at the foot of the \u00c7atru\u00f1jaya mountain, and founded there a city called V\u0101gbha\u1e6dapura after his own name. The artificers investigated the cause of the crack, and said, \"The wind, when it enters into a temple with a cloister,\\(^1\\) does not go out.\" So that minister reflected on this answer, and on the fact that a temple without a cloister involves childlessness,\\(^2\\) and said to himself, \"Though I may have no posterity, let me have a posterity of good works, and let my name be in the roll of previous restorers, Bharata and others!\" Having thus reflected in his far-seeing mind, the minister filled up with stones the space between the two walls of the cloister, and the temple having been finished\\(^3\\) in three years, he invited the congregation of Pattana to the place to witness the setting up of the finial and its rod\\(^4\\) on it, and caused the flag to be erected with great rejoicing in V.S. 1211. He set up a stone image\\(^5\\) with the help of the workmen belonging to the Mamm\u0101niya quarry, whom he summoned for the purpose. The king\\(^6\\) erected an image of P\u0101r\u00e7yan\u0101tha in the name of his father in the Tribh\u016b.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I have taken bhrama to mean a cloister, as Dr. Burgess translates bha\u1e47\u1e6di by \"cloister\" (\u00c7atru\u00f1jaya temples, pp. 21, 22). But it may possibly mean \"a conduit.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) C and a have niravayat\u0101\u1e41. This I have translated. Perhaps niravadyat\u0101\u1e41 stands for nirapatyat\u0101\u1e41. P has niravadyat\u0101\u1e41 with the text. I think that it is a Prakritizing form.\n\n\\(^3\\) P gives nipanne, which I follow.\n\n\\(^4\\) Mr. Cousens writes in a letter, which Dr. Burgess has kindly shown me, \"I understand that the term kalacada\u1e45gprat\u012bsth\u0101 refers solely to the setting up of the kalaca or pot-finial, the danda being the pole or stick which supports the finial and upon which it is set up. With a small kalaca made solid, it would not be required, the neck of the same taking its place, but it is always required with the larger and more complex kalacas, especially those made of hollow metal.\" The setting up of the flagstaff is often a separate function, according to Mr. Cousens, and this harmonizes with the descriptions given by our author.\n\n\\(^5\\) I read \"bimb\u0101\u1e41.\"\n\n\\(^6\\) P gives n\u1e5bpatipit\u016br\", which would mean that V\u0101gbha\u1e6da erected the image in the name of the king's father. It is perhaps meant that V\u0101gbha\u1e6da did all these pious works.\nvanap\u0101la temple in V\u0101gbhatapura. Moreover, before he caused all this to be done, he gave twenty-four gardens in the city round the rampart, and grants of land, dwelling-houses, and so on, to the god's attendants, in order to keep up the worship of the holy place. As for the expenditure on that restoration of the holy place, the following couplet will show it:\n\nHow can V\u0101gbhatadeva be described by the wise in that temple,\nOn which a crore and sixty lakhs were spent?\n\nHere ends the story of the restoration of the temples on the holy mount \u010catru\u00f1jaya.\n\nThen \u0100mrabha\u1e6da, the bravest warrior in the world, began the erection of the temple called \u010cakunik\u0101vih\u0101ra in Bhrugupura\u00b9 for the good of his father's soul; but owing to the neighbourhood of the Narmad\u0101, when the trench for testing the site was being dug, the ground suddenly closed and the workmen were injured;\u00b2 then, as he was overpowered by compassion, he blamed himself severely, and leapt into the opening with his wife and children.\u00b3 By that extraordinary courage of his that obstacle was removed, and the stones were laid and the whole temple was finished. On the occasion of the setting up of the finial and its rod, he brought there by invitation the congregations of the town,\u2074 and honoured them becomingly with complimentary offerings of food, clothes, and ornaments, and dismissed the neighbours\u2075 to their homes. Then, as a favourable moment was approaching, he induced the congregation of the glorious Anahillapura to come there, preceded by the venerable doctor Hemacandra, and accompanied by the king, and he gratified them with sincere proofs of his affection and goodwill, and with ornaments and other gifts, and proceeding to set up the flag, he himself caused his own house to be plundered by petitioners, and he set up a flag with a great banner on the temple of the holy Suvrata,\u2076 and in his excessive joy he celebrated a dance there with great zeal. At the end of it, by the king's request he took a candlestick to wave before the image,\u2077 and gave a horse to the reverend man who kept the\n\n\u00b9 i.q.

Every one now presses forward, and crowds into the temple, to salute the newly-\ndoor; and the king himself performed the ceremony of placing a tilaka on the image; and being assisted by seventy-two military chiefs, who waved chowries, and scattered flowers and performed other services, he gave a bracelet to the bard who then arrived, whereupon the king, seizing him in his arms, compelled him by force to put down the auspicious lamp, which he was waving in front of the image.\n\nThen \u0100mrabha\u1e6da worshipped the feet of the holy teacher Suvrata, and honoured his co-religionists, and asked the king why he hurried on so the rite of waving the light. Then the king said, \"As a gambler, in the over-mastering excitement of gambling, stakes his head and other things, so you, if further implored by petitioners, through an over-mastering passion of generosity, would give away to them even your head.\" But the teacher Hemacandra said to him, \"My heart has been so transported by your world-transcending pious conduct, that I have forgotten the vow of never praising men, which I have followed from my birth,\u2014What would be the use of the K\u1e5bta age, if you were not present? Can that be the Kali age in which you are? If you are born in the Kali age, let it be the Kali age! What need we the K\u1e5bta?\"\n\nHaving in these words expressed their admiration of \u0100mrabha\u1e6da's conduct, the teacher and the king returned home.\n\nWhen the lord Hemacandra reached home, a farewell letter came from \u0100mrabha\u1e6da, who had been reduced to a state of extreme exhaustion by a sudden illness produced by a goddess. Hemacandra understood that, at the very moment when the great-hearted man was dancing on the spire of his temple, he was smitten with disease by the heretical goddesses. Having come to this conclusion, the next morning the lord flew up through the air with the ascetic Ya\u00e7a\u00e7andra, and in the twinkling of an eye adorned with his presence the grounds in the neighbourhood of Bh\u1e5bgupura, and in order to propitiate Sa\u00efndhavi he adopted the statuesque posture, but as she made him an object of contempt by putting out her tongue at him, he threw grains of rice into a mortar, and the Ga\u1e47in Ya\u00e7a\u00e7andra pounded them with a pestle; then, at the first blow of the pestle, the temple shook; at the second blow the image of the goddess installed image, and presents are exchanged between the donor of the temple and his relatives and those who took part in the ceremonies.\"\n\nThe above is from the pen of Mr. A. Cousens, and my attention was directed to it by Dr. Burgess.\n\n1 I read with a, satvar\u0101d\u0101rika\".\n2 Here the B\u00fchler MSS. give k\u1e63am\u0101pati. P agrees with them.\n3 For \"heretical gods\" see B\u00fchler, \"A legend of the Jaina St\u016bpa at Mathur\u0101,\" p. 9, lines 2-3. Perhaps the plural is used here to indicate respect.\n4 I read with a, khecaragatyo\u1e6dp\u0101ya. The reading of \u03b2, \u1e43aty\u0101ya supports this.\ncame from its pedestal, and fell at the feet of the lord Hemacandra, exclaiming, \"Deliver me, deliver me from the blows of the thunderbolt-bearer.\" Thus, having restrained by force of blameless science the deleterious influence of the heretical demons, who were at the bottom of the whole illness, they went to the temple of Suvrata.\n\nMay the rays of the nails on the feet of the lord Suvrata protect us,\nThe bridges over the ocean of existence, the candles shooting up to guide travellers on the path of happiness,\nThe props that support the universe, the meteors rising to bewilder the views of opponents,\nMoreover, the things which alone perform the functions of a firm binding-post for the elephant of our mind!\n\nHaving worshipped with these praises the hermit Suvrata, and having refreshed \u0100mrabha\u1e6da with the bath of convalescence, they returned home.\n\nThe king placed the three finials of the king, the sovereign of Kojkana, in three places, on the Caitya of the blessed Udayana, on the \u00c7akunik\u0101 temple, and on the clock-house.\n\nHere ends the story of \u0100mrabha\u1e6da, the grandfather of the king.\n\nThen, on another occasion, the king, named Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, desiring to acquire learning, had the treatise of K\u0101mandaki on policy read to him for a time after dinner by a certain learned man, with the approbation of the minister Kapardin. They came to the couplet:\n\nThe king is the mainstay of creatures like the rain-cloud,\nFor even, if the rain-cloud be somewhat wanting, it is possible to live, but not if the king be wanting in any respect.\n\nWhen the king heard this maxim, he said, \"The king is compared to a cloud,\" using the word aupamy\u0101. When Kum\u0101rap\u0101la said this, all the courtiers made signs of approbation; but the king observed that the minister Kapardin cast his face down to the ground; so afterwards he asked him the reason in private, and the minister said as follows: \"Since\n\n1 I find in a, vyantar\u012b\u1e0dhi, female demons. 2 I read ki\u015bc\u0101\u00b0 with \u03b2.\n3 I presume that this is the ghul-i-shy\u0101 of the B\u0101gh-o-Bah\u0101r.\n4 There is no nominative in the text. The reading r\u0101jna\u015b is supported by the MSS.\n5 Passages like this show that our author's work is a collection mainly of disjointed anecdotes.\n6 No. 3990 in B\u00f6htlingk's Indische Spr\u00fcche. He finds it in the Hitopade\u00e7a and the \u00c7\u0101rgadharapaddhati. He translates Parjanya by \"Regengott.\" But, when used by a Jaina, it means \"cloud,\" as the Jainas are not allowed to say \"The god rains.\"\n7 Ny\u016bcan\u0101ni.\nyour Majesty used yourself the word *upamy\u0101*, and the use of this word is contrary to all the grammars, and since, nevertheless, the obsequious courtiers made signs of approbation, it was for two reasons appropriate that I should cast my face down to the ground. Moreover, in accordance with a maxim that a world without a king is better than an ignorant king, an evil report will circulate in the countries of hostile sovereigns. Now in this sense the words *upameya\u1e41*, *upamya\u1e41* and *upam\u0101*, and so on, are correct.\" After that speech, the king, in order to comprehend the etymology of words, began the study of treatises, commencing with the alphabet, under a certain teacher, and in one year read three poems with their commentaries, and so gained the title of Vic\u0101racaturmukha.\n\nHere ends the story of the studies of Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, who was called Vic\u0101racaturmukha.\n\nOn a certain occasion a poet, named Vicve\u00e7vara, came from Benares to Pattana, and arrived in the meeting of the literary coterie of the doctor Hemacandra. When the king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la was present, he uttered in this meeting,\u2014\nMay the cowherd Hemacandra protect you, bearing aloft his rug and stick\u2014\n\nHaving said so much, he paused for a while, and the king looked at him angrily. Then he continued,\u2014\nDriving out to graze in the Jaina pasture the cattle of the six systems!\n\nHaving satisfied by this second verse of the couplet those present in the meeting, he gave R\u0101macandra and the others a stanza to complete. The whole stanza ran as follows:\u2014\nBeing in the midst of her female friends, surrounding her in the game of closing eyes,\nShe was rejected by them on this ground, \"Her two clear eyes cannot be closed with two hands,\nAnd she will be detected everywhere by the rays of light shooting forth from the moon of her face;\"\nThus the maiden was rejected, weeping for her eyes and face, and blaming herself.\n\nWhen the stanza was completed by the great minister Kapardin by supplying the line, \"Thus the maiden was rejected, &c.,\" the poet\n\n1 P reads *survavy\u0101karane\u1e63u apaprayoge paticchando*, but \u03b1 and \u03b2 give *aprayoge ebhir*. Hofrath B\u00fchler thinks that, if we read *sati* for *pati*, or simply insert *sati*, P gives a good sense.\n2 Here \u03b1 and \u03b2 give *ny\u016bcane*.\n3 i.e. Brahma of discrimination. This story is also found in the Kum\u0101rap\u0101la-carita. (B\u00fchler, H.C. p. 82.)\nthereupon threw his necklace, worth fifty thousand, on the neck of Kapardin, saying, \"It is a line composed by Sarasvat\u012b herself.\" Then the king, astonished at his cleverness, wished to retain him about his person, but he said,\u2014\nKarna has come to exist only in story; the city of Benares is scant of people;\nThe bay steeds of Hammira neigh joyously in the quarter of Hari;\u00b9\nThis heart of mine is longing for the field of Prabh\u0101sa,\u00b2\nThat hugs the salt water, which itself longs to embrace Sarasvat\u012b.\n\nWhen he had said this, being taken leave of by the king, and having been rewarded by him, he went to his destination.\n\nOne morning, early,\u00b3 the minister Kapardin, after he had made his salutation, was asked, \"What is this in your hand?\" and he answered in the Prakrit language, \"Hara\u1e0dai\"\u2074 (a myrobalan). The lord Hemacandra said, \"What! even nowadays?\" Kapardin, with his well-known quickness, seeing the artful meaning of his question, said to him, \"Not nowadays. How could it be so? The last letter has become first, and is lengthened by a m\u0101tr\u0101.\" Hemacandra, with his eyes overflowing with tears of joy, praised Kapardin's cleverness in the presence of R\u0101macandra and the other pandits. They, not understanding the real meaning of it all, said, \"Why is it so clever?\" Hemacandra said, \"In Hara\u1e0dai lurked the statement 'Hak\u0101ro radai' (the letter Ha laments).\u2075 As soon as I said, 'What nowadays?' he, seeing the point of the question, answered, 'Not nowadays,' because formerly the letter was read at the end of the alphabet, and so one might say, 'Ha laments?' but now it is placed under the same name at the beginning, and is lengthened by a m\u0101tr\u0101.\"\n\nHere ends the story of Hara\u1e0dai.\n\nOne day a certain pandit asked if the word Urva\u1e63i should be spelt with a palatal or a dental sibilant. Kapardin, while the lord Hemacandra was giving some decision, wrote on a piece of paper, \"Urva\u1e63i is derived from Ur\u016bn acnute\u2076 (she enters the wide ones),\" and threw it into the lap of\n\n\u00b9 Probably Hari here means \u010civa, and his quarter will be the north-east. Hammira was king of \u010cakambhari.\n\u00b2 According to a gloss in a, Devapattana. Dr. Burgess (K\u0101thiaw\u0101d and Kach, p. 14) tells us that Prabh\u0101sa Pattan or Soman\u0101tha is a famous shrine of the \u010caiva form of Brahmanism.\n\u00b3 I omit the paragraph immediately preceding this.\n\u2074 I find in a and P, harada\u012b vij\u00f1\u0101pay\u0101m\u0101\u015ba.\n\u2075 I find that Professor Pischel, on Hemacandra IV. 445, explains radaintau as \"weinend.\" For harada we should read with P, harada\u012b. On line 1 of page 229 after hak\u0101ro radai, P inserts asm\u0101bh\u012br abhida\u1e6dhe.\n\u2076 I read with B, anena ned\u0101nim. P has anena na id\u0101nim. There is clearly a misprint in the Bombay text.\n\u2077 But P gives ur\u016b cete.\nHemacandra. On the strength of that evidence Hemacandra delivered to the pandit an opinion that the word should be spelt with the palatal sibilant. Here ends the story of the word Urva\u00e7i.\n\nThen, on another occasion, a certain diplomatic agent of the king of the Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a country came into the court of king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, and was asked by him, \"Is your master prosperous?\" He, being groundlessly arrogant, and fancying himself to be learned, said, \"He is called Vi\u00e7vala, because he takes the whole world (vi\u00e7vam l\u0101ti); so what doubt is there that he will be victorious?\" Then the honourable minister Kapardin, being put up to it by the king, said, \"The root \u00e7vala or \u00e7vala expresses quick going, consequently he is called Vi\u00e7vala because he flies (\u00e7valati) like a bird (v\u0101).\" When the noble reported to the king of the Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a country that his name had been thus turned inside out, he assumed the name of Vigrah\u0101raja. The next year that very noble mentioned the name of Vigrah\u0101raja in the presence of king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, whereupon the minister Kapardin explained it, \"Vigra means 'deprived of a nose,' and he has reduced \u00c7iva and N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a (Har\u0101jau) to this condition.\" When that king heard this, he immediately took the name of Kavib\u0101ndhava (friend of poets), being afraid that Kapardin would pick his name to pieces.\n\nThen, on another occasion, the Yoga\u00e7\u0101stra was being expounded in the presence of king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, and the fifteen objectionable commercial employments were being read out, and when the pandit Udayacandra came to the line,\u2014\n\nDantake\u00e7anakh\u0101sthitvagromn\u0101\u1e41 graha\u1e47am \u0101kare\n\n(The taking in the mass of teeth, hair of the head, nails, bones, skin and hair of the body.)\n\nthe original text as the lord Hemacandra wrote it, he read the words \"romn\u0101\u1e41 graha\u1e47am\" over and over again. The lord Hemacandra asked him if there was anything wrong in the writing; whereupon he said that the grammatical S\u016btra, which directs that the parts of living creatures and of musical instruments should take the singular in Dvandva compounds, showed that the singular was appropriate in the case of parts of living creatures, thus adducing a special rule applicable to this particular case. Then he was praised by Hemacandra, by the king, and others.\n\nHere ends the story of Udayacandra.\n\nThen, once on a time, that royal hermit was eating sweetmeats composed\n\n1 For ityevam P, a and \u03b2 give anantaram.\n2 Yoga\u00e7\u0101stra (ed. Windisch), III. 105.\n3 But P, a and \u03b2 give \"rompo, as in Windisch's edition of the Yoga\u00e7\u0101stra.\n4 No doubt we should read, with a and P, lipibhede.\nof flour, milk, cocoanuts and ghi.\\footnote{Ghrtap\u016bra. The word is used in the Pari\u00e7itaparvan (ed. Jacobi), XII. 158. It is also used by the Commentator on Uv\u0101saga Das\u0101o, I. 34. Dr. Hoernle translates it by \"pastry fried in clarified butter.\" Indian sweetmeats are very substantial.} Having reflected a little, he purified himself\\footnote{I insert pavitribh\u016bya before iti from \u03b1 and \u03b2. But P agrees with the printed text. Of course the visarga is found in these MSS at the end of \"parih\u0101ra.\"} by abstaining from all food, and thereupon asked the lord Hemacandra whether the eating of such sweetmeats was lawful. The lord answered him, \"It is lawful for Brahmans and merchants, but not for a K\u1e63atriya who has taken a vow to abstain from all impure food, because it recalls to his mind the taste of meat.\" The king said, \"Very good,\" and asked Hemacandra to prescribe a penance for the impure food that he had previously eaten. Hemacandra said, \"Have thirty-two temples built, according to the number of your thirty-two teeth.\" The king did so.\n\nIn a period of time prescribed by the lord Hemacandra, a merchant named K\u0101nha\\footnote{Or K\u0101nha\u015ba according to \u03b1.} came to Pattana from Vatapadraka to have set up an image of M\u016blan\u0101yaka\\footnote{A title of Adin\u0101tha or Rsabha (Dr. Burgess, \u010catur\u00f1jaya and its Temples, p. 20).} in his own temple, and so he left that image in the principal temple of the city, and went to fetch offerings, and when he came back with the offerings he found the door kept by the king's body-guard, and he could not obtain admittance. After some time had passed, the guards who kept the door, left it, but the time\\footnote{For the k\u0101le of the text, P, \u03b1 and \u03b2 give utsave.} for setting up the image had passed, so he entered the temple and clung to the feet of the lord Hemacandra, and wept, reproaching him. The lord, reflecting that the man's grief could not easily be removed in any other way, went out of the painted vestibule,\\footnote{Rangomandapa. (See B\u00fchler's Arisimha, p. 30.)} and seeing by the course of the asterisms that his auspicious moment had arisen in the heaven, said that these images which were caused to be set up by the astrologer in a moment fixed with reference to a clock,\\footnote{Gh\u0101tika. But \u03b1 and \u03b2 have k\u016b\u1e6dagha\u1e6dika.} would continue but for three years, whereas this image, if set up in the present moment, would last for a long time. The merchant had the image set up immediately, and what the lord had said turned out true. Here ends the story of the penance prescribed for eating unlawful food.\n\nThe king then asked that a penance might be prescribed for the offence, that he committed long ago in taking away the wealth belonging to a certain mouse, and so causing its death. Thereupon the lord Hemacandra caused to be built for the good of the mouse's soul, a temple called by its name.\\footnote{i.e. Mu\u1e63akav\u012bh\u0101ra. (B\u00fchler, H.C. p. 41.)} Moreover, as a certain daughter-in-law of a merchant, whose relations, name, village, and connections he did not know, had, when he\nhad been fasting for three days on his journey, refreshed him with a dish of ground rice mixed with curds, out of gratitude for that kindness, the king founded in Pattana the Karamba temple, in order to increase her merit. Moreover, the Y\u016bk\u0101vih\u0101ra was founded on this wise. A certain undiscerning rich man in the Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a country had a louse made over to him by his wife, when she was brushing his hair. He took it in the palm of his hand, and abused it for causing him annoyance, and after a long time crushed it, and so killed it. The officer, whose business it was to see that no harm was done to living creatures, being near him at the time, took him to Anahillapura and denounced him to the king. Consequently, in accordance with the decision of the lord Hemacandra, he was, by way of fine for that offence, deprived of all his wealth, and the Y\u016bk\u0101vih\u0101ra was built with it in that very place.\n\nHere ends the story of the Y\u016bk\u0101vih\u0101ra.\n\nThen in Stambhat\u012brtha, in the general temple of the S\u0101ligavasahik\u0101, where the ceremony of the lord Hemacandra's consecration as a monk took place, the king restored in a magnificent way a decayed edifice, and adorned it with an image made out of a precious stone.\n\nHere ends the story of the restoration of the lord Hemacandra's Dik\u1e63\u0101vasahik\u0101.\n\nThen, in the temple called Kum\u0101ravih\u0101ra, in Some\u015bvarapattana, the Gand\u0101 B\u1e5bhaspati was guilty of some offence, and owing to the displeasure of the lord Hemacandra was deprived of his appointment. So he came to Anahillapura, and acquired great proficiency in the \u015ao\u1e0dh\u0101va\u1e47yaka, and paid court to Hemacandra. Once on a time he performed the concluding ceremony after a four months' abstinence, and discharged the duty of worshipping the lord's feet, by the reverence of twelve movements, and then uttered this stanza,\n\nFor four months near thy two feet, O lord,\nI have performed this vow of abstaining from prepared food, to atone for my sin,\nNow, as I have rolled away evil by my own budding good conduct,\nLet me, O chief of hermits, subsist on rice moistened with water.\n\n1 Am\u0101rik\u0101ripa\u015bcakula. This proves that pa\u015bcakula does not necessarily mean a revenue officer.\n2 i.q. Cambay.\n3 It was called the Dik\u1e63\u0101vih\u0101ra. See B\u00fchler, H.C. p. 41.\n4 P gives r\u0101tnamayabimb\u0101. Perhaps \"adorned with jewels\" would be a more correct translation.\n5 According to a, \"against the Jaina religion\" (Jainadharme).\n6 In B\u00fchler's \"Jaina St\u016bpa at Mathur\u0101\" the phrases \"retreat\" and \"concluding ceremony\" are used. The abstinence was partial in this case.\nWhile he was making this petition the king came in, and observing that\nthe lord was pleased, he showed Brhaspati the favour of restoring to him\nhis appointment.\n\nHere ends the story of the restoration of his appointment to the Gand\u0101\nBrhaspati.\n\nOne day, when the king was holding a general reception, he put this\nquestion to an old member of council named Alinga,\u00b9 \u201cAm I inferior or\nequal or superior to Siddhar\u0101ja?\u201d Alinga begged that his answer might\nnot be used against him, and then said, \u201cSiddhar\u0101ja had ninety-eight\u00b2\nvirtues and two faults, whereas your Majesty has two virtues and ninety-\neight faults.\u201d When Alinga had said this, the king, being disgusted with\nhis faulty self, cast his eye towards his dagger.\u00b3 But Alinga, discerning\nhis intention, said to him, \u201cSiddhar\u0101ja\u2019s ninety-eight virtues were obscured\nby his cowardice in battle and his dissoluteness, whereas your faults, such\nas stinginess and so on, are neutralized by your two virtues, your valour\nin battle, and your habitual treatment of your neighbours\u2019 wives as sisters.\u201d\nThis second speech of Alinga made the king regain his equanimity.\n\nHere ends the story of Alinga.\n\nThen, long ago, in the reign of Siddhar\u0101ja, a Brahman, named V\u0101mar\u0101\u00e7i,\nwho was a rival of Hemacandra in the matter of learning, not being able\nto endure his establishment in a high position, composed this stanza about\nhim,\u2014\nWith shawl, on which crawls a series of hundreds of lakhs of lice, loosely\nfloating,\nWith mouth full of evil smell from a perpetual accumulation of impurities\non his teeth,\nWith continual snuffling utterance of words, from the obstruction of the\nbridge of his nose,\nHere comes that Hemada ascetic\u2074 with his bald head waggling.\n\nWhen the lord Hemacandra heard this utterance of his, which was a\nbitter lampoon, he was very angry in his heart, and accordingly gave vent\nto this severe remark, \u201cPandit, have you not read this grammatical rule,\n\n\u00b9 Probably the Alinga who was made jy\u0101y\u0101n pradh\u0101na, not the potter who\nreceived a grant.\n\u00b2 I read astanavati with \u03b1 and \u03b2. The text has 96. However, 96 seems to be a\nfavourite number with our author, as Vikram\u0101ditya conquered 96 rival kings, and\nSiddhar\u0101ja praises the 96 royal virtues of the king of Mah\u0101r\u0101stra (pp. 6 and 178 of\nthe printed text).\n\u00b3 I read with \u03b1 and \u03b2, k\u1e63urik\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 cak\u1e63u\u1e25. The text must mean, was about to\ndrive his dagger into his eye.\n\u2074 In the original, Hemada sev\u0101da. The latter word is clearly the modern Hindi\nsev\u0101da, a Jaina ascetic. Both words seem to be formed in accordance with\nHemacandra IV. 429 (ed. Pischel).\n'The qualifying word precedes' so henceforth you must say, 'That ascetic Hem\u0101da.' Then he made his servants beat him with the butt-end of their lances, and dismissed him. He also caused him to be deprived of his salary, on the ground that in the kingdom of Kum\u0101rap\u0101la only bloodless execution was permitted. From that time forth he supported himself by picking up grains, and remained in front of Hemacandra's pa\u015badha-house. Hearing \u0100n\u0101 and other royal ascetics reading the Yoga\u00e7\u0101stra, he recited this verse with complete sincerity,\n\nCausing sorrow to those who without reason are terrible,\nThere rises up the nectar-speech of the glorious Yoga\u00e7\u0101stra\nOf that hermit, surrounded with a circle of snake-like ascetics,\nIn whose face was vomited forth the poison of abuse.\n\nBy this speech of V\u0101mar\u0101\u00e7i, which was like a copious shower of nectar, the heat of Hemacandra's previous anger was extinguished, and he gave him a double salary.\n\nHere ends the story of V\u0101mar\u0101\u00e7i.\n\nThen, once on a time, two bards living in the country of Sur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, who vied with one another in the art of composing d\u016bh\u0101s, made an agreement that the one whose verses should be explained by the teacher Hemacandra, should pay the expenses incurred by the other, and they arrived in Anahillapura. Then one, meeting the lord Hemacandra, said,\n\nHis face is filled with blessings, the chief of which are Fortune and Speech,\nThose, with whom the eyes of the doctor Hemacandra are a little pleased, become learned.\n\nHaving said this, he remained near, and after the ceremony of waving lights in the Kum\u0101rapalavih\u0101ra was over, the king, intent on worship, remained a moment with the lord Hemacandra's hand on his back. At this moment the other bard entered, and uttered this couplet,\n\nHemacandra, those whom your hand full of wonderful prosperity holds,\nTo them success is presented in such a way that faces are below their feet.\n\nThe king was inly astonished at this original utterance of the bard's, and made him repeat it again and again. When he had repeated it three times, the bard respectfully said, \"Will you give me a lakh for each recital?\" Then the king caused three lakhs to be given to him.\n\nHere ends the story of the two bards from Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra.\n\n1 Ka\u015babhi\u1e63aya. The word is used in the Pari\u00e7\u1e6daparvan (ed. Jacobi) III. 187.\n2 In \u03b1 and \u03b2 and \u03a0, the word pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101te is repeated. This reading improves the sense, and I have adopted it.\nOnce on a time the great king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la was appointed head of the congregation, and was about to make the pilgrimage to all the holy places, and the god's shrine had already set forth with great pomp. At this time he was informed by a couple of posts, who came from a foreign country, that Karpa, the king of D\u0101hala, was marching against him. His forehead was beaded with drops of perspiration, and he abandoned, out of fear, his desire of being head of the congregation, and came with the minister V\u0101gbhata, and blamed himself at the feet of the lord Hemacandra. Then, as that great danger had come upon the king, Hemacandra reflected a little and said, \"In the twelfth watch from this time your mind will be relieved.\" Having said this, he dismissed the king; and while the king was in a state of bewilderment as to what step to take, a couple of posts arrived at the time fixed by Hemacandra, and informed him that Karpa had gone to heaven.\n\nThe king flung away his betel and asked them how it happened. They informed him that Karna was making a march at night, seated on the forehead of an elephant, and allowed his eyes to close in sleep, and while he was in this state, a gold chain, that he wore on his neck, caught in a banyan-tree, and hanged him, and so he died. They added that they started immediately after his funeral. When the king heard this from the two runners, he went immediately to the pausadha-house of Hemacandra, and began to praise him. But Hemacandra prevented him, though with some difficulty. Then the king travelled on with seventy-two great officers and the whole congregation, Hemacandra acting as guide on their road in two senses, and reached the city of Dhundukka, and the king, wishing to preach the faith in the \"cradle-temple\" seventeen cubits in height, which he himself had caused to be built on the site of the house in which the lord Hemacandra was born, and seeing that trouble had arisen from the Brahmans, who are naturally treacherous, banished them from the country, and in the course of worshipping the holy place of \u010catru\u1e47\u1e0djaya, he proceeded to go through the series of meditations, called the \"destroyer of pain\" and the \"destroyer of works.\" While he was engaged in the religious service of making various petitions in the presence of the god, he heard a bard uttering these lines,\n\nThe lord gives the joy of success for the sake of one flower,\nAs this is certain, do not on any account neglect the excellent Jina.\n\nAs he uttered it nine times, the king gave him nine thousand.\n\nThen he went into the neighbourhood of Ujjayanta, and while he was\n\n1 Yugalika. In India, even now the d\u0101k-runners travel in couples.\n2 More literally, \"that hugged the surface of his neck.\"\n3 I read apy\u00b0 for ity\u00b0 with \u03b1, \u03b2 and P.\nthere, the mountain suddenly began to tremble, and Hemacandra said to\nthe king, \"There is a tradition handed down by old men\\(^1\\) that this\numbrella-rock will fall upon two men possessing merit coming under it at\nthe same time. Now you and I are both possessors of merit, and whether\nthe saying prove true or false,\\(^2\\) in either case there will be a scandal among\nthe people. So let the king worship the god; I will not!\" When the\nlord Hemacandra said this, the king persuaded him over by his entreaties,\nand sent him on with the congregation; but he himself avoided the way\nby the umbrella-rock, and commissioned V\u0101gha\u1e6da to make a new road on\nthe other side, where there was a broken-down rampart. On the two sides\nof the road there were spent sixty-three lakhs.\n\nHere ends the story of the pilgrimage to holy places.\n\nOnce on a time the king was desirous of making gold, in order to free the\nearth from debt, and for that purpose, by the advice of Hemacandra, his\nteacher, the preceptor Devacandra,\\(^3\\) who was at that time engaged in a\ndifficult vow, was summoned by letters from the king and the congregation.\nThinking that some important interest of the congregation was involved,\nDevacandra, in the course of his religious tour, without being recognized\nby any one on the road, came to his own pa\u015badha-house. But the king,\nwho was making preparations to go out to meet him, and show him honour\nin other ways, having been informed by Hemacandra, came there. Then\nthe lord Hemacandra, accompanied by all the Jaina laymen with the king\nat their head, worshipped the teacher with the reverence of twelve move-\nments. After the ceremony of worship was over, they listened to his\npreaching, and at the termination of his sermon, he asked what the business\nof the congregation was, on account of which he had been summoned.\nThen Hemacandra and the king dismissed the meeting, and being concealed\nby a curtain, fell at the feet of the teacher, and asked him to show them\nhow to make gold. Hemacandra said, \"When I was a boy, a lump of\ncopper, having been smeared with the juice of a creeper begged from a\nfemale wood-carrier,\\(^4\\) had fire applied to it under your instructions and\nbecame gold. Tell us the name of that creeper and its characteristics, and\nother necessary particulars connected with it.\" When Hemacandra said\nthis, his teacher, boiling with anger, flung him far from him and said,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) For \\(vrdh\u0101paraparay\u0101\\), P, a and \u03b2 give \\(vrdh\u0101parampard\u0101\\). \u0120ila is a misprint\nfor gil\u0101.\n\n\\(^2\\) P, a and \u03b2 omit asaty\u0101, but I have followed the printed text. The reading of\nthe MSS. means, \"If the saying prove true, the people will speak evil of us.\"\n\n\\(^3\\) I have translated \u010criDevacandra\u015b\u0101c\u0101ry\u0101 which is found in a after tadgurava\u015b.\nIt may be a gloss, but it makes the narrative clearer.\n\n\\(^4\\) It is clear that y\u0101cit\u0101\u015b is wrong. The Visarga should be deleted. It is not\nfound in P or a. The latter MS. gives k\u1e63\u1e6dhabh\u0101rav\u0101hak\u0101\u015b, from a (male) bearer\nof a load of wood. P has \"v\u0101hak\u0101\u015b (sic) y\u0101citav\u0101l\u012b,\"\n\u201cYou are not qualified to receive this knowledge. First I bestowed on you knowledge, which was like a decoction of pulse, and even that gave you indigestion, so how can I give to you, whose concoctive fire is so weak, a knowledge that resembles sweetmeats!\u201d When he had in these words refused Hemacandra, he said to the king, \u201cYou have not that good fortune, which would enable you to acquire the science of producing gold in such a way as to free the whole world from debt. Moreover, by forbidding the killing of living creatures, and by adorning the earth with images of the Jina, and other meritorious acts, you have gained both worlds, so what more do you desire?\u201d When he had said this, he resumed his religious tour as before.\n\nOnce on a time the king asked the lord Hemacandra to give him an account of his former existence. The lord told the king all about it.\n\nThen, once on a time, the king made ready an army against the Sap\u0101d\u0101lak\u1e63a country, and he appointed the younger brother of V\u0101gbha\u1e6da, the minister named B\u0101hada, though he was stained with the fault of reckless munificence, general of it, after giving him many admonitions. He, after he had made two marches, seeing that a large number of petitioners had assembled, asked the superintendent of the army chest for a lakh of money, and when he, in accordance with the king\u2019s order, refused to give it, the general struck him a blow with a whip, and expelled him from the camp. Then he himself satisfied with gifts all the petitioners at his own good pleasure, and mounting on fourteen hundred female camels twice as many picked warriors, he advanced with them, and after a few marches he invested the ramparts of the city of Bambar\u0101. Then, hearing from the people of the town that on the very night of his arrival the marriage ceremonies of seven hundred maidens had begun, he kept quiet during that night on account of these marriages, and the next morning he overturned the rampart. There he captured seven crores of gold pieces, and also eleven thousand mares, and he sent off by very swift confidential messengers to the king a report full of this acquisition of wealth.\n\nHe himself returned, after he had established in that country the authority of king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, and appointed officers. He entered Pattana, and repaired to the king\u2019s palace, and bowed before him. The king, when the suitable time had arrived for conversing with him, though he was won over by his good qualities, said to him, \u201cYour munificence is a great fault; you are excellent in collecting means of transport and armies; but you have more near to you still a protecting charm, the accomplishment of the task assigned to you; otherwise you would be ripped up on\n\n1 Of course we should read pr\u012btitaro with a and \u03b2.\n2 I read pr\u0101lab with P, \u03b1 and \u03b2.\n3 Here the word cara is used, which ordinarily means \u201cspy.\u201d\naccount of the fault of your eyes in taking such lofty aims; the expenditure in which you indulge, even I am not able to compass.\" When he heard this remark of the king's, he replied, \"Your Majesty speaks the truth in this; you are not able to indulge in the expenditure which I allow myself, because you are not a king's son by immediate descent, while I am a king's son; therefore I expend money more liberally.\" By saying this he gained the reputation of priceless worth, on the ground that, whether the king were pleased or angry, a touchstone at close quarters acquires the splendour of gold. Then he was dismissed by the king and went to his own place.\n\nHere ends the story of B\u0101ha\u1e47a the king's whetstone.\n\nThen his younger brother, named Solaka, the governor of a province, bore the title of \"the Almshouse.\"\n\nThen, once on a time, the son of the king's mother's sister, named \u0100n\u0101ka, on whom, being pleased with the excellence of his service, the king had bestowed the post of military commander, but who still continued to be in attendance, as before, came into the presence of the king, as he was reclining on a sofa in the moonlight hall, during a certain mid-day period of relaxation. Suddenly a certain servant arrived there, and the king, seeing him, said, \"Who is this?\" \u0100n\u0101ka perceived that he was his own servant, and on his making a signal to him, went with him outside the palace. \u0100n\u0101ka asked the servant how things were going on in his house, and then the servant demanded a present for announcing the good news of the birth of a son. \u0100n\u0101ka said, \"Yes,\" and dismissing the servant, the lotus of whose countenance was illuminated with that intelligence, as if with the brightness of the sun, he returned to his own duty. The king inquired, \"What is it all about?\" \u0100n\u0101ka answered, \"A son has been born to your Majesty.\" The king thought over the matter in silence for some time, and then said openly to him, \"This child, in order to announce whose birth this servant penetrated in here, without being interfered with by the doorkeepers,\u2014on account, I say, of so great an accumulation of merit, this child will be a king in Gujar\u0101t, but not in this city, nor in this palace. Because you were called away from this place, before the birth of a son was announced to you, therefore he will not be lord over this city.\" Such was the decision of king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, the Brahm\u0101 of discrimination.\n\nHere ends the story of Lav\u0101napras\u0101da.\n\n1 We learn from p. 193 of the printed text that he was the adopted son of Siddhar\u1e63ja.\n2 S\u0101ma\u1e47\u1e6da.\n3 P and a have svakau\u015balam.\n4 Om iti. These words are omitted by P, a and \u03b2.\n5 Here a and \u03b2 have im\u0101\u1e41 bhuvam \u0101pa, which gives a good sense. P has im\u0101pa.\nIn eighteen great provinces that owned his sway, having with due care\nFor fourteen years turned back by his might the flowing tide of the\nslaughter of living beings,\nAnd also having set up temples fourteen hundred in number, like so many\npillars of victory,\nThe Jaina king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la wrought out the destruction of his own sin.\n\nThen, once on a time, the disease of leprosy afflicted the lord Hemacandra,\\(^1\\) because, owing to the curse of the very virtuous mother of Laks\u0101raja the\nking of Kaccha, it was handed down to all the descendants of M\u016blar\u0101ja\nand in consequence of this transmission it came to pass that, as, at the time\nof Kum\u0101rap\u0101la\u2019s taking upon himself the duties of a householder, he\nwished to devolve the burden of the kingdom upon Hemacandra, the\ndisease of leprosy penetrated into the sage by that opening. Grief on that\naccount seized the king and the courtiers, but the lord Hemacandra,\nperceiving by meditation that his constitution still possessed strength,\neasily eradicated it by practising asceticism consisting of eight branches.\\(^2\\)\n\nOn one occasion the king was astonished at seeing a certain ascetic seated\non a plantain-leaf, so the lord Hemacandra seated himself in the air, four\ninches above the ground, and then showed the king a mass of brightness\nissuing from the suture in the crown of his head. Then, at the end of a\nlife of eighty-four years, having fixed the day of his death, he began his\nlast act of faith, with total abstinence from food. The king was upset\nwith grief on that account, but Hemacandra thus admonished him, \u201cYou\nhave six months more of life left to you, and as you have no son, you must\nperform your own funeral obsequies while you are alive.\u201d Then he yielded\nup his breath by the tenth aperture.\\(^3\\) Immediately the lord Hemacandra\nwas burnt, and then the king worshipped his ashes, by using them to\nmake a mark on his forehead, knowing them to be of purifying efficacy.\nThen all the chieftains, and after them the people of the town, took the clay\nof the burning-place, and the place began to be known by the name of\nHemakhanda,\\(^4\\) which it still retains. Then the king\u2019s eyes were dimmed\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) P. \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) omit sa vy\u0101dh\u012bt\u0101 kum\u0101rap\u0101le b\u0101dh\u0101m adh\u0101t.

As the kingdom was made over to Hemacandra, he became\none of M\u016blar\u0101ja\u2019s successors.\n\n\\(^2\\) These are enumerated by Monier-Williams s.v. yoga.

In V.S. 1230 Ajayadeva was set on the throne. When he began to destroy the temples set up by his predecessor, a jester named Sila began a religious ceremony in the king's presence, and in the middle of it pretended to be ill, and made over the five gods' shrines that he had made in it to his sons, admonishing them that after his death they were to be worshipped with extreme devotion. Then, while he was feigning to be in a moribund condition, hearing that his younger son had quickly destroyed them, he said, \"Why even His Majesty Ajayadeva did not destroy his father's religious edifices, until his father had gone to the next world, but you are the lowest of the low, for you destroy mine while I am still alive.\" That talk of the jester made the king ashamed of himself, and he desisted from that impropriety. Subsequently king Ajayadeva entreated the minister Kapardin most earnestly to fill the post of prime minister, but he said, \"To-morrow morning I will take the omens, and if they are favourable to the step, I will carry out the king's command.\" Having said this, he went to the omen-house, and having obtained the sevenfold omen of the goddess Durg\u0101, that he asked for, he worshipped that omen with flowers and whole grain, and thinking that he had gained all he wished, when he arrived within the gate of the city, he saw a bull bellowing in the northeast quarter, and so he reached his house in an exceedingly cheerful frame.\n\n---\n\n1 But I find in P viplavaman\u0101h, which might mean \"being distracted\"; a has viplavaman\u0101h, B apparently vik\u0101raman\u0101h, which gives a good sense.\n2 The seven constituent parts of a kingdom are the king, his ministers, ally, territory, fortress, army and treasury.\n3 There is an allusion to the water offered to the manes. Apparently the king means to say that he ought to have died before Hemacandra.\n4 Sam\u0101dhimara\u1e47ena. See Hoernle, Uv\u0101saga Das\u0101o, p. 62.\n5 P reads p\u0101rvajapra\u015b\u0101d\u0101n.\n6 A jester named Silana is mentioned on p. 184 of the printed text. Here a has Silavana; B, Silana; P supports the printed text.\n7 It is clear from the MSS. that \u0101ntaram is a misprint for \u0101nantaram.\n8 I think that this is an instance of the peculiar use of the word d\u0101, which our author affects.\n9 But P gives gopur\u0101nte, near the gate.\nof mind. After his meal an astrologer,\\(^1\\) named Maruvrddha, asked him the nature of the omens that he had seen. Then Kapardin told him their nature, and spoke well of them. Then Maruvrddha quoted the following lines:\n\n\"In crossing a river, in difficulties, on a journey, and also when peril is approaching,\n\nIn the business of a woman, in war, in disease, the contrary is praised.\n\nIn accordance with the doctrine laid down in these lines, you, as calamity is approaching, owing to a mental delusion, think favourable what is really unfavourable. As for that bull which you supposed to be so auspicious, he, seeing that Civa would be exalted by your overthrow, and being the bull, his vehicle,\\(^2\\) bellowed.\" Showing in this way his low estimate of what the minister said, Maruvrddha took leave of him, and went to bathe in holy waters,\\(^3\\) while Kapardin accepted the seal that the king was pleased to bestow on him, and returned to his own house with great pomp, and after resting there he was arrested by the king in the night, and his colleagues began to insult him.\n\nThat lion which used to plant his paw on the forehead of mighty elephants,\n\nAnd scatter their pearls, now, owing to the might of destiny, endures the contumely of jackals.\n\nSuch were his thoughts. Then at the time of being cast into the cauldron, that wise man uttered his last stanza:\n\nTo petitioners I have given away crores of gold red as flame,\n\nIn disputes with opponents I have put forth speeches full of the meaning of the Scriptures,\n\nI have played with kings rooted up and planted in, as if with chessmen,\n\nI have done my duty; if fate also appears as a petitioner, for him I am ready.\n\nEven while repeating it, he was put to death in that very way.\n\nHere ends the story of the great Kapardin.\n\nBut then R\u0101macandra, the author of a hundred works, being placed by that low villain of a king on a heated plate of copper, uttered this couplet:\n\n\\(^1\\) I have here translated y\u0101mika as \"astrologer,\" though the word generally means \"watchman.\" On page 254 of the printed text Maruvrddha is called a c\u0101kunika.\n\n\\(^2\\) I read with \\(a\\) and \\(B\\) tadv\u0101hanok\u1e63\u0101 for tadvad \u0101h\u0101ta uks\u0101. \\(P\\) has tadv\u0101hatok\u1e63\u0101.\n\n\\(^3\\) I read t\u012brth\u0101nyavag\u0101dh\u016bni with \\(a\\) and \\(B\\). \\(P\\) has t\u0101rth\u0101nyavag\u0101dh\u016b (sic). The reading in the printed text seems to mean \"went to plunge into his business.\" But the pronouns are used in a very confusing way.\nThe setting of that sun, by whom to the whole surface of the earth,\nanimate and inanimate,\nGlory was largely bestowed, has to be and will be for long.\n\nHaving said this, he bit through his tongue with the edge of his teeth,\nand died. Thus he was put to death.\n\nHere ends the story of R\u0101macandra.\n\nThen the renowned \u0100m\u1e5babha\u1e6da, the king's grandfather, was in the\ncompany of various military officers, who, being envious of his glory,\nand thinking that they had now obtained an occasion against him, urged\nhim to prostrate himself before the king, and reproached him for not\ndoing so, but he said, \"In this birth I do obeisance to him who is\nwithout passion as a god, to the sage Hemacandra as a teacher, and to\nKum\u0101rap\u0101la as a master.\" When that hero, whose seven bodily elements\nwere perfumed by the Jaina religion, said this, the king was angry, and\nsaid, \"Prepare for battle.\" Having heard that speech of the king's, he\nworshipped the image of the Jina, and undertook a fast, and accepted\nconsecration for battle, and sweeping away from his own mansion the\nretainers of the king, like a heap of chaff, with the wind of his own\nsoldiers, he penetrated as far as the clock-house, and washed away in the\nholy bath of the edge of the sword the defilement contracted by contact\nwith those impure ones, and passed into existence as a god, being emulously\nchosen by the Apsarases, who came to behold that wondrous sight.\n\nIt is better to be a bard, better even to be a debauchee for the sake of\nmoney,\nBetter to be a teacher of dancing-girls, better even to be skilled in great\ntreachery,\nNow that, by appointment of Fate, the son of Udayana, a sea of munificence,\nIs gone to heaven, it will not do at all for sensible men to become learned\non the circle of the earth.\nIn three years, in three months, in three fortnights, in three days,\nA man eats the fruit of very great merit and sin even in this world.\n\n1 P gives s\u0101mantai\u1e63\u1e6dai\u1e25 sam\u0101ni taistai\u1e25 samah; a gives s\u0101mantai\u1e25 sta\u1e45 samah;\n\u03b2, s\u0101mantai\u1e25 sama. I read s\u0101mantai\u1e63\u1e6dai\u1e25 samah.\n\n2 Probably Mah\u0101v\u012bra or Vardham\u0101na, the last T\u012brtha\u1e45kara.\n\n3 Hofratz B\u00fchlcr in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. VI. p. 186, tells us that Ajayap\u0101la\nwas called the \"ardent devotee of Civa,\" in allusion to the reaction against Jainism\nwhich took place during his reign. It appears that the Jaina party favoured\nPrat\u0101pananda as Kum\u0101rap\u0101la's successor. (B\u00fchler, H.C. pp. 50, 61.)\n\n4 A gloss in a explains khya\u1e47air by bha\u1e47\u1e0dair. I have given the meaning assigned\nto the word in the Abridged Petersburg Dictionary.\nIn accordance with this doctrine, laid down in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, that wicked king, the sinner against religious edifices, was stabbed with a knife by a doorkeeper named Vayajaladeva, and being devoured by worms, and suffering the tortures of hell every day, he passed into the invisible world. Ajayadeva ruled for three years, beginning from V.S. 1230. B\u0101lam\u016bladeva ruled for two years, beginning from V.S. 1233. His mother, queen N\u0101iki, the daughter of king Paramarddin, taking her son in her lap, fought at a gh\u0101\u1e6d named G\u0101dar\u0101ragha\u1e6d\u1e6da, and conquered the king of the Mleechas, by the aid of a mass of rain-clouds, that came out of season attracted by her virtue. Bh\u012bmadeva reigned for sixty-three years, beginning from V.S. 1235. While this king was reigning, the king of M\u0101lava, named Soha\u1e0da, advanced to the border of Gujar\u0101t, with the intention of devastating that country, but the minister of Bh\u012bmadeva went to meet him, and addressed this couplet to him,\u2014 \n\nThy blaze of might, O sun of kings, gleams in the eastern quarter, \nBut it will be extinguished, when thou shalt descend into the western region.\n\nWhen Sohada heard this disagreeable utterance of the minister, he turned back again. Subsequently his son, named the glorious Arjunadeva, quite defeated the realm of Gujar\u0101t. The vicegerent of Bh\u012bmadeva, famous under the title of Vy\u0101ghrapalliya, the son of \u0100n\u0101ka, Lavanapras\u0101da, ruled for a long time. His son was Viradhavala, who was white with the weight of sovereignty. His mother Madanar\u0101j\u00f1i, when her sister, who was married to the P\u0101ttakila named Devar\u0101ja, died, hearing that the weight of his grief was great and intolerable, in order to help him to bear it, left her husband, named Lavanaprasada, and went with her son Viradhavala to his house. He made her his wife, as her\n\n---\n\n1 I read Pur\u0101\u1e47oktapr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47y\u0101t with \u03b1 and \u03b2. But Professor Leumann points out that the stanza is No. 2642 in B\u00f6htlingk's Indische Spr\u00fcche, and is found in the Hitopade\u015ba.\n2 The reading of \u03b1 and \u03b2 pratyak\u1e63a\u1e41 means \"suffering visibly,\" which gives an antithesis. \u03b3, \u03b1 and \u03b2 give parok\u1e63a\u1e41 for parok\u1e63at\u0101\u1e41.\n3 P has utsagge \u015b\u012br\u1e63u suta\u1e41 n\u1e5bpa\u1e41 vi\u1e0dh\u0101ya, having made her son a child in arms king.\n4 Forbes shows from Ferishta that this king was Muhammad Shah\u0101b-ul-din Ghori. This identification is accepted by B\u00fchlcr, Indian Antiquary, Vol. VI. p. 187.\n5 I find in \u03b1, aralambit\u0101.\n6 See Chronology of India by C. Mabel Drift, p. 162.\n7 I read Vy\u0101ghrapalliya, as suggested by B\u00fchlcr (Arisimha, p. 19). B\u00fchlcr reads with \u03b1, Lavanaprasada. The question of this vicegerent's position with regard to Bh\u012bma is discussed at length by B\u00fchlcr, l.c.\n8 This seems to be equivalent to the modern word patel.\n9 All the MSS. give \u1e6dh\u0101ra\u1e41. (P has dyad\u0101ra\u1e41, so too \u03b2; \u03b1 has ayadv\u0101ra\u1e41.) It seems that \u1e6dh\u0101ra\u1e41 would give a better sense. But \u1e6dh\u0101ra\u1e41 may mean \"multitude, quantity, heap.\" The printed text seems to give \u1e0dpadv\u0101ra\u1e41.\nqualities and her outward appearance were attractive. Lava\u1e47a, having ascertained that fact completely, went at night into Devar\u0101ja's house to kill him, and while, having concealed himself, he was looking \\(^1\\) for an opportunity, Devar\u0101ja, who was sitting down to dinner, said again and again, \"I will not eat without Viradhavala,\" and, after he had by his pertinacity brought him, he ate with him off the same plate.\\(^2\\) Suddenly he beheld his mortal enemy, like death incarnate in bodily form, and his face became black, but Lava\u1e47a said to him, \"Do not be afraid, for it is true that I came here with the intention of killing you, but having actually seen with my own eyes your love for my son here, Viradhavala, I have abandoned this fixed purpose of mine.\" When he had said this, he was entertained by him, and went home. Viradhavala's brothers by other mothers,\\(^3\\) of the R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drak\u016b\u1e6da race, S\u0101\u1e45gana, C\u0101munda-r\u0101ja, and others, were famous on the surface of the earth on account of their valour. Then that K\u1e63atriya Viradhavala, when his intellect began to develop a little, grew ashamed of that circumstance, and left Devar\u0101ja's house, and attended on his own father. He was distinguished for the virtues of courage, magnanimity, profundity, firmness, prudence, humility, tact, clemency, munificence, politeness, and other qualities of the kind, and thanks to his modesty, after he had gained possession of a certain territory overrun by enemies, he also had a certain stretch of land bestowed on him by his father. A Brahman councillor, of the name of C\u0101ha\u1e0da, administered the weighty affairs of his kingdom, and he struck up a friendship with the minister Tejahp\u0101la, the pearl of the Pr\u0101gv\u0101\u1e6da race, who formerly lived in the auspicious city of Pattana, and had at that time come where he was. Now the story of the birth of the minister Tejahp\u0101la is as follows. Once on a time, in the august city of Pattana, on the occasion of an exposition, a certain very beautiful widow, named Kum\u0101radevi, was looked at again and again by the reverend doctor Haribhadra, and so attracted\\(^4\\) the attention of the minister \u0100car\u0101ja,\\(^5\\) who was present at the ceremony. After the congregation had been dismissed, the teacher, being questioned by the minister, said, \"By a revelation of my favourite deity I foresee that the sun and moon will descend and be conceived in her, and therefore I looked at the marks on her body again and again.\"\\(^6\\) The minister, having\n\n---\n\n1 I read nirik\u1e63ate with \u03b2.\n2 I find in \u03b1 and \u03b2, sthale, which means that he ate in the same place.

In course of time those two heavenly bodies descended and were conceived in her, as the two ministers, named Vastup\u0101la and Tejahp\u0101la, like two chiefs of the Jyotisika gods. Then, one day, as king Viradhavala was entreating him to undertake the burden of his affairs, he first entertained him and his wife in his own palace. Anupam\u0101 presented to the queen Jayatala her two camphor-scented earrings, and her camphor-scented necklace of one string, composed of pearls alternating with jewels set in gold. Viradhavala refused the minister's proffered present, and made over to him his own business. He gave him a gift of five things connected with his business, and at the same time the following sentence on an inscribed leaf: \"Though angry with you, I promise you that I will give you back all the wealth that you now have.\"\n\nThat man is really a minister and full of wisdom, who without taxation accumulates treasure,\nWithout killing defends the kingdom, and extends its territory without war.\n\nThe minister, whose mind was established in all the treatises of policy and the Upani\u1e63ads, made his master prosper, and at the rising of the sun he used duly to worship the Jina with an offering suitable to the time, and then to do homage to his teacher, and present him with sandalwood and camphor, and after honouring him with the reverence requiring twelve appropriate movements, and making the renunciation suitable to the occasion, he used to repeat one new c\u016bka to his teacher, and after this ceremony of repeating a mantra, he cooked and ate a fresh rasavat\u012b. After this meal, a devout Jaina layman, named Mu\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101la, who was his private secretary, asked him in private, selecting a suitable occasion, \"My lord, at the beginning of the day do you eat cold food or fresh food?\" When his private secretary asked him this, he paid no attention to him on two or three occasions, thinking that he was a boor, but one day the minister flew into a passion and abused him, calling him \"a cowherd.\" He maintained his equanimity, and said, \"It must be one or the other.\"\n\n1 The Jyotisika gods dwell in the \"moons, the suns, the Nak\u1e63atras, and the hosts of stars.\" (Jacobi, Jaina S\u016btras II., p. 226.)\n2 Or perhaps \"beads of gold.\"\n3 The word mantrin\u0101h is omitted in a, but it is found in P.\n4 Here P has \"patr\u0101ntarastha-bandha-p\u0101rvakai,\" but a and \u03b2 have \"patr\u0101ntarastha\".\nI follow P, adopting patr\u0101ntarastha: \u03b2 has \"subandha\".\n5 I read with a, \u03b2 and P, pharaeva addami.\n6 I read candana with a and \u03b2.\n7 Professor Leumann informs me that six are made during the first pronunciation of the formulas, and six during their repetition.\n8 According to B\u00f6hlingsk and Roth's Abridged Dictionary, this word denotes \"curled milk with sugar and spices.\"\nWhen he said this, the minister, astonished in his mind at the dexterity of his answer, said to him, \"I have not grasped the hidden figurative meaning of your instruction, so, sage sir, let me know the real state of the case!\" Then that eloquent man said, \"As for that *rasavat\u012b* abounding in moisture, which my lord eats fresh, as it is of the nature of merit in a previous state of existence, and is left over from another birth, I consider it to be exceedingly cold. Moreover, in this I have only set forth the speech which my teacher commissioned me to transmit to you, but he is in a position to give a true decision in this matter, therefore set forward your foot towards his dwelling.\" When the minister, named Tej\u0101p\u0101la, had received this answer from him, he went to the reverend doctor Vijayasena, the teacher of his family, and asked him the duty of a householder. He taught him the duty of a householder from the seventh *Ayga*, called the *Up\u0101sakada\u015b\u0101h\u0101*, viz. the worship of the gods, the necessary duties, the giving of alms to Jaina ascetics, and so on, as set forth by the Jina; and from that day forth Tej\u0101p\u0101la began to perform various kinds of worship of the gods, and distribution of alms to Jaina ascetics, and other holy works. By laying aside a quarter of his income for the worship of the gods during three years, he produced the temple of Nemin\u0101tha in the village of B\u0101\u016bl\u0101, at a cost of thirty-six thousand pieces.\n\nThen, in the year 1277 V.S., the glorious Vastup\u0101la, the great minister, the great poet, the younger Bhoja, the neck-ornament of the goddess of learning, began his great pilgrimage, in an auspicious time fixed by his teacher, having by him been solemnly consecrated as head of the congregation. When the sending off of the god's portable shrine was being commenced, he heard in the southern quarter the voice of the goddess Durg\u0101. He himself investigated the matter to a certain extent, by the help of an interpreter of omens who understood such matters. He said, \"Maruv\u1e5bddha, explain the omen.\" Maruv\u1e5bddha reflected that a sound was more important than a visible omen, and being asked about the occurrence of the omen, when they had taken the shrine out of the city and placed it in the encampment, he said, \"In danger of the road\n\n---\n\n1 I read *m\u0101nye* with \u03b1 and \u03b2.

P gives *p\u0101dau*.\n3 P is more full than the text, giving *grhi\u1e6dharmavidhi\u1e43*.\n4 In Jaina Prakrit \"*Uv\u0101sagad\u0101\u015b\u0101*\". It has been edited by Dr. Hoernle in the Bibliotheca Indica with a translation and notes.\n5 I have used the word \"pieces\" to translate *dravyena*, as I do not know what coins are meant.

It has been pointed out to me by Hofrath B\u00fchlert, that Durg\u0101devi is applied by the natives of India to a small owl.\n8 I read *pur\u0101tahird\u016bse\u1e47u* with \u03b1, \u03b2, and P.\ncontrariety of omens is praised, and in distress of the kingdom; the case of danger on pilgrimages to holy places is similar. Send some clever man to the place where that Durg\u0101 became visible, and let the exact spot be pointed out.\u201d That was done, and the man brought the following report, \u201cWhere that portico\\(^1\\) was being rebuilt, the goddess was sitting on the heap\\(^2\\) numbered thirteen and a half.\u201d Then Maruv\u1e5bddha said, \u201cThe goddess told you that you should perform thirteen pilgrimages and a half.\u201d When he was again asked as to the meaning of the last half pilgrimage, he said, \u201cOn a matchlessly auspicious occasion like the present, it is not fitting to speak of that; when the suitable occasion presents itself, I will explain the whole matter.\u201d After Maruv\u1e5bddha had said this, the minister marched on with the whole worshipful congregation. Taking the conveyances altogether,\\(^3\\) there were four thousand and five hundred of them. There were twenty-one thousand \u00c7vet\u0101mbaras, and three hundred Digambaras.\\(^4\\) There were appointed to guard the congregation a thousand horsemen, and seven hundred riders on red she-camels, and four military officers of high rank were entrusted with the superintendence of the protection of the congregation. In this fashion, having traversed the road with the whole assemblage, he encamped in P\u0101daliptapura, which he had himself caused to be built\\(^5\\) in the neighbourhood of Lalitasaras, which was adorned with a caitya of Mah\u0101v\u012bra. There he duly worshipped the holy places, and in the principal temple he set up a golden finial, and a couple of full-sized Jinas; in the holy bathing-place of the city of \u00c7r\u012bmodhara two figures adoring the caitya of the blessed Mah\u0101v\u012bra; in the \u00c7akunik\u0101vih\u0101ra, on both sides of the row of vestibules belonging to the chapels, a series of double courtyards; in the holy bathing-place of Satyapura\\(^6\\) in front of the caitya, an arch of the value of silver, and cells suitable for the worshipful congregation, and chapels in memory of his seven sisters;\\(^7\\) in the holy bathing-place of Nand\u012b\u00e7vara, temples and a vestibule of Indra;\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I find in \\(a, \\beta\\), and \\(P\\), varanda\u00e7abde for the varanda\u00e7abde of the text. The text would probably mean, \u201cWhere that unhappy sound was being renewed.\u201d\n\n\\(^2\\) The reading of \\(a\\) in this passage looks like thare. \\(P\\) gives there. Perhaps we should read thare, a heap, from the Marathi thar. I think that the reading of \\(\\beta\\) also is meant for thare. I have translated accordingly.\n\n\\(^3\\) I find in \\(P\\), \\(a\\) and \\(\\beta\\), sarvaso\u00e7khyay\u0101 vahan\u0101n\u0101m.\n\n\\(^4\\) I find in \\(P\\), \\(a\\) and \\(\\beta\\), tri\u00e7att digv\u0101nas\u0101m.\n\n\\(^5\\) But it would appear from B\u00fchler\u2019s Arisimha, p. 33, that the lake of Lalitasaras was excavated by Vastup\u0101la. If we read k\u0101rita\\(^8\\) with \\(\\beta\\), it would follow that the caitya was constructed by Vastup\u0101la. The correct name of the lake is Lalit\u0101saras, as given in \\(B\\).

Then, for the construction of the Nandi\u015bvara temple, sixteen excellent pillars of Kantheliya stone were being brought by water from the mountain, and when they were being landed near Samudra-kantha, one pillar sank into the mud in such a way that, though diligently searched for, it was not recovered. A pillar of a different kind of stone was substituted in its place, and the temple was fully completed according to the size designed. During the next year, owing to the changes produced by the tide of the sea, that very pillar, that was lost in the mud, became visible. When it was being transported to the temple by order of the minister, a man bearing disagreeable tidings came to inform the minister that the temple had split in two. Thereupon that minister gave him a golden tongue. When clever people asked, \"What is the meaning of this?\" he replied, \"Henceforth men will manage somehow or other to get religious edifices built so strongly, that they will not come to an end even at the termination of a great age of the world. For this reason I gave him this complimentary present. This temple built up again from the foundation for the third time is sure to be greatly prosperous.\" Moreover, he caused to be built a large pa\u015badha-house in P\u0101litanaka. Now, when the minister arrived with the worshipful congregation at the sacred Ujjayanta, he saw at the foot of the mountain the new embankment that had been caused to be made in Jalapura, and in the middle of it the temple of \u0100car\u0101ja, and also the matchless tank of Kum\u0101r\u0101dev\u012b. The servants asked him to enter the palace, but the minister inquired whether there was a fitting pa\u015badha-house for the reverend religious teacher, or not, and hearing that it was in course of erection, he was afraid of transgressing the bounds of discipline, and remained with the religious\n\n1 See B\u00fchlcr's Arisittha, p. 32.

Next morning he ascended Ujjayanta, and worshipped the twin lotuses of the feet\\(^1\\) of Nemin\u0101tha, and made a great proclamation of the faith in the holy bathing-place of \u010catru\u00f1jay\u0101vat\u0101ra, which he himself had caused to be made, and he did his duty to the excellent caityas of the three auspicious occasions,\\(^2\\) by adoration and other ceremonies, and on the third day he descended, and found that in those two days the pausadha-house had been completed, and the minister and religious teacher were conducted there, and praised the edifice, and favoured those employed in building it with a complimentary present. In Pattana, in the field of Prabh\u0101sa,\\(^3\\) he prostrated himself before Chandraprabha because he was powerful there, and on his own A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101pada\\(^4\\) temple he placed, after due worship, a golden finial, and gave gifts to the people there to whom gifts ought to be given.\\(^5\\) While thus engaged, he heard from the mouth of a righteous attendant of the god, who was more than a hundred and fifteen years old, the world-renowned story, how the teacher Hemacandra showed to king Kum\u0101rap\u0101la the god Some\u00e7vara visibly manifested. He was astonished in his mind at that man's experience. Now, on the way, as he was returning, he forbade the giving of food to those who lived by carrying li\u1e45gas, on account of their improper conduct. The doctor Jinadatta of V\u0101yuda heard of that insult, and supplied that charitable donation from the resources of his lay followers. Then the minister came to propitiate that religious body, and the doctor said to him,\u2014 \n\nThe religion gains depth by means of the bearers of the li\u1e45ga,  \nAs a mine of jewels gains depth by being filled with caustic waters.  \nSince Jaina saints, even though alarmed, solicit for alms\\(^6\\) the bearers of the li\u1e45ga,  \nWhy is the respect shown to them blamed by righteous men afraid of rebirth?  \nEven those who carry pictures leave the land before these,  \nBut disrepect to the li\u1e45ga-bearers, while they stay in the land, is inconsistent.  \nThose who show contempt in the world towards those who live by carrying li\u1e45gas,  \nThose wicked men are tainted with the guilt of extirpating a religion.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Dr. Burgess in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. II. p. 355.  \n\\(^2\\) The editor explains it thus, \"The caityas in which an image of a T\u012brthakara is set up on the festivals of his birth, ordination and attainment of the rank of Kevalin.\"  \n\\(^3\\) I find in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), Chandraprabh\u0101prabh\u0101sa\\(^c\\).  \n\\(^4\\) On page 308 of the printed text, A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101pada is spoken of as a t\u012brtha.

There he erected an image of Nemin\u0101tha, and then the minister invited from J\u0101b\u0101lipura the famous minister Ya\u00e7ov\u012bra, who was skilled in determining the good and bad points of such edifices, and asked him to give an opinion on the character of the temple. Then Ya\u00e7ov\u012bra said to \u00c7obhanadeva, the architect that made the temple, \"In the painted vestibule the broad passage between the two statues is altogether inappropriate in the temple of a Tirthankara, and is forbidden by the treatises on architecture: moreover, this arch over the door that leads into the inner cell of the temple, on account of the two lions on it, altogether disturbs the worship of the god: moreover, the hall of elephants, adorned\\(^7\\) with the statues of ancestors, in the back part of the temple, is fatal to the long life of the man who had\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It appears from the MSS. that t\u012b should be substituted for vi.\n\\(^2\\) Professor Leumann informs me that these two couplets are to be found in the Av\u0101\u1e47yakaniyukti, XII. 31, 32.\n\\(^3\\) An aggregate of buildings, containing a temple and a monastery.

(See the commencement of Jacobi's preface to the Paricistaparvan.)\n\\(^7\\) The grammar of the text seems to be defective. The three MSS., a, \u03b2 and P, give \"yuta\".\nthe temple built. That an intelligent architect should have committed these three irremediable faults is to be ascribed to the force of actions in a former life, that must produce their effect.\" When Ya\u00e7ovira had given this decision, he returned to the place from which he came. The couplets in his praise run as follows:\n\nYa\u00e7ovira, this moon is the summit of the pearl-heap\\(^1\\) of your glory;\nThe spot in the moon is really the auspicious talisman to guard it.\nCyphers, Ya\u00e7ovira, empty in the middle, are of no value,\nThey acquire numerical value only when combined\\(^2\\) with you.\nYa\u00e7ovira, when the Disposer writes your name on the moon,\nHe finds that the two first syllables cannot be contained in the sky.\n\nHere end the accounts\\(^3\\) of the pilgrimages to \u00c7atru\u00f1jaya and other holy places.\n\nThen Vastup\u0101la was involved in a war with a merchant named Sa\u00efda\\(^4\\) in Stambhat\u012brtha, and he summoned from Bhrgupura a great champion named \u00c7\u0101jkha, like the god of death,\\(^5\\) to oppose Vastup\u0101la. He encamped\\(^6\\) on the shore of the sea, and seeing that the roads leading into the city were occupied in force by the enemy, and observing that the minds of the merchants clung to their ships, he sent forward heralds, and fixed with Vastup\u0101la a day for the battle. While the army, consisting of four arms, was being made ready for battle, Vastup\u0101la put forward a brave warrior named L\u016bnap\u0101la, of the family of Gu\u1e0da,\\(^7\\) and he selected his opponent\\(^8\\) in these words, \"If I strike any one but \u00c7\u0101jkha, I undertake to strike also the cow Kapil\u0101,\" and exclaimed, \"Where is \u00c7\u0101jkha?\" Thereupon a soldier in the enemies' ranks answered, \"I am \u00c7\u0101jkha.\" So he struck him down,\\(^9\\) and after him another in the very same way. He exclaimed, \"What! are there so many \u00c7\u0101jkhas\\(^10\\) because we are near to the sea?\" and was then challenged by the great champion \u00c7\u0101jkha himself, who praised his prowess.

Stambhat\u012brtha is Cambay, Bhrgupura probably Baroach.\n\\(^5\\) But a and \u03b2 have b\u0101lak\u0101lar\u016bpam. P gives t\u0101lar\u016bpam \u0101ntav\u0101n k\u0101la. Probably the author means to say that \u00c7\u0101jkha was a younger god of death, a little less terrible than Yama himself.\n\\(^6\\) I read dattaniv\u0101so with P and a.\n\\(^7\\) He is called Bhuvanap\u0101la of the family of Gula by Some\u00e7vara. (Kirtikaumudi, V. 58.) P has Bhavanap\u0101la; a, Bh\u016bnap\u0101la.\n\\(^8\\) P has v\u0101ravara\u1e47ik\u0101; a, v\u012bravara\u1e47ik\u0101; \u03b2, v\u012bravarnik\u0101. My translation is conjectural.\n\\(^9\\) P adds gh\u0101tena.\n\\(^10\\) \u00c7\u0101jkha means shell. One is reminded of Douglas and Henry IV.\nspear, he and his horse were killed by him with one blow. After that, Vastup\u0101la clung to the field of battle, and, like \\(^1\\) a lion's whelp, routed the army of \u010c\u0101kka like a herd of elephants, and they fled in every direction. Thereupon the merchant named Sa\u012bda was killed. Subsequently, the minister caused the temple of L\u016bnap\u0101le\u00e7vara to be built on the spot where L\u016bnap\u0101la was slain.\n\nNow, once on a time, the poet Some\u00e7vara wrote the following stanza:\n\nYour lake, O minister, full of sporting waves,\\(^2\\) and moving Brahmany ducks,\nGleams with swans that have taken up your praises, and eddies to which swaying lotuses have given their hues,\nWith waters deep within, and fish fallen into the swallow of the tribes of restless herons,\nAnd with songs\\(^3\\) uttered by women reposing at ease beneath the row of trees growing on its bank.\n\nThe minister gave a gift of sixteen thousand drammas as a compliment to the poet. One day, Some\u00e7varadeva arrived when the minister was troubled by anxious thoughts, and looking down on the ground, and recited the following verse appropriate to the occasion:\n\nI know why you look at this surface of the earth, with head bowed down with modesty,\nBecause you have heard the common saying of the good that you are the only benefactor of the world;\nThe fact is, Vastup\u0101la, you ornament on the lotus-face of the goddess of speech, you are yourself\nLooking over and over again for a way by which, in accordance with your wish, you may bring up Bali\\(^4\\) from Hades.\n\nThe minister gave eight thousand by way of reward for this stanza.\n\nMoreover, these three learned quarters of a couplet were being read:\n\nKarna gave his skin, \u0106ibi his flesh, Jim\u016btav\u0101hana his life;\nDadh\u012bci gave his bones;\n\nThen the pandit Jayadeva supplied this as a fourth quarter to complete the couplet:\n\nbut Vastup\u0101la gave wealth.\n\nUttering this, he received four thousand.\n\n\\(^1\\) Ca here means \"like.\" This use has been pointed out by Professor Aufrecht.\n\\(^2\\) Prakridad\u0101tis', the reading of B, gives a good sense, as \u0101ti is a water-bird.\n\\(^3\\) Cp. \u1fe5\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03bb\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9. (Sophocles, O.T. 186.)\n\\(^4\\) When Vi\u1e63\u1e47u deprived Bali of heaven and earth, he left him P\u0101t\u0101la or the lower regions in consideration of his virtues. His golden age is still proverbial in India.\nMoreover, when a distribution to the church was being made for the benefit of the Jaina doctors,\u00b9 a certain poor Brahman received, on begging for it, a coverlet from Vastup\u0101la's officers out of compassion; he then addressed this appropriate couplet to the minister:\n\nIn one place cotton, in another place thread, here and there a cotton seed,\nPrince, my coverlet is like the huts of the wives of your enemies.\n\nBy way of reward for this verse, the minister gave him fifteen thousand. Likewise a pandit, named B\u0101lacandra, said to the minister,\n\nGaur\u012b is in love with you, the bull feels respect for you, you are linked with good fortune,\nYou have shining virtues and a troop of prosperities, why, indeed, do we say much!\nLord of ministers, as you are gifted with the accomplishments of \u0106iva, it certainly becomes you\nLong to lift aloft the young moon; who except you possesses the power?\u00b2\n\nWhen he said this, the minister spent a thousand dramas on his appointment to the post of teacher.\n\nOnce on a time \u0100lima, the spiritual guide of Suratr\u0101\u1e47a,\u00b3 the king of the Mleechas, came here in order to go to the holy place Mecca, and Lavana-pras\u0101da and Viradhavala, hearing of his arrival, were eager to capture him, and asked the advice of the minister Tejahp\u0101la. He gave them this answer\u2014\n\nThat success, which kings obtain by employing a hypocritical disguise of virtue,\nIs tantamount to acquiring wealth by selling the body of one's mother.\n\nBy this advice drawn from moral treatises, he delivered \u0100lima from those two, as a goat from a couple of wolves, and after helping him with journey-money and other requisites, he sent him off to that holy place; and he returned after some years, and was again helped by the minister with clothes suitable for him, and other things; and when he reached his home, he forgot the merits of the holy place, and described Vastup\u0101la's only\n\n\u00b9 The words \u015b\u016br\u012br\u0101\u1e41 darpanapratil\u0101bhand\u0101vasare are omitted in \u03b1 and \u03b2. They seem to me to be a gloss.\n\u00b2 The minister is compared to Iqvara, the lord, i.e. \u0106iva. Gaur\u012b is \u0106iva's wife; the bull is his vehicle; \"good fortune\" also means \"ashes\"; in the word \"troop\" there is an allusion to the Ga\u1e47as of \u0106iva; B\u0101lacandra means \"young moon\"; and \u0106iva wears a crescent moon round his central eye.\n\u00b3 It is clear that Alima represents the Urdu (or Arabic) '\u0101lim and Suratr\u0101\u1e47a means Sultan.\nto Suratr\u0101\u1e47a. That Suratr\u0101\u1e47a immediately wrote to Vastup\u0101la in these terms, \"You are ruler in my kingdom, and I am only your javelin-bearer, so you must always favour me with orders directing me what to do.\" As the great minister was every year solicited in this way by a friendly letter sent by Suratr\u0101\u1e47a, he, with the permission of that monarch, who thought himself fortunate in being able to oblige the minister, brought with infinite trouble from the quarry named Mamm\u0101\u1e47a, which was in his country, a statue of R\u1e63abha fit for a building within the circuit of \u010catru\u00f1jaya. Even when this was being set up, owing to the wrath of M\u016blan\u0101yaka, the mountain was struck by lightning. After that the god never granted an interview to the great minister, as long as he lived.\n\nOn a certain parvan, the lady Anupam\u0101 was making at will an unequalled distribution of food to the hermits, and at that moment Viradhavala came, being anxious about his affairs, and seeing the entrance crowded with members of the \u0106vet\u0101mbara sect of Jainas, his mind was filled with astonishment and he said to the minister, \"Minister, why are these not always thus feasted like a favourite deity? If you are not rich enough to do it, let me bear half the expense. Or let it be all given out of my property always.\" The minister said, \"I do not tell you because it would be troubling you without cause.\" When he had by these words proceeding from his moon-like mouth, cooled the flame of his patron's anger, he said, \"What a little matter for my master is half the expense! Let all be borne by you.\" When he had said this, he blessed the cloth.\n\nOn another occasion, when a distribution of food was being made to the Jaina hermits, and the holy men were pushing and struggling with one another, as Anupama was bowing before them, a vessel of ghi, full of a great quantity of that kind of food, fell on her back, and the minister, Tejahp\u0101la, seeing that, was very angry, but she consoled him, saying, \"Owing to the favour of your master my body has been anointed with clarified butter, that has fallen from the holy vessel of the hermits.\" The minister, astonished at the completeness of her religious charity, gave her a present of five things, and praised her with this appropriate couplet,\n\n---\n\n1 This is probably the same mine that we find on page 219 of the text. I have therefore adopted from the reading Mumm\u0101\u1e47an\u0101my\u0101; P has Mumma\u1e47an\u0101my\u0101; B, Mumma\u1e47an\u0101my\u0101 (sic).\n\n2 R\u1e63abha is called M\u016blan\u0101yaka. The cause of his wrath is not apparent to me.\n\n3 This term includes the full and change of the moon, and the eighth and fourteenth of each half month.\n\n4 I read dar\u00e7enena with a and P.\n\n5 I suppose, the white garments of the \u0106vet\u0101mbaras.\n\n6 This makes it clear that Viradhavala had taken over the duty of providing for the Jaina hermits.\nCharity accompanied by kind speeches, knowledge without pride, valour\naccompanied by patience,\nAnd wealth accompanied by generosity, these four good things are difficult\nto obtain.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn this way she often satisfied the strictest standard \\(^2\\) of the grace of\ngenerosity. She was praised by the Jaina teachers with panegyrics like\nthe following:\n\nFortune is fickle, \u00c7iv\u0101 is wrathful, \u00c7aci is disgraced by having many\nrivals,\nGang\u0101 is always on the descent, Sarasvat\u012b is all made of words, therefore\nAnupam\u0101 is unequalled.\\(^3\\)\n\nThen, on another occasion, when Viradhavala and Lavanapras\u0101da were\npreparing for the battle at Pa\u00f1cagr\u0101ma, the wife of Viradhavala, queen\nJayataladev\u012b, came to her father \u00c7obhanadeva, in order to make peace. He\nsaid to her, \"Are you afraid of widowhood, that you try to patch up a\npeace?\" She, willing to extol her husband Viradhavala, who was the\nparagon of heroes, said, \"I say this again and again because I am afraid\nof the destruction of my father's family; for, when that Viradhavala is\nmounted on horseback, who is a warrior brave enough to abide him face to\nface?\" When she had said this, she went away in a rage. Then, in the\nfury of that conflict, Viradhavala, swooning with the pain of his wounds,\nadorned the surface of the earth,\n\nHo, of terrible might, who on the battle-field of Pa\u00f1cagr\u0101ma,\nFell, through the wounds which he received, from his horse, but not from\nhis valour.\n\nThereupon, the host of warriors on the field of battle were a little dis-\nconcerted, but Lavanapras\u0101da cheered up all his army, exclaiming, \"This\nis only one soldier down,\" and utterly defeated with absolute ease all his\nenemies. In this way the hero, splendid with the quality of courage, fell,\nthrough his ardent love of fighting, twenty-one times on the field, in front\nof his father. Then, when Viradhavala's life was approaching its termina-\ntion, Tejalp\u0101la, who was on his way to a holy place,\\(^4\\) in accordance with\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bohtlingk's Indische Spr\u00fcche, 2755. It is found in the Pra\u1e47ottararatnam\u0101l\u0101\nand the Hitopade\u015ba.\n\n\\(^2\\) Literally, \"reached the line on the touchstone of,\" &c. Our author seems to use\navad\u0101ta for avad\u0101na.\n\n\\(^3\\) The word \"Anupam\u0101\" means \"unequalled.\" Lak\u1e63mi or Fortune is the wife\nof Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, \u00c7iv\u0101 of \u00c7iva, \u00c7aci of Indra: Sarasvat\u012b or V\u0101\u1e47i (which is used here) is\nthe goddess of speech.\n\n\\(^4\\) But P and a have prasthitasya, which would imply that Viradhavala was on his\nway to a holy place.\nthe proverb that what is given once is received back a hundred times, gave him the merits of his last birth. Afterwards, when that prince died, owing to his excessive popularity, 120 followers elected to burn themselves with his corpse. After that, Tejahp\u0101la set guards on the cemetery and prevented that eager desire of the people.\n\nOther seasons come and go in succession,\nBut these two seasons have become perpetual,\nNow that men are deprived of the hero Vi\u1e47adhavala,\nThe rainy season in their two eyes, and in their heart the hot season of anguish.\n\nThen the minister anointed, as king, Visaladeva, the son of Vi\u1e47adhavala. Anupam\u0101dev\u012b having died, the knot of grief swelled up in Tejahp\u0101la, and could not be removed. Then the Jaina doctor Jayasena, a mighty man, came there and assuaged his sorrow, and Tejahp\u0101la, when having partially recovered his self-command, he was a little ashamed of himself, was thus addressed by the doctor, \"We have come on this particular occasion to behold your hypocrisy.\" Vastup\u0101la asked the reverend teacher what this meant. He said, \"When Tejahp\u0101la was a boy, I asked for him from Dharaniga the hand of the maiden Anupam\u0101 in marriage, and the arrangement was then concluded. Afterwards he heard of the excessive plainness of that maiden, and in order to break off the engagement, he gave to the lord of the region, established by the Jina Candraprabha,\u00b2 by way of an offering, an income of eight dramm\u0101s. Now he is despondent on account of the knot of separation from her; of these two states which is genuine?\" When Tejahp\u0101la was thus reminded of the original state of affairs, he steeled his heart.\n\nThen, on another occasion, when an assembly\u00b3 was being held, the domestic chaplain Some\u015bvara\u1e47adeva, thinking that the minister Vastup\u0101la, being of an advanced age, was desirous of proceeding to \u010catur\u00f1\u0101ya, came there, and though seats of surpassing dignity were vacated for him, he would not sit down, and when asked the reason, he said this,\u2014 \"Vastup\u0101la has obstructed the earth with doles of food and drinking-fountains,\u2074 And religious foundations, and with his glory the circle of the sky.\n\n\u00b9 This reminds us of the devotion of Otho's followers. (Tacitus, Hist. II. 49.)\n\u00b2 All the three MSS. that I have seen read \"bhid\u0101\" for \"Jina\". I think it is the Hindi bhid\u0101, enclosure. K\u1e63etr\u0101dh\u012bpati probably means genius loci.\n\u00b3 I think that avasara here means a dar\u015ban.\n\u2074 More literally, \"drinkings of water.\" Probably, \"dole of food\" means buildings where food was distributed.\nTherefore I cannot sit down, because there is no room left.\" The minister gave him a complimentary gift in return for this speech of his, and took leave of him and set out on his journey. In the village of \u0100kev\u0101liya, in a country hovel, he sat down on a bed of darbha-grass, and his spiritual adviser made him make confession of the faith, and so he abstained from all food, and having by his final act of faith washed away the pollution of the Kali age, he repeated the name of the Tirtha\u1e45kara R\u1e63abha with this couplet,\u2014\nI have done no good action worthy of being commemorated by the virtuous,\nMy only substantial merit has been aspiration; in this way my life has passed.\n\nWhen he had ended this speech, he said, \"Reverence to the Arhats!\" and, with these syllables on his lips, he abandoned\u00b9 his body composed of seven constituent elements, and adorned the heavenly world, in order to taste the fruit of his actions. In the place where he was burnt, the victorious lions, the two sons of his younger brother Teja\u1e25p\u0101la, built the temple of the ascent to heaven, adorned with a statue of the Tirtha\u1e45kara R\u1e63abha, when consecrated for the vows.\n\nTo-day my father's hope has borne fruit,\nThe tip of the branch of my mother's blessing has budded to-day,\nIn that unweariedly I gratify\nAll the people that make pilgrimage to the shrine of R\u1e63abha.\nThose men who do not extract merit from the sinfulness of kings' affairs,\nThose men, I say, I consider to be much lower even than the washers of dust.\n\nThe above stanzas and many others are the actual composition of the great poet Vastup\u0101la.\n\nThat Viradhavala, full of kingly qualities, was a monarch of measureless might;\nThe poet Vastup\u0101la had the title of Bhojar\u0101ja bestowed on him by learned men,\nAnd Teja\u1e25p\u0101la was a chief of ministers, matchless among crowds of counsellors;\nHis wife Anupam\u0101, unequalled in good qualities, was an incarnate goddess of Fortune.\n\nHere ends the fourth chapter in the Prabandhacint\u0101ma\u1e47i published by\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps it is necessary to read parihrta\u1e41. I have given what I suppose to be the sense.\nthe teacher Merutunga, called the description of the glory of the mighty men, the august Kum\u0101rap\u0101la, and those paragons of ministers, Vastup\u0101la and Tejahp\u0101la.\n\nFIFTH CHAPTER.\n\nNow I begin to describe in the ensuing miscellaneous chapter those actions of the great men previously spoken of, which remain over and above their deeds already related, and others in addition to those.\n\nThey are as follows:\n\nOf old there was in the city of Avanti, near which flashes the stream of \u00c7\u012bpr\u0101, a king named Vikram\u0101rka. He heard that the people from other realms, whom he entertained in his guest-house, after they had taken their meal, fell asleep, and slept the long sleep of death. His mind was full of astonishment on that account, and being determined to investigate the matter, he caused the bodies of all of them to be covered with cloths, and by his royal order provided that the occurrence should be kept quiet. He feasted some other travellers that arrived, exactly like their predecessors, and in the evening he brought warm water and oil to tend their feet, and as they dropped off to sleep, one by one, in the depth of the night, the king himself remained concealed, sword in hand. While he was waiting, he suddenly saw in a spot in the corner of the room, first smoke curling up, then a sheet of flame, then the serpent \u00c7esha emerging, adorned with a thousand hoods, and having his hoods decked with glittering hood-gems. While the king, astonished at that wonderful sight, was looking on with curiosity, that prince of hooded snakes asked all the travellers that had gone to sleep in the course of that day, one by one, \"What vessel?\" Then they answered, \"The vessel of justice,\" \"The vessel of virtue,\" \"The vessel of asceticism,\" \"The vessel of beauty,\" \"The vessel of love,\" \"The vessel of glory,\" and so on, and were all, on account of their ignorance, cursed at will by that serpent, and made to taste of death. When Vikrama saw that take place, he came in front of him, and putting his hands together in a suppliant attitude, said,\n\nLord of snakes, there may be various kinds of vessels on the earth, owing to associations with various qualities,\nBut the vessel of the mind is pre-eminent, if pure and cleansed by faith.\n\n1 i.q. Vikram\u0101ditya.\n2 I read n\u012bj\u00f1\u0101y\u0101 with \u03b1 and \u03b2.\n3 The reading of the text is not satisfactory. I prefer the reading of \u03b1 and \u03b2, pha\u015b\u0101ra\u1e47aprabh\u0101la\u1e45k\u1e5btam sahasra\u1e45kha\u1e47am n\u0101gam, the serpent \u00c7esha (or the thousand-hooded one), adorned with the splendour of glittering hood-gems.\n4 But P has p\u016bd\u0101ha\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ddh\u0101pavitr\u0101m, cleansed by pure faith.\nWhen Vikrama set forth \u00c7esha's very thoughts in these words, \u00c7esha being pleased with him, said, \"Choose a boon.\" Thereupon he craved by way of a boon that \u00c7esha would restore to life those dead travellers, and so pleased him very much.\n\nHere ends the account of the trying of Vikram\u0101ditya by the vessel test.\n\nThen, once on a time, in the city of P\u0101\u1e6dalipura,\u00b9 king Nanda, who was a source of great joy, suddenly died, and a certain Brahman came there at that time, and by the art of entering alien bodies, contrived to animate the king's corpse. A second Brahman, in accordance with an understanding that he had with him, came to the king's door and began the recitation\u00b2 of the Veda. The reanimated king\u00b3 made the superintendents of the treasury give him a crore of gold pieces. Then the prime minister, hearing of that circumstance, said, \"Formerly Nanda used to be parsimonious, but now he displays generosity;\" so he arrested that Brahman, and made search everywhere for a foreigner that knew the art of entering another body, and hearing that a corpse was being guarded somewhere by a certain person, he reduced the corpse to ashes, by placing it on the funeral pyre, and so by the unequalled vigour of his intellect he managed to carry on Nanda\u2074 as monarch in his\u2075 mighty kingdom as before.\n\nHere ends the story of Nanda.\n\nThen, in the great town of Kheda, the daughter of the Brahman Dev\u0101ditya, an excellent woman, named Subhag\u0101, who had become a widow in her childhood, and was exceedingly beautiful, was in the early morning throwing a handful of rice towards the sun, when suddenly, without being aware of it, she became pregnant by him. Her parents, finding out somehow or other that unbecoming state of affairs, told her that shame required that it should be concealed, and made their servants leave her in the neighbourhood of the city of Valabhi. She gave birth to a son there, and he, in course of time, grew big, and being taunted by the boys of his own age with having no father, he went to his mother to ask who his father was. She answered, \"I do not know.\"\u2076 When she gave him this answer, he was on the point of committing suicide on account of his despair about that origin of his; but the sun appeared to him, and consoled him, and placed some pebbles in his hand, and informed him that he was the sun who had married his mother, and went on to say, \"Any one of these pebbles hurled at a man that insults you will become a rock.\"\n\n\u00b9 I find in a, P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, but P and \u03b2 support the printed text.\n\u00b2 In a there is a stop after ud\u0101haran. Perhaps it should be ud\u0101harat.\n\u00b3 P, a and \u03b2 omit sa.\n\u2074 He is sometimes called Yogananda. The whole story will be found in my translation of the Kath\u0101 Sarit S\u0101gara, p. 21 and ff.\n\u2075 Niyo should be niye, as is evident from a and \u03b2.\n\u2076 Cp. my translation of the Kath\u0101 Sarit S\u0101gara, Vol. II. p. 622.\nThen he gave him this warning, \"If one is thrown at any innocent man, it will be the cause of calamity to you\"; and with these words on his lips, he disappeared. Accordingly the boy killed in this very way some persons that insulted him, and so came to be known by the significant name of \u00c7il\u00e4ditya. The king of that town did so in order to test his power, and he put that monarch to death with a rock so produced, and became himself king in his place. In the same way he obtained a horse by the favour of the sun, and roaming about on this at pleasure, like a Vidy\u0101dhara that can fly through the air, he conquered by his valour the circle of the quarters, and ruled for a long time. By association with a Jaina hermit there was produced in him the jewel of right belief, and having learnt the infinite greatness of the very holy place \u00c7atru\u00f1jaya, he restored the dilapidated shrines on it. Once on a time a public disputation took place between the Buddhists and the \u00c7vet\u0101mbaras, and \u00c7il\u00e4ditya was made president of the court, and this condition was agreed upon, that whichever party should be vanquished in argument before a full court, should be banished from the country. The \u00c7vet\u0101mbaras were vanquished, and accordingly the Buddhists drove them all away from their country, but they overlooked the fact that a boy, named Malla, sister's son to king \u00c7il\u00e4ditya, who was of measureless excellence, remained there. They, for their part, thinking themselves victorious, worshipped R\u0101bha the M\u016blan\u0101yaka, as Buddha on the holy Vim\u0101la mountain; but while they remained there triumphant, Malla, owing to his having been born in the warrior caste, never forgot his enmity, but being anxious to revenge the injury, remained studying with them, because he could not obtain teachers of the Jaina faith, and day and night his mind was fixed on that one object. During the days of terrible heat, once on a time at night, when the eyes of all the citizens were closed in sleep, he was calling to mind with great application the treatise he had studied during the day, and at that moment Sarasvat\u012b, who was roaming in the sky, asked him this question, \"What things are sweet?\" He looked round and saw no one from whom the voice could have proceeded, but he gave her this answer, \"Grains of wheat.\" Again, after the lapse of six months, the goddess of speech returned at the very same time, and once more questioned him saying, \"With what?\" He then remembered his\n\n1 This seems to be the meaning.

The agreement mentioned above was repeated, and in a court presided over by the king, Malla, by the help of Sarasvat\u012b, who descended into his throat, quickly reduced the Buddhists to silence. Then by the order of the king, the Buddhists were banished\\(^3\\) from the country, and the Jaina teachers were summoned, and Malla, having conquered the Buddhists, was considered a great disputant by his co-religionists. Subsequently, at the request of the king, his teacher, by way of reward, gave him the title of doctor.\\(^4\\) Then the honourable doctor and disputant, Malla, being head of a Ga\u1e47a, was, on account of his being a distinguished propagator of the faith, and in order that he might be still more exalted, appointed by the congregation to superintend the holy place of Stambhanaka,\\(^5\\) which was discovered by the doctor Abhayadeva, who made the commentary on the nine \u0100\u1e45gas.\n\nHere ends the story of the disputant Malla.\n\nThen, in the kingdom of Maru,\\(^6\\) in a country village,\\(^7\\) there lived two brothers, K\u0101k\u016b and P\u0101t\u0101ka. The younger of these was rich, but the elder maintained himself by doing work as his brother's domestic servant. On a certain night in the rainy season, K\u0101k\u016b was sleeping, exhausted with his day's work, when he was thus addressed by his younger brother, \"Brother, the dams in my fields have been broken through by the inundation, but you do not trouble your head about it.\" When he was reproached in these words, he immediately left his bed, and blaming himself, put a mattock on his shoulder and went to the place. But, when he reached it, he found some labourers engaged in repairing the dams that had burst. When he saw them he said, \"Who are you?\" They replied, \"We are your brother's well-wishers.\" He asked them, \"Have I well-wishers anywhere?\" They answered, \"Your well-wishers are in Valabhi.\" Then, on\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A Nayacakra is mentioned by Professor Leumann in his list of the Strassburg collection of Digambara MSS.\n\n\\(^2\\) I read with a, \"\u0101vagatatattva\u1e25.\"\n\n\\(^3\\) I find in a, id\u0101t\u012bsu.

On account of his extreme leanness he was called by them Rajka. He made a hut of grass, and remained protected by that. In the meanwhile a certain pilgrim, in accordance with the prescriptions of a book of rules, brought a liquid elixir from the Raivataka mountain in a gourd, and as he was performing the journey, he heard a bodiless voice in the air, \"The gourd to K\u0101k\u016b!\" His mind was full of astonishment and he was terrified, so he deposited the gourd of liquid elixir in the house of that disguised merchant, feeling quite at ease in his mind because his name was Rajka. He himself went on a pilgrimage to Some\u00e7vara. On a certain festival day Rajka was placing a saucepan on the stove to cook a special dish, when he saw that, owing to a drop of the elixir falling upon it from a hole in the gourd, the saucepan had turned to gold. That merchant made up his mind that it was the elixir of the alchemist, and he immediately transferred all his furniture with that gourd to another place, and with a candle reduced his hut to ashes, and built a palace near another gate. While he was living there, he was himself weighing the gh\u012b of a woman, who was selling a great deal of that article, when he found that it was inexhaustible. He discovered that there was underneath the vessel of gh\u012b an astrological diagram with black signs on it, so he managed to steal it, by substituting something else for it by trickery of some kind, and so made himself a master of the magical picture.\n\nOnce on a time, also, owing to the incalculable power of his good luck derived from good works in a former life, he obtained the magical image of the golden man. In this way, by his three-fold magical power he acquired riches that might be said to be measured by crores; nevertheless, being the prince of misers, he never spent money on a worthy object, or a holy place, or an act of mercy. Far from it; on the contrary, owing to his desire to get the whole world into his clutches, he made that good fortune of his assume the form of a demon of destruction to the whole\n\n1 Cp. the phrase dhitt\u0101 dv\u0101rav\u0101sin\u014d, quoted by Fick in his Sociale Gliederung (p. 196) from the fifth volume of the J\u0101takas, with Fick's remarks.\n2 i.e. beggar.\n3 According to some MSS. the voice proceeded from the elixir.\n4 I find sa inserted before chadmano in a and B, but chadmino would, I suppose, give a good sense.\n5 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-citraka-kusadalik\u0101\u1e41. I find that in Gujar\u0101ti the word kund\u0101l\u012b means a figure divided into square, triangular, or circular spaces, drawn to exhibit the position of the sun, planets and constellations.\n6 The circumstance of Rajka's obtaining a golden man is told by Alberuni (Sachan's translation, Vol. I. p. 192). Rajka, according to this version of the story, was a fruitseller. He bought from a peasant a man turned into gold by the juice of a Lactaria from which blood flowed. According to this version, Rajka remained in his old house, but bought by degrees the whole town in which he lived.\n7 K\u0101lar\u0101trir\u016bp\u0101\u1e41. K\u0101lar\u0101tri is the night of destruction at the end of the world,\nuniverse. Then the king took away from Rajka's daughter by force a comb studded with jewels\\(^1\\) to give to his own daughter.\n\nTo gratify his spite against the king, Rajka went himself into the kingdom of the Mlechas, and gave the sovereign of that country as many crores of gold pieces as he asked for, in order that he might destroy Valabhi, and so induced him to march against the city. But a certain umbrella-bearer of the Mleccha king, whom he had omitted to fee, at the end of the night, when the king was half asleep and half awake, carried on the following conversation with a man with whom he had previously arranged matters, \"Is there no man with any sense in our king's council, that this great monarch of the land of A\u00e7vapati\\(^2\\) has undertaken this expedition against \u00c7il\u00e4ditya, the offspring of the sun, impelled thereto by a merchant whose family and character are unknown, whether he be good or bad, and who is a beggar both in name and actions?\" When the king heard the umbrella-bearer's wholesome and true speech, reflecting a little in his mind, he made a halt on that day. Then Rajka, who was apprehensive, having cleverly found out that circumstance, by giving that umbrella-bearer gold, satisfied his lust for gold, and so on the following morning at daybreak the umbrella-bearer said, \"Whether with due consideration or not, this great king has been set in motion,\\(^3\\) and has started on his expedition; on the principle of the lion's first step, he cuts a good figure on the march:\n\nWhether people call the lion lord of the deer, or enemy of the deer,\n\nIn either case he is ashamed, since with ease he tears elephants in pieces.\n\nSo who will dare to face this master of ours, whose might is boundless?\" The king of the Mlechas was filled with ardour by this speech of the umbrella-bearer, and continued his march, that deafened the hollow of the heaven with the roar of kettle-drums.

Forbes (R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, p. 13) has an admirable note. He quotes Virgil, Aeneid, II, 351-2, and tells us that \"the ancient nations had a habit of loading with chains the statues of their gods, when the state was menaced with danger, in order to prevent their flight. Among the Phoenicians, the god Melkarth was almost constantly chained.\" Fustel de Coulanges (Cit\u00e9 Antique, p. 179) translates from\nthem, flew through the air, and became the ornament of the region of \u00c7ivapattana; and the image of the glorious Vardham\u0101na, mounted on a chariot, by the power of the god that animated it, moved away unobserved on the full moon of the month \u0100\u00e7vina, and adorned the city of \u00c7rim\u0101la. Moreover, other eminent images of gods went away, and adorned appropriate places. And when the goddess of that city was describing the portents to the holy sage Vardham\u0101na, the following conversation took place,\u2014\nWho art thou, fair one? Tell me, thou that resemblest a goddess, why dost thou weep?\nReverend sir, I see clearly the overthrow of the city of Valabhi.\nWater, that is obtained by the saints in alms, will turn into blood,\nThe hermits must abide in that place in which that blood shall turn into water.\n\nWhile the portents described above were taking place, the Mleccha forces arrived in the neighbourhood of the city.\n\nRajka, who had defiled himself by bringing destruction on his country, had distributed in many places, by largesses of gold, players on five instruments, and when the king, on the arrival of the Mleccha forces, was about to mount that flying horse, they all played on their instruments at once; whereupon that horse soared aloft like Garu\u1e0da, and flew up into the heaven, and \u00c7il\u0101ditya, being utterly at a loss as to what course to pursue, was killed by the Mlechhas. After that, they sacked the town with ease.\n\nMacrobius the form of prayer used by the Romans to induce the gods of any city that they were besieging to abandon it.

Milton's line,\n\n\"The parting Genius is with sighing sent.\"\n\n1 I find bhara\u1e6d in P., a and B., and adopt it.\n2 All the three MSS. read pr\u0101ptesu. So there is a misprint in the text.\n3 The instruments are according to P\u0101thak (Indian Antiquary, Vol. XII. p. 96)\u2014the cryga, tamma\u1e6da, \u00e7a\u1e45kha, bh\u0113ri and jayagha\u1e47\u1e6da. According to Growse, Indian Antiquary, Vol. V. p. 354, they are the tantri or sit\u0101ra, the t\u0101l, the jh\u0101njh, the nak\u0101ra, and fifthly the trumpet, fife, or other wind instrument. I owe these references to Hofrath B\u00fchlcr. Below for prat\u012bcabda, \u03b2 has pa\u015bacabda, which may indicate the right reading pa\u015bacabada. I find, however, that B\u00fchlcr (H.C. p. 38) translates pa\u015bacabalesv\u0101todyesu by \"die auf f\u00fcnf T\u00f6ne gestimmten Trommeln.\"\n4 Alberuni tells us (Vol. I. pp. 192 and 193 of Sachau's translation) that king Vallabha of Vallabhi wished to buy from Rajka a town that the latter had purchased. Rajka declined, but afraid of the king's resentment, he fled to the lord of Alman\u1e63\u016bra, made him presents of money, and asked him to help him with a naval force. The lord of Alman\u1e63\u016bra complied with his desire and assisted him. So he made a night attack upon the king Vallabha, and killed him and all his people and destroyed his town.\nMiss Duff (Indian Chronology, p. 67) tells us that the Valabhi dynasty was probably overthrown about 766 A.D. by an expedition from Sindh under 'Amru Ibn Jamal.\nBut after the lapse of three hundred and seventy-five years,\nFrom that time of Vikrama, took place the destruction of Valabhi.\n\nHere end the three stories, one telling of the origin of \u010cil\u0101ditya, one of\nthe origin of Rajka, and the third of the destruction of Valabhi brought\nabout by him.\n\nThen, in the town of Ratnam\u0101l\u0101, there was a king of the name of\nRatna\u00e7ekhara. Once on a time, he was returning from an expedition in\nvarious directions, and on the festal occasion of his entry into the city, he\nwas examining the row of shops adorned in his honour, when in a certain\nmarket he saw a shovel with a wooden bucket. After he had entered his\npalace, a large number of people arrived, with presents in their hands.\nHe put this question to them, \"Are you happy?\" They answered, \"We\nare not happy.\" He was bewildered with astonishment, but he dismissed\nthem for the time, and subsequently, at a select reception, he called up\nthe principal men of the city, and said to them, \"Why are you not\nhappy?\" and he also pressed them to declare the reason why a wooden\nbucket was hung up with a shovel. They said, \"The master of the\nhouse, where your Majesty remarked a wooden bucket and so on,\" is a\npossessor of great wealth, and not knowing the numerical sum of his\nwealth, he measures it by wooden buckets, and in order to make this\nknown he has put up this sign. And as for our not being happy, this is\ndue to the fact that the king has no son. By whom will this city that is\nfull of a multitude of men who can put up the banner of a crore, and that\nhas for a long time been cherished by the king, be brought to complete\nprosperity, as your Majesty has no son? For this reason, considering\nin our minds that your consorts are barren from their advanced years, we wish\nto provide your Majesty with youthful wives.\" Accordingly, with the\nking's permission, they went on a Sunday, when the moon was in Pu\u1e63ya,\nto the omen-house, together with a certain distinguished augur. But the\naugur, seeing a certain poor woman, who was near her confinement, and\nwho lived only by carrying loads of wood, with an owl perched on her\nhead, worshipped her with whole grain and other things. They asked\nhim, \"What is the meaning of this?\" He answered, \"If the opinion of\nB\u1e5bhaspati is good for anything, the child, with which this woman is\npregnant, will be king in this town.\" Accepting this improbable occur-\n\n1 I suppose that nirjan\u0101vasara corresponds to the Hindustani div\u0101n-i-kh\u0101\u1e63\u1e63 or\ndarb\u0101r-i-kh\u0101\u1e63\u1e63.\n2 I follow a and \u03b2, which read k\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dhap\u0101\u1e6dry\u0101\u1e0dikam avad\u0101haritam.\n3 It is perhaps almost unnecessary to refer to the story of Ali Baba and the\nForty Thieves.\n4 Nid\u0101ya is probably a misprint, as P and a give nidhy\u0101ya, and \u03b2, nidadhy\u0101ya.\n5 This appears to be the meaning of the word Pu\u1e63y\u0101rka in Mar\u0101\u1e6dhi.\n6 Here the word durg\u0101 is again used.\nrence, they returned and told the haughty king the facts of the case, exactly as they stood. Then the king, having his mind filled with vexation, ordered her to be buried alive by some trustworthy men, and as they were beginning the work, they said, \"Remember your favourite deity.\" Thereupon she, bewildered with fear of death, obtained their permission to retire for a short time in the evening twilight, and unexpectedly brought forth a son. She left it there and came back, and then the men buried her alive, and returned and reported to the king what they had done. Then a certain hind suckled the child at the two twilights, and made him grow bigger every day. At that time the king Ratna\u00e7ekhara heard that in the mint before the great goddess of fortune, a new coin was being produced in the shape of a boy under the four feet of a hind, and as the news spread abroad that a new king had been born somewhere, he sent his forces in every direction to kill that boy. They searched hither and thither until they found him, but though they found him, they shrank from child-murder, so they placed him in the evening in the gate of the town, in order that he might be killed by the trappings of the hoofs of the herd of cows, and so might not bring reproach on them, and stood afar off. But when the herd of cows came there and saw that boy, looking like an accumulation of the merit of past births incarnate in bodily form, they stood still where they were, as if paralyzed. Then a bull, that was bringing up the rear, put itself in front of the herd, and placing that boy, resplendent as the god of love, between his feet, made the whole herd pass by. Then the king, having reflected on that occurrence, and having been petitioned by those officers and citizens, sent for that boy, and treating him as a son, brought him up, giving him the name of \u00c7riput\u00f1a. Then king Ratna\u00e7ekhara went to heaven, and \u00c7riput\u00f1a was anointed king, and while he was administering the affairs of the kingdom, a daughter was born to him, and she, though beautiful on account of the perfection of all her limbs and members, had the face of an ape. Through disgust at this, she became averse to worldly pleasures, and bore the name of the Reverend Mother. One day there arose in her recollection of her previous birth, and she related to her father her history in a former life. She said, \"I\n\n1 I read m\u0101nonnat\u0101ya with a, \u03b2 and P.\n2 P, a and \u03b2 omit tam. The two latter read pras\u016btam.

I follow P and \u03b2.\n5 Cp. Professor E. Hardy's paper entitled \"The story of the merchant Gho\u1e63aka,\" in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for October, 1898, pp. 768, 769.

The reading of the text means, \"And having been informed by the people of the town that the boy was unhurt among them.\"\n7 In allusion, no doubt, to the fact that he was an accumulation of merit.\nwas formerly living as the wife of a monkey on the Arbuda mountain,\u00b9 and as I was passing from one bough to another of a tree, my palate was cut through by the unparalleled skill of an archer,\u00b2 and I died. My body, slipping down, fell into the holy wishing-pool,\u00b3 which lay below the tree, and by the surpassing virtue of that holy water my body has assumed a human form, but because that head of mine still remains where it was, unchanged, I have the face of an ape.\" Then king \u010c\u0101pi\u1e47\u1e0da ordered his confidential servants to throw that head of hers into the pool. They saw the head, which had remained for a long time in that condition, and did as the king ordered, and then the Reverend Mother acquired a human face. Then she, whose virtues were a hundred millions in number,\u2075 took leave of her father and mother, and began to perform austerities on that Arbuda mountain. While so engaged, she was once on a time seen by a magician, who could fly through the air, and as his heart was transported by her beauty, he descended from the sky, and held loving conversation with her, and said to her, \"Why do you not choose me as your lover?\" She answered, \"The first watch of the night is now passed; if, before the cocks begin to crow in the fourth watch, you can contrive to have made by some magical power twelve roads on this mountain, then I will make you my beloved.\"\u2077 As soon as she had made this promise, the magician set a crowd of servants to work on that job, and in two watches he had managed to construct all the roads.\u2078 But the Reverend Mother by the plenitude of her power produced an artificial crowing of a cock; and when the magician came and said, \"Prepare for your wedding,\" she answered, \"While your road was making, a cock crew.\" He answered, \"Who does not know that the cock-crow was artificial, and produced by your delusive power?\" Accordingly his sister brought the wedding gifts to the bank of the river, and then the Reverend Mother invited him, saying, \"Leave here your trident which is the source of all your power, and be ready to take my hand in marriage.\" He, as love had robbed him of discernment,\u2079 did so,\n\n\u00b9 Mount Abu.\n\u00b2 More literally \"by some one by means of his unparalleled skill.\" For \u00e7ilpena (skill) B gives \u00e7alyena (arrow). For \u0101sada\u1e41 I read \u0101sadam with three MSS.\n\u00b3 Such a pool is mentioned in the Kath\u0101 Ko\u1e47a, p. 50, as turning apes into men. The same idea will be found on p. 26 of Professor Jacobi's Introduction to the Pari\u00e7\u0101\u1e6da Parvan, and in the Kath\u0101 Prak\u0101\u015ba, as appears from an analysis of that work lent me by Professor Eggeling.\n\u2074 I have inserted \"confidential,\" as I find \u0101yata in the three MSS. that I have examined.\n\u2075 In Sanskrit arbuda.\n\u2076 MSS. a and \u03b2 insert hrdya\u1e25, charming.\n\u2077 For the abhi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 of the text P and \u03b2 give abhikam and a adhikam. I think that abhikam is probably the right reading. The meaning given by B\u00f6htlingk is begierig, liebern.\n\u2078 It is, perhaps, unnecessary to draw attention to the performances of Michael Scott and other European wizards.\n\u2079 I read prem\u0101pah\u1e5bta with a, \u03b2 and P.\nand went near her, but she set at his feet dogs, which she created, and then she killed him by striking him with that trident in the heart.\\(^1\\) Thus she spent her life in displaying unbounded chastity. When that woman of faultless chastity passed away, the king \u0106ripu\u00f1ja had made there in her honour a temple without spires. For at the end of every six months the serpent, named Arbuda, that lives under that mountain, moves, and when he moves, the mountain trembles. Therefore all the temples on that mountain are without spires. Here ends the story of king \u0106ripu\u00f1ja and his daughter the Venerable Mother.\n\nOnce on a time there was a king Govardhana in the country of Cauda. He had in front of his council-house a gong of justice fastened to an iron pillar,\\(^2\\) which sounded when struck by a claimant who had justice on his side. The king had only one son, and once the prince, while driving in the road mounted on a chariot, killed by mistake a certain weaned calf. The cow, his mother, continually raining tears from her eyes, in order to revenge the outrage done to her, struck with the point of her horn the gong of justice and made it sound. The king, whose reputation was unblemished, heard the sound of that gong, and having thoroughly inquired into the case of that cow,\\(^3\\) in order to elevate his justice to the highest point, in the early morning himself sat\\(^4\\) in a chariot, and though he loved his son, he placed that only son in the road, and making the cow stand by as a witness, drove the chariot over him. Owing to the virtue of the king, and the exceeding power of the good fortune of that son of his, the wheel of the chariot was held up, and the prince was not killed.\n\nHere ends the story of king Govardhana.\n\nThen, in the city of K\u0101nti, an old king was long ago ruling without pride. Once he was riding on the king's circuit, accompanied by a dear friend of his, the prime minister named Matiss\u0101gara. The king was carried away by his horse, which had received an inverse training,\\(^5\\) and the body of forces of all four arms was gradually left at a long distance in the rear. Nevertheless, the minister, who was mounted on a very swift horse, followed him closely. But after they had got over a considerable stretch of ground, the king, who was very delicate, being exhausted with the fatigue of traversing such a long tract, died from fulness of blood. The minister performed the\n\n---\n\n1. Apparently the Reverend Mother set phantom dogs at his feet to distract his attention.\n2. A similar story is told of the Emperor Jah\u0101ngir in J. L.

In this way some time passed, and then the minister, being about to march against a rival king, accompanied by the whole army, appointed a certain leading man to wait on the king in the capacity of his substitute, and himself marched into the foreign country. Then that king, being free from restraint, like the husband of a docile and obedient wife, felt disposed to amuse himself at will, and immediately sent for all the potters of the city, and made horses, young elephants, bulls, camels, and so on, out of clay, and so played with those potters for a long time. Matters being in this state, the minister, hearing that the king was despised by all the courtiers, returned from that camp with a small retinue, and going to the king spoke as follows: \"You have now forgotten, owing to the fickleness of your disposition, that your real rank is that of an artisan, but if you do not observe some measure, I will banish you from the country, and make some other potter's son king.\" The king was made angry by that speech, and in a retired part of the council-house he exclaimed, \"Who waits?\" and immediately some painted soldiers, who had been made ready, rushed forth and threw that minister into chains. The minister, considering that great and improbable miracle, and being astonished in his mind at the manifestation of the power of that king, fell at his feet, and earnestly entreated him to have him set at liberty. The king ordered that to be done, and then the minister, full of ardent loyalty, said to him, \"I have only been the instrument in the bestowal of the kingdom upon you. Your deeds in a former life are the cause that painted figures obtain life from your power and obey your orders in this way. So you are rightly named Punyas\u0101ra.\"\n\nHere ends the story of Punyas\u0101ra.\n\nThen long ago in Kusumapura, a prince, named Nandivardhana, being desirous of seeing foreign countries, went off at pleasure with his umbrella-\n\n1 Probably this means that he burnt the king's body.\n2 I read sim\u0101la with P; a and B.\n3 I read va\u00e7y\u0101 with P; a agrees with the text; B has va\u00e7\u0101.

There the king had died without leaving a son, and the royal elephant, having been duly inaugurated by the ministers, roamed about at will in the whole city.\\(^1\\) He forgot like a bad dream the prince who had arrived there, though near to him, but he sprinkled that umbrella-bearer. So the umbrella-bearer was made by the ministers to enter the city in great triumph as king,\\(^2\\) and he took with him the prince also, making him share that great reception, and so passed on to the palace. When the prince had entered the palace, he conciliated him with these complimentary words, \"I am only the master of the courtiers, but you are my master.\" But that king was unworthy to be a receptacle of the kingly virtues, and infinitely foolish, and did not know how to cherish the castes and stages of life. The more he was addicted to oppressing the subjects, in administering his kingdom, the thinner did the prince become every day, like the moon, when seized by the head of R\u0101hu. On a certain occasion the king saw the prince in that state and asked him the cause of his leanness. The prince answered, \"You oppress the subjects out of stupidity, and it is owing to that improper conduct of yours that I suffer from excessive leanness. I have proved the truth of the g\u0101th\u0101,\u2014\n\nI dwell in the midst of dolts; the double-tongued ones are intent on listening to their lord;\nThat I live at all is so much to the good; why should you wonder at my leanness?\"\n\nImmediately after he had said this, the king answered, \"As, owing to the fact that the demerit of these subjects who delight in wickedness had come to an head, the destined time of their chastisement had arrived, I was made king; if the governor of the world had intended that they should be cherished, the royal elephant would have sprinkled you and made you sovereign.\" The malady of that prince was checked by the king's speech, and its sound argument, as if by two medicines, and he regained stoutness of body.\n\nHere ends the story of Karmas\u0101ra.\\(^3\\)\n\nThen, in the country of Gau\u1e0da, in the city of Lak\u1e63an\u0101vati, a king of the name of Lak\u1e63manasena ruled for a long time, and his kingdom was administered by the minister Um\u0101patidhara,\\(^4\\) who was a treasure-house of all intelligence.

Other impure things become pure by touching you;  \nAnd what further cause for commendation of you is there?

You are the lord of all the worlds. What are we to say?\\(^4\\)  \nIf he boasts that he cut off the head of Brahm\u0101, if he has friendship with ghosts,  \nIf intoxicated he sports with the Mothers, if he delights in the burning-ground,  \nIf he creates and then destroys creatures, nevertheless devoutly concentrating my mind  \nI adore him. What am I to do? The three worlds are empty: he indeed is lord.  \nIn this great time of nightfall you are the only king, then why, O kumuda,\\(^5\\)  \nDo you not shed abroad your splendour, eclipsing the fortune of the lotuses?  \nThat Brahm\u0101 reposes on the lotus and that it is honoured in the ranks of flowers,  \nWho are you that you should prevent that?

Then, once on a time, that king, having returned from his royal circuit, saw that minister in a pitiable condition, alone, and at a loss for resources, and in his rage he made the elephant-driver drive the elephant at him to kill him. But he said to the elephant-driver, \"Restrain the elephant from its rush, until I have said something to the king.\" The elephant-driver complied with his request, and then Um\u0101patidhara said,\u2014\nHe stands naked with his body grey with dust, he mounts on the back of a cow;\nHe sports with snakes; he dances, bearing aloft the blood-dripping skin of an elephant;\nWe fix our love\\footnote{For santo \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) give satyam and \\(P\\) sa\u1e41tya.

Once on a time, the wife of a head of a family who was a citizen of that town, a lady named Suhava, surpassing in beauty the females of the three worlds, had been playing in the water in the season of terrible heat, and was standing on the bank of the river of the gods. That wagtail-eyed one saw a wagtail sitting on the crest of a snake, and thinking that omen a most incomprehensible one, she fell at the feet of a certain Brahman, who had come to bathe, and asked him for an explanation of it. That man learned in omens said to her, \"If you will always observe my command, I will tell you the explanation of it.\" She said, \"That command shall be reverenced by me as if it were the command of a father; I will always carry it on my head.\" When she promised this, he said to her, \"On the seventh day from this you will become the head wife of this king.\" Thereupon they both returned home.\n\nThen, on the day fixed by that Brahman learned in omens, that king, on returning from his royal circuit, saw in a certain street that young wife of a householder, whose body, though she was unadorned, was sanctified by infinite beauty, and accepting her as the thief of all the wealth of his heart, he made her his head wife. Subsequently, she, out of gratitude, remembered her promise to the Brahman, and after she had told the king of that augury of Vidy\u0101dhara, that Vidy\u0101dhara was summoned by beat of drum, and the king, seeing that seven hundred men named Vidy\u0101dhara arrived, separated that one after he had been recognized, and duly honoured and dismissed the others, and then he said to Vidy\u0101dhara, who was distressed with adversity, \"Ask what you like.\" He was delighted with the king's command, and said, \"Let me always attend on your royal person.\" The king consented, saying, \"So be it!\" and afterwards, observing his boundless cleverness, he made him bear the chief burden in all the business of the state. So he gradually accumulated wealth, and every day he had made for the thirty-two ladies of his harem ornaments perfumed with abundance of genuine camphor, and had the old ones flung into the rubbish-hole, as if they were flowers offered to a deity, and like a visible incarnation of some god, he continued to taste heavenly enjoyments; but he never tasted food himself, until he had given to eighteen thousand Brahmans the food that they desired. Then, once on a time, though possessing fourteen sciences, he was sent by the king to make war\n\n1 This means, I suppose, that his army extended from one river to the other.\n2 i.e., G\u0101ng\u0101 or Ganges.\n3 The text is supported by the MSS., but the grammar seems to be defective. According to Var\u0101ha Mihira XLV. 4 (Kern's translation), a wagtail is fortunate when seen on the head of a snake.\n4 I find in a pit\u1e5bnirv\u012bc\u0113sasya m\u0101ny\u0101m\u0101j\u00f1\u0101\u1e41 sadaiva n\u0101r\u0101dhna vah\u0101mi. This is probably right, as P agrees, except that it gives erroneously \u0101j\u00f1\u0101.\n5 Here she is called c\u0101l\u0101pativ\u0101l\u0101.

Then he conquered the enemy that opposed him, and returned in triumph, and when he reached the environs of his own city, he heard that the king was angry, because he had burnt the pieces of fine cloth in order to procure food.\\(^1\\) So he caused his own house to be plundered by petitioners, and went off with the desire of worshipping holy places. The king followed him up and tried to conciliate him, but he through high spirit pointed out that his desire\\(^2\\) was due to the king's disposition, and with great difficulty managed to take leave of him, and brought his life to a conclusion. Immediately after that, the queen Suhava asked the king to bestow the office of crown prince on her son, but he admonished her, saying, \"It is not fitting to bestow the sceptre of our race on the son of an unchaste woman.\" So being desirous of killing her husband, she summoned the Mleechas.\n\nThen the king heard of that circumstance by a report that came from his representatives,\\(^3\\) so he respectfully asked a certain Digambara, who had won the favour of a boon from Padm\u0101vati, for an augury, and he informed the king that the goddess Padm\u0101vati had certainly issued an order forbidding the approach of the Mleechas. Then the king, hearing after some days that the Mleechas were drawing nigh, asked the Digambara, \"What is the meaning of this?\" So the Digambara that very night began a sacrifice before Padm\u0101vati in the presence of the king. Then Padm\u0101vati, brought there by his perfect power of attracting spirits, appeared within the garland of flame in the sacrificial pit, and said that she had forbidden the approach of the Turu\u1e63kas. Then the naked mendicant, in a fit of rage, seized the goddess by the ears, and said, \"As the Mleechas are approaching, do you, even you, say what is false?\"\\(^4\\) When he reproached her in these words, she said, \"That Padm\u0101vati, whom you question so devoutly, has fled from the might of my prowess; while I, being the family deity of the Mleechas, encourage people with false speeches, and by means of the Mleechas rob them of breath.\"\\(^5\\) When she had said this, she disappeared. The next morning the king found out by actual deeds\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pisayaka is given in the smaller B\u00f6htlingk as Oelkuchen, but here it must mean food generally.\n\n\\(^2\\) But P, a and B give \u1e5bpater \u1e0dcay\u0101m svabhil\u0101\u1e63asambhavena.\n\n\\(^3\\) Sth\u0101napurusa\u1e47am.\n\n\\(^4\\) P, a and B read br\u0101se.

Are you saying what is false?\"\n\n\\(^5\\) P reads vigata\u00e7\u016b\u1e63am; but the reading of the text, which is that of a and B, must probably be taken in this sense.\nthat Benares was surrounded by the army of the Mleechas, for the twanging of their bows drowned the sound of fourteen hundred pairs of kettle-drums, and as his mind was bewildered by the mighty host of the Mleechas, he placed that son of queen Suhava on his own elephant, and plunged, elephant and all, into the waters of the Ganges.\n\nHere ends the story of Jayacandra.\n\nThen a K\u1e63atriya, named Jagaddeva, who was the most eminent of heroes in three ways, though honoured by the emperor Siddha, was earnestly invited by the glorious king Paramardin the crusher of his enemies, who was enslaved by the charm of Jagaddeva's merits, and so he went to the country of Kuntala, which may be called the braided hair-knot of the matron Earth. When the doorkeeper announced his arrival to Paramardin, it happened that a low woman was dancing in his court, unclothed save for a flowered petticoat, and at that moment she was seized with shame, and, snatching up her upper garment, sat down where she was. Then the king's doorkeeper introduced Jagaddeva, and the king, after showing him respect, and honouring him with friendly conversation and so on, gave him a piece of fine dukula-stuff as a splendid covering, together with an incomparably magnificent piece of cloth, the value of which amounted to a lakh. When Jagaddeva had sat down on a distinguished seat, and the temporary disturbance in the court had ceased, the king ordered the low dancer to resume her dance. Then she, being renowned for making a show of propriety, and unequalled in wily cleverness, said, \"The only man in the world, named Jagaddeva, has just arrived, so I am ashamed to be without my upper garment in his presence. Women, in the presence of women, behave as they like.\" His mind was gratified by this surpassing praise, and he gave her the two garments which the king had bestowed on him. Then, owing to the favour of Paramardin, Jagaddeva became governor of a province, and his teacher came to visit him, and presented him with this stanza:\n\nA Brahmany drake asked a lotus, \"Tell me, friend, is there anywhere such a place to live in\nWhere night does not take place on the earth for a long time?\" The lotus answered,\n\n---\n\n1 I omit bale, as it is not found in P, a or B. I suppose that ni\u1e63v\u0101na is a musical instrument consisting of two pieces of metal.\n2 This Jagaddeva is apparently referred to in Kirtikaumud\u012b II. 99.\n3 The editor tells us, in mercy, generosity and warlike prowess.\n4 I find in P paramarditagiya at Paramardin\u0101.\n5 Kuntala means \"hair\" or \"look of hair.\"\n6 I read yutam, with a and \u03b2, for yugam. P has yuta.\n7 I find in P acityagrapa\u1e47e ca\u00f1ucanacceduryadhury\u0101; a agrees, but has \"prapa\u00f1ca\"; but \u03b2 agrees with the text.\n8 The Brahmany drake separates from its mate at night.\n9 P gives p\u0101tham, a traveller; a and \u03b2, p\u0101tham, water.\n\"Meru\\(^1\\) has been brought to an end by the man named Jagaddeva, by means of gifts of gold,\nAnd so for the last few days this sun has not been hidden; thus he has created perpetual day.\"\n\nAs a reward for this stanza, that munificent man gave him half a lakh.\n\nWhile Jagaddeva, whose right arm is skilful in protecting the earth, the consecrating priest of generosity,\nThe home of prosperity, of fortunate birth, is bestowing gifts on the world,\nThe servants become continually occupied every day, in the houses of learned men,\nIn making ropes for the binding-trees of choice elephants,\\(^2\\) and tethers for horses.\n\nWhile you live, there are living Bali, Karna and Dadhici,\nBut while I live, O Jagaddeva, Poverty is alive.\nWhile the Disposer is creating poor men, and you are making satisfied men,\nWe do not know, O Jagaddeva, whose hand will cease first.\nJagaddeva, when you enter the temple of \u00c7iva, the lord of the world,\nYour glory is like the liyga, and the asterisms\\(^3\\) like whole grain poured upon it.\nThe sea is unfathomable; the vessel of the earth is broad; the ether is omnipresent;\nMeru is lofty; Visnu, the enemy of Kaitabha, is renowned for greatness;\nJagaddeva is heroic; the tree of the gods is generous; the river of the gods\nIs purifying; the moon is nectar-raining; these facts are no novelty.\n\nJagaddeva had given the words \"no novelty,\" and the stanza was completed by a pandit. The stanzas cited above and others like them must be considered as handed down by tradition.\n\nThen the queen-consort of king Paramardin was the adopted sister of Jagaddeva. Once on a time, Jagaddeva was sent by the king to conquer a neighbouring\\(^4\\) sovereign, and while he was worshipping the god, he heard that his soldiers were attacked by the enemy's force, which had entrapped them into an ambuscade; but he did not cease performing the worship of the god in which he was engaged. On that occasion, king\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mount Meru consists of gold and jewels.

The king said, \"What are you looking for?\" She said, \"The sunrise.\" The king said, \"Silly woman, does the sun ever rise in the western quarter?\" She answered, \"The visible universe of Brahm\u0101 is turned upside down; the sunrise may take place in the western quarter, though difficult to happen; but never can the defeat of the prince of K\u1e63atriyas, Jagaddeva, take place.\" Such was the loving conversation of the royal couple. After the worship of the god was concluded, Jagaddeva rose up, with five hundred brave warriors, and easily dispersed that army, as the sun the accumulation of darkness, as a lion's whelp a herd of elephants, as an eddy of wind a bank of clouds. Then the king, named Paramardin, enjoying a splendid sovereignty which became quite proverbial in the world, day and night, except during the time of sleep, adorned with his might the use of the knife, and ruthlessly killed with his dagger every day at mealtime one cook, while engaged in serving up the food, and thus he was waited upon in the year by three hundred and sixty cooks. By this practice he acquired the title of the \"Destroying flame of wrath.\"\n\nEther, advance; move on, ye cardinal points; become thou broad, O Earth;\nYou have beheld with your own eyes the development of the glories of primeval kings;\nObserve! from the increasing expansion of the collected glory of king Paramardin,\nThe egg of Brahm\u0101 is assuming the condition of a pomegranate bursting from the swelling of its seeds.\n\nPraised with this and similar praises, he long enjoyed the sweets of rule. Now it happened that he was involved in war with P\u1e5bthv\u012br\u0101ja the king of the Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a country, and he went up to the field of battle. His army was defeated and he became a fugitive. Fleeing in the first direction that offered itself, he reached his own capital. Then a former servant of that king, named P\u016brva, who had been disgraced and banished from the country, came into the royal court of P\u1e5bthv\u012br\u0101ja, and after he had made his bow, he\n\n1 I read with \u1e47 tadbal\u0101\u1e41 dalay\u0101\u1e41\u015ba.

P has apam\u0101nitas\u016brvasevako.\nwas asked by the king, \"What deity is specially worshipped in the city of Paramardin on account of benefits?\" Thereupon he recited this stanza, which was suited to the occasion:\n\nEnthusiasm about the worship of the moon-diademed god is slack, there is no thirst for adoring K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a;\nThere is a torpor about prostrations before the wife of \u010civa; the house of Brahm\u0101 is distracted;\u00b9 Grass is now worshipped in Paramardin's city, because, when taken in the mouth,\nIt preserved our lord Paramardin from P\u1e5bthv\u012br\u0101ja, the king of men.\u00b2\n\nThe king, pleased with this panegyric, bestowed on him the present which he desired.\u00b3\n\nHe repulsed from his city thrice seven times the king of the Mlechhas, but nevertheless that very king came for the twenty-second time to the capital of P\u1e5bthv\u012br\u0101ja, and encamped there with his formidable army. A chief of heroes, named Tunga, a recipient of boundless favours from his master, bearing the bravery characteristic of the warrior race, like a second body,\u2074 perceiving that his king's mind was full of annoyance because the enemy came back again and again like a mosquito that is driven away, entered at night-time the camp of the king of the Mlechhas, together with his son, who was the very image of himself. He found round the pavilion of that enemy a ditch fiercely flaming\u2075 with charcoal made of khadira wood. So he said to his son, \"I will plunge into this, and then you must set your foot on my back, and put to death that king of the Mlechhas.\" When the father had given his son these instructions, the son said, \"This task is utterly impossible for me to accomplish, and it is also utterly impossible for me to witness the death of my father out of a longing for life; therefore I will plunge into the ditch myself; do you bring the king to his end.\" When he had said this, he acted accordingly, and then his father, thinking that his master's business was all but accomplished, put to death that enemy with ease, and returned home. When the night had almost turned into morning, the hostile army, finding that their king was killed,\n\n\u00b9 I read stambha\u1e25 with \u03b1 and \u03b2, and take graha\u1e25 in the sense of grha\u1e25.

That hero Tunga, being of lofty nature, never told the king the real state of the case. On a certain occasion the king, seeing that the wife of Tunga's son, who was well known on account of her being honoured by the sovereign, had left off wearing her auspicious bracelet, in a flurry asked Tunga the reason, but he, though questioned, being profound as the sea, kept within the bound of silence, and said nothing, until the king adjured him by his own life to answer, when he said, \"It is painful to have to commit the offence of declaring one's own merit; nevertheless at the king's request I will tell the truth.\" Thereupon he related the whole occurrence, exactly as it took place, though he was afraid that a recompense would be made him.\n\nThis is a certain great and world-transcending Sternheartedness of lofty-souled ones;\nWhen they have conferred a benefit, they are free from desire,\nDreading lest they should receive a recompense from their neighbour.\n\nHere ends the story of the hero Tunga.\n\nThen, once on a time, the son of that king of the Mlechas, being now himself king, remembering his father's feud, and being desirous of making war on the king of the Sap\u0101dalak\u1e63a country, came with all his host, but that army was driven away by the arrows of the valiant bowmen that formed the advance-guard of Prthv\u012br\u0101ja's army, as if by heavy showers from the clouds of the rainy season, and then Prthv\u012br\u0101ja went in pursuit of it. The officer that presided over the kitchen said to him, \"It will not be easy for even seven hundred she-camels to carry the kitchen service, so your Majesty should furnish me with a few more she-camels.\" The king gave him the following assurance: \"When I have cut off the king of the Mlechas, I will give you the she-camels that you ask for,\" and started off again on his march. A minister named Some\u00e7vara again and again tried to dissuade him, but the king, erroneously supposing that he favoured the enemy, cut off his ears. Some\u00e7vara was incensed against that king on account of that cruel outrage, so he repaired to the king of the Mlechas, and made him and his followers trust him by revealing to them that insult, and then led them into the neighbourhood of Prthv\u012br\u0101ja's camp. King Prthv\u012br\u0101ja was sleeping, after bringing to an end the fast of the eleventh day, and when a furious combat took place between the heroes of his\n\n1 The reading of a, r\u0101jam\u0101natay\u0101, would mean \"on account of her usual magnificence.\"\n2 All the MSS. read niya.\n3 The words pr\u1e63o njagunap\u0101takam are omitted in a.

On a second occasion, the king was bringing to an end the fast of the eleventh day, and while he was worshipping the god, the king of the Mlechhas sent there some roasted flesh on a dish. They placed it inside the tent, but, as at that precise moment every one was occupied with the worship of the god, a dog proceeded to make off with that meat. The sentinels said to the king, \"Why do you not rescue the meat?\" He said, \"I am looking on with a mind bewildered with wonder at the fact that my kitchen service, which formerly could with difficulty be carried by seven hundred camels, is now reduced to such a pitiable condition by the arrangement of spiteful destiny.\" They said, \"Have you still any heroic vigour left in you?\" He said, \"If I manage to return to my own palace, I will show you the strength of my body.\" The sentinels informed the king of the Mlechhas, who, being eager to behold Prthvir\u0101ja's valour, took him to his own capital; but when he was about to reinstate him as sovereign in his own palace, he saw there in the picture-gallery Mlechhas represented as being slain by droves of pigs. The sovereign of the Turu\u1e63kas was exceedingly incensed at this biting insult, and he put Prthvir\u0101ja to death by cutting off his head with an axe.\n\nHere end the stories of king Paramardin and Jagaddeva and Prthvir\u0101ja.\n\nThen there lived in C\u0101t\u0101nandapura, to which the sea served as a moat, a king of the name of Mah\u0101nanda, and his queen was called Madanarekh\u0101. As the king had a numerous harem, he was indifferent to the queen, and for this reason she was anxious to perform some magical rite in order to bewitch her husband, and so gain his affection, and with this object she kept questioning all kinds of foreigners and professors of arts, and at last she obtained an infallible philtre for the work of enchantment from a truthful reliable person, but at the moment when she was about to employ it, she remembered the maxim,\u2014\n\"The procuring of love by the might of charms and roots is called treachery against a husband;\"\nso, like a virtuous woman, she threw that magic powder into the sea. But inasmuch as the force of gems, spells and simples is incalculable, the sea was captivated by the might of that medicine, and came at night in human form, and made the queen pregnant. Thus the king, suddenly finding out the fact of her pregnancy from obvious indications, was angry,\n\n1 For Mlechch\u0101dhipatt\u0101n\u0101m P gives Mlechch\u0101n\u0101 (sic.): \u03b1 and \u03b2 omit the word, but give Mlechch\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 after saha.

All these became generally known to people as Kaunkanas.\u2074\n\nHere ends the story of the origin of the Ko\u1e47kan.\n\nThen, in the city of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, there was a certain son of a Brahman named Var\u0101ha, and he from his birth was a believer in astrology, but on account of his poverty he grazed cattle in order to keep himself alive. As he was thus employed, one day he drew a horoscope on a certain stone, and returned home at nightfall without rubbing it out.\u2075 When he had performed the duties appropriate to the time, he sat down to eat at night-time, and remembering that he ought to rub out the horoscope, he fearlessly went to the place at night, but when he reached it, he saw a lion sitting on the stone. Regarding even the lion with contempt, he placed his hand under the creature's belly, and began to rub out\u2076 the horoscope. While he was so engaged, the sun-god abandoned the form of a lion, and manifested himself in his true shape, and said, \"Choose a boon.\" Then Var\u0101ha asked by way of a boon, \"Show me the whole circle of the asterisms and the planetas.\" So the sun-god made him mount on his chariot, and took him to the heaven, and there he inspected on the spot for a year\u2077 the con-\n\n\u00b9 Here a gives jaladhera.

He was highly honoured by king Nanda, and he composed a new treatise on astronomy called the V\u0101r\u0101hi Samhit\u0101. Then, once on a time, on the occasion of the birth of a son to himself, he set up a clock in his house, and according to it he ascertained exactly the position of the heavenly bodies at the time of birth, and in accordance with the treatises on nativities, by the help of the knowledge of the whole circle of planets seen by himself with his own eyes in the zodiac, he predicted for that son a life of the length of a hundred years. On the great birth-festival there was nobody that did not come with a present in his hand, from the king downwards, with the single exception of the Jaina teacher, named Bhadrab\u0101hu, his younger brother. That astrologer told the minister \u010cakad\u0101la, who was devoted to the Jina, the reason of that Jaina doctor's not coming, in a way that was full of censure. That great-souled one was informed by the minister, and as, thanks to his perfect knowledge of the scripture, he had grasped in his hand, like an \u0101malaka fruit, the three times, he pointed out that he did not come because he must declare, that that son would die on the twentieth day from birth, by means of a cat. The minister repeated this declaration of his to Var\u0101hamihira, and from that time forth Var\u0101hamihira, in order to avert from his family that calamity which was inevitably to befall that son, made use of hundreds of devices to keep away cats. Nevertheless, on the date specified, at night, a bar suddenly fell on the boy's head, and so he went to the next world. Then the reverend teacher Bhadrab\u0101hu, in order to extract that dart of grief, went to Var\u0101hamihira's house, and when he arrived there, he saw in the courtyard of the house, all Var\u0101hamihira's books treating of the science of astrology, piled together in a heap, on the point of being burnt. He asked the astrologer, \"What is the meaning of this?\" He enviously reproached the Jaina hermit, and said despondently, \"I will burn these doubt-producing books, by which even I have been deceived.\" Thereupon the Jaina hermit explained to him completely, by virtue of his knowledge of the scriptures, the position of the heavenly bodies at his son's birth, and by his keen discernment informed him of the effect of those planets, and\n\n1 Mihira.\n2 I read guddh\u0101m with P, a and \u03b2.\n3 In the Kath\u0101 Sarit S\u0101gara, and the Pari\u00e7itaparvan (ed.

In this way he took away his disgust with his art. But that astrologer said, \"Your prediction that the boy would be killed by a cat was erroneous.\" When he said this, the great hermit had that bar brought there, and showed him the figure of a cat scratched on it, and said, \"Is destiny ever frustrated?\"\n\nFor whom do we weep here? Who has gone? This body is composed of imperishable atoms;\nIf grief is merely due to the destruction of a particular arrangement of them,\nnever must we give way to despair.\nBy existences produced from non-existence, called into existence by the power of delusion,\nAnd ending in the state of non-existence, infatuation is not produced in the good.\n\nHaving admonished him by this speech and argument that hermit went to his own place.\n\nThough Var\u0101hamihira was thus instructed, he was so confused by the Dhatt\u016bra-poison of false religion, that everything presented itself to him in a yellow light. Owing to his excessive jealousy of that Jaina hermit, he injured by sorcery some of the laymen devoted to him, and others he killed. The hermit by his great knowledge found out this fact from them, and in order to put a stop to this trouble, he composed a new panegyric, called the trouble-removing noose.\n\nHere ends the story of Var\u0101hamihira.\n\nThen, on the mountain named Dhajka, there was a Rajput named R\u0101nas\u012bha. He had a daughter named Bh\u016bpala, and V\u0101suki, seeing that she surpassed in beauty the maidens of the snake-world, fell in love with her, and visited her, and had a son by her, named N\u0101garjuna. The mind of that king of P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la was infatuated with love for his son, and he made him eat the fruits, roots, and leaves of all herbs, and owing to their virtue he was adorned with great magical powers, and inasmuch as he was a great magician, he was able to penetrate the earth, and though he was teacher of arts to king S\u0101tav\u0101hana, and had thus obtained a distinguished position, he waited on the teacher P\u0101dalipta in the town of P\u0101dalipta, in order to\n\n1 I read with P, a and \u03b2, kasy\u0101tra for kasm\u0101t, and insert with the same three MSS., k\u0101yo'ya\u015b before param\u0101navo.\n2 I read with a and \u03b2, abh\u0101van\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101paryantai\u1e25, and bhrama\u1e47a for tama\u1e47a with a and \u03b2.

As his mind was uplifted with pride, he took the following course. His teacher had at meal-time flown through the air by virtue of an unguent applied to his feet, and adored the holy places A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101pada and others, so, when he returned home, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna washed his feet, and as he knew the colour, taste, smell, and other properties of 107 potent herbs, he quickly found out in that way what the unguent was made of; so he applied it to his feet, despising his teacher, and flew up like a cock or a peacock, but fell into a pit, and so his body was crippled with the multitude of bruises thereby produced. His teacher questioned him, saying, \"What is the meaning of this?\" So he told his teacher exactly what had occurred. The teacher was astonished in his mind at his ingenuity, and placed his lotus-like hand on his head and said, \"You must wet those herbs with water, in which grains of rice, that ripens in sixty days, have been boiled, and then you will be able to fly through the air by anointing your feet with an unguent made of them.\" In this way N\u0101g\u0101rjuna obtained one magical power by his teacher's favour. Moreover, he heard from his mouth that an elixir, prepared in front of the image of P\u0101rvan\u0101tha and bruised by a woman, devoted to her husband, and distinguished by all the good points of womanhood, was all-powerful. Now there was an image of P\u0101rvan\u0101tha, which Samudra-vijaya, of the Da\u00e7\u0101rha race, heard to be very excellent from the mouth of Nemin\u0101tha, who knew the three times, and so he had it made of jewels, and set it up in a temple in Dv\u0101ravati, but after Dv\u0101ravati was burnt, and that city was overwhelmed by the sea, the image remained unharmed in that very sea. The ship of a merchant of K\u0101nti, named Dhanapati, was arrested there by the exceeding might of the god, and the merchant was informed by a divine voice, \"Here is an image of a Jina.\" So he sent out sailors at that very spot, and fastening round it seven new ropes, drew it up, and placed it in a temple which he himself built in his own city, as having gained something past all conception. That all-surpassing image N\u0101g\u0101rjuna carried off in order to prepare his magic elixir, and set it up on the bank of the river Sedi, and to compound this magic medicine in front of it, he brought there every night the virtuous wife of king \u015a\u0101tav\u0101hana,\n\n---\n\n1 I read with P, m\u0101nocchritamatir for vratamatir; a has m\u0101nositamatir; and \u03b2, m\u0101nojitamatir.\n2 See note on page 594 of the second volume of my translation of the Kath\u0101 Sarit S\u0101gara.\n3 P, \u03b2 and a give sastika.

As in this way she was continually going to this spot and returning, she began to look upon N\u0101g\u0101rjuna as a friend, and so asked him what was the object of bruising those herbs. He told her the whole circumstance of the all-powerful elixir, in accordance with his own idea, and treated her with a kindness that baffled the power of description, and showed her an increasing familiarity\u00b9 that he extended to no one else. Then, once on a time, she told this story to her own two sons, and they, desiring the elixir, left the kingdom, and went to the land adorned by the presence of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, and treacherously disguising themselves in order to get possession of that medicine, gained over, by a gift of money, the cook of the place where he took his meals, and asked her for news of the elixir. She, in order to find out about it, flavoured with that view his rasavati with overmuch salt, and after six months had passed, he began to abuse the rasavati as being briny. Then she intimated to the two princes by signs that the elixir was complete. Then they, who had been adopted as his nephews,\u00b2 being eager to seize the elixir, and having found out by rumour, reaching them in a roundabout way, the fact that V\u0101suki had predicted N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's death by a blade of darbha-grass, killed him by that very weapon as predicted, and that elixir, in virtue of its being presided over by a deity duly set up,\u00b3 vanished. Where that elixir was arrested is the holy place of P\u0101r\u00e7van\u0101tha, called Stambhanaka, surpassing even the elixir, as it gives to all people the objects that they desire. After some time had elapsed from that event, that image was covered with earth, all but the face.

The grammar was thoroughly considered at the end of six months, and then the Brahman at once bade adieu to Gane\u00e7a, and, taking with him the first copy of his work, entered that city, and sat down on the open space in front of a certain house and went to sleep.\n\nThen, the next morning, a hetaera, being informed of that circumstance by her maids, who found him in such a condition, made them bring him, and placed him on a swing-bed. At the end of three days and three nights he shook off his sleep to a certain extent, and looking at the wonderful pictures of the picture-gallery and other rooms, he thought that he had been born into the heavenly-world, but he was informed of the real state of affairs by the hetaera. She satisfied him with a bath, food and drink,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I have endeavoured to translate janm\u0101g\u1e5be which I find in P, a and B, instead of yam\u0101g\u1e5be. The words \u201cimage of the\u201d are not in the original. The deity was, no doubt, a local deity, identified by the Jainas with P\u0101rvan\u0101tha.\n\n\\(^2\\) I find in B, so v\u0101rd\u0101h\u012bmadhye, an allusion to the fact that the image was found in the sea; a gives sv\u0101rv\u0101rd\u0101h\u012bmadhye.\n\n\\(^3\\) Aufrecht, in his Catalogus Catalogorum, gives the titles of two MSS. as Phakkik\u0101vy\u0101khy\u0101na (the very word used here), and Siddh\u0101ntakaumudig\u016b\u1e0dha-phakkik\u0101prak\u0101\u015ba. In Molesworth\u2019s Mar\u0101\u1e6dhi Dictionary phakkik\u0101 is said to mean an assertion or argument to be maintained, a position or thesis.\n\n\\(^4\\) I read tats\u0101hasatusfena with P, a and B.\nand other attentions, and he went to the king's audience-hall and explained correctly the grammar of P\u0101\u1e47ini. He was liberally rewarded by the king and all the other learned men, and he gave to that hetaera all the wealth that he received from them.\n\nThen he had successively four wives, belonging to four castes. Now the son of the K\u1e63atriya wife was Vikram\u0101ditya, but the son of the C\u016bdra wife was Bhar\u1e6d\u1e5bhari. The latter was secretly taught in a cellar on account of his being of inferior caste, but the others were made to study openly. Accordingly, they were being instructed in communication with Bhar\u1e6d\u1e5bhari, and the following line was being read out:\n\nCharity, enjoyment and waste are the three destinations of wealth.\n\nBhar\u1e6d\u1e5bhari, as the usual communication was not made by the string, and the three other pupils, who were openly taught, asked for the second half of the couplet, became angry, and scolded the teacher, saying, \"What, you son of a concubine, do you not even now make the necessary communication by means of the string?\" Then he appeared in person, and blamed the writer of the treatise, saying:\n\nOf wealth acquired by a hundred exertions, dearer even than life,\nCharity only is the destination, the others are deviations.\n\nGiving this version, he expressed his opinion that there was only one destination for wealth. That Bhar\u1e6d\u1e5bhari wrote many books, the Vair\u0101gya-\u00e7ataka and others.\n\nHere ends the story of the birth of Bhar\u1e6d\u1e5bhari.\n\nThen the ornament of the country of M\u0101lava, king Bhoja in Dh\u0101r\u0101, had a certain physician well read in medical treatises, named V\u0101gbhata. He made use of all the unwholesome things mentioned in the medical treatises, and so produced diseases, and then employed to check them the remedies and diets famous in Su\u1e63ruta, and so cured them. He then wished to try how long one could live without water, so he abstained from water, but at the end of three days his palate and lips were tormented with thirst, so he recited the following couplet:\n\n1 I find vy\u0101cakhy\u0101na in \u03b1 and \u0392; \u03b2 has vy\u0101cakhy\u0101na.\n2 No. 2757 in B\u00f6htlingk's Indische Spr\u00fcche, found in Bhar\u1e6d\u1e5bhari and elsewhere. The second line is:\n   Yo na dad\u0101ti na bhuykte tasya tritiy\u0101 gatir bhavati.\n   He who does not give or enjoy, wastes.\n\nClearly we must read uttar\u0101r\u0101he with \u03b1 and \u03b2. They have Bhar\u1e6d\u1e5bhari (short i) and kupita up\u0101dhy\u0101ya, thus representing the teacher as angry, because Bhar\u1e6d\u1e5bhari did not pull the string. The reading of \u0392 is shorter than the text, and agrees in sense with \u03b1 and \u03b2.\nSometimes hot, sometimes cold, sometimes boiled and left to cool,\nSometimes mixed with medicine, water in no case is forbidden.\n\nSuch was the saying in praise of water that he uttered. He wrote a\ntreatise named V\u0101gbhata, with reference to his own experience.\u00b9 His son-\nin-law, the younger B\u0101hadra, went with his father-in-law, the elder B\u0101hadra,\nto the king's palace in the early morning. After examining the appearance\nof the king's body, the elder B\u0101hadra said, \"To-day you are free from\ndisease.\" But king Bh\u016bja observed a certain alteration in the features of\nthe younger B\u0101hadra, and asked him the reason. He said, \"To-day, at the\nend of night, consumption entered the king's body, for this is indicated by\nthe appearance of a dark shade.\" In these words he revealed, by the\ninspiration of a deity, a process that could not be detected by the senses.\u00b2\nThe king, astonished at the wide range of his acquirements, questioned\nhim about the means of checking that disease,\u00b3 when he mentioned an elixir\nthat cost three lakhs. That elixir was prepared in six months at the cost\nof so much money, with great care, and at nightfall the physician put it\nin a glass phial and laid it on the king's bed. In the morning the king\nwished to take that elixir after worshipping the divinity, and after the\njoyful ceremony of adoring the elixir was completed, and all the necessary\npreparations had been made, that younger physician, for some reason or\nother, dashed the glass phial on the ground and broke it. The king said,\n\"Alas! what is the meaning of this?\" The physician said, \"The disease\nhas been driven away by the mere smell of the elixir, and as there is no\ndisease, what is the good of exhibiting without cause this medicine that\nconsumes the elements of the body, since to-day, at the end of night, that\ndark shade that I spoke of before, has been seen to have abandoned the\nking's body, and to have gone far off. In this matter the decision rests\nwith the king.\" The king was pleased with this assurance of his truthfulness,\nand gave him a present that chased away poverty. Then all those\ndiseases, being extirpated from the earth by that physician,\u2074 went to heaven\nand told the two physicians, the sons of \u0100gyini, how shamefully they had\nbeen treated. Then those two \u0100gyinis, being astonished in their minds at\nthat intelligence,\u2075 took the form of a pair of blue birds, and sat on a turret\nunderneath the window of the palace of V\u0101gbhata, that champion who\n\n\u00b9 I prefer the reading of P, n\u012bj\u0101nubh\u0101te. The Ast\u0101ngah\u1e5bdayasa\u1e41hit\u0101 is ascribed\nto V\u0101gbhata the younger, grandson of V\u0101gbhata.

Again they spoke, and the answer came as follows:\n\nHe who remains quiet in the rainy season, drinks in the autumn, eats in the cold and dewy seasons,\nRejoices in the spring, sleeps in the hot season, he is free from disease, O bird.\n\nWhen he had said this, they went away again. On the third day they assumed the form of mighty hermits and came to his house. Their utterance was,\n\nNot sprung from the earth, not of the ether, not animal, not sprung from the water,\nSay, physician, what is the medicine approved by all the treatises?\n\nAgain the physician gave an answer,\n\nNot sprung from the earth, not of the ether, wholesome, free from taste,\nAbstinence is the sovereign medicine mentioned by ancient teachers.\n\nThe divine physicians were astonished in mind at this, and they showed themselves in their true form, and after giving him the boon that he chose, they went to their own place.\n\nHere ends the story of the physician V\u0101gbha\u1e6da.\n\nThen a certain merchant, named Dh\u0101ra, residing in the village of Gh\u0101map\u0101uli, in wealth rivalling Kuvera, obtained the leadership of the congregation. He gave life to the world of living beings by the fact that\n\n1 The Sanskrit ko'ruk sounds a little like the cry of a bird.\n2 The words ityabh\u0101ni are omitted in P, a and \u03b2.\n3 P, a and \u03b2 omit prativac\u0101.\n4 Literally, \"not to be slain.\"\n5 I read \u0101\u015b\u0101dayad with \u03b2, or \u0101\u015b\u0101dayat with P and a. I cannot find m\u0101dyad in any one of the three MSS.\nhe expended money, and with his five sons he took up his abode on the land lying at the foot of mount Raivataka. Because he was an adherent of the \u0106vet\u0101mbara sect, he was opposed by a certain king of Girinagara, who was devoted to the Digambara sect, and when a furious battle was going on between the two armies, those five sons, fighting with infinite martial ardour, out of their zeal for the god, as their courage was stimulated by affection \\(^1\\) for him, were killed, and became five lords of regions \\(^2\\) round the mountain. Their names were in order, 1. K\u0101lamegha; 2. Meghan\u0101da; 3. Bhairava; 4. Ekapada; 5. Trailokyap\u0101da. They were, all five of them, victorious all round the mountain, bringing to destruction the enemies of the holy place. Then their father, named Dh\u0101ra, alone remained. He went to the country of Kany\u0101kubja, and when the ceremony of the exposition of the holy doctor Bappaha\u1e6d\u1e6di was beginning, he gave him this order from the congregation: \u201cThe Digambaras have established themselves in the holy place of Raivataka, and they treat the \u0106vet\u0101mbaras as heretics, and will not let them ascend the mountain, therefore conquer them, and deliver the holy place, and so having shown yourself devoted to the religion that you follow, proceed to perform the ceremony of exposition.\u201d By the fuel of his speech the doctor's backward \\(^3\\) flame was made to blaze up, and he took the king with him, and with Dh\u0101ra reached that mountain region, and in seven days conquered the Digambaras in a set disputation,\\(^4\\) and made Ambik\u0101 appear visibly before the congregation, and listened to the g\u0101th\u0101 uttered by her, \u201cThere is one formula of adoration on the summit of mount Ujjayanta,\u201d and so on, and the religion of the \u0106vet\u0101mbaras being thus established, the vanquished Digambaras leapt down the precipice from the portico of Bal\u0101naka.\n\nHere ends the story of the origin of the Genii of the place.\n\nThen, once on a time, \u0106iva was asked by Bhav\u0101ni,\\(^6\\) \u201cTo how many pilgrims do you give a kingdom?\u201d When she had said this, he answered, \u201cI will give a kingdom to that man who, alone of men a hundred thousand in number, adheres to his purpose.\u201d\\(^6\\) In order to prove the truth of this by example, he turned Bhav\u0101ni into an old cow stuck in the mire, and himself stood by her on the firm soil, in the form of a man, and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) P and \\(a\\) give vallabhaya.\n\\(^2\\) I believe that ke\u015btrapati means \u201cGenius loci.\u201d I find that Professor Leumann, in his list of the Strasbourg Collection of Digambara MSS., assigns this meaning to ke\u015btrapati.\n\\(^3\\) P omits pratipa; \\(a\\) and \\(\u03b2\\) have parigha.\n\\(^4\\) P and \\(\u03b2\\) have v\u0101dasthalena; \\(a\\) has v\u0101dasthale.

So perhaps the phrase also means \u201cis devoted to Durg\u0101.\u201d\n\nP\ncalled to the travellers to pull her out. They, being eager to visit the neighbouring shrine of Some\u00e7vara, laughed him to scorn. At last a compassionate party of travellers began the task of pulling her out, but \u00c7iva assumed the form of a lion, and chased them away. However, one traveller, even preferring death, would not leave the side of that cow. He was selected and shown to Bhav\u00e2ni as worthy of a throne.\n\nHere ends the story of purpose.\n\nThen a certain pilgrim, going on a pilgrimage to the shrine of Some\u00e7vara, slept on the way in the house of a worker in iron. The wife of that worker in iron killed her husband, and placed the sword at the head of the pilgrim, and raised the hue and cry. A watchman came there and cut off the hands of that supposed guilty person. He began to exclaim against the god, but the god appeared to him in the night and said to him, \"Hear the story of your former life.\" Once on a time, a she-goat was held by the ears by one brother with his hands, while the other brother killed it. Then that she-goat after death became this woman, while the man who killed the she-goat became in this life her husband. Because on that occasion you held her ears, therefore, on meeting her again you have had your hands cut off, so how can you reproach me?\"\n\nHere ends the story of compassion.\n\nOf old time, in the city of \u00c7anjhapura, there was a king named \u00c7apkha. In that city there was a merchant, who both in name and deeds was Dhanada. He, once on a time, reflected that fortune is as unsteady as the flapping ears of an elephant, so he went with a present in his hand to the king and pleased him, and on a piece of ground granted by him he caused to be built, after consultation with his four sons, a Jaina temple in an auspicious conjunction. After he had erected the images that were to be set up there, he made many doors of approach for the service of that temple, and being anxious about its ritual, he had laid out a charming garden adorned with a number of flowering trees of various kinds, and appointed people to look after it. The merchant's impeding works in former births began to reveal themselves, and so he gradually found his wealth diminish, and he observed that in that city his reputation was\n\n---\n\n1 I read with P and a, \u00e7r\u00e6u tv\u00e4n pr\u00e4gbhav\u00e4n; B has pr\u00e4gbhava.\n2 I read with P and a, krya\u00e4; B has krap\u00e4. The text would mean \"the story of the sword.\" But the story seems to me to be an edifying Jaina tale inculcating ahimsa.\n3 This is the first tale in the Kath\u00e2 Ko\u00e7a.\n4 i.e. a giver of wealth.\n5 All the MSS. have sam\u00e2racan\u00e2ya which I have tried to translate. This word is found on the last line of page 204, and the first line of page 322.\n6 The MSS. insert go\u00f1\u00f1akesu (sic) after cintakesu, which means, I suppose, that its caretakers formed a guild.\ntarnished by his indebtedness; so he settled in a certain village at no great distance from the town, and his sons gained subsistence for him by going to and fro between the village and the town. In this way he spent some time. Then, on another occasion, when the festival, that takes place once in four months, was approaching, Dhanada went to \u00c7anjkhapura with his sons, who were in the habit of going there, and as he was ascending the steps of his own temple, the woman, whose business it was to pick flowers in his own garden, presented him with a fourfold flower-garland. He was filled with great joy, and worshipped the mighty Jina with those flowers. In the night he was complaining bitterly of his bad circumstances to his spiritual guide, so he gave him a charm for attracting the Yak\u1e63a Kapardin. Once on a time, he made use of that very charm on the fourteenth day of the black fortnight, and made the Yak\u1e63a Kapardin appear, and then by the advice of the spiritual guide, he asked that Yak\u1e63a to bestow on him the fruit of the merit he had gained by offering a fourfold flower-garland on the occasion of the four-monthly festival. The Yak\u1e63a answered, \u201cI am not able to give the fruit of the merit of even one flower offered in worship, without the permission of the All-knowing.\u201d But the Yak\u1e63a Kapardin, as he felt extraordinary affection for his co-religionist, buried in the four corners of his house four pitchers full of gold, and then disappeared. The next morning Dhanada came to his house, and made over that wealth to his sons, who were disposed to speak evil of the Jaina religion. They eagerly inquired of their father the cause of his obtaining that wealth, and in order to manifest in their hearts the power of religion, he informed them that that wealth had been bestowed upon him, owing to the power of worship paid to the Jina, by the Yak\u1e63a Kapardin, whom he had thereby gratified. They, having attained wealth, returned to the city in which they were born, and being devoted to the service of their own religious edifice,\n\n1 These days, according to \u0100tm\u0101r\u0101m Muni, are the days of the full moon of the white fortnight, in Ph\u0101lguna, \u0100\u1e63\u0101\u1e0dha, and K\u0101rtika. On these days the Jainas, after fasting, perform pious works.

This Yak\u1e63a is supposed to be a sort of guard.\n\n5 Here I transcribe the corresponding passage literatim from my MS. of the Kath\u0101 Ko\u1e47a which I call C:\n\nTasya pura\u1e25 Kaparda-Yak\u1e63a\u1e25 (sic) pratya\u015bitabha\u1e45ga uktam ca bho Dhanada caturm\u0101sasvastare \u0101rvitar\u0101gasya pusphacatu\u015bvarap\u016bj\u0101\u1e25 (sic) pusya phalam me dehi tena kathitam ekasy\u0101pi pusphusumasya (sic) saru\u1e47\u0101\u015bv vina d\u0101nam na samarthah iti k\u0101vya\u015b\u0101ya \u015buddharmikatv\u0101d Kapardiy\u0101k\u1e63ena\u1e6dadya (sic) catv\u0101ru ghalok\u0101nteyu, &c.\n\n6 I find nidd\u0101 for d\u0101na in P, \u03b1 and \u03b2, and in the corresponding passage in the Kath\u0101 Ko\u1e47a.

The corresponding passage in\nand engaged in propagating the law of the Jina in many various ways, they firmly established the Jaina religion even in the minds of people of alien faiths.\n\nHere ends the story of Dhanada, having reference to the worship of him who is without passion.\n\nThus the fifth chapter of the Prabandhacint\u0101ma\u1e47i produced by the teacher Merutunga, called the miscellaneous chapter, which is the description, commencing with the discrimination of vessels uttered by Vikram\u0101ditya and others, and ending with the story of Dhanada having reference to the worship of the Jina, has been completed. The number of \u0101loka\u015b is 3000.\n\nAs deeply-learned virtuous old men are generally hard to find,\nAnd as learning is evidently sinking from the decay of the ability and application of pupils,\nTherefore this book, like a dole of nectar, has been made by stringing together the stories of good men,\nBy the author, desirous of doing a great service to future sages.\nThis \"wishing-stone of narratives,\" taken in the palm of the hand,\nProduces the appearance of the Syamantaka jewel, being a deposit for a long time,\nPlaced on the heart, it creates an excellent pure ray of the Kaustubha,\nSo, by means of this book, the wise man becomes like the husband of \u0100r\u012b.\n\nAs I have heard, I have carefully compiled\nThis book from narratives, though I am dull of intellect;\nIntellectual men, giants in wisdom,\nMust exalt it to honour, dismissing jealousy.\nAs long as in heaven the sun and moon, like two gamblers, play with the planets as cowries,\nSo long may this book rejoice, being taught by learned doctors!\n\nIn the thirteen hundred and sixty-first year of the era of king Vikram\u0101ditya, on this fifteenth day of the white fortnight of Ph\u0101lguna, being a Sunday, in this city of Vardham\u0101na, this book, called Cint\u0101ma\u1e47i, has been completed.\n\nthe Kath\u0101 Ko\u1e63a is Jina\u1e0dharmasth\u0101nasam\u0101ra\u1e47apar\u0101h.

(Z.). I may extend this note of Professor Zachariae's by the help of some remarks of his on the 15th story of the Siddhi-K\u016br, where he quotes from Professor Eggeling's article in the Gurupuj\u0101kaumudi. \"In the time of Bhojar\u0101ja there lived in Ujjayini a Brahman, who, because he did not receive as much honour as K\u0101lid\u0101sa, set out on a journey with his servant, who was of the same caste as himself. He came to the king of K\u0101lanjara, waited upon him respectfully (tasmai cik\u0101 datt\u0101), and was dismissed by him with rich presents. On his journey home he lay down under the shade of a fig-tree, and went to sleep. Then avarice awoke in the breast of the servant, and planting his foot upon the scalp-lock of the sleeper, he drew his sword to cut off his head. In the meanwhile his master was awakened by the pain, and when he saw what was going on, he offered all his gold to the servant, and promised to leave his native land for ever. But, when his servant would not consent to spare his life on those terms, he entreated him, at any rate, to take back a message to his father\u2014consisting of the syllables apra\u00e7ikha\u1e6d. The miscreant consented, and then\ndealt him a mortal blow. However, the father could make nothing of the message, and asked counsel of the king, as being a caturda\u00e7avidy\u0101nid\u0101nam (i.e. a master of the fourteen sciences), but neither the king nor K\u0101lid\u0101sa, nor any one of the other learned men could help him. Then the king became despondent and refused all nourishment. But a learned man, of the name of Vararuci, who could not bear to endure the reproach that the king was about to die on account of his ignorance, left the town. While he was passing the night on a fig-tree, he heard the solution of the mystery from a female jackal, who was telling her cubs the whole story, and explaining to them how the word apra\u00e7ikh\u0101k was made up of the initial letters of the four p\u0101d\u0101s (i.e. quarters) of this tell-tale couplet:\n\nAnena tava putrasya prasuptasya van\u0101ntare\n\u00c7ikh\u0101m ukramya p\u0101dena kha\u1e0dgena nihatain cirah.\n\n'This man planted his foot upon the lock of hair on the crown of your son, while he was asleep in the wood, and cut off his head with his sword.' So the crime came to light, and the goods of the murderer were confiscated, and he was banished from the country\u2014the most severe punishment that could be inflicted on a Brahman.\"\n\nI take the explanation of the expression visemir\u0101 from another paper of Professor Zachariae on Siddhi-K\u00fcr, XV., in which he gives a short abstract of a story in the Jain recension of the Sinh\u0101sanadv\u0101trim\u00e7ik\u0101 (Weber, Indische Studien, XV., p. 301 and ff.).\n\nIn Vij\u0101l\u0101 ruled a king by name Nanda, his son was called Vijayap\u0101la, his minister Bahu\u00e7ruta. The guru (teacher) of the king, the wise \u00c7\u0101rad\u0101nanda, was supposed to have been put to death by Bahu\u00e7ruta, on account of a groundless suspicion that the king entertained against him. But the minister, with wise prevision, had not really put him to death, but had hidden him in an underground room in his house.\n\nOne day Prince Vijayap\u0101la went out hunting and lost his way. Being chased by a tiger, he took refuge in a tree. This tree was inhabited by an ape, in the body of which dwelt the god of the tree. The prince was hospitably received by the ape, and when night came on he lay down to rest in the lap of the ape. In vain did the tiger, which was keeping watch under the tree, try to persuade the ape to throw the prince down. After some time the parts were reversed, and the ape went to sleep in the prince's lap. The tiger cautioned the prince against the ape. Accordingly the prince, overmastered by fear, let the ape fall, but in his fall he was caught in a bough, and remained hanging there. Then the prince was ashamed of his action. But the ape said, \"Do not be afraid, prince, of me! You show that you are conscious of what an enormity you have committed.\" Then the morning broke, and the tiger went away. The\ndeity that animated the ape taught the prince the four syllables, vi se mi r\u0101, in order to inform the world in general of the real state of affairs, and made him get down from the tree. No sooner had the prince learnt the syllables than he became crazy, and wandered about in the wood. There, at last, he was found by the king, who had gone out with his servants to look for him. The prince was quite distracted, and only kept repeating to himself the syllables vi se mi r\u0101. In vain did they attempt to restore him to reason, with all possible expedients, charms and medicinal herbs. Then the king began to regret the wise \u010c\u0101rad\u0101nanda, whom he had ordered to be put to death. The minister advised him not to cry over spilt milk, but to proclaim in the city that whoever restored the prince to health should obtain the half of the kingdom. By the advice of \u010c\u0101rad\u0101nanda the minister then informed the king that he had in his house a girl seven years old who, if she saw the prince, would discover a means of curing him. The king went with the prince into the house of the minister, where \u010c\u0101rad\u0101nanda was hidden behind a curtain. Then \u010c\u0101rad\u0101nanda repeated four Sanskrit verses, beginning respectively with vi\u00e7\u016bsa, setum gatv\u0101, mitradrohi, r\u0101jantsva\u1e41 (of which the first three denounced treachery, while the last recommended that the crime should be expiated by gifts.) The prince uttered one of the syllables vi, se, mi, r\u0101, at the end of each verse, and when the fourth verse was finished, entirely recovered his reason, and related his adventure in the wood. All the hearers were astonished. The king discovered \u010c\u0101rad\u0101nanda behind the curtain, prostrated himself before him, and praised the prudence of his minister, who had saved him from the sin of killing a Brahman, and had preserved the life of the prince into the bargain.\n\nPage 7, line 12, \"The son-in-law's revision.\"\n\nOn the son-in-law's revision compare Molesworth s.v. j\u0101me\u1e63i \u1e63o\u1e0dh (Z.). Molesworth gives the following explanation, \"A phrase founded on a popular story to express the examination of a piece of composition by a shallow-witted fellow, incapable of discerning its merit.\" The proverb is otherwise explained by Manwaring (No. 1392), as Dr. Sten Konow pointed out to me. Molesworth's explanation fits in admirably with Merutunga's story.\n\nLine 27, \"A merchant named D\u0101nta.\" This story will be found in the Sinh\u0101sanaadv\u0101trimcik\u0101; Weber, Ind.

Simh\u0101sanadv\u0101trin\u012bcik\u0101, Weber, Ind. Stud., p. 427, where the professor remarks, \"Das Eingeweidenetz in deinem Leibe ist scheickig.\"\n\nPage 10, line 10, \"The occurrence is thus described.\"\nIt is related in a somewhat different manner in the Prabandhako\u1e63a (B\u00fchler MS., No. 294), 173-174. For the pa\u1e6d\u1e6dahasti\u1e47 we have a pa\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101ya\u1e47a.\n\nPage 11. Some of the verses quoted at page 15 of the text (translation, p. 11 f.) are given also in the Subh\u0101sit\u0101vali, ed. Peterson, No. 2452 ff. (Z.).\n\nPage 12, line 6, \"Thy right hand is a sea.\"\nPerhaps better in one sentence, \"Thy arm is a southern sea, quick to remind man of the might of R\u0101ma.\" There is a \u00e7leha in samudra, which also means \"marked by lines.\" The previous line also contains a punning allusion to the rivers Sarasvat\u012b and \u00c7op\u0101 (Th.).\n\nPage 14, last line of the text, \"As king \u00c7\u0101tav\u0101hana, &c.\" In the Prabandhako\u1e63a, 141, we are told that he was called \u00c7\u0101tav\u0101hana, because, when playing with his boyish companions, he gave as a king v\u0101han\u0101ni karituragorarath\u0101ni k\u1e5btrim\u0101ni to them.\n\nPage 15, line 1, \"He saw in the river near the city a certain fish.\" In the Prabandhako\u1e63a, 158, 159, the story of the laughing fish is told in a slightly different form.\n\nLine 28, \"Had a book made which was a treasury of g\u0101th\u0101s.\" Cf.

Perhaps also pa\u00f1cakula, Ind. Stud., XVIII., p. 314, belongs here (Z.). The reference to the Har\u1e63acarita is p. 280 of the translation by Cowell and Thomas, where other references are given. I had noted this reference, but it was omitted by an oversight.\n\nLine 14, for Pipalut\u0101 read Pipalul\u0101.\n\nLine 18, \"J\u0101li-tree.\" A \"J\u0101l\" tree is mentioned in the Bh\u016bt Nibandha translated by Alexander Kinloch Forbes (p. 20), in connection with the superstition of the \"Rag-uncle.\"\n\nNote 2.

This verse is as old as king Avantivarman of Ka\u00e7mir, see R\u0101jatarangini, quoted in B\u00f6htlingk's Indische Spr\u00fcche, 552 (Z.). The verse is found v. 36 of Troyer's edition, and also of Dr. Stein's. It is ascribed to K\u1e5btamand\u0101ra. Avantivarman came to the throne in 855 A.D. (Duff, Indian Chronology).\n\nPage 40, line 7 (Text, p. 70, l. 3). Him\u0101laya, &c., is from Kum\u0101rasambhava I., 1; and prav\u0101la\u00e7ayacara\u1e47am cariram from Kum\u0101rasambhava, III., 8 (Z.).\n\nPage 41, line 18, \"Bh\u012bma was created, &c.\" The Sanskrit text contains a punning reference to Bhoja, who also was the son of Andhaka, sc. of the blind. The tradition referred to above (p. 32, note 1) is therefore old (Th.).\n\nPage 42, line 6, \"While I am shrivelled up with cold.\" On the authorship and reading of this verse, cp. Peterson on the Aucity\u0101la\u1e45k\u0101ra of K\u1e63emendra (Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay, XVI., p. 169) (Th.). Peterson tells us that Matrgupta is given as the author in R\u0101jatarangini III., 181, and in the Subh\u0101sit\u0101vali. K\u1e63emendra ascribes it to K\u0101rpa\u1e6dika, which may be a synonym of M\u0101trgupta, as being an aspirant for the king's favour. Peterson reads adhyusitasya. Dr. Stein reads \u00c7itenoddh\u1e5b\u1e63itasya. In the Pa\u00f1catantra, Book I., story 18, p. 100 (ed. Kielhorn), we read that the ape was v\u0101t\u0101s\u0101rasam\u0101hata\u1e25 proddh\u016b\u1e63ita\u00e7ariro dantavi\u015b\u0101m v\u0101dayam.\n\nPage 44, line 20 (text, p. 77, 3), \"The Cola king.\" This stanza is found in the K\u0101vy\u0101nu\u00e7\u0101sana (see K\u0101vyam\u0101l\u0101, No. 43), p. 25, prop. fin. (Z.).\n\nPage 45, line 26. For \"practise\" read \"practice.\"\n\nAdd to note 2. R\u0101dh\u0101 denotes the butt or mark; R\u0101dh\u0101 is after all \"the aim\" personified. In Prakrit the r\u0101dh\u0101 is generally called puttaliya, literally \"a little figure,\" as apparently a little human figure was painted in the middle of the butt (L.).\n\nIbid., line 2, for \"B\u00f6htlingk and Roth\" read \"B\u00f6htlingk.\"\nPage 46, line 3 (text, p. 79, 13). Compare Kavy\u0101nu\u00e7\u0101vana, p. 27, 8 (Z.). Here we find the following:\n\nPraj\u00f1\u0101pu\u00f1ja may\u0101 j\u00f1\u0101nam (j\u00f1\u0101tam?)

This is quoted in the Kavy\u0101nu\u00e7\u0101sana (see Kavyam\u0101la, No. 43), p. 11, 6; the first line is quoted in the commentary on the Mankhakoca, s.v. k\u0101ra\u1e47a (Z.). The edition referred to is that of Professor Zachariae, Vienna, 1890.\n\nPage 56, line 23 (text, p. 93, 6), \"They take grass in their mouths.\" This is an allusion to a most ancient custom. Cp. Har\u1e63acarita, 132, 11 (Commentary, tr\u1e47am k\u0101tarair mukhe dhriyate), Ca\u1e47\u1e0dakau\u00e7ika, 3rd Act: Liebrecht, Zur Volkakunde, 382 ff.; Grimm Rechtsalterth\u00fcmer, p. 121 ff.; 604, 205, 481 (Z.). The passage referred to in the Har\u1e63acarita will be found at the page indicated, in the Bombay edition of 1892. Cowell and Thomas, in their translation, p. 101, note 4, say, \"To carry a straw in the mouth was a sign of surrender; cf. Acworth's Maratha Ballads, p. 43:\n\n\"And 'twixt the teeth a straw is fit\nFor eurs who arm but to submit.\"\n\nLiebrecht quotes from Elliot's Glossary of Indian Terms, \"Whoever wishes to appease the anger of an opponent takes a straw or a blade of grass in his mouth, and at the same time stands on one leg.\" Liebrecht finds traces of the custom in Europe. An extract which he makes from Campbell's Popular Tales of the Western Highlands (II., 304) is particularly interesting, \"He went to the fair and he took a straw in his mouth, to show that he was for taking service.\" It was, I believe, the custom in England in old times, for people who wished to be hired as false witnesses, to sit with straws in their mouths. The reference in the Ca\u1e47\u1e0dakau\u00e7ika will be found in the Bombay edition of 1860 on fol. 11a (last line of the page), and on page 69 of the Calcutta edition of 1884. When Hari\u00e7andra wishes to sell himself as a slave, the stage direction is \"girasi tr\u1e47am k\u1e5btv\u0101.\"\n\nPage 56, add to note 1. See also the J\u0101takam\u0101la (ed.

The story of the exit from the temple is very similar to a story in the Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la of Nidh\u0101mi-i-Ar\u016b\u1e0di-i-Samarqandi, translated into English by Edward G. Browne, M.A., M.R.A.S., (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for October, 1899, p. 798). Anecdote XXIII. begins as follows:\u2014\"It is stated that once when Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd bin N\u0101siru'd-D\u012bn was sitting on the roof of a four-doored summer-house in Ghazna, in the Garden of a Thousand Trees, he turned\nhis head to Abu Rayh\u0101n and said, \"By which of these four doors shall I go out? (for all four were practicable). Decide, and write the decision on a piece of paper, and put it under my quilt.\" Abu Rayh\u0101n called for an astrolabe, took the altitude, worked out the ascendant, reflected for a while, and then wrote down his decision on a piece of paper, and placed it under the quilt. \"Hast thou decided?\" asked Mahm\u016bd. He answered \"Yea.\"\n\nThen Mahm\u016bd bade them make an opening in the wall, and they brought mattocks and spades, and in the wall which was on the eastern side dug out a fifth door, through which he went out. Then he bade them bring the paper. So they brought it, and on it was written: \"He will go out through none of these four doors, but they will dig a fifth door on the side of the eastern wall, by which door he will go forth.\" The author of the Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la was born towards the end of the eleventh century of our era; so he, at any rate, cannot be the borrower.\n\nPage 57, add to note 4.

The word kha\u1e6d\u1e6daka is found in Appendix A. to K\u0101thavat\u0113's edition of Some\u015bvara's Kirtikaumudi, stanza 64. Professor K\u0101thavat\u0113, remarking on the compound vimal\u0101cakha\u1e6d\u1e6dakayut\u0101\u1e25, says \"I do not understand the meaning of kha\u1e6d\u1e6daka. It may be an adaptation of taklit. If so, the adjective may mean with thrones of white marble.\"\n\nPage 58, line 10 (text, p. 96, l. 12), this is Subh\u0101\u1e63it\u0101val\u012b, 2399 (Z.).\n\nPage 60, add to note 1. These lines appear in Hanumann\u0101\u1e6daka or Mah\u0101n\u0101\u1e6daka, Act XIV., stanza 49 (Bombay edition of 1886) in the following form:\n\nIha khalu vi\u1e63ama\u1e25 pur\u0101k\u1e5btan\u0101m\nBhavati hi jantusu karmasa\u1e41 vip\u0101ka\u1e25\n\u00c7iva\u00e7iras\u012b \u015biv\u0101\u1e41si y\u0101ni reju\u1e25\n\u00c7iva \u00c7iva t\u0101ni lu\u1e6dhanti grdhrap\u0101da\u1e25\n\nPage 61, lines 7 and 8 (text, page 100, ll. 7 and 8). Perhaps we have here puns in loha (also Sanskrit loha, \"steel,\") and akkhara (=Skr. ak\u1e63ara, \"sword.\") P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la in the second line means the subterranean world, as the world of riches. Bhoja was a mere petitfogging hackster in gold as compared with the lord of treasures, the hero of the story. P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la, with this implication (=anur\u0101v\u012bra), is used by the commentator on the passage in Har\u1e63as\u0101r\u012bta, corresponding to translation, p. 82, l. 24, \"treasure-seekers, the mine\"; cf. the note to 33, n. 3, in Appendix B., p. 268 (Th.).\n\nPage 62, add to note 3.

Hall seems to think that ak\u1e63ap\u0101\u1e6dalika may mean the man who has cognizance of the p\u0101\u1e6dala, litigation, of ak\u1e63a, judicial cases; or does p\u0101\u1e6dala mean filing?\nAdd to note 4.

If we keep ahim\u0101ruci\u1e25, will not this mean ac\u012bciraracmi, the sun? (Th.) I think that Mr. Thomas's view is correct. I find that Devas\u016bri is referred to in a commentary on the Kalpas\u016btra as Jivadevas\u016bri, the victor of the Digambara Kumudacandra. A Devas\u016bri is in the same work spoken of as the author of the \u010c\u0101ntistava. Bh\u0101nd\u0101rkar's Report for 1883-84, p. 141.\n\nIn Peterson's fourth report, p. lvi., will be found an account of Devas\u016bri, who disputed with Kumudacandra. He quotes from Klatt, Indian Antiquary XI., p. 254, \"Devas\u016bri was born S\u0101\u1e41vat 1143; d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101 1152, \u015br\u012bpada, 1174, svarga, 1226.\"\n\nPage 105, note 3. This enumeration of the fourteen divisions of knowledge is often met with in the Jaina literature. There are two \u00e7lokas containing the list in p. 13 of the Appendices to Professor Jacobi's edition of the Pari\u00e7itaparvan. While the Jainas invariably speak of eoddasa vij\u00f1\u0101th\u0101n\u0101ni or caturda\u00e7a vidy\u0101sth\u0101n\u0101ni, the Buddhists know of a wider range of knowledge, as they mention eighteen divisions, aj\u00f1\u0101r\u0101sa vij\u00f1\u0101tth\u0101n\u0101ni, cf. J\u0101taka No. 80, ed. p. 356 (L.). In the Miliuda Pa\u00f1ha nineteen sippas are enumerated. Professor Rhys-Davids, in note 3 to p. 6 of his translation, tells us that the number is usually given as eighteen.\n\nPage 109, line 5, \"A K\u1e63atriya of the Jh\u0101l\u0101 family, named M\u0101ng\u016b.\" The first part of the story of M\u0101ng\u016b seems to have some connection with an old tradition that speaks of the greediness of the patriarch Mangu (L.).\n\nPage 113, l. 191, for \"water donation\" read \"water of donation\"\n\nPage 115, lines 5 and 6 (text, p. 189, l. 6).

C., 67, st. 26) by Lak\u1e63mi. I believe m\u0101-Lak\u1e63mi is derived from M\u0101dhava=Lak\u1e63mipati=Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (Z).\nPage 124, lines 18 and 19 read:\u2014\n\nLet us eat what we receive as alms! let us wear old garments!\nLet us sleep on the bare earth!

Hall seems to think that the word comes by metathesis from pa\u1e6d\u1e6dala, which corresponds to canton, mahal, or pargana. Probably the jurisdiction of this officer was wider than at present, though even now he has sometimes three or four villages under him.\n\nPage 170, line 25. \u201cShe became pregnant.\u201d Cp.

(Z).\n\nPischel tells us that, according to the scholiast E. of the Gitagovinda (Lassen, p. 72), Um\u0101patidhara, the contemporary of Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47asena was a physician, vaidya (I should say that he belonged to the Vaidya caste). The same authority tells us also that the stanza beginning \u00e7aityan n\u0101ma (\u201cCoolness indeed\u201d), is ascribed by Kavibha\u1e6d\u1e6da, Padyasajgraha, 17 (H\u00e4berlin\u2019s Anthology, p. 531, f.), to Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47asena; the third, chinn\u0101mi Brahmaciro yadi, is ascribed by C\u0101\u1e45gadhara to Dhoi (probably Kavir\u0101ja to Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47asena). The stanza beginning tvam cet samcarase (If you ride on a bull, &c.)\nhas been found quoted by Professor Pischel in \u00c7obh\u0101kara Alanj\u0101r\u0101ratn\u0101kara, foll. 30a and 64b (MS. Det. Rep., No. 227, now = \u010cidhar R. Bh\u0101nd\u0101rkar, A Catalogue of the Collections of MSS. deposited in the Deccan College, Bombay, 1888, p. 85, No. 227). Professor Pischel thinks that \u00c7obh\u0101kara is later than Buuyaka, who flourished in the beginning of the twelfth century. It is interesting, as Professor Pischel remarks, to note that other authorities besides Merutunga ascribe two of the stanzas to the time of L\u0101k\u1e63ma\u1e47asena.\n\nPage 184, note 2, dels \u201ci.q.

The story of Var\u0101hamihira and Bhadrab\u0101hu is given in the Rajmandalapra\u00f1karanav\u1e5btti (See Bh\u0101nd\u0101rkar\u2019s Report for 1883-84, pp. 131-132). According to this account Var\u0101ha was originally a Jain, but because his brother would not give him the S\u016bripada, he put on the habiliments of a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and composed new \u0100\u015b\u0101stras, such as the Var\u0101hasamhit\u0101. The rest of the story agrees pretty nearly with Merutunga\u2019s account. Eventually he received the Bh\u0101gavati d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101. When he died he became, on account of his wicked deeds, a ghost with a great hatred for the Jainas and troubled the laymen of that sect. To lay him, Bhadrab\u0101hu composed the Upasarga-harastotra, for men to repeat it, and even now it is repeated to put down any troubles.\n\nPage 194, last line of the page. \u201cThe teacher P\u0101dalipta in the town of P\u0101dalipta.\u201d See Bh\u0101nd\u0101rkar\u2019s Report for 1883-84, p. 142. \u201cP\u0101daliptac\u0101rya flew through the sky by means of a certain ointment applied to the feet, and visited the shrines of Catur\u00f1jaya, Girn\u0101r, Ab\u016b, A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101pada and Sammeta.\u201d\n\nPages 196-97.

The Jayat\u012bhuyapastotra of Abhayadevas\u016bri is still preserved in manuscript; it is said to have been composed in Samvat 1111. Compare also Weber, Verzeichniss der Berliner Sanskrit-handschriften, Vol. II., p. 1039 (2). One point in Peterson\u2019s account of Abhayadevas\u016bri is of special interest. He tells us that he \u201ccomposed on the spur of the moment thirty-two verses. But the goddess perceived that the last two verses were of an awful power to control the gods, and besought him to content himself with the thirty.\u201d Dr. Peterson assures us that \u201cthe image of P\u0101r\u00e7van\u0101tha is still worshipped in Cambay by the faithful.\u201d See also Bh\u0101nd\u0101rkar\u2019s Report of 1883-84, page 141.\n\nPage 202, lines 4 and 5. \u201cHowever, one traveller even preferring death, would not leave the side of that cow.\u201d Cp.
